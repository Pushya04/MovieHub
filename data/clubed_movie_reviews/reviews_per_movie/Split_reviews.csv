James McAvoy Carries This Film,"A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great movie! James McAvoy is awesome.,"This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It maybe gets a bit too fantastical, but it's still an awesome thriller","I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway.The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way.Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Movie Overall Could Have Been So Much Better, But McAvoy is Astounding","James McAvoy gives what could have potentially been an award-worthy performance if it had appeared in a different film.He plays a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three young girls as a part of a plot two of the personalities have hatched to unleash a powerful and unstoppable identity. Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since ""Signs,"" crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great story telling,"What a remarkable film! The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there's so much more beneath.It's a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don't need to be spoon-fed every explanation.The acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It's gripping, un-turn-away-able.Seriously impressive. I don't give 10's lightly.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A one man show,We need more of James McAvoy on the silver screen that's for sure. He plays the role of a person with MPD (multiple personality disorder) and he plays the role(s) so darn well. The movie is the second in a trilogy of an adult comic series and comparing it to it's older brother (Unbreakable 2000) it's more refined and perhaps with a more interesting plot.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't understand the hate for this film,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work since ""Unbreakable"", but I have to admit that this movie made me believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Split continues Shyamalan's upward trend, but still not hitting greatness.","Ahhhhhh I am so disappointed with this! I really wanted to love it, it ticks all the right boxes for a decent thriller. Yet somehow Shyamalan missed the mark. It's not bad, in fact it's crafted intricately...just not great. A man with 23 different personalities abducts three young girls as he prepares to unleash the 24th personality that dominates the others. This is extremely difficult to review. For every positive outcome there is a negative to counteract it. For example: Kevin's internal survival against the other personalities was an intriguing and compelling concept. However, the enthralling psychological analysis was negated by the stupidity of this whole 24th personality that is able to physically change Kevin. A thought provoking theme is decimated by an unrealistic concept in an attempt to be dramatic. It didn't need to be! The first act was going so well with interesting ideas that Shyamalan clearly has an interest in. His focus on this multiple personality disorder shows in the film. Patient and psychologist conversations take place that explains Kevin's fractured mind. Then it constantly shifts to the thriller aspect where these three young girls are trying to escape from a sinister location. It's not exciting. At all. These girls aren't put in any real danger or hardly attempt to flee so what's the point? They just exist for the finale which as a result makes the film absurdly boring. These girls are lifeless. Except Taylor-Joy's character who actually has some decent backstory, told through flashbacks. Split is a tool for James McAvoy to showcase multiple fantastic performances. Genuinely creepy and unnerving. His ability to automatically switch characters was faultless and found him to be highly enjoyable. Also like the final scene which harks back to a certain film which I shall not name. I look forward to future prospects. But in the end, Split was a failed attempt at a thriller but an intriguing psychological drama. It's unfortunate the two just didn't blend for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The broken are more evolved,"Split is a 2016 psychological horror thriller about a man with dissociative identity disorder who holds three teenage girls captive for sacrificial purposes.Although not a direct sequel to M. Night Shyamalans Unbreakable, it takes place in the same universe and once again deals with the concept of superhuman abilities. This is an excellent film all the way through, with some absolutely amazing performances. James McAvoy is incredible with his portrayal of Kevin Wendell Crumb and all of his personalities locking you in to where you can't take your eyes off the screen. The story is creepy, compelling, and completely creative. It's filled with suspenseful moments that tickle the hairs on the back of your neck, and a fantastic ending that will leave you walking away in anticipation for what's next to come.This is one of my favorite M. Night films, and if you haven't seen it before, It's an absolute must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
And I Thought M. Night Shyamalan Was Loosing His Touch.,"When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with ""Split"" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Perfect But Good,"I will start off by saying this film was in no way perfect. There were some instances where I wondered what will this all lead to. Many people I hear who dislike the film is because of the personalities being violent. To be honest, the only personalities that are shown to be somewhat violent is Dennis and The Beast. Dennis doesn't do anything violent either. As seen in this film the personalities were actually funny, kind, and artistic however there were events that lead to some personalities believing it what's known as The Beast. The acting by James McAvoy was excellent. The plot was probably the only thing that was a little confusing. This is a great thriller film with some flaws but its entertaining in which I believe the director did good. I'm not anticipating his next film as I am others but I'm interested in seeing his next film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't believe the One Star reviews...,"After watching this movie, I have to say, I don't understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven't enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I've seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn't one of them. It's definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn't like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I'd rank it higher).It's a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.Is it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I'd happily see it again.As for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Thanks for fishing it out of the drawer, Shyamalan.","Unpopular opinion, I think it's better than Signs. While I think Signs has plenty of redeeming qualities I think it has too many big problems going against it. (I've reviewed it already.) Don't get me wrong this movie has some big problems of its own, but we will get to those later.The movie is very well shot. Mike Gioulakis is a cinematographer to keep your eyes on, right up there with Roger Deakins. The shots were nicely framed and they had a slow, creeping movement to them and that really brought out the tension in the movie.The score also did a great job at bringing out the tension, as well as setting the tone. I especially love the song during the opening credits. And the opening credits themselves were pretty creepy.There were moments in this movie that were very disturbing. Disturbing to the point where you think, ""Most directors wouldn't show this."" Bravo, Shyamalan.There were a few subtleties in the movie. My favorite would have to be when Dr. Fletcher writes Kevin wendell Crumb on the piece of paper. Or when Casey hesitates to answer the police officer's question.Anya Taylor Joy did a really good job and her character had a good amount of depth. The decisions that she makes in the film make a lot of sense.Betty Buckley was pretty good. You could tell that she was doing the best she could with the dialogue she was given.And let's talk about the very best thing in this movie! Do I even have to say what it is? Let's just say that this movie would've crashed and burned if they had picked a less talented actor. He is truly one of the best actors in the world today. Even if he picks a bad movie he's still phenomenal.Now for what this movie did not do well:The other two main actresses were bad. I was happy when they got separated and put in two different rooms.There is quite a bit of dialogue that is not natural at all. It's not Last Airbender level terrible; you can tolerate it, but you can't help but be like ""No one talks like that."" And there are lines that were very unnecessary.There are a number of holes in the narrative. Like why didn't he separate the girls in the first place? Or why would he try to kidnap those girls in broad daylight? And why would he take them all at once instead of one at a time?I also have to wonder why Dennis didn't notice Casey in the car at first.So yeah, I do enjoy this movie and I find myself revisiting it every now and again. It's by no means as good as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but it's certainly better than most of Night's filmography. (What happened, dude?) Something I should probably mention since it occurs to me that not a lot of people know this: Shyamalan wrote the script to this movie back when he was still making good movies. So anyone who said that he had returned to form with this movie, myself included, was very incorrect. Which explains why Glass was such an insufferable piece of crap.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love that he's back!,"M.Night Shyamalan is one of those filmmakers that you either love or hate, and I definitely love his work. However, I stopped watching him after the Happening, (which was really quite a terrible movie. No comment on The Last Airbender).This is such a wonderful comeback. His ability to totally freak you out without being terrifying; to keep you fascinated, yet completely confused, it's all just so much fun! Not sure how his films can be so slow yet so gripping and FUN!This one is bang on. The cinematography is wonderful, the story is intense and gripping. Not to mention that James Macavoy is bang on (what a great performance, love Joaquin Phoenix, but not sure he would have been quite so awesomely intense as Macavoy was).I highly recommend this film to any thriller lovers and a must for any M.Night lovers (but I don't need to say that at this point now, do I). I agree it's not a horror film but it does very get under your skin. (If you found The Ring too much, don't watch this!)However, if you loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this is a must see!!Can't wait to see Glass.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An OK resurrection from Shyamalan!,"Splits first 45 minutes are the best part of this movie with an intriguing look into the split personalities of Kevin, played by the excellent James McAvoy. It's within the small details of characterisation that astounds to still prove McAvoy as one of the best actors of this generation. His talent in being able to intertwine characters together is magnificent. Kevin and his 23 personalities respond well to Dr. Fletcher (Casey Cooke) who provides a great supporting role.This can not be stated about the Girls, they almost feel like a gimmick at times to keep your heart pounding. The movies aim in scaring is also unsatisfactory, hardly ever making the audience jump out of their skin. The overall story arc also slows terribly down in the last 30 minutes with some fundamental errors in storytelling almost dragging on too long. The dialogue in scenes, partially with the girls also seems a little trashy, I don't feel like Shyamalan captured these roles as well as Kevin and Dr. Fletcher.The score throughout the film keeps tensions a high but costume design feels a little rough around the edges. With constant swapping of personalities comes new costumes but at times characters don't adhere to what they are wearing which can occasionally become messy. Set design is also OK especially compared with the other recent Sci-fi, underground basement movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane.Overall, it is one of Shymalans finest films but still has many underlining problems especially with pacing and dialogue.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Feels like a first draft, albeit one with strong performances and decent premise","It was the recent release of Glass that made me decide to watch this film, despite its so-so reviews; I wanted to watch the former, and it didn't feel right to skip right to it. The film opens with a creepy setup, and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters, while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension, it mostly does it well, with an escalation as the film goes, but the film is not tight enough to be event driven, and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something, but mostly doesn't deliver.It is an odd film in this way, because there is a lot here to work with, but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements, or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea, but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise, the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more, and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting, but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again, there was much more writing and refining to be done here.It is a shame, because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self, the actresses seems to have found it, and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this, and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing, but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan, so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances, and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking, and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either.",,Anonymous,Horror
The movie that got me interested into film!,"Wow, this is my first review on IMDB. Let's start off with the movie that got me interested into film, and that movie is Split. I remember being 13 years old, sitting on my couch a few nights before halloween. I wanted to watch a horror film, so I browsed on the ""Free Movies"" section on Xfinity Demand. I scrolled down the page, and my eyes everted to Split. I read the plot synopsis, and I really liked the concept and watching the film for the first time was one of the best movie watching experiences I've ever had. I was glued to my seat the whole time watching the film and it genuinely scared me. I noticed how the movie builds suspense and I also paid attention to the interesting camera angles the cinematographer chose to shot. After watching the film, I was excited to watch more M. Night Shyamalan films, and that eventually built my love for film. James Mcavoy in this film has an oscar worthy performance, playing 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also had a very good performance in this film and she played a very interesting character. The techniques for building and showing suspense was masterful in this movie, and the cinematography in this film was golden. The story in this film was also very investing, and its twist and turns are very fun. At first I didn't understand the twist ending, but after browsing the internet, I found out it involved a character from Unbreakable, and watching that movie was also a treat. I'm 14 years old right now, and my passion for film will live on! Split is one of my favorite films of all time and it is a film I will always love.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Feelings are fairly ""split"" here","As said in my recent review for 'The Visit', M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted, both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films, it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle), not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy, who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here, with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock, spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere, while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit', having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie, and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning, much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful, with many twisty suspenseful turns, a sense of fun, frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind, more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However, the last half an hour does disappoint, with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it, actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension, horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all, actually he did give the needed creepiness, but what he was given which was goofy), coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better, with a better and less awkward flow, the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily, constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole, fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films, just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A great suspense story, with a standout performance by Mr McEvoy","A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here.I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode.I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all.This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling.James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A return to form for Shyamalan,"It's been a rough few years, but M Night Shyamalan's latest film Split proved that this director still has it.Firstly, James McAvoy's performance is the best part of this movie, his performance carried this film for me and kept me invested. McAvoy charms the audience with his brilliant (at times comedic) portray of the Hedwig personality, and does a good job making other personalities like Dennis, Ms Patricia and the beast frightening and creepy in their own ways. McAvoy does a good job separating the personalities from one another, making each seem like individual characters.The other performances in this movie are also good, Anya Taylor-Joy played her character fairly well, especially during the more dramatic scenes, and i hope to see more dramatic work from her in the future. The other two girls did decent jobs but nothing really special about their performances. Betty Buckley's character was fairly well done as well.Although this is a fairly well made film, i did have a few errors with pacing, the flashback scenes felt very shoehorned in and confusing at first. Shyamalan's camera-work and writing also seemed to be a bit messy at times, mainly during the first act of the movie, but was fine for the majority of the movie.However, although this isn't a perfect film, it's definitely worth a watch, and it's a good sign for Mr Shyamalan's career. Fans of his earlier work will hopefully appreciate this film like i did, especially the obligatory plot twist. :)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right ... Here I am, stuck in the middle with the 23 of you","I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles, that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems), but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village"", so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet, he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined, and for the very first time, the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama, with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls, two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past, are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls, simultaneously with the audience, gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl, Casey, realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities, but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially for James McAvoy as Barry, Kevin, Dennis, Hedwig, Patricia, etc. Okay, admittedly, it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles, but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh, elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", for sure! Sadly, M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface, and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly, but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received, but the violence and murders all occur off screen, and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it, I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass"".",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You will be talking about this movie for days,"Whether you've enjoyed or loathed the last few movies from M Night Shyamalan I don't think any of us could disagree the talent is still there, and after a few misfires comes Split. I can say unequivocally that this is the best thing I have watched in a long time time.The first thing I think this film will be remembered for is the stellar performance of lead actor James Mcavoy, a wonderfully charismatic and talented actor, I'm sure most of us adore, I feel here he's announced himself as a serious contender for mega roles. His ability to switch from one persona to another, to be dark, sinister, camp, soft, cute etc. is incredible, people sat around me watching the movie were stunned at how good he was. The Dennis, Hedwig and Patricia characters in particular show his total versatility.A brilliant supporting cast, Betty Buckley did a fantastic job as Kevin's doctor, as did the trio of girls, Anya Taylor-Joy I thought was especially good.I make it sound like he's the only reason to see the film, far from it, the opening is gripping, the story itself so chilling, and the ending a real surprise.I implore you, see this in the cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst movie of 2016,Split is a terrible movie that promotes the idea the idea that people with mental illnesses are dangerous and need to be isolated and stopped before they destroy the lives of people that do not have mental illness. The pacing of this movie is also extremely terrible of the overall plot is pertaining ridiculous. I the movie really began to go hit downhill with the main character changes from someone with mental illness to a strong powerful almost supernatural creature is intended on destroying the lives of people. The movie almost makes it seem like it's better for them to die. This is extremely problematic considering the movie initially talks about having a real-life mental illness. Also the way to dissociated personality disorder is shown is inaccurate and extremely weird. The movie is very inconsistent sometimes it makes you try and feel sympathy for the main character and other times it depicts him as an unstable monster. It's not shopping at the still is terrible because M night Shyamalan is known for terrible movies. He made one good movie and never made another one. Also the ending is weird because his link to a movie 20 years ago.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Split not only has Shyamalan back on the saddle but also rewards fans for their patience in his return to form.,"What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as ""The Beast"". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The most entertaining BAD movie in years.  It's certainly never boring, but...","Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast"", the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!'To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Intense and original,"(I watched this in 2018)I don't even know what to rate this. I just finished watching it and feel like it's the type of film that will stay with me for many days afterwards. That final scene had me yelling out loud in excitement!It is the most ""M. Night Shyamalan"" film in years, so I can definitely see why people are describing this as a return to form. The complex spattering of themes throughout and bigger-life-picture vibe was certainly there too. Killer script and writing which is refreshing at a time when too many movies are becoming mundane or lazy.It also worked as good as any other thriller/horror out there. I wouldn't even know what genre to put this in - I don't think M. Night Shyamalan films belong in any concrete genre. I felt claustrophobic and uneasy watching this the whole time. In that sense, I didn't find it easy watching. But I couldn't look away.Much of the reason I couldn't look away was due to James McAvoy's career best performance. Seriously - how did this guy not get an Oscar nomination for this?! I've never really seen quite an acting display like it and he clearly loved performing the role(s). One second I would be laughing, the next I would be utterly terrified and getting sweaty palms.Features the best 'shrink' vs 'patient' scenes since The Sopranos.While I probably won't re-watch this, I'm still keen to say:Bring on 2019.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You like to make fun of us, but we are more powerful than you think.","Split is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley, Haley Lu-Richardson and Jessica Sula. Music is by West Dylan Thordson and cinematography by Mike Gioulakis.Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 different personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...We now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.The plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.However, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma,"Impressive performances from James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy carry Split in a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma.Split revolves around two main characters, Kevin and Casey, who suffer from childhood trauma which the film explores. Kevin developed his multiple personalities to cope from abuse by his mother and loss of father. He abducts three young women which includes Marcia and Claire. The film gradually reveals that the multiple personalities are distinct and fight for each others turn on ""the light"". The narrative is further driven by a yet not shown 24th personality, named the Beast, who commanded the other personalities to abduct the women as his food. Casey being abducted is designed for her to grow from the trauma caused by the sexual abuse by her uncle which is revealed through flashback scenes. Another subplot is Dr. Fletcher's, played by Betty Buckley, attempt to heal Kevin.The arc or Dr. Fletcher trying to heal Kevin bogged down the pacing which should have been strictly focused on Kevin and Casey. Scenes with an adult Casey and her uncle implying continued abuse should have been presented, not just on her childhood experiences. A clear resolution to both Kevin and Casey is not fully grasped because their trauma is different. Kevin is shown to be abused, but is not shown specifically how. For Casey, her ending should have been a proper breakup with her uncle signifying character growth. The camera work is impressive in some shots but not all. Angles are good but not the lighting which takes away some of the claustrophobic feel of the film.Nevertheless, McAvoy and Taylor-Joy are spectacular and carry the film on acting alone. McAvoy's personality switching is fluid and shows his ability to be a chameleon. Taylor-Joy is able to portray a layered performance simultaneously dealing with sexual abuse and the possibility of reoccurring in another form.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a return to form for M Night Shyamalan, but a step in the right direction, at least","A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking ""This is so unrealistic, just escape already!"" and getting bored at some of the discussions.It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shyamalan's Big Comeback,"Split is deemed as M. Night Shyamalan's big comeback as a filmmaker, and I'm inclined to agree. To say Shyamalan has had a hit or miss career would be an understatement. His first three films, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, were all quality movies, but afterward the man entered into a fifteen long year slump starting with The Village up to The Visit. So, when Split came out we were all pleasantly surprised to find out it was actually good. Yes, Split is a good movie. Is it Shyamalan's best? In my opinion, no. Unbreakable is still his best work. Sixth Sense is also better, though I enjoyed this movie a bit more. However, this is still a solid movie; certainly the best the man has put out in over a decade and a half.The plot is pretty simple. You have three girls leaving a party but get abducted by James McAvoy's character(s), The Horde, a man with twenty-three personalities occupying his mind. Now these three must try to survive and escape their tormentor. Meanwhile James McAvoy's doctor is notices that The Horde is acting peculiar, and is attempting to determine what's happening.What carries split, and makes it as good as it is James McAvoy's character(s). Seeing this man playing all these different personalities so brilliantly is great to watch. His performance should have at least easily nominated him for an Oscar, which never happened. The film has an eerie look and atmosphere to it' something Shyamalan has always excelled at even in his bad movies. The score isn't one of Shyamalan's best, but it complements the film pretty well.Once we get to the third act it becomes a thrilling survival horror film, which is when the film is at its best, in my opinion. Usually, the third act is when most Shyamalan movies fall apart, but here it's the best part of the movie.I do have some issues with Split, however. It does feel slow in spots. Some of it does feel like padding. The film is just under two hours, when it could've been just an hour and a half. Also, while James McAvoy is a lot of fun, I didn't care much for the three main girls. The main heroine is okay, but the other two girls are nothing characters. The scenes between McAvoy and his doctor were far more interesting to watch, or when the doctor is trying to explain The Horde's condition to the other scientists.Overall, Split is a good film, and was a good comeback for Shyamalan. I hope he can keep the momentum going, though Glass has been pretty divisive so things appear shaky once again for him.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
McAvoy & Shyamalan at their best,"My kind of psychological thriller. It's not a horror movie for me. People with similarly strong imagination to mine can enjoy this piece to no end. James McAvoy stepped on my radar with this one. Of course, previously I saw him in Narnia and in the X-Men movies but neither Mr. Tumnus nor Charles Xavier couldn't convince me whether he is a keeper or not. Now, I have 24 reasons to rave about his talent on this platform, too. He became wanted as my future cast member, that's for sure. His facial expressions and his eyes have no limits. His voices and gestures are literally giving you the chills. In the best possible ways, naturally.I wasn't a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work until Split came out. He caught my attention with Unbreakable but I was waiting for something more of my kind to appear. His way of telling stories is like an outsider. He is a witness. But with Split and Glass, he has entered the arena of the wicked. He's playing on our field now.This is a 10 star film, no doubt. From every angle it is a masterpiece. Epic soundtrack by West Thordson! I've been listening to it ever since when I need inspiration to write out one of the dark feathers.Have to mention Anya Taylor-Joy's acting debue in my world, too. She is one actress to look out for! I love her face and the ease she can transform. One of my weaknesses when it comes to choose a cast member.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A twisty, tense thriller that doubles as a superb showcase for McAvoy's talents","Shyamalan's inconsistencies as a director are decidedly ignominious. He  spellbound us with The Sixth Sense, but soon after befuddled with lady  in the Water, provoked derisive jeers with The Happening, and merely  bored us with The Last Airbender and After Earth. The pared back horror  of The Visit signalled a renaissance for the auteur, with its genuinely  frightening aesthetic, and even a decent Shyamalan twist!   But, armed with what seems to be a more significant budget, and far  more loopy creative ambition, Split is Shyamalan's true calling card to  what hopefully is a far more fortuitous run of features. Using the  disorder of DID, and a true story (!), to create its bonkers premise,  McAvoy plays Kevin, a man who possesses 23 distinct personalities, some  of which are male and some of which are female, some of which are  young, and some of which are old, some of which are homosexual and some  of which are heterosexual, some of which have OCD or require insulin  for diabetes, and some of which are really rather volatile and  dangerous. The catch? The 24th is about to arrive, with all hell set to  break loose.   If this sounds like an actor's dream job, you're right. With the  opportunity to flex his acting muscles to the nth degree,  all-accent-changing, mannerism-altering McAvoy rises to the challenge  with a performance of breathtaking versatility. The film around him is  never quite as reliable as this towering performance, however. The plot  functions between an incredibly tense kidnapping/hostage situation and  a doctor who purports to be an expert of DID. While eventually serving  a narrative purpose, in the early scenes, Shyamalan's switching to this  doctor's narrative grinds the movie to something of a halt, leaving you  longing for the far more interesting story to develop and ultimately  resolve. That being said, the movie never bores for a second, thanks to  Shyamalan's distinctive style and an ominous score, as well as Anya  Taylor Joy, so impressive in The Witch, who proves she isn't a one  trick pony. In addition, like THe Visit, Split is, unexpectedly, quite  funny, in a way that never sacrifices tension, but rather serves to  enhance it by catching you off guard with scares when you're recovering  from a bizarre joke - it's a terrific tactic that serves the film well.  Most worthy of recommendation is the film's third act, which evolves  into something genuinely terrifying and ferociously tense, as twist  upon twist piles up to create a thrilling sense of chaos and dread.  Less convincing are Shyamalan's repeated attempts at motifs of beasts  and animals, which feel shoehorned in and unnecessary. Despite al this,  Split is a worthy work from Shyamalan that will deliver a jolt of high  octane thrills to your nerves, one which will certainly be needed in  the doldrums of the January dumping ground of films.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shyamalan - Why this?,"SPLIT - M NIGHT SHYAMALAN - The Real DealThe movie is about a man suffering from a disorder of multiple personalities. He abducts 3 girls to whom he manifests his various personas while warning and scaring them of The Beast, his most extreme, yet to come, personality. His psychiatrist tries to help him while investigating his activities.Now for the real deal, M Night Shyamalan disappoints. That's the word. Disappoints.He could have improvised a bit by hooking the audience to some concrete aspects of the story. Why does the antagonist abduct the girls? And the specific ones at that? While James McEvoy makes an honest attempt at the character or characters, M could have infused a bit of logic into the scheme of things. I felt that the 3 girls could have beat the guy to a pulp any time. The action sequence I mean? The generation is real smart these days!Where is the dread? Where is the scare?

Multiple Personality Galore !!,"12 years back at Sreekumar theatre Trivandrum , I was going berserk over Chiyaan Vikram's multiple personality magnum opus Anniyan - and all of a sudden James McAvoy has outweighed that very specific standard of enactment with his once in a life time role in Split. Manoj Nelliate Shyamalan, that Indian prodigy who made sixth sense and sunk into oblivion with a chain of duds subsequently has made a magnificent riposte! Split sees the prolongation of Shyamalan's assignation with the supernatural but also a long anticipated rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to rematerialize. The film deals majorly with a person sustaining 23 different personalities within himself of which a 24th one is about to surface. Resting heavily on the lead actor who has done a magnificent job, the screenplay sways between his distinctive dispositions, transitioning from an OCD patient to a psycho woman and to a 9 year old boy, amongst 18 other manifestations. 3 girls are abducted by one of these personas and made to wait for the appearance of the last one before they should try and escape him.

Better Than It Has Any Right To Be,"There's two ways to develop this ""psycho character kidnaps a trio of teenage girls"" type of plot . One is to make the girls and the audience squirm as they're subjected to all type of obscene practises in a torture porn type of tale . The other is to keep the horrors mainly psychological and understated and hope the actor playing the psycho isn't going to have too much fun in the roleThe good news is that SPLIT isn't torture porn . Even better news is while James McAvoy has fun in the role it's never enough to actually take you out of the movie . McAvoy is of course a Scottish actor from a working class background and it's usually a distraction watching ""one of us"" in a commercial Hollywood movie but here McAvoy delivers a pivotal role playing a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder . Okay it's obvious no one had an eye on the Oscars when this was released and McAvoy's character pieces are a bit episodic along with being intermittently camp but even so the film rests mainly on this performance!!!!

Shyamalan is figuring out how to overcome his flaws and still do his thing,"Few filmmakers have faced the scrutiny M. Night Shyamalan has endured in the nearly 20 years since ""The Sixth Sense"" became a global phenomenon and launched his memorable name into the spotlight. With each progressive film, it seemed Shyamalan drew more and more ire for his twist-focused approach to horror and by the late 2000s, nearly all his projects were panned. With ""Split,"" he appears to be on the rebound.Shyamalan's upswing actually began with a nice reception for 2015's ""The Visit,"" a return to horror after a foray into sci fi/fantasy (to no avail). ""Split"" builds on that momentum as a psychological thriller that walks a fine line between expert cinematic tension and unabashed lunacy. The film contains both that which has, at times, garnered Shyamalan much praise, and also that which has been the source of much derision.Creating a horror thriller based on an actual psychological condition – Dissociative Identity Disorder – immediately positions ""Split"" in dicey territory. It could quickly come across as exploiting a serious issue for the sake of entertainment. Shyamalan works around this as best he can by naming DID and devoting exposition to it in the form of Betty Buckley's character Dr. Karen Fletcher, the foremost expert on DID and a therapist with a longstanding relationship with Kevin (James McAvoy), who has 23 distinct personalities.Part of the mystery is that Fletcher senses something is off, that Kevin is hiding something. She is part of the story, not just a way for us to understand it. From a social responsibility perspective, this is a better approach than the 2003 film ""Identity,"" which was more exploitative of DID.Of course Kevin is hiding something, as in the film's opening, he kidnaps three teenage girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). Casey, the outsider of the three girls, draws on memories from her troubled past to try and understand her unusual captor.Everything hinges on believing McAvoy's performance and the script's ability to set him up to be believed. Both flirt with disaster, like at any moment we might laugh at the entire production, but we end up buying it. McAvoy really commits to Kevin's many personalities, which Shyamalan wisely limits to a handful. There's a logic and sense of purpose behind which ones show up at which times. McAvoy owns them to the point that we actually see them as different characters when they're on screen.Yet it's the mystery of Kevin's intent and what he might be capable of that keeps things tense throughout most of the film, a tension that shifts from mystery-driven to horror-driven in the final act. At this point, ""Split"" becomes a much stranger movie and we're surprised at just where and how far Shyamalan will go.In narrative and thematic respects, however, ""Split"" doesn't quite pay off for all that it builds up. Piece by piece we get to know a lot about Cassie, for example, and enter her psychology, but her role in the story doesn't contribute anything revelatory. She's merely a more traditional protagonist to root for, another troubled mind to understand. The biggest ""twist"" is actually tied to this weaker component, and it kind of flies in the face of everything else that's happening in the movie tonally. Not enough to derail it, but enough to remind you of Shyamalan's challenges as a writer.Even worse for the film's tone, a post-credits revelation that Shyamalan throws into the movie has a souring effect on its ending. It seems entirely unnecessary and makes Shyamalan come off as self- aggrandizing – but that's about all that can be said spoiler-free. Ultimately, here's a filmmaker who is figuring out how to deliver the best version of the films he wants to make and he's getting closer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I think, that the screenwriter wanted us to believe that it is horror, but he was wrong (It's horror just because we were worried about girls?) However, the plot of this film is very interesting. It keeps you in suspense all the time. But the most important thing is the acting. Actor James McAvoy surpassed all my expectations. He managed to play the role of Kevin, with 23 different personalities inside. Although all personalities weren't shown, we saw about six of them, in my opinion, it didn't affect the quality of the film. The transition from one person on another, James McAvoy made great! I really enjoyed this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Beast, the Manifestion","I think Split is one of the best Psychological thriller movies in the past few years. I'm not sure if it has comparisons with other thrillers but would rather say that the idea is indeed very interesting. Look at Mrs. Fletcher who tries to convince the audience at the conference that the human mind has evolved to a different stage. Shyamalan pushes this concept even further saying that if there are a set of personalities to explore then the final outcome reachable would be something supernatural which in this case is the Beast. The creation of the personalities, if is a result of the childhood trauma then the idea of a super powered being is something which contradicts the concept of the capability of the human mind. Since the devil lives on after being hit by two bullets( and in this case Shyamalan is not trying to show that there are only two bullets for Casey but the magnitude of destruction that can be caused by the bullets) there is direct reference to something beyond being human. Even if this is one of the finest interpretations out there for Splitm the Director fails to explain indirectly why there is a difference in approach the 23 personalities have towards humans and the approach of the Beast.Are the personalities functionalities for the beast? The use of the spray versus the kill?. Why does the devil need Humans? Is it some kind of vengeance that would actually improve lives of people like Kevin or the beast? I say this because Dennis and Patricia are trying to protect Kevin. Kevin seems to have gone through a childhood trauma so whatever is trying to protect him is not doing so against the devil. All this holds true if the 23 personalities manifest to the beast or like how I said reaches out and becomes the beast. What is the beast trying to accomplish? Will the next sequel 'the Glass' have answers to this? If it had to leave out people like Casey who had been tortured at a young age there is definitely something the beast is trying to prove by killing the impure. Why does it kill Mrs. Fletcher? Is the devil a manifestation of only that kind of emotion related to child abuse? Is that some kind of ideal the beast is trying to put forth? If Barry, Dennis and the others are the outcome of the child abuse and the beast is its final form ,is killing a cure to the angst and anger within Kevin? These are questions that need to be explained! One thing is sure that not all the personalities are aware of the beast. Do the killings by the beast and the protection of Kevin have any kind of relation? In the end I feel the beast lives on the mind of people like Kevin (not all the personalities ) who strangely/accidentally accept the devil with a different set of ideas(Dennis and Patricia take control of Kevin's life-""we are in control"") which in turn helps the beast to live and spread itself farther.Thank you",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
24 things you need to know about SPLIT,"1. Obviously, the first thing that should be mentioned is James McAvoy's amazing performance. He is genuinely good and convincing as he weaves in and out of vastly different personalities, sometimes in the same scene.2. Anya Taylor-Joy is a joy to watch as well. Her character has quite a bit of depth than the trailer suggests.3. Rejoice for Betty Buckley! Those who thought she was awful in THE HAPPENING will find her lovely in this film.4. As for the other two girls in the film - Haley Lu Richardson (who was wonderful in THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN) and Jessica Sula - are serviceable but not entirely memorable.5. Special shoutout to Izzie Coffey. Shyamalan always has a knack for finding talented young actors.6. My favorite personality? Hedwig. He is a delight every time he's on screen. Etcetera.7. Barry comes a close second. Seeing McAvoy play a homosexual character is as wonderful as it sounds.8. I would have liked to see more of Kevin himself.9. And in that line of thought, I would have liked to see more of the other personalities as well.10. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Not a surprise since Mike Gioulakis shot IT FOLLOWS.11. So is the score. This is Shyamalan's first parting from his go-to collaborator, James Newton Howard (unless you count Paul Cantelon's small contribution in THE VISIT). While a shame, West Dylan Thordson more than makes up for Newton Howard's absence, providing an atmospheric and surprisingly empathetic score in certain scenes.12. Most inventive opening/closing credits ever? I think so.**13. Don't let anyone spoil this movie for you. Just don't.**14. I've already seen the film twice within 5 days of each other. I liked it more the second time.15. But I still prefer THE VISIT. Some reasons:16. The climax is really underwhelming. It works thematically/symbolically, but the payoff falls short.17. On top of that, the third act itself could have been crazier.18. The structure gets repetitive.19. The runtime is a bit long as well.20. As a matter of fact, the film has many problems.21. But there are risks taken here, and SPLIT is admirable for that.22. In fact, the film goes to some truly dark territory, especially for its PG-13 rating.23. Overall thoughts? SPLIT is a really good January movie.24. But I don't doubt that audiences will be split on the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
As inconsistent and uneven as the main character,"The best thing by far about Split is the performance by McAvoy. He has great fun switching personas, and the fun is infectious. Because of this, its best seen as a black comedy because you'll be smirking and giggling quite a bit at the little nuances.But without that performance, the film is pretty lame. The subplot of the girl captives trying to escape is nothing new, especially in an era of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Room, Green Room, Saw films etc. The therapy sections are extremely clichéd and dull, the old woman therapist badly underwritten. These scenes could have been so much more interesting.By the end, Shyamalan's immaturity as a filmmaker once again rears its ugly head, both trying to shoe-horn in some heavy themes (sexual abuse, self-harming) without any sensitivity or real emotional awareness, and also swerving the film firmly into absurd comic book territory. By this point its clear he didn't have a firm idea of the story he wanted to tell or why, just another gimmick that made itself up as it went, meandering all over the place.Basically, don't expect anything ""great"". Set your sights for a 2- star Netflix kinda film, then be pleasantly surprised by how fun and watchable it is (in a forgettable way).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply. The thriller masterpiece.,"I don't mind if James McAvoy win an Oscar next year with this role. He's simply amazing with his facial expression, his eyes focus, his breath.

"Outstanding acting, script not so much","I think if I had paid attention to the director's name at the beginning of the movie, I would probably have skipped it. The director started huge with his break through movie ""The Sixth Sense"" and then every movie became more lackluster. The last movie I watched with knowing that he had directed it was ""The Village"".Anyway, McAvoy is doing a superb job at acting out the different personalities of the villain - even if the director didn't trust it so much and had him put on different clothes for each of the characters. The other characters like the girl played by Anya Taylor-Joy and the therapist are played very well and intensely as well.The major gripe I have is with the premises of the story. The multiple personality disorder had more appearances in movies and TV shows than in actual reality - which was one case only as far as I know. That is why it is so controversial. The movie takes this further and puts the premise that different personalities come with biological differences e.g. Diabetes.I guess they picked McAvoy because of his role in ""Filth"".Anyway, would definitely not see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years.","Dissociative Identity Disorder (known as DID, and previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) is a psychological disorder in which a single person displays multiple distinct personalities, often as a defense mechanism to help the original personality deal with some sort of emotional trauma, like that suffered as a result of child abuse. These personalities each have a distinct name and distinct personality traits. As you can imagine, this condition is shrouded in mystery, is especially difficult to diagnose and treat and can be very dangerous for the sufferer – and for those around him/her/them. Fascination with DID has been fodder for a number of movies over the years, most notably in 1976 when Sally Field played (and won an Emmy for) a made-for-TV version of the true story of a woman who had 16 different personalities. (""Sybil"" was remade, again for TV, in 2007, then starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange.) 2017 offers a fictional DID story in the form of the horror-thriller ""Split"" (PG-13, 1:57), written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also co-produces for the second time with Jason Blum and Marc Bienstock of Blumhouse Productions, which gave us horror franchises like ""Paranormal Activity"".James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with 23 different personalities inside his head, but who is still able to function in society. He lives on his own, has held a good job for ten years, and regularly sees his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). She finds it difficult to treat Kevin, but she cares a great deal about his mental health and she makes herself available to him 24/7. She also finds it difficult to gain professional acceptance for the things she is learning about DID by working with Kevin. And it can be especially difficult for Dr. Fletcher to know which of Kevin's personalities with whom she is speaking. For a while now, she's been dealing primarily with Kevin's artistic personality, known as Barry, but something has changed in her recent sessions with Kevin. She senses it, but isn't sure what it means.However, three young women are experiencing firsthand what has changed in Kevin. High school friends Claire and Marcia (Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are giving a ride to strange loner Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) when Kevin suddenly gets into their car, incapacitates the three of them and takes them to some sort of underground facility in which he lives and has built a room to hold the girls. Actually, it was Dennis, Kevin's most forceful personality, who abducted the three, but they don't understand what is going on, why they've been taken or what they should do about it. Disagreements over how to work together to escape and the emergence of Dennis' fellow ""alters"" keep them off balance, but when they do take action, their attempts to resist just make matters worse for them. With the obvious exception of their captive state, the girls are unharmed, but it becomes clear that something bad is about to happen.""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years. Looking at audience and critics' ratings reveals that there was a slow, but steady decline in the popularity of his films after he burst into the public consciousness with his Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1999 drama-mystery-thriller ""The Sixth Sense"". That decline bottomed out with 2010's ""The Last Airbender"", but rebounded slightly with 2013's ""After Earth"". The reception for his films improved further with his 2015 horror-thriller ""The Visit"", his first film with Blumhouse Productions, who gave Shyamalan more artistic freedom than he had enjoyed in many years. Although ""Split"" doesn't feature one of his trademark mind-bending twists, it's his best film in 10-15 years.Here, he has made a movie with an original concept, a compelling narrative and genuine tension which gradually builds. It helps that this is an especially well-acted horror film. McAvoy transforms himself (physically, emotionally and regarding audience perceptions of him), Buckley turns in her most powerful performance since the original ""Carrie"" in 1976 and Taylor-Joy follows up her under-appreciated work in 2016's ""The Witch"" and ""Morgan"" showing that she's one of the most talented young actresses of the mid-late 2010s. And, almost as much as this film showing that Shyamalan is very much back as a director, his fans will appreciate seeing two actors from his earlier films in the cast and one killer reference to one of those films in the closing credits.

The best psychological thriller of the past five years,"Just like ""The Visit"" a year earlier, Shyamalan's new movie ""Split"" offers a great mixture of psychological suspense, horror elements and an emotional drama with a lot of depth. The great story line, the tense atmosphere and the stunning acting pardon for the lack of a real twist as we usually get from Shyamalan.The story is quickly told. A man diagnosed with twenty-three different personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them in an abandoned basement. The girls quickly realize that they can manipulate some of the split personalities while others are very hostile to them. It becomes obvious that the twenty-three personalities prepare for the emergence of a twenty-fourth personality called the beast that plans to feast on the teenagers' impure bodies. The three girls must find a strategy to escape before their lives will be in danger. At the same time, the psychologist of the man with the numerous personalities realizes that something seems to be wrong with her patient during their therapy sessions. Will the girls manage to escape and the psychologist find out the truth before it's too late?The movie develops a quite diversified pace right from the start. The teenagers get kidnapped within the first five minutes of the movie and have to face one of the more aggressive personalities right from the start. The movie then slows down and presents us seven of the twenty-three different personalities. The film also gives us background information thanks to therapy sessions with the perpetrator and his psychologist as well as flashbacks of one of the girls that will become more and more important throughout the movie. The last quarter of the film quickens up the pace and leads to a furious showdown and an interesting reference. If compared to Shyamalan's last movie, some questions are though left unanswered and indicate a potential sequel to this movie. The restricted space in the basement, the calm and precise camera work, the gloomy light effects and the sinister soundtrack progressively increase the uneasy atmosphere of the movie.James McAvoy has the challenging task to portray eight different personalities all at once and his acting performance alone elevates this movie to a very high level. He is credible in all of his roles and convinces as unpredictable patient that is both perpetrator and victim at the same time. This unprecedented acting performance should be honoured with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role next year. The main actress incarnated by the talented Anya Taylor-Joy is almost as perfect as her character develops a fascinating chemistry with the perpetrator. Initially, she seems to be a shy outcast but turns out to be a clever and empathic young moment who will fight relentlessly for her survival. She's the tragic heroine of this movie and empathic viewers will definitely care about her fate. She would also deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role next year. Among the secondary characters, Betty Buckley convinces in her role as open-minded psychologist who is walking a thin line between tolerance and insistence to uncover her patient's gloomy secret. I think she would deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress next year. Overall, the cast is really convincing and easily the best in the psychological horror genre since Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"".The only reason why this movie didn't get all ten points are a few minor lengths in the story telling during the first half of the film and the fact that the movie didn't come around with a stunning twist in the key of many of Shyamalan's previous works.Still, ""Split"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller with an intense plot, an uneasy atmosphere and absolutely outstanding acting. Genre fans might even have their best movie of the year right here. Even those who like to criticize Shyamalan should admit that ""Split"" is a success and one of the best movies in his career. This film should definitely be rewarded with awards and is one of the few Hollywood movies that actually deserves all the attention it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Beast and The Beast,"Okay so this movie is directed by Shyamalan, the director of some popular horror movies. He is specialized to make audience freaking out. Well in his new movie, Split, Shyamalan tries to combine the sci-fi horror and psychology issue. It is said that the main character here, Kevin, has 23 distinct personalities, from the kindest one, the woman, the sincere child, and so on. But there will be 24th personality about to produce. At first, audience already knew that Kevin is the main character because since beginning he leads the plot. What makes this movie good is that the effects and the places, so dark, so underground, and so ""horror"" with the fringe musics that you could imagine. For me, the plot is quite predictable, but the great acting of James McAvoy will keep your mouth shut up and you will close your eyes in some dramatic scenes that will give you a nightmare if the 24th personality is real in the real life. So that, I appreciate this movie as the new method to explain a psychopath, not just because he/she has bad childhood, but also to see the relation between human and their mind, how they make everything happen beyond logic and how they react it to other people. This horror is not just a horror, but a sci fi also. You watch it first and you will agree with me. Good job, McAvoy!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lays the groundwork for Glass.,"M. Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie, introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such, the film feels a little inconclusive, but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy, who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities, and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy, who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity, the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times, but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale, and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Right down the middle,"Splitting hairs is nothing compared to this. Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird), although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer, which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one.

"Very well made, but it is too opaque","Unbreakable was a weird little movie, but it had the sort of classical character arcs that people are used to: a hero who changes because of extraordinary circumstances. Split kind of breaks this pattern because the leads are not the kidnapped girls, but James McAvoy's character. Through the eyes of victims we see who the villain is and what he becomes, but they don't grow in any meaningful fashion. Hell, the two girls kidnapped with Anya Taylor-Joy's character are basically extras.Yes, both films are, in fact, focusing on the villains, yet Split offers nothing revelatory in its last act. The film starts with girls kidnapped for unclear reasons, then you get an explanation somewhere in the middle, with the idea of what is going to happen. Then it happens. No ""I didn't see THAT coming!"" here. And the ending is really unsatisfactory, with no resolution in any direction, just a scene to let us know that it's connected with Unbreakable, which otherwise you would have never known. Imagine how ridiculous it would have been if the third movie would not have been made.That being said, the film is very carefully made. McAvoy is his usual brilliant actor, Anya is weird as usual, but all of the other (few) cast members did a good job, the tension is always there, the sets are good, the sound is good, and so on. This is a good movie, but with an unclear story.I watched Unbreakable in 2000. I kind of liked it. Then, *16 years later* there comes a pair of sequels. It took me 8 years to even convince myself to watch Split and I guess i will watch Glass now, but if people felt like me, no wondered this trilogy ended up as an obscure reference MNS fans like to obsess about.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

M. Night Shyamalan Is still a one trick pony,"M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999. His follow up films have been not just been huge disappoints but truly some of the worse films I had to sit through. ""Unbreakable"" was just stupid and so was ""Signs"" and ""The Village"". I did not even bother to watch ""The Lady in the Water"" and other celluloid manure he created.So last night against my better judgment I saw ""Split"" which was just an exercise in patience. M. Night Shyamalan proves he likes to not only bore his audience but he also loves steel money from studios that still will back his films.In this film M. Night Shyamalan had an interesting gem of an idea about a crazy man who kidnaps 3 girls. The Three teenagers, Claire, Marcia, and outsider Casey, are kidnapped and held captive by ""Dennis"", one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a victim of childhood abuse diagnosed with identity disorder.The film however fails to engage the audience. A few scenes work but they are out numbered by the scenes that don't.The film of course has a ""Minor"" twist at the end but its more like a winks to the audience for fans of one of the directors other films.A much better film that dealt with split personalities is ""Raising Cain"" and ""Sisters"".

7.5/10 - James McAvoy and M. Night Shyamalan showing their true potential.,"An underrated actor and a forgotten genius-on-the-rise shows us what they are capable of. This is the long-awaited return to shape from M. Night Shyamalan (MNS) fans have been expecting (including myself).Our heroin is a classic lonelier with a troubled past. Flashbacks from our protagonist help us feel related to her and her quest to save her life (good narrative skills). A well-written character with enough depth for joining her in the 2-hour road to survival. Nice work from Anya Taylor Joy, applause. James McAvoy shows his true talents for this multi role. A challenge for whoever that take it, this performance steals the show.MNS does a great camera-work with cinematography that adds the mystery and thrills typical of his movies. Shots from the top or bottom of the scene, close-ups, tracking shots and a creepy use of light help create the atmosphere for a heart popping flick. Shame that his signature twist ending isn't here, but the very end more than compensates for this omission.At the end, the story might lack depth and may not leave an impression that will resound for weeks; and it takes a little light on the Dissociative Identity Disorder theme...

"""We are what we believe we are"".","M. Night Shyamalan fizzed into movie consciousness in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense"" which – having rewatched it again recently – still has the power to unnerve and impress even after knowing the famous 'twist'. Since that film and his next, ""Unbreakable"" in 2000, Shyamalan has 'done a bit of an Orson Welles' by never really living up to that early promise. Here with ""Split"" he returns to better form with a psychological thriller that is heavy on the psycho.James McAvoy plays Kevin and Dennis, and Patricia, and Hedwig, and Barry, and Orwell, and Jade, and if the running time permitted another 17 characters. But this is no ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"": McAvoy plays all these varied personalities in the same body. For Kevin suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, a rare condition where his different schisms not only affect his speech and attitude but also his whole physique. One personality for example is diabetic and needs insulin: all his others are fine.Under the care of MPD specialist Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley, ""Carrie""), Kevin seems to be making good progress. But all is not as it seems. Dennis, one of the more evil of Kevin's personalities, has kidnapped three teens – Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) – and is holding them captive in his home.While Claire and Marcia are good friends, Casey is the wild-card in the pack: a moody and aloof teen that doesn't fit in with the crowd. We see the abduction unfold largely through her intelligent and analytical eyes, with her experiences causing flashbacks to hunting trips in the woods as a five-year-old child with her father and uncle.This is McAvoy's film, with his different personalities being very well observed and the scenes where he switches from one to the other being particularly impressive as piece of acting. Of the youngsters, Anya Taylor-Joy is the most impressive, with the denouement of her particular sub-plot being my favourite part of the film.Shyamalan, who also wrote the script, is treading a well worn cinematic path here (since often the MPD element is the surprise twist, to list any films here inevitably risks major spoilers). But this is a film that seems to have generated a lot of interest, particularly with a younger audience (I have seldom been quizzed more with the ""Ooh, have you seen this yet"" question). As a result this may be a modest sleeper hit.Where I think the movie missteps is in its casting of the three cute and scantily dressed teens as the abductees. From the plot of the film that emerges this appears to be unnecessary and exploitative, especially since they are made to progressively dis-robe as the film progresses. The film would actually have been made more interesting if a family unit, or at least a mixed variety of individuals, had been taken.Unfortunately Shyamalan also over-gilds the lily for the finale by going from medical improbability into outright science fiction: and dilutes what was up to that point a stylish thriller. As a result it's a decent popcorn film, and worth seeing for McAvoy's clever performance, but its not going to go down in my book as a classic.Watch out by the way for a nice final cameo scene: a clever reference to past glories.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Solid Thriller That Derails at the End,"Overall I enjoyed this film, despite it's flaws. The concept is very intriguing in my opinion and has a lot to offer from a story telling perspective. For the majority of the film I was captivated and invested in the character's wellbeing...until the end. This movie is a shining example of how an ending can diminish what was an otherwise enjoyable experience.I will start by saying that James McAvoy was brilliant in ""Split"". He has, over the years, proven his worth and this film is yet another notch in his belt. While the script is inconsistent at times, McAvoy carries the load with his protrayal of a young man suffering from split personality disorder (23 to be exact, and thus we are given the title ""Split""). The acting is definitely one of the bright spots of this film, and McAvoy does not disappoint; he delivers a truly memorable experience from start to finish. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well; I was especially impressed by the performance of Betty Buckley who plays the therapist of Mcavoy's character Kevin.With an interesting premise and good-to-great acting, what could have possibly went wrong? Well, M. Knight Shyamalan is what went wrong. While i'll give him credit for rising above his recent disasters (and lets be honest, he hasn't made a halfway decent film since ""The Village""), he again attempts to be a bit too clever with this one. The ""twist"", as it's become known as in his works, is downright terrible and threatens to derail the entire movie. In fact, the first time I watched this I did not like it because of this ""twist"". It wasn't until my second viewing that I was able to appreciate this movie for what it does well.While the climax of this film is pretty disappointing, the actual conclusion is somewhat interesting. For those who have seen Shyamalan's (good) films, you will know what I speak of when you reach the end. Many did not like this, but I found it to be a pretty cool conclusion. Watch for yourself to see what I mean.I originally rated this film a 5 simply for the disappointing aformentioned climax, but after a second viewing I have decided that it deserves a better score than just ""average"". You must suspend disbelief if you wish to truly enjoy this film, but that isn't uncommon in the movie world. While the climax of the film leaves much to be desired (as well as some of the over-arching plot), overall this is a solid thriller worth watching in my opinion. Kudos to M. Knight for making another film actually worth watching (and one that doesn't make the list for potential worst movies ever).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mentally ill people are not a horror movie plot,"Tired old trope of using a person with a mental illness as a plot for a scary movie. Unoriginal, and ableist.Mental illness, especially misunderstood illnesses like dissociative identity disorder, are incredibly stigmatized in our society. They're often seen as scary, and the people suffering from them are often labeled as dangerous, making it difficult for them to receive help and support. Movies like ""Split"" further this stigma.There is very little media representation for people with DID, many people don't know much of anything about the illness, so when movies present it as something that makes people dangerous, others have no reason not to take this as a fact.In reality, people with DID are not abusers, but people who themselves have been abused. DID is an illness that develops after long term exposure to trauma occurring before the person turned nine years old. It develops because the trauma is too much for the young person's brain to handle, so their personality ""splits"" off into different parts, so that they don't have to. Movies show these alters as violent, but really, people with DID are usually only a danger to themselves. Showcasing them as the kind of people who would kidnap and abuse teenage girls is a gross inaccuracy, that again, wouldn't matter so much if it wasn't basically the only media representation of this illness.Because of the belief that these people are violent and dangerous, not only is it difficult for them to find support, but societal biases are often internalized.Mentally ill people are not violent abusers. But the stigma furthered by these movies contributes to the belief that they are. Mentally ill people need support, they need to be normalized, they do not need any more horror movies that use them as the scary abuser. I hope that in the future we can move past movies like this, and towards acceptance. Mentally ill people deserve better.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"McAvoy Is Outstanding, Shyamalan Is On Form But We Have To Do Better On Mental Health","Everyone says McAvoy is excellent in this, and everybody is right - he really is on top form here, effortlessly carrying the film. If the film would be as exciting or gripping with a less convincing central performance is a moot point; but Shyamalan is certainly in better control of his ideas than he is in his weaker films. We've really got to start doing better, however, than using mental health problems as horror movie shorthand. This film does at least try to do something a little more complex in that regard, but it's still not enough to move beyond 'ill people as scary boogeyman'. It all does just about hang together in a final act that threatens the wrong sort of chaos but never quite delivers it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""My name's Hedwig, I have red socks!""","Split (2016) -It is weird to have a slight crush on James McAvoy in this film, playing someone with 23 different people inside his head, but I do. There are very few occasions when you get to see them being an everyday person, but there is a slightly sexual component to things that makes him appealing, but maybe that's just me.The everyday people aren't the interesting personalities of course, so you don't see them much at all, except for a fantastic montage type part where some are shown in more detail via recorded video messages, which I think is a smart way to explore them.James was absolutely superb though and I cannot believe that the Oscars wouldn't even touch this film, because of it's subject matter and that Mr McAvoy didn't clean up all of the awards everywhere. It takes a lot to impress me, but this really was a phenomenal performance on his part.How did he do it? I mean there are times when they flip from one personality to the next almost instantaneously. That must have taken some rehearsing.And it's also very odd when you think just a year before that he also made 'Victor Frankenstein' (2015), which was dreadful.The story is very clever and interesting, especially when you consider that it is based on a real person. I can only imagine how hard it would be to live like Kevin (Person 1) does. I'm actually trying to avoid referring to myself as we, when I have conversations in my head, for fear of releasing another person hidden deep inside. The one I've already got is bad enough and my other person would end up being Patricia, I just know it!It's an intelligent story, well thought out and researched. Some say that it has had a detrimental or misrepresented effect on people that suffer with Dissociative Identity Disorder (D. I. D.) and the causes that support them, but I for one feel educated by it and fascinated by the possibilities of the human brain as a result.I can see that people with only pleasant multiple personalities may feel misrepresented, but that's not the point of this particular story. I'm sure a film about a more everyday case of D. I. D. To show the other side of the coin would be just as interesting if someone made it as a comparison.This film though, is a little bit crazy and horrifying in its subject matter and really intense, but somewhat compelling to watch even as someone who hates horror and psychological films.I could easily make comparisons to 'Whiplash' (2014), 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971), 'The Departed' (2006) and '12 Years A Slave' (2013) in the respect that those films are really not to my standard tastes, but so well executed that the things that upset me personally, because I'm a wimp, are not enough to score them low. They are what really good film making is all about and so is 'Split'.The whole production and James' characters are excellent and I couldn't help but appreciate that.""I have blue socks too!""897.55/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Performances in Nice Thriller,"Split (2017)*** (out of 4)James McAvoy plays a man with twenty-three different personalities who kidnaps three young girls and holds them hostage in an unknown location.Normally I offer up more more of a plot description but the less you know about this film the better you'll enjoy it. M. Night Shyamalan's SPLIT is certainly a very interesting movie that clearly seems to have been inspired by the various Brian De Palma thrillers that he directed throughout his career. I had a couple major issues with the film but there's still no doubt that the director-writer is back on top of his game in this well-made and at times tense thriller.What I enjoyed most about the film should come as no surprise. James McAvoy really gets to shine in this film as you'd expect since he plays so many different characters. I'm not going to spoil all of the personalities but it was really amazing getting to see a talented actor play a chess match and come up with the various different personalities and bringing little touches to each of them. There are a few scenes where the actor is forced to go from one character to another in the matter of seconds and he perfectly nails it. There's no question that he brings a wide range of emotions as there are times where you feel bad for him and other times where he's downright creepy to say the least. All of the supporting cast are good but Ana Taylor Joy deserves a special mention.The screenplay most takes place inside this unknown location where we see the three girls being stalked by one personality after another. The film exits the location a couple times including introducing us to the man's doctor who is trying to control the personalities as well as some flashback scenes dealing with the main girl's childhood. It's here where I think the film makes it's biggest mistake. I don't mind anything that's in the actual film but it ends up running at a 118-minutes and I thought this was a bit too long and slow. I think everything in the film could have worked much better with a faster pace and perhaps a tighter editing job.With that said, there's no question that SPLIT holds your attention throughout and yes, there's that ending, which I certainly won't spoil here but I found it to be excellent. It's great that Shyamalan is back and doing such fine work and I really can't wait to see what he does next.",,Anonymous,Horror
Split,"Split (2016) is a story of a deranged young man whose twenty-three personalities control his life. Sounds as interesting as watching a clinical trial. Throw into the mix a kidnapping and it sounds like a third-rate thriller. A psycho keeping people (most likely vulnerable people like kids, or teenage girls) in the basement rings too familiar. Compare 'Split' with William Wyler's 'The Collector,' or Mark Tonderai's 'House at the End of the Street,' and you end up with a bad remake. 'Split,' '24,' 'Room,' 'Prisoners,' and the list goes on. Three words: Seen it before. What, if anything, makes 'Split' different and somehow watchable is the charismatic performance of James McAvoy whose acting reaches new heights.Not only is he playing nine drastically different characters, managing to smoothly transition between them, but he also succeeds in making the spectator comfortable with his deranged incarnations. In a way, Kevin is as vulnerable, if not more, than his victims. He is a prisoner too and his prison is not made of walls which, once escaped, can be forever left behind. His prison is his mind. The twenty-three characters represent lost pieces of his mind, each struggling to have a life of its own. Each of them has a distinct set of qualities as well as flaws which make them all human, breeding empathy for the anti-hero. The question becomes, who do we root for? And so, the meaning of a happy ending shifts. Watching the film, I yearned for all the prisoners, especially Kevin, to be set free from what confined them. The film has succeeded in familiarizing people with multiple personality disorder and spreading awareness about mental health issues. This definitely helps integrate the people affected into society which could treat them as different, or even dangerous, otherwise.Besides, watching James McAvoy become a woman, a child, an obsessive cleaner, and many more is simply great entertainment and 'Split' is worth a watch, if only to see that happen. However, if you expect to be blown away by the story, or the layers of meaning, or the ethereal context. You might just hit a wall. In other words, if you look for originality, look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Split (2017),"I was once a fan of M Night Shyamalan. I absolutely love The Village and Signs and feel he was on a fantastic creative run at one point. That ended when he made The Happening and then even worse, The Last Airbender. I thought The Visit was a nice reminder that he could bring forth an entertainingly thrilling film. I was hoping Split would give me the satisfaction of being comparable to M Nights' glory days but I am sad to say I am disappointed.The film is about three teenage girls who are unexpectedly kidnapped in a parking lot by a mentally ill man with dissociative identity disorder. He has 23 different personalities and a 24th called the beast which seems to be the most threatening of them all. The hype for this one seemed to be real and I heard many raving about it but I didn't have fun during this film.I know many won't agree with some of my criticisms but I wish I could have liked this more.First of all the film should have been shorter. There were areas of the film that dragged. M Night was trying to build tense moments , a lot of which I felt fell short and were worn out. I have a background in psychology and know of dissociative identity disorder but am certain that a lot of the elements of it were fantastical. Too many personalities and that final form stuff just doesn't gel well and borders on silly. Not to mention the shift between characters feels incoherent at times. Saying all that I have to say that James McAvoy is absolutely superb in this. Like so alluringly good. I'm glad an actor of his caliber was able to showcase his range and ability although I wish the film was written better.The transpiring of some of the events were so stupid. There are a few plot holes but I couldn't ever really sit back and enjoy the film. The three actresses did a decent job, Anya Taylor-Joy will certainly become a big name but I have a hard time getting over the implausibility and the buildup to the final act. I don't want to say anything that will spoil it for other viewers but the ending is pretty cool and a nice callback to a time where M Night was on top of his craft.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tense, exciting and a welcome return to form for Shyamalan.","The double whammy of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable saw filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan ascend to the throne as the master of twists. Yet after delivering a string of debacles (The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth) his title was lost, seemingly forever. Thanks to a career shakeup—involving collaboration with super successful low-budget producer Jason Blumhouse (Paranormal Activity, The Purge)—Shyamalan has announced his return to form with this creepy psychological thriller. Creating an atmosphere of dread via constant tension building and a genuinely unpredictable narrative, Shyamalan is back to his old tricks of misdirection, rug-pulling and Kafka-esque storytelling. Opening with the kidnapping of three teenage girls in an utterly unnerving sequence, the tale unravels to explore the complicated lives of both abductee Casey (Anna Taylor Joy) and split-personality abductor Kevin (James McAvoy). Or is it Barry? Or Patricia? Chewing the scenery with aplomb, McAvoy delights in a role that allows him to segue between an obsessive compulsive weirdo, a frightfully stern mother-figure, a whimsical (and hilarious) 9 year old, and, in the final act, something else entirely. There are undoubtedly flaws—an underwhelming and frustratingly ambiguous climax for example—in addition to a few nonsensical genre tropes, but the film's tempo and energy diminishes the negative effects of these missteps. Possibly a transcendent movie short of regaining his old position amongst Hollywood royalty, Split is nevertheless an exciting and gratifying thriller that continues the Shyamalanaissance.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally misjudged by the viewers! This is really good.,"I read all the reviews and I can say that most of the viewers missed the point of the movie. First of all, I think that in order to get the idea, you need to know a little about dissociative identity disorder a.k.a multiple personality disorder. I don't really see why this is classified as a horror movie and maybe that led to all these shitty reviews. Split is a psychological drama with a little touch of sci-fi. A lot of people mentioned the fact that those girls could have easily escaped.. but really, dude? If that's the only thing that makes you think in this movie, you are just the wrong audience. Now I have to brought up McVoy. The way he shifts from one identity to another is the best thing I have seen these days. This movie would still be slaying the genre with just McVoy in it. To sum-up, if you are interested in criminal psychology, MPD and these kind of stuff, you will be loving this.

Mcavoy is Great,"James McAvoy is the only reason to watch Split. He is a man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. Three high school girls are abducted from a parking lot in a Pennsylvania town. Kevin(McAvoy) has placed them in a room and appears as a different person with each encounter, including one as a little boy. He also is a regular patient of a college professor, Dr. Fletcher(Betty Buckley), who not only treats him as a client, but uses him in lectures as an example of an extreme multiple personality disorder. The three victims are downright silly and the doctor clueless as to just how dangerous her pet project is to society. His means of financial support are never explained and how he is able to survive and live in some abandoned building with no one seeing him come and go is absurd. M. Night Shyamalan has left too many gaping plot holes here. He uses a flashback involving one of the girls as a small child in the woods with her father and uncle hunting deer. It makes no sense as to the rest of the story. McAvoy is riveting as he transitions from one personality to the next with both voice and body mannerisms that are uncanny. I was impressed with him previously in another movie from Scotland in 2013 which is fairly unknown, Filth. He is hilarious as a corrupt policeman and it is a better film then Split.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Doesn't Always Make Sense, But So Much Fun You May Not Care","The resume of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan reads like a roller coaster: Peak (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), Decline (Village, Lady In The Water), complete bottoming out (Happening, Devil, Last Airbender, After Earth), and recent resurgence (Visit). ""Split"" fits right in with that narrative, as it turns out to be Shyamalan's best movie this decade.For a basic plot summary, ""Split"" sees three teenagers Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Marcia (Jessica Sula), and Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) abducted by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) who seems to be harboring multiple personalities. As the girls struggle to find a way to stay alive and escape, the man's therapist (Betty Buckley) starts smelling something fishy, while flashbacks show that Casey may have some similar demons in common with this mystery kidnapper.""Split"" is more of a psychological thriller than, say, ""The Visit"", and I think that really suits Shyamalan's filmmaking style. He's great at creating an atmosphere of tension and setting up some really creepy scenarios. There is even a sliver of ""real science"" permeating the film that at least tries to ground it in reality a bit. What it all adds up to is a film that is equal parts creepy and fun.That being said, ""Split"" doesn't always make sense or amount to the scale it seems to be built upon. In other words, the setup is significantly better than the climax. Even the traditional ""twist ending"" from Shyamalan, though present here, is of a completely different variety than his usual shenanigans (probably a good thing, though, in all honestly). Like I said, though, ""Split"" is just so much fun to watch as it's rolling along that its shortcomings are usually overshadowed.The acting in ""Split"" also goes into the ""plus"" column. McAvoy is truly a treat (a performance worthy of anything that will be featured at the Oscars), while Taylor-Joy continues to establish herself (after ""The Witch"") as an up-and-coming star.Overall, ""Split"" is the kind of film that epitomizes what Shyamalan is all about. It isn't his peak, but it does showcase his taut, spooky, madcap style of movie-making. It may not hold up to intense scrutiny, but it was one of the most enjoyable, exciting film experiences I've had of late.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

If you want to provoke, please do so but not just for the sake of profit. There was literally no need whatsoever for this film.

And I didn't quite understand why the kidnapping of the girls? Was there a point to it? Was is random? Why them? And for what reason? Were these frightened girls the symbol of what was wrong with the world on McAvoy's mind? And what was the reason for the cannibalism? What was that all about?

Very satisfied,"I went to see this movie with fairly high expectations (something I try not to do). But even then, I walked away very satisfied. Shyamalan's recent movies may not have been the biggest hits, but Split is his step back into the spotlight. And this is largely due to James McAvoy's performance(s). Preparing for one role is hard enough, but he manages to not only tackle multiple ones, but switch from one to the other in an instant. Anya Taylor-Joy also does a great job as the lead actress, and I admit my expectations for her were high after watching The Witch.

"A short review of ""Split"" (2016)","For much of its running length, I was considering writing a review for ""Split"" (2016) that rated it a perfect 10. (I am an unabashed fan of M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how reviled he is by other Internet commentators.) I love the way he frames his shots, I love his dialogue, I love his stories, and I love the strange way he can make a slowly paced film nevertheless absorbing.)And ""Split"" looked nearly perfect. James McAvoy handed in a tour- de-force performance as Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID). (Yes, I am aware of the clinical controversies connected with whether the disorder even exists — I was a psychology student many, many years ago. I think we should suspend whatever disbelief we have for the purposes of enjoying the movie.) McAvoy plays his role to perfection. His ""Dennis"" persona is particularly frightening, and ""Barry,"" one of the ""good personalities"" he portrays, is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic.Playing off McAvoy wonderfully are Betty Buckley as his gentle psychiatrist and Anya Taylor-Joy as one of three teenaged girls kidnapped by his nastier personalities. The talented Taylor-Joy was also perfect in her role. (I last saw her 2015's ""The Witch"" and she was also in last year's ""Morgan;"" I'm gaining the impression that this promising young specializes in cerebral horror-thrillers.)I would rate ""Split"" an 8 out of 10. It suffers a bit, I think, from two missteps toward the end. One, this taut psychological thriller takes an ill-advised turn into dark fantasy. I thought it was amazingly good as a thriller grounded only in the real world — it was far less so with the later jarring story elements. (I do realize why Shyamalan made this creative decision, and you will too, after watching it and then reading up on it.) But I still think that this would have been a perfect film if the majority of it focused on McAvoy's personalities either aiding or misleading his psychiatrist, with Taylor-Joy's fate hanging in the balance.Two, this film seemed to suffer from the too-many-endings syndrome that people often associate with Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. We seem to have one denouement that works quite well, then a second that should have been re-shot and re-scripted. And then there's another plot strand finally addressed  but it is played so subtly that I'm not even sure I got it. And this isn't even counting the significance of the movie's final line, which works as a fantastic framing device.About that line  if you're a Shyamalan fan, then you simply must watch the film until it's very end, as the camera pans through the coffee shop.

Bit of a shame,"A fairly suspenseful thriller with a good performance by the lead character. However, the film is let down by incoherent character dialogue and an unnecessary supernatural/pseudoscientific tinge.The first half an hour or so of the film was great. However, poor scripting begins to sneak thereafter; namely, characters saying and doing things that are completely out of character (I've noticed this with a few Shyamalan films, which makes me wonder whether his best films are good because of high-profile actors modifying the script). Nevertheless, the film continues to have it's tense (and occasionally quite gritty) moments. The film then takes a completely unnecessary supernatural turn towards the end, which in my opinion makes the film less frightening and a bit ""teenage"".6/10 for a great lead performance, an interesting fundamental premise, and some tense scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not surprised the studio reviews come up first,"So the first reviews here were which rated the film are obviously those connected with the film. The torrent of bad reviews that follows are the honest ones. From the start I had a bad feeling about this movie because the intro was so awkward and the dialogue was so cheesy with poor acting.James Macavoy is a very talented and versatile actor. How he was suckered into doing the latest Shyalaman stinker can only be explained by his needing to pay back a favor or someone having a terrible video of James with a farm animal. This film is that bad. The only moments that are somewhat tolerable are when Macavoy is on the screen. He's got by far the most presence and talent and the rest of the cast looks even worse contrasting his performance with theirs.In short, Macavoy plays a mentally ill person with multiple personalities. He kidnaps 2 girls with the assistance of a third who is terrified to act against his wishes, even when she has the ability to just walk away in a public airport. I mentioned this because that is how the film opens. You must buy into the premise in order for the film to even start to work.As the film progresses, it becomes evident early on that Macavoy suffers from this multiple personality disorder and will act out each part. And Shyalaman throws in his usual bit of supernatural rubbish, how such afflictions are also gifts, the savant mentality. OK, great, got it. Begin an hour of torture porn and hints of what bad things might happen. Warning that things will get worse. Heighten tension. Disclose things that don't really add up. Heighten tension. Add more awkward, obviously orchestrated dialogue and directing.Will the girls escape the potentially horrible ending they fear might happen? When will the James Macavoy acting clinic open? Will his accent change? Take Macavoy out of the film and this is a direct to video stinker that no one will remember. Sets a whole new bar of low.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

An intriguing setup is wasted in this sloppy, laborious blend of horror film and psychological thriller which lacks suspense, scares, or a really good payoff. McAvoy appears to be having a ball conveying all those various personalities, but the rest of the acting is so underwhelming, the plot twists and the exposition so ineffectual that it really doesn't seem to be worth the effort.

M. Night comeback gaining speed,"Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) has been getting into trouble at school. She and her two young friends, Claire Benoit (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula), are kidnapped by a mysterious stranger named Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy). Kevin has been getting treatment from Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) for having 23 personalities. Dr. Fletcher fears Kevin has been taken over by the less desirable identities Dennis and Patricia. She dismisses their fears of an emerging Beast in their psyche. The movie also flashbacks to a young Casey on a hunting trip with her uncle John.M. Night Shyamalan has regained much of his footing. There are some good scenes and the acting is great. McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable. Six would be more compelling as the audience counts up each identity. This is a solid addition to the M. Night library.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Night Shyamalan the other day regarding achieving success at such a young age, and how, over the years since then, he's developed as a filmmaker and person. He turned 29 the day The Sixth Sense opened in 1999. ""It was weird, but I got to do the cycle of fame early: 'I'm great, I'm an idiot, I'm a success, I'm a failure...I got to experience all that and then say, 'Let's just concentrate on making movies.'""

20 of My 23 Personalities Love Split,"Few directors inspire more intense reactions than Shyamalan. Starting out on the highest-of-highs (Sixth Sense) before steadily falling to the lowest-of-lows (Happening), his career wasn't so much a roller coaster as a log-flume-drop with seemingly no end. So while 2014's Visit was a nice rise back to quality, Split is a true return. A bold, original vision that hearkens his earlier work; a fascinating mixture of drama, horror and psychological world-building. Following the recent trend of ""kidnapped-and-trapped-with-a-crazy-man"" (10 Cloverfield Lane, Room), a trio of teenage girls are captured by a disturbed man (McAvoy) with 23 different split personalities. It's clear Shyamalan did extensive research, as the attention to and mentions of real-life disorder case studies is impressive. McAvoy's giant performance had every chance to be obnoxiously overacted, yet his commitment and intrigue ultimately wins each scene. His moments with his psycho-therapist are intuitive and curious, with an underpinning of unknown menace, as it all leads to an emotionally difficult message about handling and living with trauma. On top of all this, Split's ending surprise, a trademark of Shyamalan's, may be his best and most satisfying since The Sixth Sense. Still, even with all the good in Shyamalan's, he still has his hang-ups, many of which are on display here. For all the powerful horror visuals, ominously toned pacing, and humor that wonderfully walks the line between funny and disturbing, his direction makes the performances feel fairly unnatural, and his dialogue is sometimes oddly stilted and explicitly expositional. Despite the messiness and weak script moments, Split is an enveloping psychological thriller whose yarn is dutifully weaved with darkness and intrigue.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's OK.,"I am rooting for M. Night. Really. Unfortunately, his films of late were a let down. Hence, I am keeping an open mind on Split. The first sign of a series of disappointments were on the first 10 minutes of the film. The Marcia character could not act. I just want to slap her or wished she is the first victim so I can enjoy the rest of the film.John McAvoy to the rescue. This may not his finest but he can make an average script work. The story trudges along slowly. In the meantime we learn that Casey was abused. The flashback scenes were predictable, - camping trip. This could have been shorter. We get it why Casey is an outsider. Five minutes will suffice.The motivation of the psychiatrist who protects her patients needs more clarity. Does she want a Noble prize for her discovery? Seriously? The case of the blind patient regaining sight and the mention of McAvoy's split personality dilemma (spoiler) are clues served on silver platter. She seemed hopeful this will have a rosy ending.The third act is already revealed. There are some scary moments but that's about it. I was hoping this new M. Night is a better outing but it's just OK.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good acting, movie could have been better","I think Shyamalan is very hit and miss, and not just one movie being a hit and another a miss, but every movie he's made had been part hit and part miss.From Signs and The Village to Devil and The Visit, there have been great ideas and moments almost ruined by not following through. But they all have enough to make them enjoyable, for me anyways (except for 6th sense).Here the story is good, imagine 10 clover field lane it the kidnapper had different personalities, McAvoy is really good, I don't normally care that much, i mean acting should always be good.. it's their job, but you can tell when he switches between one personality and another and he plays them well and adds to the movie.annoyingly, the rest of the cast are awful, script wise. Even when the kidnapper is being an 8 year old child sitting in a corner they still don't attempt to escape, when one of them suggests maybe they should all attack him, being 3 of them, with countless objects in the room to use as weapons, the main girl says no, in an attempt for her to be the reasonable an clever one...OK so you'll be expecting a twist, it's a bit different here, and I'm not sure about it, but the fact is i've been thinking about it quite a bit and so i guess it must be good! although i hated it at the time.. and still do...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I don't get all the venom spitting...,"...which goes on about this movie. I liked it greatly. The suspense starts within a few minutes from the beginning, and never releases its grip until the final demise. The mean actor is absolutely great in his performance, playing 8 different personalities was not an easy task, and he did accomplish it with awesome skill. The setting of the story is totally creepy and perfectly fit for the character and the tale that is told, the soundtrack is carefully chosen to masterfully accompany the gloomy, sick atmosphere, and what about the story itself? It has a few minor flaws, but it works more than fine, and reading other reviews I notice that many didn't get important details.Casey's flashbacks, which many have deemed useless to the story, are instead a key element in the lunatic's final attitude towards her, and his seemingly unrealistic transformation (the most impressive one, I'm not going to say more in order not to spoil anything) is justified many times in the course of the movie by the description of how different personalities in one single person can have each their own physical peculiarities (such as illnesses etc.) which the others have not. Sure, the transformation itself a bit exaggerated, but the sense remains the same. And anyway, hey, it's a movie! You're expected to apply a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. Otherwise, just watch documentaries.As in just any horror/thriller movie, there's a few ""I-have-to-act- stupid-in-order-to-keep-the-movie-going"" moments, but those are to be expected, and don't take anything away from the enjoyment anyway.All in all, this is a very good movie in my opinion.

Excellent until...,"...the final 15 minutes.Up until then, the mesmerising performance of James McAvoy kept me on the edge of my seat. The effortless way he portrays so may characters (some changes being made in mid sentence) are astounding. Ably supported in the acting stakes by Anya Taylor-Joy, Split is a horror/thriller with much to like and represents a welcomed return to form for M. Night Shyalaman after some box office disasters.So why, after so much spectacle and intrigue, did Shyalaman transform Crumb's character into a far fetched, super human beast? It wasn't necessary - the more believable character study of a man with multiple personalities was easily enough. The most interesting psychotic character since Hannibal Lector.It killed the credibility of what, until that point, was an outstanding piece of cinema.Hats off to McAvoy though - what a performance! Also, it's pushing it to call this a horror movie. 70s Hammer films have more genuine frights than this.So not a miss this time, but could have been a much bigger hit, rather than trying one plot shock too many which is Shyalaman's calling card.Sometimes less is more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Who is He? Unpredictable.,"Split is a thriller and horror film from a famous director, M Night Shyamalan. Before watching this film, I imagined a unique, surprising, and mysterious film like the earlier Shyamalan films. Then, what I imagine is true. That is what the audience wait from the film of M Night Shyamalan.
The most I like about this film is about the acting of McAvoy as the main actor. He can act for many varieties of different personality. During this film, McAvoy has must to act for 9 personalities from 23 + 1 personalities that he has in the story script. Who is the new personality? he is so mysterious. While his opposite is Anya Taylor, she can also act it well as a protagonist. The supporting figure as a psychology doctor acted by Betty Buckley. Her act as supporting actress very helpful to connect the personality and characters of McAvoy.
This film presents a clear path, but we need to concentration and understanding with the story. McAvoy can change into his other personality at any time. But that what makes make it interesting, that's what makes this film mysterious and very unexpected. I like this because of my curiosity to the new one personality of McAvoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A so-so thriller elevated by its acting.,"Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a zoo employee, suffered enough trauma as a child that he ended up with Dissociative Identity Disorder, or DID for short. His mind harbors 23 distinct personalities, with a 24th yet to emerge and dominate all the others. While Kevin has frequent appointments with a psychiatrist (Betty Buckley), he abducts three young women for a purpose that is eventually made clear.While not exactly truthful in terms of portrayal of the disorder, ""Split"" is a decent thriller from M. Night Shyamalan, who's been hit or miss with much of his output. ""Split"" tries to have it both ways, trying to be an intelligent examination of this mans' mental problems while also aiming to be a rather conventional abduction / imprisonment thriller. While I didn't find it to be that successful on either count, the film does at least have good atmosphere. It also has intended victims who do make the attempt to not just lie back and accept their fate; they do their best to remain feisty.Anya Taylor-Joy, who'd made such a splash in ""The Witch"", follows up that project with a very fine performance here as Casey, who has her own ****ed up back story that makes *her* a more interesting protagonist. But it's McAvoy who is the main reason to watch, delivering a compelling series of distinctive performances and commanding ones' attention for the duration of the story. There is a quick, unbilled cameo before the end credits linking ""Split"" to Nights' earlier film ""Unbreakable""; this was subsequently followed by the film ""Glass"", bringing together characters from both films.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great performance, bad movie","The storytelling is cliche, the idea/view of multiple personalities is dated, there really is no progressing story, and the 'thrills' aren't really scary/thrilling. The script of Split feels like a first draft, missing a few basic elements. Like usually in this kind of serial-killer kind of thriller, it starts off with a grisly murder, which shows what the bad guy is capable of and what the protaganist wants to avoid. Here we have nothing, not knowing why Kevin even wants the girls. This fizzles a lot of tension/horror. From there no real plot develops (no one looking for the girls) and an unconnected sideplot with the therapist doesn't push things along (and the flashbacks of the lead girl really don't add anything to her character or story either). Split then tries to do the typical Shyamalan twist, but there was no story/red herring to make the twist surprising. Like in the Sixth Sense, the movie was setup as a story about helping a kid who sees ghosts, until the inevitable twist that showed what the movie was really about. Here, with out that element, all you have is a campy origin story for a super villain whose only purpose is to setup for another movie (the next Unbreakable). The only saving grace to this film, and only reason to see it, is McAvoy. His performances are rivetting. Each character is unique and very watchable. I'm not sure it's enough reason to watch this film, however.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Though not all the characters were developed, Kevin, Casey, and Dr. Fletcher felt very fleshed out. Sounds great right? Well... Every other character (Including Casey's two friends - who were also kidnapped) feels bland and forgettable.

The premise of this movie is simple. A troubled man with multiple personalities kidnaps three young women and holds them hostage as they try to escape, warming up to the character's friendlier personalities and trying to trick the less cooperative.

The supporting cast is very wooden, almost lifeless delivery. There are some great moments, anything to do with McAvoy and Anya was mostly great and fun, especially parts of the final act.

The information shared is right in accordance with true-to-life *supposed* cases of it. Of course, this is entertainment and not a case study, so Shyamalan certainly took some liberties with how he chose to depict DID. I will not say anymore about the story because I think the less you know going into it, the better. But I will say my husband and I both loved it. It was intense and terrifying.

James McAvoy is too talented for this silly movie, which had a big potential in terms of plot, but it was reduced to the regular Shyamalan garbage. It starts well, but gets worse and worse until it reaches the awful silly ending.BTW, although Anya Taylor-Joy is a main character, I think she has less lines of dialog than Arnie in the first TERMINATOR.As always, Shyamalan has to give himself a silly cameo. And the last scene... oh, god, the cringe.This film is only worth watching for James McAvoy.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Performance from James McCavoy really good time movie but its less then my excpectations,Good morning everyone before anything i didn't want to see this but thats the only thing left after gold and the founder firstly i enjoyed james mcavoy's acting it was fantastic so as Anya Taylor joy she was great and persuasive although i new her from this film but it had some problems like haely lu richardson's acting she is so hot but she was so bad in her acting and the way the movie spreaded the suspense in the first 30 minutes and in distributing the plot was unstable and moving so slow in the movie but the screenplay showed us the rest of the things in the end like saying that he had 24 personalities but they only showed 4 but i liked it and enjoyed it but i don't want to see it at the cinema again maybe i could see it at TV but my rate is 8/10,,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifying,"I've had skepticism with M. Night Shamalayan lately. His films have been kind of hit-and-miss these past few years. I think if he does more of what he did with this movie, he can be back on top in a few years. This movie is crazy intense! It was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. There are some extremely mature and dark themes and subject matter and it almost goes into rated R territory at points. However, it is these themes and subject matter that make these characters who they are, and explains why they act the way they do. James McAvoy's performance is particularly impressive. This film proves that he can play anyone a director needs him to play. There's moments where he's funny there's moments where he's chilling, and there's moments where his performance makes you hold your breath worried he'll harm you. The three young actresses in the film provide stellar performances as well. There's such range of emotion with them. You sympathize with them, you fear for them, you feel what they feel. Genuine, tearful performances, that actually look tearful and not like acting are hard to come by, and they pulled it off very well. Like I said, this film is very heavy. It's a hard PG-13. I don't want to advocate for this film due to the dark, heavy themes and subject matter so I don't want to say that it was a good movie. At times, it is very hard to watch. But judging it purely from a filmmaking standpoint of ""Was it well made? Was it well written? Was it well acted? Was it well directed?"" etc. the answer is yes. If you're a fan of M Night's earlier work, this hearkens back to that. It's still too early at this point to say if he's redeemed himself from the garbage that was ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"", but if he can keep doing what he did with this film, he just might.

Upper Echelon Popcorn Thriller,"Though not an absolute masterpiece, this is a well made film with plenty to enjoy - an original story, a memorable performance from James McAvoy and a good dose of intrigue.The suspense did wane in parts but never long enough to lose my interest. Shyamalan, conscious of the audience's perception of his previous films also plays with our expectation of a twist to deliver a satisfying conclusion.Most importantly, Split poses an interesting and pertinent question about how we deal with trauma and offers an answer which I found agreeable and in keeping with the story and in the wider context of society.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Beast of a Thriller,"Split is a really great movie, such a breath of fresh air from the sea of inconsistent, infuriating mediocrity that has plagued Shyamalan since Signs. While everyone's acting is quite great throughout, James McAvoy easily steals the show, being able to effortlesslessly making them all feel believable in the same performance.The cinematography is excellent as well, portraying the claustrophobia that the 3 captive girls feel as well as revealing information to the audience about DID sufferer Kevin in clever ways.The theme of how trauma is passed down from childhood abuse and how it affects our behavior as adults I feel will be no doubt controversial to anyone watching Split, but I believe that Shyamalan handles this very sensitive topic with care and tact. Both Kevin and Casey, one of his captives, suffered from intense childhood abuse which shaped some antisocial behavior in them later on in life, but what separates them from each other is that Casey tries to help the other captives survive and escape. Kevin (or rather Kevin's other personalities), however, embraces the philosophy of ""The Beast"", who believes that those who have not suffered like he has are ""impure"" and must be purged from the world.Split proves that Shyamalan can easily still make films that are both thought-provoking and high quality, and it's for films like these that I still root for him and want to see him succeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

M.night shaymalan's big return.,"It was all about ""split"" the week it came in theatres , and honestly it's by far the most compelling, thrilling and exciting movie of this season ,it was inarguably an Oscar worthy picture. It's hard to be decisive about how good are M.night shaymalan 's movies are , since two of this era's most acclaimed movies ( ""the sixth sense"" and ""unbreakable"". ) were his making , yet his career was undoubtedly in a huge recession or even in a distressing decline since ""the happening"" . Yet , Mr.shaymalan never ceases to amaze,not only did he make ""split"" which is the triumph of 2017's thrillers list , he also showcased one of this decade's most brilliant actors; James Mcavoy, this movie's ultimate star.Even though his ecstatic acting talent had been cornered and frankly wasted on either bad dramas or corny PG-13 superhero movies he made his breakthrough in this tremendous portrayal of the multi personality young man named,truly and among others , Kevin Wendell in his deranged journey in depths of his own dissociative mind , and in his life long struggle between complete insanity and a promised normal life, under the guidance of his most faithful companion and ""DID"" activist Dr. Karen Fletcher portrayed by the astonishing Betty Buckely . James Mcavoy has exhibited under Mr.shaymalan's visionary supervision a great deal of talent as he shifts both physically and mentally between twenty two completely distinguished personalities, in which the youngster Hedwig resides the hardest to portray, leading Mr. Mcavoy to lead one of this industry's best performances of all time. In this Odessy like journey Kevin drags Casey Cooke who's portrayed by Anya- Taylor joy in a labyrinth of despair and terror, this put the promising actress in a position in which she had excelled being one of the key elements of the well crafted psychological horror story. Split is by all means the gem of M.shaymalan 's movie universe and quite the kick starter for all the incredible young cast .It's a new take on this new fusion that mixes both the horror elements from a neo noir movie and the entertaining thriller action in one brilliant story that proves one more time that the director M.shaymalan made his comeback, knowing a new tie-in movie is already in pre production. This only leaves to wait for the visionary's big psychologically themed pictures in which he exceeds.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Run of the mill suspense film,"James McAvoy turns in a strong performance here, adding some nice touches to the various personalities of his character(s), and is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula, the three teenage girls he abducts at the beginning of the film, are all reasonably good as well, and pretty besides. Maybe too pretty, as their casting and the plot feel a bit packaged. I liked the back-story of abuse and implication of going from one beast to another, and the line ""the broken are the more evolved"", which will resonate with anyone who has suffered while growing up. M. Night Shyamalan is at least coherent in this movie, but in the end, he doesn't really add all that much to the genre. It all seems done before, and the one 'new' element, the 24th personality, wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too jazzed about the concept of setting up the next film either. This is a run of the mill suspense film, which is a shame given McAvoy's performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Better than Advertised,"I'm no film buff and I don't feel compelled to write reviews all that often. I'm not one to eagerly await the next blockbuster title and paw over the critical reviews before I decide if it's worth my buck. I bide my time and wait for the streaming release - 'Split' would otherwise have passed me by. And that would have been a huge mistake on my part. This film grows and grows - and grows into a psychotic thriller of great proportions. The character building runs alongside the present day plot with twists and turns - but that doesn't detract from the story line - it serves to enhance it at the right intervals. The sense and feeling of foreboding seeps throughout with echoes of a 'Silence of the Lambs'-type menace. The acting and typecasting is spot on and the characters themselves are quite believable in their respective roles. In all, certainly worth my buck!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Plus, having watched Glass first, the last scene at the counter was a perfect segue. Now I feel compelled to watch Unbreakable.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"At times entertaining, it lacks the confidence to make its sillier moments stick.","With perhaps the most meta twist-ending of all time, this psychological thriller represents somewhat of a return to form for Shyamalan - a writer/director who's career declined so heavily that he managed to not only make two of the best films of all time but also two of the worst - and a platform for McAvoy to really stretch his acting chops with a fantastic performance that perforates the piece. 'Split (2017)' is a bit silly regardless of its retroactive narrative justifications and lacks confidence in a number of key places, leading to a few on-the-nose expository dumps and jarringly unnecessary flashbacks. Despite some downright dodgy dialogue, it still manages to be both entertaining and interesting throughout, even if it's final act is incredibly rushed and wraps itself up in a neat yet unsatisfying way that only serves to bait a sequel that, with Shyamalan not quite back to what he once was, will surely disappoint. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Largely Well-Made Movie,"Split follows three young women who are kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities who, supposedly, has sinister intentions for said girls.When I first heard about this movie I wasn't excited. It's M. Night Shyamalan, what could possibly go right? After 'The Visit' from 2015, which received mixed reception (but I hated it), I was fairly done with M. Night. Still, Split was well met, so I gave it a go.Going in I wasn't totally sure what I would think of James McAvoy in this role. It would be easy to mess up, but it very well could be good. I'm happy to say that I walked out thoroughly impressed by his performance. He managed to embody each personality perfectly, portraying each one as a totally different person. Come Oscar season, I hope this guy at least gets a nomination. As for the others, they were fine. Anya Taylor-Joy is the standout of the three main females, though this is far from her best. The other two girls are good, but nothing worth mentioning.The tone of the movie is rather dark, and it doesn't hold many punches. It explores dark themes in ways that I haven't seen in movies much as of late. It was great to see a movie put itself out there and be a little more than edgy.The writing is almost all great. The dialogue is most always well- written, the plot moves at a good pace, and the characters are interesting and fleshed out. At least, the important ones are. Where the writing falters is with Betty Buckley's character. She is, while important, poorly written. Her dialogue is forced and doesn't really make sense. She talks to the audience more than she does McAvoy's character. More than once, she says things that, while you can tell the writers were trying to work it in well, it was clear that they didn't succeed. She'll just throw bits of information into conversations where both parties know said information so that we'd know. It doesn't work very well, and as such the movie suffers from being a little exposition-heavy.The movie takes a little while to really get going. It fakes out the audience at the beginning by making them think that there will be a set-up for the characters, then it just gets right into the plot. While I don't have a problem with movies skipping the intro and getting right into it, the way Split handles it doesn't totally work. The tone just shifts from one side of the spectrum to the other in about 5 minutes.There is one thing at the very end of this movie that is kind of fantastic. It actually makes some aspects of this movie that, at first appeared goofy and dumb, actually make sense. So when you get confused, just wait. It pulls off a different kind of twist ending that I absolutely loved.Overall, Split has a rocky start that once you settle into really is a lot of fun in the long run. McAvoy is outstanding, and the writing is more often than not great. I had a great time with this movie, and I really can't wait to see it again. In the end, I would definitely recommend Split.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sybil Unrest,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDEDIN BRIEF: James McAvoy's performance(s) is (are) the real reason to see this flawed thriller.SYNOPSIS: Three teenagers are kidnapped and held captive by a deranged loner.Dissociate Identity Disorder, a form of mental illness in which one has multiple personalities, is the inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's latest psychological thriller, Split. While the premise for his film is always intriguing, the execution is as mix-up as his central character(s). One begins to wonder if the talented director/writer will ever find his true visionary self as well, but he is on his way to self discovery with this outing.Three teenagers (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula) are abducted by a man who suffers from multiple split personalities, 23 and counting. James McAvoy plays Kevin aka Dennis / Patricia / Barry / Hedwig and other various individuals that possess this man at a moment's notice. While this may be taking diversity to extremes, the film lays the groundwork for a taut thriller, especially with the director's use of atmospheric visuals. He creates tension very well. If only his screenplay would have avoided stock characters and predictable outcomes.After setting up an effectively creepy and overused story-line, Mr. Shyamalan relies too heavily on his characters' dumb reactions to situations that could have been easily (and logically) avoided during parts of the cat-and-mouse games. His screenplay has gaping leaps of logic and one too many plot contrivances that make little sense except to advance the action and make the film more suspenseful. Especially odd is the obsessive behavior of Kevin's psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), but you know where that is heading from their first session. There is a flashback story that fills in some exposition to one of the characters, but more development on that aspect was needed. Of course, there is also his trademark twist ending, and it worked well enough, just not very surprising or exciting.But it is Mr. McAvoy who impresses with his acting choices and he is terrific. With a wide range of quirks and subtlety, he play Kevin with the widest of strokes. Displaying extreme mood swings from childlike behavior or sudden violent tendencies, the actor brings the proper degree of menace and vulnerability in his many transitions. Ms. Taylor-Joy gives strong support as his sharp-witted adversary and Ms. Buckley adds greater depth to a standard rote role.Split is an entertaining psychological thriller that uses mental illness as a plot device for cheap thrills. And though Mr. Shyamalan remains in full control, except for a script that could have used a rewrite or two, it is his lead actor who rescues his film from its run-of-the-mill mediocre origins.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Splat,"A troubled girl is kidnapped by a strange man and must reveal her past in the struggle to escape.Standard captive-captor plot enlivened by a fascinating conceit over multiple personalities, and well performed by the lead actors. Almost two hours long, but it flies by at great pace despite the mostly claustrophobic sequences. The story is well put together, but it's not a horror and nowhere near as creepy as the director's last outing in The Visit. Nor does it give its violent moments real life, which is typical of this director. Only three characters, with the minor parts badly underwritten, and mostly it's a two-hander with an interesting antagonism. A few plot holes, and a couple of implausible plot points involving locks. In the end the director adds a decent twist, but then he reveals his ambition and I was left shrugging my shoulders.I looked forward to the lead actor's performance after his showing in Scum, and he does really well, but the lightweight mood drains his power, and the whole thing falls way short of, say, the basement scenes in Silence Of The Lambs. The lead actress is very good in close up.Music is atmospheric but laid on too thick, especially over some dialogue scenes that should have been more powerful with simple delivery. Photography is good, and the editing and writing keep up an excellent pace.Overall: fascinating premise, but the director wimps out on the horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Split is a return to form for Shyamalan,"An unrelenting cerebral thriller, Split strikes deep with its exploration of human nature and its possibilities. M. Night Shyamalan's return to form is strong in character and visuals yet it is this controversial director's own quirks and flaws that stop it from being great.Shyamalan is known for his big yet often flawed ideas but Split manages to ground the often absurd dialogue and lingering camera through the strength of the performances across the board. While the whole cast does a good job, our two primary characters, troubled captive Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the mentally unstable Kevin (James McAvoy), are a wonder that completely captivate you throughout. Their skill in invoking a true sense of sympathy and fear despite the beautiful but often blatant use of camera is a merit to their performances. Newcomer Taylor-Joy is a true talent for holding her own against the powerhouse McAvoy whose Kevin is destined to become a classic character. Suffering from dissociative identity disorder, each of Kevin's personalities shown on screen comes across as a distinctive being, often fooling even the audience into forgetting the innocent, playful Hedwig and the OCD afflicted paedophile Dennis are technically the same person. As the film progresses and we build to the reveal of 'The Beast,' Kevin's hidden 24th personality, Shyamalan masterfully keeps us on our toes regarding his true nature. Thankfully he shows restraint in maintaining the more grounded tone rather than surprising us with a cheap twist, adding an element of rewatchability lacking in even his best works.Despite these merits, the film often falls into the Shyamalan trap of unnatural, forced dialogue that in a second can undo any tension or investment in the plot. While nowhere near the painfulness of The Happening or After Earth, Split still fails to put faith in its visuals and feels the need to explain everything to the audience. Often it also falls into awkward, sudden humour that feels unwarranted and not in line with the otherwise extremely tense atmosphere it creates. As a result of these factors, it is easy to see why one may call the film arrogant or self-congratulatory and I would definitely agree with them in part yet, overall, I still find myself having enjoyed the film due simply to the power of the premise and performances.Thrilling but flawed, Split seems to suffer from the same tonal shifts as its antagonist, the moments of terror undercut by Shyamalan's awkward humour and blatant dialogue. Regardless, the tense atmosphere and a truly mesmerising performance from James McAvoy raise it above mediocrity.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enough now,"Here I am, about to disagree with the popular view again. Watching this did not make me think Shyamalan is ""back"", or has vastly improved or something along those lines. If anything, it all strikes me as a tad 'samey'.Even on the back of good cinematography, the movie itself suffers from atmospheric deprivation, ill-timed and unfocused characterization framing, a complete absence of story foundation and cringeworthy, cheap, try-hard attempts at distracting the viewer into the supposed twists instead of purposefully diverting us into them.On top of all that, the by now Shyamalan-trademarked lacklustre structure and pace, the terrible (TERRIBLE!) writing and the doltish efforts to force a ""surprise"" ending upon us, it all contributes to the creation of a weak, ineffective movie, generously saved by one thing alone.James McAvoy is superb.Now, imagine the same exact movie and replace McAvoy with anyone else (who isn't also Tom Hardy because if you've seen Bronson, you know that boy would own this role, too). It just would not work. As it stands, miraculously and above its many, many shortcomings, Split does work — on the shoulders of its protagonist. That is not to say that Anya Taylor-Joy is not worthy, she also has to be mentioned with praise, however, I found her budding talent severely underused here and her performance caged within the screen writing confines of a shadowed, mismanaged backstory and character stagnancy.Going back to McAvoy, thank the cinematic Gods for that man. A premium performance, engaging to the point of actually making the surrounding happenings an irritating distraction — I would happily spend the duration of the movie watching him doing his ""thing"" without anything else interrupting me, no background plot, no other actors, just all 24 of him in front of a camera.Lucky, James McAvoy's Kevin is making this a must-watch for anyone interested in harvesting the prime, ripe offerings of a true thespian — but that's all you can expect from yet another poor effort coming to you directly from Mr Shyamalan's clouded mind and overinflated ego.tl;dr: Woman or man, watch this and James McAvoy will get you pregnant.Salud!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A Return To Form For Shyamalan, Great Performance from McAvoy.","I get the feeling that Shyamalan wrote and directed this film, got it down to the 2 hour running time and screened it. Then the studio asked him; ""Shyamalan, don't your movies always have twists? Why doesn't this film have a twist? I think this film needs a twist. Put a twist in"". Then Shyamalan decides to tack some cheap ending onto an otherwise suspenseful film with a career performance from McAvoy. Now people might be upset that I said this film has a twist because saying that is in fact a spoiler. This spoils nothing. The so-called twist, if you even want to call it that, has nothing to do with the film and makes me question why the hell such a scene exists in this film to being with. Now...in saying all that. I honestly don't know if I hated it or loved it. I'm split. (Bad dad joke)McAvoy plays Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade...etc. He kidnaps three young girls and brings them to his lair. The girls are desperate to escape and try everything they can, but soon realize that their kidnapper is not all there. Each of his personalities have completely different conversations with them and himself. Can they escape before ""he"" arrives, a yet to be discovered 24th personality?We can all agree that when the name M. Night Shyamalan is attached to a project, the groans, the eye rolling and the utter disinterest immediately hits you. Whatever goodwill he did with his first three films seems to have been completely destroyed with The Happening, Last Airbender and After Earth. A low budget horror flick came out recently, from Shyamalan, and people were surprised at how not terrible it was. The Visit was a found footage film and Shyamalan managed to use it to pretty good results. Now he Split, a suspense thriller that boarders body horror and I think it's another hit.The film relies, heavily, on James McCoy's performance and I'm glad to say it's really strong. He's able to snake his way in and out of the vastly different personalities on a whim and each one is as believable as the last. He gives 100% in his performance here, being terrifying, funny and sad at any moment. Anya Taylor-Joy is the 'lead' girl out of the three, we are given snippets of a backstory through some flashbacks. She's damaged and fits the victim role perfectly. The problem is that we've seen it all before, trouble girl is trapped and has to muster the strength to fight back.Split was really fun and tense.

Even though we only get to see 8 of the 23 (or is it 24?) multiple personalities, what we are presented with is utterly brilliant.There was depth to the movie. We are told bits of Casey's past that serve to give important background to the character, even though they are never too obvious.The tension is palpable in several scenes and you're constantly on tiptoe, never knowing what comes next.As in all horror movies there are scenes where you just can't help wonder what the hell the character is doing. Why didn't Casey open the car door when she obviously had plenty of time but most of all - edited out-.It's a pet peeve of mine when the trailer features scenes that don't appear in the movie. In this case, it was Casey saying that the flowers meant they were special.The film wasn't very well balanced, in my opinion. The pace that seemed so well accomplished in the trailer just wasn't.

I like it!,"M. Night Shyamalan's take on Silence of the Lambs is like a tightly woven thriller with a personal touch that draws you in. He's not just a director, he's more like a doctor of genres, injecting his own ideas and emotions into each story. Remember how The Sixth Sense wasn't just about ghosts, or how Signs wasn't just another alien invasion tale? Even The Visit wasn't just found footage; they all tapped into deeper themes like trauma, loss, and the passage of time. Split is another shining example of his craft, blending suspense with a deep dive into emotional struggles. Shyamalan's keen eye captures the power of facial expressions, telling a story beyond words. His camera moves with purpose, capturing every twist and turn, adding to the tension. And with actors like James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy leading the charge, it's a mental chess match from start to finish. The film's confined setting is masterfully used, creating layers of suspense within its limitations. While it might not be perfect, I have a feeling its impact will only grow with time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointed after all the hype,"No plot points nor spoilers here. You've probably read a lot about this film, including that it resurrects M. Night Shyamalan's writing brilliance with a remarkable plot twist at the end. Well, I read all of that, too, which is why I went to see it today...before the big twist and turn would accidentally be revealed to me.McAvoy's performance was terrific, but that's the best thing I can say. At the end of the film I was asking myself, ""Where's the great twist? What did I miss?"" I had to log onto IMDb to read others' comments and see what all the fuss was about. In sum: for me, no flash of ""Sixth Sense"" brilliance from Shyamalan, just another dopey ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Emotionally Stirring. One of M. Night Shyamalan's best.,"Shyamalan has made a few films in his career that didn't quite grab me (The Village, The Happening and The Last Airbender for instance). However, this is not one of them. I didn't know much about this film other than having a basic idea of the premise and no expectations, and I am so glad I watched it (if only I had of seen it at the movies!).Split is the story of a man, who in his suffering the hands of his abusive mother and abandoning father, developed Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). This results in the emergence of 23 personalities as a coping/defence mechanism, gifting him the nickname 'The Horde'. With hint of a 24th personality on the way, three girls being held captive by The Horde must escape before the 24th personality emerges.This film looks at DID through the lens of how the disorder can unlock the potential of the human psyche and transcend the limits of human physiology - believing is to become. James McAavoy gives an absolutely amazing performance whilst shifting seamlessly through multiple personalities, in body and in voice, along side the talented Anya Taylor-Joy who also gives a great performance of her own as the intelligent and troubled Casey Cooke.If you're looking for an emotionally stirring thriller with great acting and an interesting story line, this is a film to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Split Opinion,"Split is an intriguing film which follows the story of a man who has different 24 personalities. It is a tense thrill ride and the story has you gripped from the start.James McAvoy's performance is breathtaking. At no point in the film do you think that McAvoy is acting; it all feels very real. His portrayal of a person with multiple personalities is truly incredible. Compared to McAvoy' performance, the other actors' contribution is a little underwhelming – although this is not a big problem.M. Night Shyamalan's direction is consistent throughout the movie. However, there are plot holes. The movie keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat throughout. It is well made and brimming with suspense.I feel that the story and pacing of the film is well constructed and I look forward to seeing what Shyamalan releases next, now he has returned from his fall from grace. We get a hint that he may be building a cinematic universe at the end of 'Split' but, the scene in question does feel a little shoehorned in.Overall, I liked the film, but feel it was insensitive to sufferers of Dissociative Personality Disorder. I would give the film 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well done, James MacAvoy!","I don't understand why this movie would get low ratings because it's incredibly well acted. James MacAvoy is pretty dang phenomenal in this.

I definitely recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
M. Night Shyamalan,"Movie- M. Night Shyamalans comeback to the movie industry, by making a brand new movie, that caught the interests of everyone seeking a new, fresh, thrilling movie. M. Night Shyamalans previous works doesn't impress people with movies like, signs and after earth, which were total failures. M. Night Shyamalan released the movie The Visit in 2015 which was kind of a funny- thriller. Now when I say funny-thriller I mean it wasn't supposed to be humorous but gave a few laughs in some scenes and the same happened with split. I don't think it should of got the "" horror "" tag as its not a horror its a thriller. One thing that really caught my attention and a small detail that was in the movie was at the start when they address the cast they do it in a kind of a old thriller type of thing where its a split 10 screens, it just made the beginning look so cool. The story, plot, and idea of this movie was very unique and special, M. Night Shyamalan was smart to come up with something like this as a lot of directors would not think as something as smart as that.Actors:Now actors, I can not exaggerate how much of a great performance James McAvoy pulled off, really Oscar worthy. His character kind of reminded me of Heath Ledgers Joker. That was something that was a highlight of the movie. Other actors such as Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, were outstanding with the characters, especially Anya Taylor-Joy.Plot: As I said before the plot was very unique, and was something fresh, and new for people to watch, but as a thriller not a horror. It was sort of a mysterious film where you didn't know what was happening next but not to a high level.Feedback: Overall I recommend watching this movie, its really entertaining for any type of audience. One thing was the ending. You know its going to be confusing if there's ending explanations when you type in ""split"" in google or YouTube. The order of events is really tense and you're always wondering whats going to happen next. If you are into M. Night Shyamalan, go see this movie to see a tremendous comeback. The only downfall was a confusing ending that only a small group of M. Night Shyamalan super fans would understand, you would understand if you look at a ending explanation if you didn't already understand the ending like I did. I rate M. Night Shyamalans Split a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A creepy and unique thriller dominated by McAvoy's turn,"Until last year's mini-comeback The Visit hit our cinema screens, it seemed like the ""it"" thing to do was talk down the undeniable talents of M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker.A writer/director of unique vision that gave birth to one of the greatest debuts of all time with The Sixth Sense and followed it up with the memorable Unbreakable and Signs and the underrated The Village, only to be found wanting with misguided films Lady in the Water and (cold shudder alert) The Last Airbender and The Happening, the young director seemed to have lost his way and everyone was having a great time reminding each other about it, but showing once and for all that you can't keep a talent down forever, the commercially successful and critically liked Split see's Shyamalan back doing what he does best, delivering audience appeasing thrillers with fresh unpredictable twists.While not reaching the grand heights of his early products, Split which ends up going to some fairly dark and twisted places as it deals with a group of abducted teenage girls led by The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey and their increasingly demented encounters with their adductor Kevin, who just so happens to have a further 22 personalities with an added addition on its way, is a constantly engaging and often unpredictable beast that is anchored by a powerful display of acting turns from James McAvoy.Whether playing the OCD Dennis, the child like Hedwig, the fashion introvert Barry or an array of other identities including a late starter to the horde in the films final stages, McAvoy dominates the film and elevates it to grander heights than it's somewhat slight narrative aims go for and while Split is unlikely to be a film awards season cares to recognise come the end of 2017, there's little denying that we've already seen one of the year's most standout acting displays and arguably the turn of McAvoy's still developing career.The other highlight of Split is seeing Shyamalan back on impressive directing and writing duties with the film featuring a number of tension riddled examples of direction (and a standout dance scene) and a number of brave writing choices, some of which will shock the audiences in the later stages, and in particular give greater meaning to Casey's plight.It's great to have the Shyamalan of old back, not to the level we know his capable of, but Split is a thriller with a difference, filled with an odd yet evident heart and James McAvoy having the time of his life running wild with one of modern cinemas most spine-tingling villains. With the added addition of an end coda likely to please Shyamalan fans of old, Split is well worth your time.3 ½ cd players out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
M. Night Shyamalan's Best Idea In Years.,"This past Halloween I revisited The Sixth Sense(1999) to see how well the horror classic had aged. I remembered it being a perfect piece of new age horror, that changed the way ghost stories would be told in movies. While The Sixth Sense does hold up as a terrific movie, there are problems mostly with the direction of the story and the dialogue. It may please you to hear that Split has a lot of the same elements that made The Sixth Sense great, but also some of the faults. They are not the same movie at all, but M. Night Shyamalan may have stumbled upon his best idea since Unbreakable(2000) and while he has taken quite a fall in recent years, he still has the ability to create worlds that are interesting and watchable.Split is about 3 teenage girls who after attending a birthday party, are abducted by a man who seems to have some significant mental problems. The girls are placed in a room who's only contents are 3 beds, a door and a bathroom. The girls can hear a few different voices on the other side of the door, even a woman who seems to be willing to help the girls, but as the girls find out, their captor has split personality disorder, and has been talking to himself the whole time. The plot is incredibly easy to understand, while also feeling like a complicated web of stories and characters that we will most likely never fully know about.While Shyamalan has always been known for his twists at the end of his movies, his overall writing ability has been lacking. Where he really excels is in creating worlds that exist in the same one we live in, but adding an element that changes the whole story. For example The Sixth Sense is about a boy who is struggling to grow up, who also happens to see dead people. In Unbreakable Bruce Willis is a regular down on his luck guy looking for meaning in his life, who just happens to not be able to get hurt. Split follows the same formula and it is this which really took Split from a bad movie to a good one for me. The way the different personalities take hold of James McAvoy's character is just so darn cool and inventive. The more I learned about the process the more I wanted to see it used in other movies.James McAvoy, who is probably best known for playing a young Professor X in the recent X-Men movies has been at this for a while. I first remember him as Mr. Tumnus in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) movie, but McAvoy has moved out of family movie actor and has become one who takes some challenging roles. McAvoy has played characters with mental disorders before, in Filth(2013) he played a cop with Bipolar Disorder and his performance in that was great. While he takes his role in Split a little over the top, its almost what the character needs, Kevin does not have a run of the mill case of split personality disorder, he has 23 unique personalities who seem to be completely separate people, to the point that one of them can have diabetes while the other 22 do not. While not his grandest performance, McAvoy gives a good one and one that fits into the movie.I have tried to avoid using the wordplay that I'm sure every other review of this movie has used, but since were almost done I figure using this pun won't ruin your opinion of my opinion. I felt very SPLIT in my opinion of Split while watching it. On one hand there were some lines of dialogue that I could not believe made it past the first draft of the script, let alone into the final cut, but on the other Split kept my attention for most of the 117 minute run time. If you don't understand the ending that is fine, just do a quick internet search and the results should solve at least some of the confusion. Split is an entertaining movie, that was marketed more as a horror movie than a thriller, but if you keep an open mind and allow Split to be entertaining you should have a fun time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
He's Back,"Wow. I wasn't expecting this film to be anywhere as great as I had heard it was. Assuming audience and critics alike were just happy Shyamalan made an objectively good movie, I went in expecting a movie about on par with an average marvel movie. I was wrong. This movie is on par with the greatest that shyamalan has made. And that does mean something!Unfortunately he hasn't really followed up with creating another great film, but his previous two have been much better than say Airbender or The Happening.Of course the story was interesting and compelling. There was little doubt that Shyamalan would ever fail in that aspect. The editing and cinematography were pretty great. Though still not comparable to Unbreakable or Sixth Sense, it was definitely better than his lesser films. Acting was amazing.

Superb acting with an interesting plot.,"I was not expecting much.Looking back on M. Night Shyamalan's track record for the past few years, he hasn't put out a lot of quality films compared to some of his earlier films like the Sixth Sense. Split was a surprise. The plot of this movie follows three girls who are captured by James McAvoy's characters.This film has some amazing acting coming from James McAvoy, probably the best in his career. He puts so much effort into each character he plays and each one is unique and interesting in their own way. Anya Taylor-Joy also brings a lot to the movie, her character's arc in the film in deeply interesting and she acted it out very well.The cinematography in this movie is very good. Mike Gioulakis makes the film feel claustrophobic while bringing a stylized look.My only gripes with the movie are some of the acting and the plot near the end. The two other girls that get captured along with the main girl overacted or underacted most of the time and usually did some pretty stupid stuff. Some of the plot near the end of the movie starts to become a bit unbelievable but doesn't ruin the entire film.Overall, Split is a great horror film with some fantastic acting, great cinematography, some twists and turns, and a solid story with some flaws mixed in.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best character performances in a great psychological thriller,"""Split"" is M. Night Shyamalan return to forms. It was really a character act, upon viewing it really does seem like a sort of supervillain origin story (the ending does sort of reveal /confirm this). The way that the film depicts the character of Kevin is stellar due to the acting and narrative flow. I thought that this is a very solid psychological thriller, one that we haven't gotten a lot of recently.The film manages a steady pace with a very intense theme that is enforced by the films brilliant score. This was something I really liked, the build up to the reveal, the way we slowly peel away at this character. However I do feel that the trailers sort of spoil it for us and it might be more effective if nothing is given away however that probably wouldn't work marketing wise.The way that James McAvoy depicts each individual personality is amazing, the way he contorts himself, squeezes his brows together or stand upright, subtle details like that make it a performance to watch out for. The female lead, Anya Taylor-Joy was also really good in her role and was great at depicting this cold, broken individual. The way she intuitively was able to calmly decipher the situation and identify what to do made her character great. The film really thrives at unravelling these two character's past in a very great way.However once we enter the last act where the final personality dubbed ""the beast"" is unleashed i feel the film starts to go down hill, this is the most action heavy part of the film however it may be pushing the boundaries a little with the development of the personality. It was horrendous to see how this such well crafted and built up character crawl around on walls like spiderman. This was a really kind of off putting ending however it was well resolved in terms of having an amazing epilogue in which kicks off with Taylor-Joy's character giving a final emotional stare, as she contemplates which is worst, returning to her abusive and sexually harassing uncle or to have just been locked up here for ever. Followed up by the reveal that this movie sets place in the same universe as ""Unbreakable"". Setting up the potential Unbreakable trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Split is Awesome,"Amazing story tellers do not come around all the time, but M. Night certainly is one of the best of our time. The second film in a three film Superhero trilogy, is so smart and so well acted, calling it a Superhero film is an insult. How Jame McAvoy did not win an Oscar for this performance is beyond me. To pull off a horror film without blood, an action movie without explosions, and psychological thriller without selling out, is a major accomplishment. The first film in the trilogy is Bruce Willis's Unbreakable, which is a fun watchable film. This was followed by Glass, that wraps up the whole series in a nice little bow. This was by far the standout of the three.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
NICE Tie-in,"The movie was not done badly. I think the story idea was a bit /meh until the final 5 seconds of the movie. Then the world becomes clear. Yes, what I am saying is that the last 5 seconds of the movie will change the ENTIRE contextSome have posted that it caused them to not be able to view the movie, as it was put forth, when the ending comes. I, however, found it delightfulThe acting was nice on mostly all parts. I understand the movie's tone kind of conflicts with the implied physical characteristics of the DiD character as it implies control over the physical. Trying not to get to into it in order to avoid spoilers.He did well with his choice of cast, nearly. The psychiatrist's acting was a bit lacking and flaccid for a person who championed the view that they did. Still, I think James McAvoy NAILED a DiD persona and made it ""real"" for the viewer. That is what matters in a movie. Are the characters ""real"" or are they simply actors.Anya Taylor's character....well, I have to assume some areas were removed from the movie. You will see what I mean if you are a person who really get's into each character's role when trying to ""Experience"" the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More of the Same from M. Night Shymalan,"The works of M. Night Shymalan are certainly an acquired taste. A taste that has not been acquired by mainstream American audiences for the better part of seventeen years if we're being totally honest. Make a short list of movies that have angered audiences with misplaced pretension and/or rug-pulling twists that don't make sense, and you're liable to find the directors name all over it. Yet much like fake news, ska music and smallpox, his personal clout and unique mix of genre tropes are having themselves a bit of a comeback. And nowhere is that more evident than in his newest film Split.Split's main conceit; the mysteries of the human mind, are exemplified by the traumatized Kevin (McAvoy) who becomes our villain of sorts. His psychoanalyst Dr. Fletcher (Buckley) believes he possesses 23 distinct personalities, all of whom vary in age, gender, interests, mannerisms, personal histories and even body chemistry. This of course comes as a shock to three teenage girls who have been taken hostage by one or more of Kevin's personalities, many of whom have a cult-like obsession or fear of ""The Beast"" the rumored 24th. While huddled in a locked basement awaiting their fates, the three girls must decide which personalities to trust while keeping their eyes peeled for ways to escape.With Split, it seems that Shymalan has finally accepted the fact that he'll never be anything more than a B-movie director. A brief look at his filmography reveals that even at his worst, Shymalan has used the same sophisticated visual vocabulary and affinity for psychological pablum as Hitchcock. Yet much like using a pipe wrench for an oil change, Shymalan's work doesn't come with the same sophistication or practical applications. Shymalan's fateful decision to eschew big-budget projects like The Last Airbender (2010) for smaller genre-niche movies has yielded some objectively better results over the last few years. He's still using the exact same formula that made him a household name, only now his clumsiness is seen as endearing or quirky in smaller movies. If one were to compare the found-footage proclivities of The Visit (2015) to the horrifyingly excessive The Happening (2008), you'd realize that the only real difference, is one actually knows it's a black comedy.Split is simply more of the same - ominous atmospherics, pseudo-religious iconography, quasi-Jungian pop psychology and excessive brooding, all dialed up to eleven. Clearly never learning from his mistakes, Shymalan has also speckled in wind-baggy in-world explanations and redundant plot information, all but guaranteeing that audiences will burst out laughter before they cower in fear. Add to all that a complete inability to marry his technical abilities with a unifying tone and you got yourself a carnival full of cheap tricks and cheaper thrills.Aiding in this carnival act is James McAvoy whose campy performance is fun to watch, if for no other reason than its so far beyond the pail of plausibility. Kevin is one of those characters that most actors secretly dream of doing because, while they may be broad and even offensive, they do supply facets of an actor's range. Plus, by the time one of the kidnap victims opens the files on all the personalities, Kevin's kinship to those suffering from Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is about as tangential as Pure Flix's kinship is to Christianity.Out of all of Kevin's victims, Anya Taylor-Joy's outsider Casey has the easiest time adjusting to Kevin's solipsistic creep vacuum, allowing her characters lack of character color the background like the blank stare of a China doll. Her background, parceled in segments, does give reason for this; reasons that ultimately endear her to her kidnapper/s in the most unsettling of ways. While some may see her eventual fortitude as a source of strength, her inherent lack of agency throughout just reeks of exploitation.By the end of the film, our fully-realized villain purports to bring salvation through suffering. Yet when you realize that you're not watching a bizzaro girls-in-peril kidnap movie but something else entirely, the suffering just becomes too unbearable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A masterful showing with a final scene that will make your jaw drop,"In a Hollywood completely lacking in originality and creativity, M. Night Shyamalan remains a shining light. Say what you like about some of his films, but the man continues to put out original, thoughtful and sometimes brilliant material. There's no questioning he's gone through something of a rough spell after the incredible start he had to his career. 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakble', 'Signs' and 'The Village' are all some of my favourite films to this day. Films like 'Lady in the Water', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth' on the polar opposite end of the scale are completely unbearable to watch and deserve no praise at all. It has been a bizarre career to date containing the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows. 2015's 'The Visit' however was a hint that he may be righting himself again and now 'Split' has absolutely confirmed it. Shyamalan is back baby!I was completely hooked by 'Split' from the moment I first saw the trailer. What a brilliant concept that lends itself to so many possibilities and so much potential. James McAvoy in the lead role must not have been able to believe his luck when he was offered the part. A character with 24 different personalities - an actor's dream. I thought he was quite brilliant in the role too. He completely sold me on every personality he performed and brought a tremendous level of intensity to the role.The only problem with the film I could possible perceive is a slight lack in advancement of the story. Things can feel a little stationary at times with an almost two hour run time. Other than that though this is near perfect film making. All of Shyamalan's class as a film maker is on show. The opening scene is brilliant, the flashbacks are masterful and the final scene of the film will leave you shivering (if you're anything like me). The brilliance of that final scene is unlike anything I've seen in a very long time. Shyamalan is back and that is brilliant news for film lovers around the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Heads in the right direction but doesn't fully utilize its potential,"Split is a psychological thriller, not a horror. Everything this movie delivers, together with all suspense, culminates in the final few scenes. So don't expect seeing a movie in which particular scenes alone make sense or are able to scare you. It's like a one coherent experience in which what is to happen heavily depends on what has happened. And it develops slowly.As the story continues you somehow get to know one person with many different personalities. All of them stand as characters in themselves but tell one story about a particular individual named Kevin. Kevin kidnaps three teenage girls who serve as interlocutors; they don't take pivotal role. Split is not about them and their effort to escape. This is not escape the room stuff.Seeing how many different personalities interchange in between as if they were not manifestations of a single person is what makes Split so interesting. To help you understand what may be going on inside of Kevin's head, a woman psychologist is utilized as a facilitator. So you get to see Kevin (and some of his personalities) interact with several different characters as to bring about better understanding of why kidnapping and split syndrome. Let me mention that it's not all about Kevin only as you'll get to see as the final moments approach.McAvoy deserves every single applause he had got. Even critics who didn't like the movie thought acting on his part was excellent. Three young actresses who played girls that got kidnapped did what they were supposed to do. They're not spoiled or stubborn as teens in some other horrors.I gave it a six because I found the story of 23 different personalities as almost being an excuse for horrible things. Yes, at the bottom Split deals with very difficult and important issues of mental health and wounds we get from the love ones. No matter how sad his story may be, Kevin is a deranged and mentally unstable kidnapper. There's a moment where psychologists says that people like Kevin may have unlocked secret potentials and so somehow surpassed other people. This is pure wishful thinking which Shyamalan apparently took seriously. I may be wrong, but this quaint taste is what I had been left with after seeing it. Other than that, there are several boring and unnecessary parts which should have been replaced with something more interesting. There was a plenty of material for Shyamalan to do that given this topic.So to conclude. Split is somewhat original in his attempts to deal with serious issues like mental scars, but you'll enjoy it as much as your views on this issues allow you to.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Shayamalan's best, but far from his worst","I had written off M. Night Shayamalan. He had a string of bad movies and it seemed that was the new norm for him: The Happening, The Last Air Bender, Lady in the Water and perhaps there are others I'm forgetting. So, when Split was released and they said it was a Shayamalan production I thought: ""I'll pass.""Then I started hearing the rave reviews. I heard more than one which planted a small seed in my head like maybe I should watch this. So I did.Split wasn't as bad as the aforementioned movies but it wasn't all that great either. As the title indicates the movie is about an individual with dissociative identity disorder (i.e. multiple personalities). One (or maybe more) personality is responsible for kidnapping three teenage girls and it is unknown what his plans are for them. Because it is a Shayamalan movie your mind is trying to dream up all kinds of possibilities.The film moves somewhat slow as the plot is gradually unfolded. McAvoy is adequate as the main character although there was a lot to be desired from the rest. The movie is OK as it explores the mind, its fragility and its strength. It's not Shayamalan's best but it is far from his worst.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense and very well made thriller,"Greetings from Lithuania.So just before the very end of ""Split"" (2016), a movie by M. Night Shyamalan that i haven't had enjoyed this far since well, maybe ""Signs"" back in 2002, i kinda thought that there won't be a any twist at the end (kinda even can't remember times where a movie by this director was an event film) - but i was surprised more then i could imagine after i heard a very familiar and great theme back from a very good director's movie back in 2000 and the there was HE! No spoiler - but count me in for any sequels from this ""universe"".Now back to the ""Split"" - i did enjoyed this movie a lot. This is a tense, involving and intriguing thriller where once my favorite M. Night Shyamalan is on his good form - writing was good, dark and involving - its like non of those shxx movies before have ever happened (and you know what movies i do refer). Acting was very strong by James McAvoy and good by Anya Taylor-Joy. Directing was solid - the movie is intense, good / dark looking and moody thriller.Overall, hopefully M.

Surprisingly bad,"I think Shyamalan has been abducted by a multiple dissociative disorder guy, because I don't think he could have directed this crap.How come i can cry on some deep emotional movies, and How come i can feel NOTHING for Split ? How did he make this way to make me not care about any of these characters ? How did he fail that much, in his communication with the spectator ?The main actor is amazing but it doesn't matter. This is out-of-pace during 2 hours. Irrelevant flashbacks, general lack of rhythm and pacing of the action and emotional scenes.Actually this movie doesn't split anything, everything is faded the same way into this garbage aesthetic nonsense, so we have no idea whether to be scared or moved, but thats not the worst.The representation of dissociative disorder is cliché, childish, silly and ridiculous. Does he even know what is he talking about ? Cholesterol, really ? That is bio-lo-gical. Come on.Let me tell you something. I have known someone with these kinds of sickness.

James McAvoy is a genius actor. Worth every penny,"I don't understand all of the other harsh reviews on here, I thought this movie was M. Night's best since The Village or Signs. Finally a good dark thriller that keeps you guessing and doesn't have corny special effects or a lame story. This movie was extremely dark and perfectly sinister. James McAvoys acting was absolutely superb and I honestly don't think I could see his character played by anyone else. Definitely worth my time and I'm still thinking about it 2 hours after watching it so that's how I know it was a great film. Give this movie a chance, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A strong performance from McAvoy and a fairly well-constructed first two-thirds make this worthwhile, but it derails and becomes a bit silly and absurd in its final third","Three girls are kidnapped by a man with Dissociative Personality Disorder (with a total of 23 personalities). The girls try their best to escape from said individual, but little do they know the fate that awaits them when a new 24th personality is said to emerge in the very near future...In Shyamalan's latest film he throws us into the main plot of the film more-or-less straight away which in one way is good (we don't get a long and potentially dull build up prior to being thrown into the kidnapping itself) and bad because there's no development of the principal protagonists. On balance, the set-up provides more good than bad; whilst I found that I didn't care much for the protagonists as people I did care for the situation that they were caught up in which meant that I did find Split to be a fairly involving experience overall..I think one slight problem with films that explore D.I.D or any other personality disorders is that sometimes it's hard to perhaps give them the true justice that they deserve... I think that in order to make them truly compelling, terrifying and realistic the filmmakers would have to explore each personality on more than a superficial level in order to make this aspect work, but in an average 105 to 120 minute film you don't really have the sufficient time to accomplish this goal. This is perhaps one reason why films focusing on personality disorders of say two or perhaps 3 different personalities arguably work better as there is more time afforded to each personality. By attempting to cover a multitude of personalities, Shyamalan's narrative unfortunately lacks depth as we never really learn a great deal about the various personalities...Whilst Shyamalan's narrative may not be quite up to scratch thankfully the same cannot be said for his directing which here is actually superb... The isolated setting is put to good use and Shyamalan also gets one hell of a performance from James McAvoy - some of his personas are chilling whilst some of his personas show a vulnerable side to him and he's so convincing that you sometimes forget that this is all done by the same person. The film is also well-paced with plenty going on and few, if any dull moments.There are parts of the film where one of the girls is trying to manipulate one of McAvoy's weaker personas in order to effect her escape. This was an interesting part of the story and the film probably would have been stronger if this was utilised more in the film... perhaps if all 3 girls worked together in trying to achieve this or maybe if they tried playing the personalities off against each other. If you think about it I'm almost certain that this would have made the film stronger as there is already something of a power-struggle between some of the personalities which would have been exacerbated had the girls managed to manipulate the necessary personalities. For me, this would have made the film more involving and would have perhaps had me on the edge-of-my seat a bit more. However, Shyamalan seems to put most of the focus on McAvoy's personas either intimidating the girls, discussing power struggling and the 24th personality in therapy sessions or sermonising on the reasons that the girls have been chosen; these things are strong enough to make it work, but I got the feeling that a bit more effort the film could have been better.Sadly, the film does derail slightly into the absurd in its final third; in fact it becomes so silly and ridiculous that it becomes hard to take it seriously - which is odd considering the film is about an individual with D.I.D and one wonders why Shyamalan felt the need to drag the film in a silly direction given the rather serious subject matter?Still it is a pretty solid film and whilst it's not in the same league as Shyamalan's earlier films such as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable it is much better than The Visit which Shyamalan released a year earlier than this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent creepy thriller!,"I really don't get all the bad reviews for this excellent movie? This is in my opinion, one of the best performed thrillers for the last years. James McAvoy's performance is alone worth the time for this one.I don't know what the people giving this film bad reviews were expecting, maybe a flawless documentary about multiple identity disorder?

Gets Better and Better,"One needs to be a fan of James McAvoy to fully enjoy this film which I am not. I also rarely watch films so absorbed with one primary actor or ""character(s)"" but this one did win me over. First of all the film score matched up well with the scenes adding the right evocation or emotion. It got better and better as the tension increased. The acting of McAvoy is engrossing, there is no doubt about it. The first half can be at times very grating as drama because the characters keep making wrong decisions. This usually puts me off of a film but it got me back during the last 30 minutes. The story and symbolism is reminiscent of ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann which was re-made as ""Red Dragon."" Only this one by Shyamalan added quite an interesting new element which is actually supported by much literature. Some will think it borders on the esoteric but the lines are fuzzy. As far as the naysayers who invalidate MPD or DID there is very convincing data that the physical changes are immediate and not faked having been observed in many young children. The transformations are as real as spontaneous remission.My only criticism is the moral ambiguity. In the end losses come because of the superior and experienced, nuanced analysis of the sickness instead of immediate and hostile action. The losers were right about what should have been done from the very beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
SPLIT is a film that is famous for the sake of being famous,"PROS: The ending, which is the most controversial part, was still my favorite part. For some reason it left me wanting to see more, which is a very good quality to have. Through the duration of the film I was just sitting there, but the end was when I was truly at the edge of my seat. The acting was very varied throughout the film. This was aggravating because some actors did a really good job in one scene, then a crappy job in the next. There was no one actor that carried the film, and no one actor that ruined it. To sidetrack a little bit, the tension that was made in this film was very average...CONS: The part that was so upsetting was the character development. This movie had one job, and that was to make the characters have depth. I was just so ticked off throughout the film watching blank actors walk across the screen. This includes the main character, the one with multiple personalities, who was constructed with so little finesse. None of his personalities had depth nor were they explained enough for an ENTIRE film to be carried on them. Another thing was how unethically they portrayed this mental health disorder. It wasn't handled properly, and they put incorrect sciences in that had no relevance to the film whatsoever. This led to numerous amounts of plot holes. Where was never fully answered, who was never fully answered, and why was never fully answered; these are possibly the three most important questions that should probably be answered throughout the film, and nothing was answered. The final thing was how utterly pathetic the characters relationships were portrayed through the movie. It was just so incomprehensible and unrealized that I was sitting there filling in the holes of the movie during the movie. This ended up distracting me from how the film was overall, it was an OK movie.www.chorror.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very disappointing.,"Not scary or suspenseful at all. McAvoy's character was ridiculous and not the least bit frightening. In fact, I laughed through most of his performance. I almost walked out halfway through, but i wanted to give the movie a chance to get better- it didn't; in fact, it went further downhill. To call this movie horror or smart or clever, even in the slightest, is a flat-out insult to the viewer. This movie sucks- waste of time and money. The critic's seem to have viewed a completely different version and praise this movie up and down. Not only not scary, but just not a very we written and developed story line. So much potential was lost here. I'm baffled by the rave reviews of the critics, are they smoking something that might have made this an entirely different movie?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
M. Night Shyamalan's Road To Recovery Continues With Yet Another Competently Crafted Horror,"From the writer-director of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & The Visit, Split is a small-scale psychological horror that marks another right step in M. Night Shyamalan's road to recovery and finds him making skillful use of his rediscovered creativity & passion to put up a simple structured, competently crafted & morbidly humoured chiller that's dark, mysterious & wickedly amusing.The story of Split follows a trio of teenage girls who are abducted by a man diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and who has manifested a total of 23 different personalities so far. With no one to rely on but each other, the girls try to compel one of his identities to help them escape and must do so before the emergence of a far sinister & frightful 24th persona.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan whose filmmaking career has seen both soaring highs & crushing lows, Split is a more confidently executed feature from him that makes efficient use of all his trademarks, and keeps its tense vibe alive from beginning to end. The characters do lack flesh on their arcs and are thinly sketched but their predicament is still relatable to an extent.Shot majorly in a single location, the isolated setting do bring a sense of unease into the story and it is further enhanced by its smooth handling, sharp focus & controlled movements of the camera. Editing briskly paces its 117 minutes narrative, few scenes are drawn out longer than expected and its eerie tone rarely goes away. The film keeps throwing surprises throughout its runtime and few of them manage to stick.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley & Haley Lu Richardson, with McAvoy & Taylor-Joy chipping in with commendable work. Not all the 23 identities appear but McAvoy does well with whichever ones make it to the final print. Taylor-Joy is just as good if not more and the moments between the two make up for the film's best segments, plus it only gets better as plot progresses.On an overall scale, Split is a well-directed, well-scripted & well-performed horror that may not be as memorable as the finest examples of its genre or even Shyamalan's best works but it definitely ranks as one of his better directional efforts. Enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying, Split is a thrilling ride that keeps the viewers engaged in its premise from start to finish and wraps itself up with a game-changing final twist that no one saw coming. And for that alone, it's worth a watch.",,Anonymous,Horror
"dark and suspenseful, but ignore people who claim there's a twist ending","Split is possibly the most creepy and suspenseful movie of director Shymalan's career. This dark film follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities, brilliantly played by James McAvoy, whose transitions from one personality to another are seamless and who maintains a disturbed, threatening quality through all of them.The movie was, however, slightly wrecked for me because I was trying to guess the ""twist"" that some critics claim the movie has. Here's the thing to know: no one would be saying this movie had a twist if it wasn't directed by someone famous for his twists.A twist is when you are lead to believe something and then your perspective is shifted. It's something Twilight Zone did a lot.Split certainly has plot turns, some of them interesting, some rather unconvincing, but none all that surprising. This is a movie about suspense and character, not brilliant plotting. If you spend the movie, as I did, trying to figure out how Shyamalan is going to flip everything on its head, it will take you out of the movie and lead nowhere. But if you just appreciate the beautifully constructed shots and the flow of action, you'll be impressed.There is something very surprising in the last second of the movie, but it's not a plot twist because it doesn't come out of the story. Most people will have to google the ending to understand what it means.This twist distraction is not Shyamalan's fault, but that of critics determined to talk about the director in twist terms regardless of the movie. I just wanted to let people know that, as a public service, so that they can enjoy the movie without false expectations. Because it's well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit but certainly a step in the right direction,"Split is a psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring James McAvoy. While not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit, it is certainly a step in the right direction.After attending a birthday party, three girls named Casey, Marcia, and Claire are kidnapped by a mysterious man identifying himself as ""Dennis"" (James McAvoy) and are held in a prison-like basement. While trying to escape, the girls discover that ""Dennis"" is actually one of 23 distinct personalities belonging to the man in question, and is conspiring with a fellow personality to aid in the release of a frightening 24th, known only as ""The Beast"".Suspenseful and often chilling, Split feels like a much needed return to form for the once disgraced writer/director. Shyamalan successfully channels the Hitchcockian method of storytelling that was present in his early films. As one would expect, there is a twist ending but unlike Shyamalan's recent duds, this one actually works quite well. James McAvoy gives a frightening, deranged performance as a man suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and he never overacts or hams up the unhinged nature of his character. Shyamalan still has a long way to go before he fully redeems himself of his recent terrible films but if Split is anything to go with, he's definitely on the right track.I rate it 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprising,"M. Night Shymalan was said to have lost his special filmmaking touch. The famous director/screenwriter behind treasures like Signs, The Sixth Sense, and Unbroken destroyed his own career after having recently pumped out The Happening and After Earth, two movies classified as flops and atrocities in so many eyes. However, with his most recent film, Split, Shymalan has resurrected himself back into his former golden days of above-average filmmaking and has left the sour taste of The Last Airbender behind. Split revolves around Kevin Crumb, played brilliantly by James McAvoy, who suffers from a split-personality disorder and has twenty-three distinct personalities. One of Kevin's personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them hostage inside a locked area of his home. The film continuously jumps back and forth between the girls attempting to escape and Kevin confronting his therapist, Dr. Fletcher, to try and keep his disorder under control. Split is a unique, complex movie that isn't so much of a horror movie but more of a psychological thriller. Shymalan doesn't take the film too seriously, which works to his advantage as there are lots of funny moments involving the different personalities of Kevin's. Split also never leaves you bored because it constantly introduces new situations and information that keep you interested as the girls attempt to escape Kevin's house. Kevin Crumb's multiple personalities all feel distinct and creepy at times, expertly including eerie conversations that Kevin would carry on with himself and his own personalities. One of the downsides, unfortunately, that I experienced with Split were the constant flashbacks that were shown throughout the movie involving the main character's past as a toddler. The flashbacks came across as very distracting and it felt as if they kept interrupting and bringing you out of the rather well-written plot. Split, aided by one of the best performances of James McAvoy's career, is nothing short of a unique success that definitely brings M. Night Shymalan back into the movie business",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bad film with a purchased IMDb score,"Let's be honest: The film is pretty bad. I was almost laughing in parts where humour was not the film-makers intention.

Well, not much apparently when you work your way through the obviously fake reviews with some being so brazen as to repeat the exact same review a previous fake profile had already submitted.

The director also produced the film and I see it has grossed millions already. It's a great money making tactic.. you have money so you can put it into making a bad film, then invest more money in buying Metacritic scores and fake IMDb profiles to boost its ratings and create a hype around the film, ensuring enough people will see your film in order for you to turn a hefty profit.

A very gripping film,"Split is a very interesting movie. Even though some actors certainly show more experience in the business than others, all of them intertwine very smoothly to create an atmosphere of tension and fear. The story focuses on a man with multiple personalities and 3 girls that he kidnaps and holds hostage. Even though his intentions for them aren't revealed until much later in the movie, the film successfully holds the viewers attention by exploring the backstory of the man and following the attempted escape of the girls. The movie actually focuses on two stories at once; the life of the main teenage character, Casey, and the life of the man. The cinematography shines in conveying the atmosphere and overall mood of the situation. The camera rarely does jump cuts, and instead opts to focus on characters as the scene builds up tension towards an action. My only true gripes with the film are with some of it's characters. James McAvoy's character as the man steals the show and separates itself from the rest of the case, with Anya Taylor-Joy's character as a close second. The other two girls pale in comparison and the viewer will quickly fade them to the background. Some of the other characters range from decent performance, to lackluster. In conclusion, I can safely recommend Split as a rental. Even though it isn't a perfect film, it sure is a gripping one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Knowledge from actual DID,"This movie has so much thought and introspect on psychological aspect which I am so interested in from my father who had (killed himself - no pity in glad he's finally released from his demons and blessed to be mentally strong as a result so wouldn't have it any other way & he loved us).Firstly let's point on his alter ego as you will - my fathers personalities were mostly all mainly friendly and innocent but one we named ""Satan"" was something else - you could actually see his eyes cloud over and when that happened you ran for your life and jumped out of any window (luckily I was a fast runner) but also his physical strength changed - this I attribute to psychosomatic effect which is basically mind over matter - believe something so much you can show physical affections which is documented and very interesting.I love that this idea was looked at in such an insightful way and although it's a probable impossibility, it's still by far the highest possible version of super heroes and more insight behind a ""normal"" persons outlook than most would perceive - 100% props from someone who has first hand experienced such a horrible outcome.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting; McAvoy Stupendous; Sometimes Unremarkable,"Heralded by many as a return to form for polarising director M. Night Shyamalan, Split tells the fascinating story of a man, played by an astounding James McAvoy, who has 23 completely distinct personalities - each with different ages, genders, and characteristics - fighting for control of his body. Some of these personalities conspire to kidnap three teenage girls for mysterious and nefarious purposes, making a film which is as much a psychological abduction thriller as it is a creepy Shyamalan horror as it is a character study of McAvoy's Kevin and his split personalities.Split has received a divided response, with many citing controversy around its seemingly ham-fisted portrayal of mental illness. However, upon watching the film, it soon becomes clear that this is not a scaremongering horror story of the mentally ill who could be living among us, but instead a low-key sci-fi much like Shyamalan's 2000 film Unbreakable, with McAvoy's condition being treated as more of a supernatural ability. It ultimately translates into a film which, without the hype surrounding its release, would be seen as a largely unremarkable if interestingly watchable horror-thriller piece.The main draw of the guild is undoubtedly James McAvoy. In a performance which tops not only his already glittering career, but also many of the best performances of 2016. It is even Oscar-worthy, not that that is necessarily a good indicator of quality. It is a fantastic mark of the man's talents under the role's stress, given the frequency with which he has to switch between hugely varied parts. His versatility makes it akin to seeing several different actors on screen, but it is all him. He manages to carry the entire film on his shoulders whilst simultaneously stealing each of his scenes, providing an endless source of massively interesting characters, creating sympathy for the character, and even sprinkling some black comedy into the mix. A near flawless performance overall.The rest of the film does not reach quite the same heights but is nevertheless decent and worth watching. The horror elements are handled very well, without too many jump scares, and although it is not designed to frighten for the most part, it certainly succeeds at several times as tensions mount, mysteries unfold, and we find out more about Kevin and Casey, the most-developed of the abductees.There are certainly other portions of the film which are highly commendable: the two central characters are well fleshed-out (though some of Casey's backstory feels at times somewhat unnecessary and tacked-on), for example. McAvoy performs with a well-judged moral greyness that leaves you rooting for both Kevin and Casey, whilst the story makes for an interesting tale that continues to surprise and entertain.However, ultimately too much of the film is just rote and unoriginal. Admittedly it's hard in the current cinematic climate to make anything original but certain parts of Split feel too uninspired and lazy, especially some of the plot points and dialogue - notably, discussions of Kevin's ""abilities"" sometimes serve to induce a small eye-roll. Finally, it sometimes feels far too self- indulgent on Shyamalan's part. Ignoring his jarring obligatory cameo, there is a certain reveal which, without spoiling anything, will be obvious to any Shyamalan fan, that just feels far too dumb and unnecessary, though it could be interesting to develop if there is a sequel.This doesn't make it a bad film - far from it. It's definitely worth watching, though maybe doesn't warrant the level of debate it has garnered. Watch Split for the unmissable McAvoy performance, and try not to expect anything too mind-blowing, and you'll probably enjoy. A solid 72/100.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simple, yet great plot. Amazing acting from James McAvoy.","Split has been a film I had been anticipating to watch for an extremely long time. The trailer was made fantastically, completely capturing it's viewers with it's filming and plot. After watching the film, I must say I was not disappointed in the least. Although I believe the ending could have been done better, James McAvoy's sensational acting was great enough to excuse it. He completely captured all the personalities wonderfully from playing a 9 year old child to a woman. I'd imagine it to be difficult for an actor to portray one character perfectly but McAvoy exceeded all expectations with his phenomenal performance in this film. The slight changes in body language, facial expressions, and voice all conveyed a different character and truly made me believe he was each of his characters while on screen. Definitely not a horror film which you need to look away during the scary scenes but one which captivates your attention with the thrilling suspense and psychological aspect of the film. Simply because of the ending I would give this movie an 8.5 but since you can't do that on IMDb, I believe McAvoy's acting definitely brings it up to a 9. Split was an overall amazing film.

A Must-Avoid!,"This movie is just plain awful! I went to see hoping that it would be an intense thriller, however it was anything but that. It started off well initially but then turned into a slow, boring and drawn-out movie without substance. The worst part of this movie was its ending.I have never been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan but I thought this movie would be different given the fact that it is advertised as a thriller. I completely regret wasting 2 hours of my life and money on this pathetic movie and I would really like others to save their time and money. DO NOT be fooled but the intense trailers for this movie. I repeat, DO NOT be fooled but the intense trailers for this movie. Also DO NOT be fooled by the positive reviews on this site because you will regret watching this movie at the theater.

Just split.,"First of all McAvoy and Anya Joy make this film brighter. Identity disorder is long-known disease that used by movie makers quite often, directly or indirectly, they do it. This is always between crazyness and not fully understanding, so there are many questions to speculate about. And one of them is Does an individual just imitates the multi- personality or it really split, by meaning that.Childhood is the course that makes our further ways for living. Once it affects you - and it is going to come out sometime later. And here people make decisions where to stop it by committing suicide or moving on and exacerbating the situation. If second one has been chosen the limit depends on the accumulated pain and eagerness to dull it. But sometimes it comes beyond the expectations and here we go...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant idea and Riveting performance,"Unlocking the potential of our complex mind and understanding the fact is what the movie is all about. Brilliant idea and concept by M Night Shyamalan, and riveting performance by James McAvoy made the movie much watchable. Night knows the magic of silence and quietness in the movie just make us wonder whats the next thing. Acting as 23 different persons even for a short periods is such a big task, James nailed it. A little more Horror and thrill in the movie would have been wonders. Still a good watchable movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overrated and is Ultimately Tiresome, Unfulfilled, & Unsatisying","The Director has always had a Keen Eye and His Films Look Great.In this Psychological Thriller, Ditto.

With any luck this tour-de-force will get Oscar buzz for McAvoy a year from now,"It shouldn't come as a surprise that M Night Shyamalan continues to make films. Regardless of critical opinion, he somehow manages to build an impressive box office draw no matter how unimpressive his films turn out to be. In 1999 when he debuted with 'The Sixth Sense' there were people who said he would be the next Steven Spielberg. Looking back at that idea, there have got to be some pretty significant people rolling over in their graves to think that such a comparison was ever made. Regardless of my thoughts, and regardless of past works, it must be said that 'Split,' as silly as it is, still works on many levels as an intriguing thriller.The movie begins with the kidnap of 3 girls (Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula, and Anya Taylor-Joy) from a parking lot in broad daylight. When they wake up in a windowless room, they soon begin to see the danger of their situation. Not only are they being held by a man (James McAvoy) with vague intentions, but he displays one of many personalities; some helpful and some dangerous. The chances of escape are slim.Right away, we have a flawed concept. We identify the hero of the story, the shy girl named Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who also appeared in 'The Witch' earlier in the year). Through endless flashbacks we see her tortured childhood, scene after scene of a small girl and her deranged uncle. Shyamalan attempts to draw sympathy with Casey and leaves the other two girls as little more than props with no clear character or motivation. Why have 3 girls at all? Kevin, as we learn the real kidnapper's name is, is in constant communication with his psychiatrist Dr Karen Fletcher who treats his split-personality disorder as though she is diagnosing a witch in the 16th Century.There's a novelty that comes with the film and Kevin's personalities, and it's with a surprising amount of conviction that McAvoy pulls off a difficult task: making us believe him regardless of the silly script and silly words they speak. We learn he has 23 personalities (ranging from a sort of kinky nun named Patricia to a small boy named Hedwig) that come in and out and communicate to the kidnapped girls through locked door. Hedwig is a fan of Kanye West and is curious about kissing girls. Another personality named Dennis has obsessive-compulsive disorder and keeps a close eye on the cleanliness of the bathroom.Yes it's Shyamalan so there is a twist of sorts. Whether or not you buy the ending is up to you. It comes in the final moments of the movie as patrons of a diner watch the news and react to the idea of a man living with multiple personalities. In the theater I saw it, most people didn't understand what happened. I don't blame them. The twist requires an audience's prior knowledge and history of the director's films. It's a preposterous setup and makes little sense in the context of the film, and yet die-hard fans will say they are now excited to see what M Night Shyamalan does next. That's a twist in itself.I can only praise the film for McAvoy's performance, which is unbelievably clever and worked out. The movie overall is a rough cut of something that could have been much more effective, perhaps with a different director or a tighter screenplay. When we see McAvoy on screen, it's almost makes up for all the other issues. When he's absent, the story falls apart. If that's not great acting I don't know what is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
M. Night is back!,"I've been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan ever since I saw The Sixth Sense (1999), though I must admit that his last couple films haven't been good. Split changes that.The story of a man with 23 different personalities living inside him, with the 24th, known as The Beast soon emerging. The idea is original when everything coming out of Hollywood is a repeat. The writing, dialogue and camera work are all done with such precision. M. Night has an eye for camera angles and this is the best it has ever been. The acting from all players were top notch, but the stand out is from James McAvoy, who plays each personalty perfectly. He was creepy and chilling and why he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.Of course, what is an M. Night movie without a twist. There are actually to in this one, but the biggest twist is the last 30 seconds, and I wont spoil it, but If you've watched M. Night's movies, this one will leave you speechless. It actually gave me chills.I honestly have nothing negative to say about this movie. This is M. Night back at the top of his game and I can't wait to see what he does next.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dreaded this movie, but it was unexpectedly good.","I dread M Knight movies anymore, as I have the opinion the scripts always feel as if they were written by a thirteen year old kid. While that still holds true for me (super powers, vengeful trees, space aliens thwarted by h20 etc.) I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie. Despite the stretch of imagination required for some plot points in this movie (not as far reaching as some others in the past have been) I did legitimately like the movie, and I believe it was because of McAvoy's immense talent.James McAvoy could easily have slipped into a campy portrayal that had a strong potential in this script. He did not. I felt he was believable, and placed a superb premium on professional effort that was apparent to the viewer from the beginning.Any other actor, and I do not believe this movie would have worked.If you, like me, would have passed on another M Knight foray... rethink that choice and give this movie a try. I do not think you will regret it (despite the ending... I was satisfied with the stories ending and not the (I feel) tacked on final scene).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

M. Night Shyamalan is back on form,"I'll just start by saying I loved this film.For me M. Night Shyamalan has been disappointing for a long time, I loved Sixth Sense, I loved Unbreakable(very underrated film I think), then the rest of his films were all just big disappointments up until The Visit which I personally found very engaging and now we have Split which is definitely his best film since Unbreakable.Split is the story of three girls being kidnapped and held by a man(portrayed brilliantly by James McAvoy) with split personalities.I don't want to go into the story but it is very good and tense the directing is good too but for me the stand out in this film is James McAvoy. His acting in this film is incredible. He plays a man with 23 distinct personalities including women and a child. I think we see him portray nine on screen and he plays them all so differently with different mannerisms, facial expressions and speech patterns. I was very impressed with him.I don't think I have any complaints with the film, overall I thought it was excellent and the ending made me very excited too. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The 2 side characters not the best but not terrible. Their face expression should look like their terrified, but they look like their confused. The music was good. The camera movement was good.

McAvoy steals the show,"Split is a psychological thriller about a man named kevin who suffers from DID and has 23 personalities. One of these many personalities kidnaps three girls and takes them to an unknown location where they must figure out how to survive and what is it that kevin exactly wants with them. Soon Kevins therapist of many years notices some differences in her patient and begins to investigate and stop what may take kevin back from all his progress he has had with her. she thought she knew all there was to know about kevin but she just may learn something newThis movie definitely surprised me and for me gave me a very good viewing of what this director has in regards to talent. I have not seen many of his Classic films but i have heard a ton about all his movies and their ""twists"". I was enthralled by this movie from start to finish. Shyamalan captured this movie in a brilliant way that allowed his audience to delve in the depths of the movie and understand with their own minds what is really going on. there are exposition scenes throughout but none so heavy that weigh the movie down and bore you. I was very interested in the DID concept of the movie and also the therapists stand on DID and how it plays into the movies end. The movie also had some great humor that did not drain from the mood at all. one moment you could be laughing and then at the next, the very thing you were laughing at suddenly is haunting. Fantastic. As for the twist, I did not find it amazing and i felt like their was no other way for the movie to go but i still enjoyed it none the less.This movie is captured beautifully and you can definitely feel the grittiness of the thriller in many shots. beautiful camera work.As for the acting, Number 1, if you have no desire to see the movie then just go see it for the sake of McAvoy. He is phenomenal in every second that he is on the screen. His ability to give life to these personalities is amazing especially because each one of his personalities that makes it on screen appears to be their own BEING. i found myself trying to decipher which personality it was and after the first half of the movie knowing clearly which person he was. even with his scenes where he talks to himself it feels like there honestly are multiple people having a conversation and he doesn't look weird doing it. His performance is so believable and i loved every personality that was on screen. Anya Taylor-Joy was also very into her character and always left me satisfied with her character. her character ark was of much interest to me as well and did not disappoint.Only thing i did not enjoy about the movie was i felt that the other two girls that were kidnapped were extremely annoying but besides that the movie is visually great, acting is top notch, direction is once again back on top from his streak of not so enjoyable movies.Shyamalan is back and it looks like he is coming with a storm.

The Return of MNS,"It's finally happened. M Night Shyamalan has returned to form after being dismissed as a has-been,following several mistakes like After Earth,The Last Airbender and The Happening. He's made an incredibly enjoyable thriller with a very limited budget. James McAvoy is fascinating in a tour-de-force performance,bringing to life a character with 23 distinct personalities,and a soon-to-be-unleashed 24th. The film has a very good tone and flow,with nail-biting tension that really gives us a throwback to the start of Shyamalan's career. I hope he keeps it up in his next film too. He's never been as good with the ending as he has with the incredible setup,and this one suffers from that too,but in the end,there are a lot of positive factors that make thus a memorable experience. The uncredited cameo at the very end is jaw-dropping,and highlights the possibility of a sequel. I can't help but think that film could be a good one too.

Not quite as good as Shyamalan's classic earlier work.,"'SPLIT': Four Stars (Out of Five)M. Night Shyamalan's new horror flick, about a man with DID (dissociative identity disorder) who kidnaps three young women and terrorizes them. Shyamalan wrote and directed the movie (on a budget of just $10 million) and it stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy (who also co-starred in 'THE WITCH' and 'MORGAN'), Betty Buckley, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a huge hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as well.Three teenage girls are kidnapped, in broad daylight, while leaving a birthday party. Their captor is a man named Kevin (McAvoy), who also has 23 different personalities. Kevin locks the girls in a room, beneath a zoo, and continues to terrorize them; while demonstrating several different personalities. At the same time a psychologist, named Dr. Karen Fletcher (Buckley), tries to help Kevin. The doctor learns that Kevin is more than just a danger to himself, while the girls desperately try to escape him.Shyamalan used to be one of my favorite directors. I haven't been too impressed with his recent films, like many others, but this is definitely a well made movie. McAvoy is great in the lead, and I'm sure he had a lot of fun with the role. The film is both suspenseful and involving. There's also a great twist at the end, especially for fans of Shyamalan, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker does next. It's not quite as good as his classic earlier work, but it is definitely an effectively well made thriller.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"For two hours, you will forget how to breathe","Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy as this man with 23 personalities who kidnaps these young girls and they try to escape. Shyamalan's career is quite a story. With his first few movies (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable""...), he was hailed as the new Spielberg and had a bright future. Then, all of the sudden, he starts releasing some bad, bad movies (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""...). Then he redeemed himself with 2015's The Visit which was quite a refreshing thing for the found footage genre and it took everyone by surprise. That gave a bit more hope for this one when it was getting released. And now we can finally safely say that Shyamalan is back on track!I've always liked Shyamalan as a director. He had some horrible movies, but still, he was one of the only ones who mostly had original stories and ideas with movies and that alone makes me respect him. I expected this to be good, but it took me off guards. It's his best since ""The Sixth Sense"" and I'd even go as far to say that it's even better. It has a small opening scene and then it throws you straight into action to assure that you're following. Then, after that, you get to know the backstories and characters little by little. And each new reveal, pumps up the anxiety of this film. From the first few minutes, Shyamalan assures that he has our attention and the feeling of uneasiness grows throughout the movie. Visually, the film looks beautiful and cinematography is fantastic. But even though everything impressed me about this film, there's one more particular thing that blew me away and that's James McAvoy. He has to get recognition on the next awards season. It would be a crime if he got snubbed. Let's just hope he doesn't get overshadowed by someone who got a certain accent right or who perfectly portrayed a mental breakdown in one scene because McAvoy does it all here. He was incredible and boosted up the creepiness in some scenes. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, but all of them are overshadowed by McAvoy. And also, you might know Shyamalan is known for twist endings. Trust me, you WON'T see this one coming.I have no flaws with this film. I loved absolutely everything about it. It's for now my favorite movie of 2017 and it's likely to stay that way. But, you never know.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"female acting was sub par, if you didn't see unbreakable you will not understand the ending, shymalan returns","spoilers lmaoif you haven't seen unbreakable, you will not understand the ending, or the direction of the franchise and future films. some of my major gripes with the movie were its sub par female acting roles, filled by what i would consider low budget newbie actresses, although i can understand why shymalan went that route because he had to pay bruce willis and james mccavoy a big chunk, thus leaving little to be ""split"" among the rest of the mediocre cast. another one of my major gripes with this movie is how it was marketed. it was more marketed as a standalone, rather than a sequel, which is 100% is. in understand that was probably to built up suspense to the climactic finish, but most people in the theater when i went to watch split didn't understand the ending at all, and were just ready to do be done with the movie by the time the girl was discovered underneath the zoo. however, overall, i think this movie had a good premise, and it translated nicely to the big screen, putting shymalan in a brighter light than previous movies portrayed his style.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Disappointed,"Not a fan of The director since Unbreakable. It was slightly above average but no whee near the quality of The Sixth Sense. I don't know why I keep watching his movies, probably hoping one will be the same extraordinary quality. With all the pre-release buzz I thought this was finally that movie.I was so disappointed. I rated it slightly lower than Unbreakable. I don't know exactly where it where it went off the rails, but it never held my attention (and I'm not ADHD- I sit though three hours of a good bio pic.A good part of this was the girls trying asinine ways to escape; at other time we see McAvoy play several personalities half heartily. After all the award talk I expected a much better and diverse McAvoy. Sadly, just like the majority of Night's films he has his actors perform methodically. It actually felt McAlvoy was pushing his talents against the brick wall of what the director wanted.He wasn't the only actor who underplayed the role. So did the doctor and the three teenage girls. First, after all these late night calls for extra appointment why didn't she get upset earlier or pull a personality up (which she has stated she can do) to discover the emergency instead of A casual bye--you-leave when another dominant personality shows up to the appointment.I rate this in the same category of Nights's films except the quality Sisth Sense and Devil, which he did not direct and only wrote the original story,As for,the ending, I felt it was a cheap shot. If the point was they are in the same time, the message came across far too,strong. If it is a hint to an Unbreakable 2 I'll pass and see another big screen feature.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An unrelenting thriller,"M. Night Shyamalan has had a very interesting directorial career to date. His films range from the wonderfully chilling The Sixth Sense to the woefully dreadful The Happening. His cannon is certainly a mixed bag but for me there is enough creativity and inspiration amongst his eclectic range of films to approach any new title he releases with an open mind. His latest venture Split boasts an interesting concept and a leading man who I consider to be one of the finest actors in his generation; James McAvoy. As a result I was cautiously optimistic when I sat down in the cinema last week and I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed.Split follows three young women who are kidnapped by McAvoy's character and locked in a mysterious basement. This is not your standard slasher/torture horror movie however as it quickly becomes apparent that MacAvoy's character has been diagnosed with 23 distinct 'split' personalities. Some of the personas sympathise with the female victims whereas others are not so accommodating. Up until the kidnapping this title suggests that McAvoy's character has successfully integrated into society but something has gone horribly wrong in his head and the evil personas within him have taken over his actions. The choice of victims here and the claustrophobic nature of the captivity ensure that you will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Interestingly although the sympathetic personas that McAvoy embodies may break the tension at times you begin to feel empathy towards his portrayal of a villain as a result.To just focus on the talents of the Director or the strength of the story line for this review would completely miss the main attraction of the title. James McAvoy once again provides a towering performance as Dennis, Hedwig, Crum, Patricia...OK so there are too many to list here but you get the point!Many actors have attempted to play multiple characters in titles with varying degrees of success. Alec Guinness is a classic example of an actor who could embody anyone he wished (see Kind Hearts and Coronets for example). Eddie Murphy is a more recent example of an actor who likes to play versions of himself but his movies have descended into the dreadfully self indulgent Norbit. The primary difference with both of these actors however is that they rely heavily on costume and prosthetics to embody another character. What is so impressive about McAvoy's performance here is that he is able to embody a range of different personas without the use of extensive costumes or make-up. In fact his appearance is deliberately neutral as he has a shaved head so he has to rely solely on facial, bodily and voice expression.We won't see McAvoy on the podium holding an Oscar this year as he hasn't even been nominated for the best actor category (which is bizarre but that's another discussion altogether) but if he keeps putting in performances like this his talents will surely be widely recognised amongst the critical establishment. For now he can take a lot of comfort from the fact that Split has been a huge box office success so clearly his fans recognise his talents even if the Academy elite do not.Split is an unrelenting thriller that will get your blood pumping for the entirety of its screen time and it certainly represents a return to form for Shyamalan. Let's hope he can keep up this quality of work.see more at:http://thereeltruth1.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mostly great,"I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. I probably would have given it a 9 before I saw the ending. For the most part, it's a superb psychological thriller. The suspense is great. The lead actors and even the supporting actors (such as the other 2 teenage girls) are brilliant.That ending though...The movie spends a lot of time as a thriller. Toward the end we get some sort of supernatural elements creeping in. A little jarring but it was done well enough.Then at the end though there's a brief moment when the film's title appears on the screen before another 2 or 3 minutes of story are added before the credits. I would have been quite happy to stop watching it before those last couple of minutes.I'm think I know what the director was trying for with that ending but it was poorly executed and completely unnecessary. If you haven't seen it, my advice is to stop watching it when that title comes up and skip those last couple of minutes. It tainted what was otherwise a superb film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I would not categorize it as a thriller/horror only though - it has a pretty massive SCI-FI influence for me, especially the ending, but not just that.Acting is perfect from James McAvoy, but then again I've been a fan of his for ages. Anya Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing, what a remarkable young lady.It's the kind of movie with the kind of ending that screams for a sequеl.

"Shyamafans will love it, haters gonna hate it & non-fans will miss the point.","M. Night Shyamalan has fast become one of those Marmite directors, dividing people into two camps of love him/hate him. Myself being a big fan of his earlier films like Unbreakable and Signs, yet I could appreciate the criticism The Sixth Sense received from people who figured it out. But what I really like about Shyamalan work is his love for his art, his passion reminding myself very much of my own. He's a fanboy who watched films as a child and wanted to do nothing else but make movies, and that admiration and influences can be clearly seen. So regardless whether you like his films or not, no one can question his dedication and the fact he is a very good, and well respected filmmaker. Yes, some of his recently catalogue is questionable with films like The Last Airbender, The Happening and After Earth, but still his understanding and use of the moving image has always be exceptional. I have yet to watch The Visit.This time round, he could safely hide behind the outstanding performance of James McAvoy's multiple characters causing quite the stir among critics and viewers alike, you could almost forget you're watching a Shyamalan film until the very end, which might be lost on audiences not familiar with his films. It is interesting to know that Joaquin Phoenix was originally casted to play the multitude of characters, especially seeing the viewers reactions to McAvoy's impressive range. Makes anyone wonder how this portrayal might have been with Phoenix instead.The film is about McAvoy's team of personalities, that abduct three teenage girls and hold them captive for reasons unclear. We get to meet a few of McAvoy's 23 characters each with their own agendas, mannerisms and behaviours. There's inner conflict and potential betrayal, some characters being under ""house"" arrest simply for not agreeing with the other personalities. It's truly astonishing to watch McAvoy and I don't think I could ever watch him again the same way.It's good to see Anya Taylor-Joy so soon after Morgan and The Witch, wondering if she's go for something completely different like her co-star Haley Lu Richardson, who in last year's Edge Of Seventeen. It's Jessica Sula that doesn't quite sell it for me. Taylor-Joy is brilliant as the introverted, unpopular girl with something to hide. Betty Buckley reunites with Shyamalan and plays a superb Doctor who is possibly the closest thing McAvoy has as a friend, and instead of treating him, she's mostly encouraging him to explore his personalities.I think Shyamalan missed a trick and I know audiences would be demanding answers if I did it my way, but maybe we would be better not knowing what happens to the girls, though the full reasons as to why is left totally unexplained. But instead of what I consider a cheap shot, I think a more intriguing hint would have been more effective.West Dylan Thordson replaces Shyamalan's regular composer James Newton Howard and gives us something quite sinister and very different. Different, probably to try to emphasise the various characters of McAvoy, but the score does cover a board range, the looming, low hums being what I remember most.Shyamalan has stated this to be his most challenging and longest film to date, and while it shows McAvoy's amazing talent, I wouldn't place this as this finest, it's not anticlimactic, but I was excepting something, stronger? More horrifying than what was presented.

Unfortunately, James McAvoy was the worst part of the movie. He did over-acting up to the point that it became annoying. He tried way too hard to portray the roles. The way he tried to be Hedwig and Barry was too much over-acting and looked very fake. James McAvoy has no clue how to act like a 9 year old child that Hedwig was supposed to be. He does it too stereotypical and too over-the-top. The female roles in the movie had to compensate for the lack of acting talent of James McAvoy. Luckily, the actresses were so good that it ended up being a good movie. The story wasn't the problem, because it was good. The main problem was the choice to cast a very unskilled actor, James McAvoy. His bad acting ruined the movie, but the excellent story and good actresses made it worth watching.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of my favs,"I am a a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan. Well, more acurately my feelings towards him is digital. I either give his moves 0 stars or 10. Nothing in between. This is a 10-er. This is the 3rd time I have watched it. I watched it in preperation of Glass. His story telling is slow and maticulous, with acting that is out of the park. I LOVE this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

7/10 You always hope for another 6th sense but ...,"Unfortunately this isn't one but its better than 99% of M Night Shyamalan's follow ups. Danny Boyle said your first film is always your best and with the MNS that's always been the case but we all hope he can replicate it.Many of the reviews contain spoilers on here which is the last thing you need for a suspense thriller so I'll just concentrate on the acting .A lot has been written about James McAvoy and he undoubtedly portrayed someone with DiD very well but for me the star of the show was Anya Taylor Joy her portrayal of Casey was superb and key to the whole plot , that and the taxi driver will have you questioning what you've seen after though you won't realise at the time and to avoid spoilers I won't explain why . That's what makes a great MNS film its the bits you just don't see coming , it cerebral horror not gruesome graphic gore. Having said that there were elements of the film that reminded me of Hostel with a touch of Psycho.Is it worth seeing ? Yes ,is it as good as Sixth sense ? NoIs it better than most of M Nights other films ? Yes .Don't go with high expectations and you'll definitely enjoy it. Great cameo right at the very end to look forward to too .This film only cost $10m and will make ten times that at the box office here's hoping his next outing is even better now he's bankable again.Pad.A 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Think Shyamalan May Be Back!,"In many ways, this is a return to Shyamalan's classic films. It puts its emphasis on characters and atmosphere. Instead of being a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller. It builds its atmosphere, and uses it as a weapon to toy with the characters. It employs a subtlety that Shyamalan has lost in some of his latter films. It's a show-don't-tell mindset that allows James McAvoy to shine as his character. McAvoy is absolutely brilliant in this movie. He turns in probably one of the best performances of his career. He completely transforms himself for each personality, really taking on an entirely new character. There are some overt differences between personalities, and then there are some subtle ones. Throughout most of the film, I wasn't seeing McAvoy. I was seeing Hedwig, or Barry, or Patricia. He cultivated these personalities so well and so independently, that you only saw those characters, and not McAvoy. It's hard enough for an actor to lose themselves in one character, let alone close to two dozen. I think Shyamalan and McAvoy share ownership for the brilliance of the performance. McAvoy delivered on his end, and Shyamalan clearly guided him towards the finish line...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
watch it,"The acting really makes this movie. Much more so than the story itself. Granted the actors do have quite a good story to work with. Featuring 3 younger girls. 2 of them I barely remember. I don't know their actual names, or their character names and honestly don't care to. They were just there, and were so far out-shined by the other actors. The movie at times was very tense. It's pretty straight forward. No mystery to try to figure out. Not a lot of gore. Would not call this a horror movie. I would place it in the thriller genre. Not sure what genre it is actually being categorized as. M. Night really did good with this one. Even if you typically don't care for his movies I would still give this one a go. The last time I seen one of his films in theatres was The Village, so I did go in with a lot of hesitancy, but he proved that like anyone else, sometimes he does bad work, and sometimes he really gets it right. I daresay this will probably make my top 10 of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
SPLIT - James McAvoy's Finest!,"When I first saw McAvoy in the movie Wanted, I pegged him as just one of the plethora of actors who come and go and you don't even remember their face after some time. After about a year, I watched Atonement. I was surprised because the actor who I saw on the screen was no rookie, and before that, I was seldom wrong about such thing. So, I started looking for all the movies starring James McAvoy. In my quest, I found Filth and Trance, after which I became a die hard fan. He carries every one of his performance with a finesse which could pull up the entire movie by itself.So naturally, I was very excited about Split. One other reason was M. Night Shyamalan in whom I had faith even after watching The Visit. So, I went to the theater yesterday. First-day first show in Pune, India, about a month after its release in the US. There were 7 silhouettes I could see in the hall and I was afraid they would cancel the show, but I was wrong, fortunately.Let me tell you something about Split. It is not meant for a mass audience. The film is about a man named Kevin who has 23 different personalities and a 24th is about to come out. He kidnaps 3 girls for some sort of ritual to be performed before the 24th personality arrived. Some of the personalities are dominant and are eagerly waiting for the 'Beast', the 24th entity. The girls have to escape somehow before they become the victim of the beast. Also, apart from these 24 Kevins and the 3 girls, there was also Betty Buckley portraying Kevin's psychiatrist.I have to say the movie left me speechless, especially the second half. It took advantage of the silence so very well that we had to refrain ourselves from taking our eyes away from the screen because it felt like anytime the movie is going to throw something awesome on our face. The main story line is in perfect blend with the past story of Casey, played by Anya Taylor Joy who did an amazing job by the way.But, McAvoy stole the show. He played every one of his personalities so very well that in some of the scenes, he won't even speak a word but you will know from his body language what character he is in at that moment. In the second half, when the movie picked up a pace, you can hear a trace of a slur in his voice and then he would be a totally different person, with a different voice, accent, and behavior. My favorite out of the 24 was Hedwig, a 9-year-old child, who McAvoy portrayed with all the innocence he could bring up in his eyes. But that is the thing, there is this one personality which you would hate to love and there is this other one you would love to hate. Such a character can only come alive on screen if played by the finest actors we know.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shyamalan is getting his groove back.,"Reminiscent of a time when M. Night Shyamalan was on top of the world comes Spilt, a film that's a great combo of dark, disrupted and humorous.James McAvoy plays a man with 23 personalities, but the movie only has room for 4 of the darkest personalizes that kidnap three teenage girls to implement a plan to lore in a new personality that will put them all on a new level.I wish I could say more, but it's one of theses situations where you don't have to be a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan just remember when his movies were top notch (You know before his head got too swollen with the village) In order to be real excited about the overall plot, an overall concept that's catered to Shyamalan's universe.But even without his well known twist, Split was a stunning movie that relied on the power of McAvoy's great acting. Well worth seeing just to watch him go back and forth between these people.It's a well trigger exciting moment at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
M. Night Shyamalan's one big step in the right direction,"M. Night Shyamalan is back! No, not the The Happening-Lady in the Water-The Last Airbender-After Earth toxic one. It's the Unbreakable-Signs-The Sixth Sense celebrated one. I wouldn't say Split is as great as his earlier films, but I can safely attest he has taken a giant step in the right direction.Split is a psychological thriller built on a ""what if"" - what if a man with 23 personalities kidnaps three young girls and a 24th personality threatens to appear in the looming horizon. How will the game be played with the 24th? Will anyone survive?Shyamalan's films always adhere to an over-used template in which the final twist of the knife is the whole selling point and he draws compelling characters and builds a grounded story to encompass it. If the film works, especially his early ones, the twist is the most memorable aspect that is seared into your brain. In his successful films, the twists always feel earned. With Split, Shyamalan doesn't quite tread the same path (some of you may think the final scene has a OMG-WTF twist, but I see it more as a clever coda with a link to an earlier film). The conceit of movies involving characters with multiple personality disorder is that the revelation of the mental illness is the eventual twist, with movies like Psycho (1960), Dressed to Kill (1980) and Identity (2003) coming to mind. Split wisely stayed clear of the well-trodden path and is able to give us a different type of monstrosity, holding my attention throughout.All would be naught if not for James McAvoy's tour de force performance to sell the premise. He plays all his roles with chilling finesse. With a variance to his voice, mannerisms, facial expressions and body language, he sold every character with aplomb and then some. As I typed this out, 9-year-old Hedwig and matronly Patricia still send shivers down my spine. The three girls also gave excellent performances and their character traits efficiently differentiated for interesting group dynamics to happen in some kind of evil lair. But we are clearly persuaded to follow Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) whom I last saw in the outstanding The Witch (2015). In clever flashbacks we are given crucial context of how Casey's mind ticks and how she stands the best chance of escaping this terrifying ordeal. But will she? Finally, there is Betty Buckley who is sympathetic as the psychiatrist, but being a professional in her field some of her actions beg for scrutiny. Some of her expositional dialogue also drags the movie down at some spots.The tension is neatly build up to a feverish climax with a whole suite of cinematic tricks thrown in for good measure. I was perched on my seat as the story closes on an impactful soul-searching note. It was a very satisfying ending for this reviewer with his wifey in equal agreement. Then, if that's not good enough, trust Shyamalan to lay one final moment on you that will make your jaw hang open in a mixture of geeky joy and pure shock. Oh yeah... make it happen pleaseeeeeee!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Vidiot Reviews...,"SplitEntering your online dating personality profile takes forever when you have multiple personalities.That must be the reason the schizoid in this thriller kidnaps his matches.Three teenage girls (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula) are adducted by 1 of the 23 personalities belonging to dissociative identity disorder patient Kevin (James McAvoy).While in his captivity the girls become acquainted with Kevin's other personas, including a female and a child who the girls manipulate for their freedom. The one disposition they haven't encountered happens to be the most dangerous: a super-human intent on purging humanity.Although the concept and characters can get absurd, this M. Night Shyamalan feature does find the once lauded director finding his footing again.

"Nicolas pesce('eyes of my mother'),up & coming M.Night shyamalan","yes, this excellent McAvoy movie comes in the wake of 'eyes of my Mother', but multiplied by 10. I would think that the title 'SPLIT' infers 'split personality', as in schizophrenia(most of the inmates at Atascadero Prison for the criminally Insane, Atascadero, California),but it actually refers to DID, & other types of mental disorders(petit & grand mal seizures?);however, unlike DID, or petit mal, schizophrenia is not only a mental disorder, it is a confirmed genetic illness, ie, blond parents, their offspring will also have blond hair? Which is why I do not think DID is as dangerous as depicted in this movie; but I agree w/ Shyamalan, that both DID & schizophrenia also highlight the incredible intelligence of these victims of these disorders?(the business of DID altering the physical chemistry of the body is a bunch of Hollywood artistic license hoo- hah, though..)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bizarre and Oddly Disturbing Psychological Thriller,"Following from his 2015 soft comeback film 'The Visit,' director M. Night Shyamalan's next suspenseful thriller titled 'Split' was already an intrigue with the plot centering around James McAvoy's character having an unusual personality disorder. This had me jumping back to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho, but unlike Anthony Perkins' unhinged Norman Bates with his one ""Mother"" persona, McAvoy's Kevin Crumb has twenty-three personas in his complex mind that you'd never know when his normal self is there or not (or anything that is ""normal"" for that matter).A psychologist named Dr. Fletcher is trying to learn more about what makes Kevin transition from one personality to the next, but with each one that emerges, it grows even more bizarre since each one has the mindset of a nine-year-old boy, an unknown woman, or a kidnapper named ""Dennis."" It becomes increasingly ambiguous that Fletcher decides to investigate into what each personality had done in life with the help of one of his captives, a young girl named Casey.For this to what could possibly be Shyamalan's next splendid follow-up, I say this is one of his long-awaited return to form. For Split, the way he tries to capture McAvoy's unpredictable notions on camera makes it feel more terrifying every time we try to comprehend each personality carefully. I did get lost in some parts of the film, but knowing McAvoy's past roles in other movies, I always pondered that a few of these personalities might as well be indirectly mirroring some of McAvoy's previous movie roles.It became a psychological thrill ride that my mentality was put to the test and keeping up in some parts proved tricky, but careful observation. The twist ending (which I won't spoil) was uniquely different from the other plot twists Shyamalan had done in his previous projects. This one in particular would be one I found to be very jarring in my opinion (I know, since a few in the audience were quietly deducing a connection). Well played, sir.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting and Intriguing Film,"Though Shyamalan's last few films may have been quite terrible, this film is actually quite good.James McAvoy's performance is excellent, and Anya Taylor-Joy's performance was quite nice as well. The two other main girls weren't the greatest, but it wasn't bad enough to where they deserve eye- rolls.The main protagonist (Casey) got a good amount of character development, that I found to be pretty good.The plot of the film is pretty intriguing, and I found myself greatly enjoying it. However, this movie is definitely not for everyone. Some will like it, some won't.I personally think that before seeing this film, know the ending. If you don't really know the ending before seeing it, the ending could be upsetting or confusing.Also, towards the ending, it slowly went downhill in overall tone. It personally just felt like it was getting lazier, but it wasn't too much of an issue, because the film ended before it could get close to being bad.I would recommend this film to anyone who liked M.

McAvoy is absolutely terrifying!,"The second film in a short while where M. Night Shyamalan successfully has managed to scare the living hell out of us. The previous being The Visit of course.Now I know that there have been quite a few thrillers that make use of the Dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder (MPD) and that at this point there is very little that can be done to truly surprise you. But by god M. Night has succeeded in a way that will put you on the edge of your seat multiple times. Not all the time mind you since the film dials down a few notches a couple of times. And this could make it seem the film drags here and there. In hindsight though it was M. Night teaching us what a master of horror he truly can be since he plays around with the tension to keep your interest peaked. Trust me on this that even when some of the plot developments may appear predictable it goes into different directions entirely. Especially at the very end of the film since it gives us a twist that is so meta that it will make your head spin. Very daring and incredibly effective. It is like he is saying, I told you that I am still very much on top of my game. But aside from this, the film in itself is incredible brilliant. James McAvoy was having a blast and he shows us what an amazing actor he is by switching up personalities like it's nothing. Still I do have to remark that Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke made a good impression as well. I did not even recognize her as she also was in The Witch.Split is one of those movies that does a lot of things really good and has you singing praise right after. But of course there will always be people hating on this film just because Shyamalan is involved. He does tend to make films that require you to suspend disbelief and have somewhat of an imagination. Doesn't always mean you have to like or agree with his vision because I am pretty aware he can make terrible films as well. Still Split is certainly is one of his better ones and deserves to be watched by many. So go forth ladies and gentlemen and enjoy yourselves. I certainly did!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A confused dynamic carried by a prominent McAvoy performance.,"Split lead me to believe that M. Night Shyamalan was trying to please too many audiences resulting in a confused dynamic. Aside from the plethora of Horror/Thriller clichés, there were moments where Split took a darker and more intriguing turn. However these moments were not frequent or embedded enough to change the dynamic of the film as a whole. The initial mysterious nature of certain characters in Split was alluring, however the desire to know more about these characters faded the more I got to know them.

This movie goes straight to the core of you,"Movie rating 8.5/10 - Just seen it and I must say I liked this movie more than Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. The main role is played by James McAvoy, for those of us still unfamiliar with him, he's the guy from X-Men: Origins/Apocalypse, the young Professor X. As we didn't have a feast in this year's Oscars as I think most would agree, I was wandering why wasn't he nominated there, I mean fuak, has anyone else seen what he did here!? But then I read more carefully, this movie was released only about mid January so it did not classify as a 2016 movie.You can't tell what's what about an actor until he is given the right stuff, the right scenery to work with. Take the guy from Deadpool for example, Ryan Reynolds, he does well in that movie, but 14 years ago he played that extremely superficial Van Wilder and fed those stuck up Harvard shits some dog cum in cookies. :D Of coarse we all liked that scene but his role was out of the charts of dumb. And then only 8 years later he plays that great role in Buried, in 2010. Practically he makes all that movie almost all by himself and manages a very good movie out of it.The moral is that you never know how an actor will develop or how deep his talent goes until he is put to the real test. And that my friends happened in Split with our dear young Professor X. I deeply enjoyed this movie, watched the ending about 4 times and I regret I didn't wait for the HD/Bluray version as I have no cinema in my little town for the moment. I thought it will be a 7/10, mostly 7.5/10 rated movie so with no obvious special effects I might lose, I thought I would give it a go in a shady quality. Boy was I wrong, this is the type of movie you see as clear as possible, in a cinema if you got the chance. I will re watch it in the best quality possible when it will be released, no doubt, I don't wanna miss every little thing from McAvoy's best performance to date!I regret ever calling him gay in relations with the new young X-Men I disliked at the time, this guy is simply... great. He would have been an Oscar nominee I think, if the movie would have been released just a month earlier. Bad luck for him opposed to us, who got the real treat in early 2017.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Find Out Why James McAvoy Has Done Awful Things to People, and Why He'll Do Awful Things to You in Split","He's Coming For YouSo the prime plot of the film is, Kevin has so many personalities and each passing day he has more and more trouble controlling his personalities. He abducts three teenage girls, and these teenage girls have no idea where they are. They wake up in a large dark basement, they are freaking the hell out, they don't know why they are there, and they are thinking well damn today I might actually die. These girls are introduced to Kevin's personalities. Not all 23, because that would be too long of a film. However, we do get to meet some very interesting split personalities/identity disorders. When these girls first come across Kevin, they think he is just a crazy man. Five minutes later Kevin comes back, only this time he is wearing a dress, wearing high heel shoes, and speaking in womanly voice. I love the expression the girls had on their face when they first see this. The look of, ""Did this man seriously kidnap us to show us his acting abilities? Are we at a dinner theater? Is this what they call improv?"" Not exactly, each personality has some plan for these girls. Some dangerous, some not so bad, but all very creepy.I don't know if this makes much sense, but the real stars of the movie are Kevin's identity disorders/split personalities. You can actually feel James McAvoy having fun with all these characters on screen. This is the role of a lifetime for any actor that wants to show his or her acting strengths and range. Some of his personalities are really intimidating, and others not so much. For instance, we are introduced to a Barry. Barry is one of the 23 split personalities Kevin suffers with, and Barry is a fashion designer. Even though Barry comes off easy going at first, when his psychiatrist Dr. Fletcher has a long conversation with him, Barry slowly becomes unstable and has that awkward crazy stare. So in a way he has personality disorders within his personality disorders.""My name is Hedwig. I have red socks.""I know this film seems like it has many characters to balance out and sit through. However, we truly do feel a somewhat connection to these characters. Now a majority of people felt something for Hedwig. Hedwig is another personality we are introduced to. Hedwig is a nine year-old mentally challenged boy. Hedwig and Casey form a bond with each other. I thought it was funny and sweet when Hedwig asked to kiss Casey, and Hedwig said, ""You might be pregnant now."" Hedwig is supposed to be the one character that makes us feel sympathetic for Kevin. But honestly, Mr. McAvoy did such a great job of making all these personality traits feel crazy, it was hard for me to feel that emotional attachment to Hedwig. Really, most people in the theater seemed to love him, but I was sitting there saying to myself, ""I don't care if your name is Hedwig, you have red socks, you have a collection of Kanye West albums, you like to dance, and you want to kiss me. At the end of the day, you kidnapped me; you're crazy as all hell, so screw you!"" Maybe that's just me though.Accordingly, Anya Taylor – Joy is easily starting to become one of my new favorite actresses. She has been doing very well, especially in the horror/thriller genre. I would like to see her become a future scream queen in this genre of film. I liked her in The Witch and Morgan, and I liked her character in this film as well. She has a backstory and flashbacks of her father, uncle, and hunting trips that connects to the audience emotionally, and adds to the story. It's her back story that leads her forming a relationship with Kevin.My only problems with the film are some scenes do drag just a little bit and at times it is the typical fight for survival formula. So these are my Final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Split. I think this is movie filled with great tension, performances, and a beautiful welcome back for Mr. Shyamalan. Trust me the twist ending was really good! The audience members at the movie theater were all going bonkers, buck wild, and gaga. No one saw the twist coming. If I were you I would avoid spoilers, because it makes the ending that much better. I won't spoil the ending for you, I'll just say watch one of Mr. Shyamalan's previous films. Is this his best film? In my opinion no, but it has be intrigued to see his next project. I believe Split earns a7 out of 10!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Kidnapped,"Upon discovering that the man who has kidnapped them has a multiple personality disorder, three teenage girls try to manipulate his more benevolent personalities into helping them escape in this horror thriller from M. Night Shyamalan. The film features two distinct plot lines as the kidnapper, played James McAvoy, separately converses with his psychiatrist and interacts with the girls he has kidnapped. Tension sometimes dissipates as the film switches back and forth, but McAvoy's intense and unsettlingly unpredictable performance keeps the film is chugging along. The best performance though comes from Anya Taylor-Joy (of 'The VVitch' fame) as the most introverted of the three kidnapped teens who nevertheless knows the best ways to deal with their abductor; Shyamalan's camera constantly hangs close to her face as her wide-open eyes and nervous glances convey volumes. As the film progresses, we gradually learn that she has suffered past trauma as per McAvoy, though the film's reluctance to explore her past experiences in depth (we only get the briefest of suggestive flashbacks) never feels right. The element of the film that sits least comfortably though is the fact that we are told that McAvoy has 23 distinct personalities, yet we only ever see eight of them and we are given no compelling reasons why he would have so many personalities aside from it sounding rather creepy. That said, the film offers several thought-provoking views on individuals with such a condition, questioning whether they are not in fact ""more evolved"" and whether curing such a condition is really the answer.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Movie, minor issues","Before I start this very late review, I just want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm happy M. Night has come back with a hit movie that puts forth gripping suspense, terror, and even mild humor at times. It should be noted that this movie is still a very dark one, with scenes of open wounds and pedophilia shown on screen. I'm very surprised it ended up with a PG-13 rating when it's all said and done.Nevertheless, 'Split' cuts to the chase, diving right into the kidnapping of three teenage girls. There is great camera work in this scene and definitely hooks you right in. It was exciting watching them piece together the strange actions of Kevin and his odd behavior. It isn't exciting however, watching some of the girls struggle to act. They do a poor job, and for a second it took me out of the viewing experience. Thankfully, not all the girls get an even amount of screen time as the trailer might have you believe.There are two other stories that the movie will jump back and forth throughout. One is of Dr. Karen Fletcher, who Kevin turns to so the audience can help understand him better, as well as Fletcher herself. In these scenes James McAvoy really gets to show off his acting skills, and he is awesome to watch. The other is a flashback that could have been cut down a few minutes, but still brought forth an important aspect of one main character that helps the audience understand them better. The movie ends with some plots I felt did not have much closure, but it did not lessen the quality of the movie. And then there's the end credit scene, which felt silly but could be enjoyable for those who understand it.In short, Split is a tense, but slower paced movie with solid acting from McAvoy and decent acting from the rest of the cast. I would definitely recommend seeing this whenever you can. Though the run time could be taken down a bit, it still leaves you on the edge of your seat as the main characters learn piece by piece the dangers of Kevin and his multiple personalities.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great weaving of compelling story arcs and masterful performances by all the main actors makes Split a welcome sophomore return effort by Shyamalan,"If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the surprisingly clear premise of Split - the latest film from M. Night Shyamalan. A mysterious man kidnaps three girls and traps them in an unknown location. As they struggle to escape, it would seem that he has accomplices - except it turns out, ""they"" are him. It's all him.James McAvoy is Kevin, the kidnapper who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). We start the film when he is controlled by the stern and OCD-inflicted ""Dennis"", kidnapping Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) for a mysterious reason, with his companion personalities, ""Ms Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"". Together, they are considered ""the Horde""; three of twenty-three personalities taking turns to be ""in the light"" inside Kevin. This only turns more disturbing, as words like ""The Beast"" and ""sacred food"" are whispered by the trio, and the girls, naturally panic-stricken, work towards finding their way out of their jail.It would seem that thirteen is a lucky number for Shyamalan. The 2015 The Visit was his return to form after a string of embarrassing work. He's always been a good explorer, asking what-ifs that turn subject matter on their heads, ending them with his signature plot twists. After realising this became his Achilles Heel, he has reinvented himself with a refreshed formula, and Split would reinforce that he is succeeding.With his latest film, he comes at you three ways - the obvious plot of the girls being abducted by a trio of cultish personas that wants to somehow use them to release ""the beast"". The second is Casey's story, that runs parallel in the form of flashbacks, slowly unfurling the reason behind this youth's unusual behaviour. This explains not only her aloof and uncooperative nature, but also her worldly and calculated maneuvers, relative to the other two girls who are more impulsive.It is the last that rattles the most, and it lies in the hands of both slayer and savior - the beast's doctrine that ""those who have not suffered are impure"" and Kevin's therapist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who theorised that those suffering from DID are not lesser human beings with damaged minds, but evolved greater beings, with sometimes supernatural traits. Weaving these three arcs seamlessly into Split is a testament to Shyamalan's persistent skill.McAvoy is a notable actor, with enough fluidity to make for a fascinating Kevin. As ""Dennis"", he is sombre and uptight, crunching brows and fidgeting with object placements. ""Ms. Patricia"" comes along and he turns poised and deliberate, with arched eyebrows and tightened lips, holding back her delicious secrets. ""Hedwig"" is the attention-seeking nine-year-old, who we slowly find out has managed to steal ""the light"" from ""Barry"" - the usual benign controller of Kevin.McAvoy does an admirable job, shifting nuances between the personas. But maybe his recent appearances as the bald Charles Xavier has grown too ingrained, and Kevin's transformations, though laudable, are not as defined as they should be. And though interesting to watch, and sometimes terrifying to decipher (as to who's in charge), the mental patient he plays does feel cliché and a bit of a caricature. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix (Shyamalan's original choice) would have fared better? Unfortunately, we'll never know.Though the early scenes of escape were tense and exciting, the ones with Dr. Fletcher made for some of the most engaging watch. Although therapists are roles that tend to be relegated to help with exposition, Fletcher serves to be an equal and compassionate player in the hide-and-seek game, where she susses out who the controller might be. As she figures out that her theory might be more terrifying true than she expected, the audience follows her through her mortification.Anna Taylor-Joy was a riveting victim. Her startling fragility and angst as Casey gives the movie its most moving moments. Her quick- thinking and measured moves reveals a survivor honed by the past, and as we get fed her history, we become thankful for it, and yet in the most conflicted of ways. Her ending scene and that withering look has us knowing that she's in for more terrifying stories to run from, and proves to be the most disturbing takeaway of all.Shyamalan remains a great storyteller, reinforcing the main plot with small vignettes of charm and wit. In the scenes where ""Dennis"" masquerades as ""Barry"", he makes himself overly effete, and over- populates his speech with fashion trivia, when ""Barry"" was nothing like that, revealing stereotypes even among personas. In another snippet, as Fletcher shares her theory with her elderly neighbour, and calls her patients superior human beings, the old lady rejects her proposal, calling it rubbish, before picking up her phone having succumbed to an infomercial.Split is so many things, and served up by the skillful editing of Luke Clarrocchi and the magnificently atmospheric score by West Dylan Thordson which swings overhead like a metallic guillotine, explores and represents this old adage the best - whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too long and a suffers from a real lack of tension,"I'm going to start this review by stating that this isn't a particularly original film - there are already quite a few out there which do the same thing, only far better. Only last week I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is broadly similar, yet a far superior movie. The reason 10 Cloverfield works (the final 10-15 minutes aside) is that you always feel John Goodman's character could lose it at any moment. And from time-to-time, he does. That movie really had me on edge and the tension was almost unbearable at times. Unfortunately, 'Split' did not do this well. The runtime and pacing is probably one of the biggest issues, because a movie like this set over 117 minutes really needs to be handled by a master. I don't know much about this director, but he's no Kubrick. And although Kubrick could be self-indulgent (Eyes Wide Shut was a catastrophe), a film like The Shining runs for well over 2 hours, but the suspense and atmosphere carries it all the way. With Split, the film lulls and drags you really don't believe you're going to see this 'beast' they talk about till the very end, which is a big problem, because you're not on the edge of your seat. Perhaps sharper editing would help and personally I would've cut it down substantially, but that still wouldn't have made it a great movie.McAvoy gives a decent performance, but I'm not about to overstate it. I saw a film called 'The Love Butcher' the other day and the almost unknown actor in that film also played many characters quite successfully. Lots of actors are capable of this and I'm sure many will cite McAvoy's performance as being a key element of the film, but for me it doesn't save the movie. If you want campy fun of this sort, check out John Lithgow in Brian De Palma's Raising Cain! Other acting in the film is absolutely fine, although you don't get to see two of the girls all that much. This again is another problem, because this sort of film really works best when you can put yourself in the place of the victim(s). It doesn't really dare you to do that, as it moves from place to place, but doesn't focus on their plight.There's a huge plot hole something which one of the characters should have said near the end of the movie, but I won't elaborate, as I don't want to spoilt it. It's a glaring plot hole though! To conclude, it really does drag so much and I couldn't wait for it to end. It gets to the point where you know everything there is to know, but it won't stop. We're just treated to more 'performance' from McAvoy, but by this point, you won't care. I could recommend at least a dozen similar films without a second thought which are far better than this, so I honestly wouldn't waste your time. There were a few laughs along the way, but by the end of the film, you certainly won't be laughing. Overall, for me it's a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shyamalan can still surprise!,"Mysterious man with many distinct personalities (James McAvoy) kidnaps three girls and holds them without much explanations. What is going on and do they have a chance to get free again?Even once-biggest fans of M. Night Shyamalan such as myself have to admit that, as a filmmaker, he is not nearly as good as he used to be.The breakout hit ""The Sixth Sense"" is still my favorite but his zenith came with 2002's ""Signs"". After that, the good going just, er, stopped. The same can be said, by the way, about Mel Gibson's acting career, who starred in ""Signs"".So what happened? Shyamalan just suddenly lost his steam. Every later project I've seen has been artistically limp, pompous and/or bit weird in a bad way. True, I have skipped ""Wayward Pines"" and ""The Visit"", so maybe they are the exceptions.M. has always known a thing or three about creating dark gripping atmosphere and characters we can root for but I think he is seldom good at moving the story along and making it compact.Thus, many bits or scenes in his movies are strong and/or fresh but the whole thing gets kind of tiring as it progresses.This is also exactly how I'd sum up ""Split"". Pure Shyamalan, with all his usual strengths and weaknesses. It has lot of good stuff going on. I like everything here separately... but the whole thing just does not come together.""Split"", too, goes to three different directions at once. None of them is really effective and satisfying – although could be if given more room and care – which is the main problem bogging the result down.By far the best part is to watch James McAvoy playfully juggle different personalities, managing to move effortlessly from horrifying to funny to pathetic to kind of cool.It has to be the most interesting acting work anybody has ever had a chance of doing in Shyamalan movies which are known for one-note lead characters (not necessarily a bad thing but still). Although i don't understand the point of having 24 personas if we only get to see 8 of them. Were the others put on hold for the possible sequels?So. ""Split"" is better than expected – although almost anything would be after Shyamalan's double death punch of early 2010's (""The Last Airbender"", ""After Earth""). And it has the second-best ending we have ever had in a Shymalan move.Is it enough to give Shy another chance? Yes. But I'd still approach his future project with caution. The man has a long way to go back to the top.In the world full of me-too horror and thriller movies, usually relying on cheap scares (such as sudden sound effects), he could be one of the true auteurs. But he can't do it alone. He needs someone who will help to put all his ideas in tight compact packages.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
the return of M Night,"Greetings again from the darkness. As a filmmaker, the public's expectations become a burden rather than a blessing once you write and director back-to-back movies like The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000). M Night Shyamalan has never been able to replicate the box office or critical success that he enjoyed with those two films  but, oh how he has tried. It's this latest that finally makes us believe he is at least having fun again.James McAvoy plays Dennis and Patricia and Hedwig and  well  he plays a guy with 23 distinct personalities. As you might imagine, some of these personalities are nicer than others, while some are stronger in their fight for the spotlight. As Dennis, a button-upped neat freak, he captures 3 teenage girls and holds them captive. At first, the purpose is a bit murky, but the delay does allow the girls to meet some of the personalities.The girls are Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who was so good in The Witch), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson from The Bronze), and Marcia (Jessica Sula). Claire and Marcia are the popular girls who react with typical teenage emotions, while Casey pushes for patience and observation. It's Casey who may be the film's most interesting character as childhood flashbacks occur that are first thought to explain her survival skills, but soon enough disclose a darker, more unfortunate past. The younger Casey is coolly played by newcomer Izzie Coffey, and holds her own with Sebastian Arcelus (her dad) and Brad William Henke (her Uncle John).The always terrific Betty Buckley is outstanding as Dr Fletcher, the psychologist treating McAvoy's character(s). Ms. Buckley adds class and a connection to the real world that gives us hope for the future of the girls being held. McAvoy really seems to be enjoying the acting challenge and shape-shifting that accompanies this mental disorder, and he will likely creep you out a few times. Cinematographer Mike Gioukakis was a key to the look and mood of It Follows, and his camera work here is superb in mostly confined areas. Sure, the whole thing is preposterous, but it's fun and wicked  and with this director, you can expect a surprise or twist – even after all these years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A psychological thrill ride.,"Split tells the story of a man who is diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder(DID). Kevin Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) has 23 vastly different personalities, living inside him. One of these personalities, kidnap three girls namely, Casey Cooke(Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire Benoit(Haley Lu Richardson) & Marcia(Jessica Sula). Casey, Claire & Marcia have to figure out what Kevin wants with them & escape, before the appearance of a terrifying 24th personality.Split is a mind blowing film. Director M. Night Shyamalan delivers another unforgettable thriller, after The Visit(2015). Shyamalan's original script is one of a kind & maintains the suspense & tension, throughout the movie. You just cannot predict what Kevin is going to do next. The performances are the highlight of the film. James McAvoy has given the best performance of his career so far, as Dennis/Patricia/Hedwig/The Beast/Kevin Wendell Crumb/Barry/Orwell/Jade. McAvoy alters his speech, gait & mannerisms for each personality, with ease & panache. Not even one personality feels like a rehash of another. James McAvoy astoundingly portrays a man suffering from DID. Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Casey Cooke. Betty Buckley is superb as Dr. Karen Fletcher. Haley Lu Richardson is great as Claire Benoit. Jessica Sula is brilliant as Marcia. Izzie Coffey is outstanding as Five-Year-Old Casey. Brad William Henke, Sebastian Arcelus & Neal Huff are impressive as Uncle John, Casey's Father & Mr. Benoit, respectively. Split is a must watch for psychological thriller fans. Also, I recommend everyone to watch it for its sheer unpredictability & the performance of a lifetime by James McAvoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fairly decent Shyamalan film, but that's faint praise","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA trio of girls find themselves abducted from a shopping mall by Dennis (James McAvoy), a man with Disassociative Personality Disorder, who is struggling with twenty three different personalities and who the girls must try and escape from before the 'monsterous' twenty fourth personality emerges.After really disliking 2006's Lady in the Water, I became quite averse to M Night Shyamalan (wasn't a great fan to begin with, really) and after avoiding 2008's critically savaged The Happening never bothered with any of his work again. This has come to an end with Split, an intriguing psychological thriller that taps into the world of multiple personality disorders and unlocks the potential that this condition has for a thriller. While signs (or Signs!) of his Sixth Sense promise do shine through, it's still all a pretty hit and miss affair with some major flaws.In what's at the very least a challenging performance, James McAvoy has to portray twenty three different characters inhabiting one body and mind, and yes, as others have noted, he does do a pretty brilliant job, especially with such a heavy workload on him. Although the character's motives for the multiple kidnappings or his ability to carry them out with such an affliction does make you wonder, before it builds up to a nonsensical ending where he's turned into some werewolf type thing, that messy, self indulgent and overly labourious.Although it's just slightly above rather than below average, to be honest 2003's Identity took this concept of a psychotic multiple personality and worked it to much better effect, and in half the time of Shyamalan's skin of the teeth comeback. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Split (8/10),"When it comes to Split, M. Night Shyamalan has put questions to rest if he can ever create a thriller with terrific built suspense or a thoughtfully written twist ending. The story really anchored the film, which relied on intricate dialogue, scene by scene and a limited cast to sell it. What's different about modern Shyamalan thrillers compared to his past ones is his comic relief that he's been able to successfully apply. The ensemble of personalities James McAvoy portrays was engaging, each well-crafted and had their own distinguished presence. Along with McAvoy's performances, Anya Taylor-Joy was also marvelous as the introverted lead female with complexities that were well built. Split establishes an anxiety-filled atmosphere, fluid build up to the end, with little mercy shown to characters and viewers. Split is well worth the watch, and without spoiler, its recommended to watch Shyamalan's early thrillers beforehand.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

M. Night's Comeback and an Outstanding Performance from James McAvoy,"Split is the newest film from the writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan which his name became a joke since he has created some disasters films mostly in the category of action and blockbusters. However, with the 2015's The Visit he has shown signals of his recreation of the genre as well as a sign for his return to thrilling form. As this was my anticipated film of the moment, I was vastly surprised from this movie. At this point, we could agree that M. Night Shyamalan has been returned and welcomed by other audiences in return form for thrillers. Not only does this film succeeds his career in recent memory, but also creates an unexpected super villain origin story that is a form of a rarity these days.When the term 'superhero' or 'super villain' comes to our mind, we genuinely think of huge Hollywood action blockbusters, that is a huge aspect of modern day entertainment and a leasehold to most modern released films. As it takes incredibly huge budgets to create, it also earns or exceeds these amounts of money/box offices that have become extremely essential. However, with the film Split it breaks this stereotypes instantaneously. It may trick most audiences as a straight- up thrilling film, as three girls including Casey Cook (Anya Taylor Joy) gets kidnapped by a man named Kevin (James Mcavoy). As it seems that the man has OCD and perfectionism, as the days increases other unusually uncommon events occur as different personalities or identities are expressed. Half way, the film reveals that the man named Kevin has a rare psychological disease called 'Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)' and has distinct 23 different personalities that live in Kevin one form body. First off, the film's entire premise and the plot is very unusual and interesting as in cinema history, this range of ideas hasn't been thought out. The film does handle this idea in a fascinating method and a classical method that does not follow similar routines of modern day film storytelling. Also, it has a sense of 'fun' as the film essentially knows how to express these different identities and has fun playing around with them. Most of all, James Mcavoy is absolutely courageous in this film. He gives a variety of range of his acting ability while encouraging himself deeply that he might just be one of those rare actors who is 'really' acting. He gives such an amazing and phenomenal performance that you just cannot keep your eyes off. When the film falters at a certain point, James Mcavoy arrives to pick it up again and he is the best aspect that elevates this film in a high ranking. Anya Taylor Joy is good as well as she gives a very compelling performance as the lead girl. The film uses a lot of its tension on the environmental conditions, the sense of deep isolation. It does not have a consistent flow of true tension and thrills which could have been improved. Some of the dialogues are clunky and unusual in which some character human interactions seemed awkward and too much scientific. However, the cinematography is truly excellent. From the cinematographer of It Follows, it does have a very sleek and immaculate visual to be viewed. To sum up, it is a beautiful looking movie. As a film made by M. Night, we definitely expect ending plot twists that make us praise this filmmaker. The ending of this film is definitely one of his best endings and a very unexpected, surprising treat for fans of M. Night, himself. Aside from some major flaws, this film is excellent of what it has achieved through the ingredients M. Night has been given.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wow,"James McAvoy acting so amazing I can't put it into words, he really pulls off every character: personality perfectly. I really enjoyed the filming and how intense it could be with just a change of expression. He even gives them different ways of speaking and small mannerisms,I would of liked to see more of the other personalities however I understand the film wouldn't of had time for that without possibly dragging. I hope it is possible to do another even if it's a prequel as it sounds like some of the personalities have a colourful past.Even though James McAvoy stole the film, the rest of The cast were well chosen for their roles. I will be watching this again and rewatching more M. Night films. He has a great writing style and it really does seems he has come back to his own.This film deserves to win some serious awards",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Split Decision,"James McAvoy's performance is outstanding right down to the details of 9-year-old Hedwig's mannerisms. The film is a 2-hour thrill ride that starts with a brief introduction to the protagonist, the emotionally distant Casey Cooke. Before the can settle in to the unfolding plot, McAvoy emerges, immediately ""causing significant disruption and commotion"" that endures throughout the film.There are lapses in diagnostic integrity such as 1) inaccuracies in Kevin's trauma history, 2) the methodologies that form Dr. Fletcher's medical opinions, 3) her caring for potentially dangerous patients in her home, and 4) an acutely ill individual's ability to walk on walls. But for all these bloopers, there are 498 times as many reasons to ignore and enjoy.Overall, the film deserves its place on the ""must watch"" list of M. Night's achievements. This film takes the ""guess"" out of what's ""causing"" Kevin's pathological behavior. While the depiction of Kevin's identities is over the top, what Split lacks in diagnostic accuracy, it more than makes up for with suspense and thrills.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Same old Shyamalan,"The issue with recent Shyamalan movies has never been style or execution. Unfortunatey, though, his solid (and often gorgeous) film making often hides a fundamentally flawed story - desperate attempts at his trademark twist, shoddy character development, giant plot holes.

I mean, there were some really interesting suspense and horror moments. The central characters were mostly developed well.

"A Knockout Performance from McAvoy,","Split is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a very tense, thrilling film as we follow three girls who have been kidnapped by a man with a serious case of schizophrenia. It kept me at the edge of my seat throughout as we follow these girls struggling to escape and being forced to deal with his many different personalities.The only thing about the movie that did bother me a little was false advertising. It was marketed that this man had 23 personalities and that he was unleashing his 24th. However, we only ever meet eight of them, so it is simply a disappointment for the audience who were expecting three times more than that. I understand that Shyamalan has plans to bring this character back, but it still should not have been advertised as such.Although, I must say, you do not walk out feeling underwhelmed by the amount of characters James McAvoy transforms in to throughout. He is phenomenal in this role, delivering each character with clear, specific detail. He blew my mind in every part, playing a convincing nine year old boy, woman and even an animal. There was nothing pantomime about his performances, he lets out a presence that truly becomes these characters, no acting, simply being.It is a very intense ride, one of M.

The interpretation of James McAvoy who played as Kevin is nothing short of remarkable. His ability to seamlessly switch between personalities adds a layer of unpredictability and depth to the film.

After that i had to keep jumping forward in order to find a scene that wasn't drawn out or meaningless...Needless to say i never found that scene.Acting was below average and dialog wasn't much better.Very disappointed in M. Knight in this one..I don't know how someone with his kind of talent let this one slide by.Look forward to watching more of his work in the future.I have loved his work in the past and hope for his sake this doesn't set him back in creating his next project.Until than ill just watch his other films and skip over Split!,1.0,Anonymous,Horror

DID is a scary condition which makes it perfect for a thriller like this. James Mcovy is a really really great actor, he has been great in everything I have seen him in, in this role he is really able to show his range, all the way from nice and sweet to downright creepy.

Great premise that unraveled throughout,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it really fell apart in the end. Possible spoilers.The best thing about Split was James McAvoy. He played his character(s) impeccably. His mannerisms changed in almost imperceptible ways, so you could always see what personality was in control. Because of him, it's not a bad movie.The plot wasn't half bad. The suspense worked. The issue was it kept reaching points where the conflict in the film should have resolved, but it continued to play out until it became ridiculous.There are characters who die who did not need to die for a good story. They died at the wrong time for it to make sense. There was no satisfactory resolution, and there could have been. What ended up happening was several people died for shock value, without adding value to the story. And the shock value wasn't high enough because by that point the story was devolving into no longer being believable.There were also some really weird scenes where the teenage characters were sexualised for no particular reason. They spent half the movie in their underwear without much of an explanation in the plot.There were lots of well executed parts, for sure, and it's far from a terrible movie. But when a movie makes you think ""okay, this should end in five minutes"" multiple times while just getting more pointlessly dark, and finally doesn't pay off the audience's expectations of more than one of the cast surviving, and doesn't even give half a happy ending to the remaining characters, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.Sure it's horror, so that's how it should be expected to play out, but they set up what seemed like rich characters that might grow and learn, and abandoned the most intelligent aspects of the film in the resolution.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very interesting story and excellent performances,"This film gives you really good insights into split personality syndrome, how it came to be, what it looks like and why it can be a serious problem.This is a story about three girls being abducted by a criminal who has split personality syndrome. The guy is deeply a study by a devoted psychiatrist who did not know that his darkest personality is about to come out.I am not giving away the plot. I will just say that it is thrilling and exciting and makes me learn. This is not just a type of thriller with blood and slashes and torture, those type of things. It is a better kind of film where related backgrounds of character are given and you can learn from it.The lead performer James McAvoy is excellent in performing all these personalities in himself. The lead female character did very good job, too. You can see how she is different from the other two girls and there are reasons behind it, and this makes her wiser than them.Some people might have a problem with the ending but for me, it's fine. It can happen that way in reality. The whole point of the film is to show you how this monster in a man came to be. In reality, so many criminals, rapists and murderers are with abusive childhood and they try to build their strong side to protect themselves. They have their other sides too, but once they are made to believe that being strong and ruthless is the only way to survive safely, then they'll become monsters. Our society can learn from this.

Anya a tailor-made joy...!,"Allow me to enthuse about the true merit of a movie that starts off very, very promising, but steadily begins to derail and SPLIT apart with an uneven performance, at times seriously flawed, by the lead actor. That said, this is a good movie, it certainly has some suspenseful moments, but all in all, built on a bunch of psycho-babble claptrap... I mean, I watch a buncha vampire TV shows and superheroine TV shows, but ol' Betty Buckley here with her these people's suffering and trauma brought us to the breakthrough, aw, bull, come on...! Metamorphosis is best left to caterpillars.Largely disappointing except for one. There is a jewel of a performance in this movie, Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, oh, that beautifully-intense girl with the long, long brown hair and the soulful brown doe eyes. She's the one who should be mentioned as the true acting talent, because she was consistent all the way through... (and the reason for me being on this one, for I got a sneak preview of the parking lot scene)Too much old lady. Too little of the two other victim girls. Too little Beast. Too much Hedwig.

Better than I expected,"""Split"" is a well-executed thriller based on an interesting concept: three girls kidnapped by a man suffering from a dissociative identity disorder. It sometimes feels more like a Friday night B movie, but it's clear that the director is trying to focus on storytelling and atmosphere rather than throwing in the usual gimmicks of the genre. The mood is uneasy and suspenseful, and both main characters are brought to life by convincing acting performances. However, it felt like the concept needed further development. Kevin is supposed to have 23 different personalities, but we only get a glimpse of the same five or six. Kevin and Casey both have a domestic abuse backstory, but we only get a couple of dull flashbacks. The character psychology is supposed to be the core of the movie, but we get nothing deeper than a bunch of didascalic interventions from Kevin's therapist.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The main reason why this movie works and why everyone should watch it is simply for the phenomenal performance by James McAvoy. This is one of those movies roles where they manage to cast the character perfectly with the right actor in mind. James McAvoy manages to play off all of the multiple identities of Kevin Crumb and makes all of them different and distinct from each other. He manages to be both very compelling and terrifying at the same time. I also really liked Anya Taylor-Joy as our main character in fact this is my introduction to this woman and now she's become this major star in Hollywood now. I also appreciate that M.

"Shyamalan again subverts genre expectations. Split is a tense, fun and frightening experience performed by an exquisite cast","The premise revolves around three teenage girls who are kidnapped by a man who has Dissociative Identity Disorder, manifesting 23 distinct personalities in all - and this is where the film shines, as James McAvoy manages to act exquisitely and alternate with the world's greatest naturalness among the different characters, ranging from a methodical man with a mania for cleanliness to a nine-year-old child with an elegant woman in the middle of it all. It's interesting to note how Shyamalan uses a game of framing and mirrors to denote the transition of Kevin's different facets, giving a greater air of insanity to everything.Split repeats the themes and the natural-supernatural twist of the director's main fabled films. The biggest news is a stunning drive to expand that world to a franchised universe-building level. For the rest, what we have here is a fine-tuning of the director's style and a very efficient game of expectation-breaking and delivery. Split is a psychological thriller that takes advantage of the best points of its genre. There is a clear concern to build a script that walks between tension and terror, but care is even greater when it comes to making sure the film doesn't end up leaning too far either way. This creates a unique aspect, although the audience should end up feeling uncomfortable for the lack of a greater horror atmosphere. However, like other films by Shyamalan, such as The Sixth Sense and The Village, the intention is precisely that: the devil is in the details and it is precisely in them that the most horrendous aspects of the feature film grow.The film begins with a very sarcastic and somber tone, which is characteristic of Shyama's cinema at the height of creativity. The girls are locked underground and, as they try to find ways to escape, they meet some of Kevin's personalities. Casey, played by the reveal of ""The Witch"", forms a manipulative friendship with Hedwig, a nine-year-old personality, which makes her explore captivity, while the other, more desperate girls are not so subtle in their approaches to search for freedom.The film's biggest focus is clearly on James McAvoy's acting. He doesn't actually play all 24 personalities, just a few of them, but he can't orchestrate really outstanding characters. There is a particular moment in which one of his identities tries to pass for another, and it is remarkable how, with a slight alteration in his expression, the actor manages to make us perceive the change. Yes, many of these identities end up sounding like caricatures (the tongue-tied child; the grim-faced gay stylist), but this is even forgivable when we consider McAvoy's difficult task, which relies primarily on physical compositions to establish differences.Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Casey, one of the kidnapped girls who is plagued by a painful past that follows her wherever she goes, is another one who stands out. The new actress of ""The Witch"" gives herself body and soul to portray the traumas of her character, who appears with great delicacy and a constant melancholy. To add depth to the script, M. Night decided to introduce flashbacks into Casey's life, showing that she has been abused by her uncle since childhood, something she has never been able to confront. Such plot serves exclusively so that, when Casey faces the Beast, she goes through an overcoming and finally manages to face a monster in her life, culminating in the dubious ending where we don't know if she goes back home with her uncle or not.On the other hand, less understandable is Shyamalan's tendency to turn some of these McAvoy-created versions into jokes, which eliminates much of the tension they could cause, while still failing as attempts at humor. To make matters worse, the script is simply incoherent, initially freely suggesting a conspiratorial tone, as if there's a big secret being kept between Dennis/Barry/etc (McAvoy/McAvoy/McAvoy) and his psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Buckley), but which, in reality, is just a devious effort to create mystery. The doctor, by the way, is slowly revealing herself as one of the most incompetent professionals in the world, indulging in theories that make no sense from a basic biological point of view while the film tries to make us believe that we are facing a brilliant figure. (At a certain point, it becomes so ridiculous that the character reaches a conclusion she considers relevant when she observes how someone behaves in front of an overturned garbage can, stating, like an authentic Sherlock Holmes, that ""anyone would have given to back around the rubble"").Another questionable factor is that never, at any time, the imminent danger of the arrival of such a Beast is palpable on the screen - and through it. The girls even go through a tension, but on this side of the screen this entity represents no fear, which makes their arrival tasteless - and even a little too fanciful. In the middle of it all is Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), a psychologist who cares for Kevin and believes his illness is an opening door to his mind expansion. She treats Kevin almost like a protégé, the perfect guinea pig for her studies. The character is one of those who predictably will discover the real nature of his patient and consequently fall into his clutches, without first explicitly leaving the way to fight him. She is the deus ex machina who appears to Casey to get away with it, a mere pawn to conquer the protagonist - a ploy so cliché of so many thrillers / horror movies.Some thought-provoking elements in the basic plot: the idea of personalities vying to ""come to light"" and take control of a body is promising, as is the concept of the ""horde"" and different identities dominating the villain at the same time, but these are examples rare in a script that, if written by a stranger, would likely be thrown in the trash. How can it be acceptable, for example, for a professional screenwriter to include a scene like the one where the psychiatrist, aware that saying the villain's full name will bring back her original personality, writes on paper, basically to herself, the phrase "" Say his name: Kevin Wendell Crumb""? Or should we assume that this is a note she left on the guy's desk as a message to a girl she saw in passing trapped in a closet and that she doesn't even know whether or not she's aware of the kidnapper's disorder to understand the message?But perhaps Splito's greatest offense is Shyamalan's cynicism in employing pedophilia as a mere twist by including several flashbacks throughout the projection whose sole function is to set the stage for the revelation that Casey, as a child, was molested by his uncle. And why is this important? Because the marks left on her body, when finally exposed after her last blouse is removed (yes, she removes her clothes during the narrative), lead the villain to consider her an ""equal"", saving her. Now, are we to suppose, then, that her being abused was a good thing? Or that this makes her as ""damaged"" as McAvoy's character? Either option is offensive - and there's no way to rule them out in the context created by the script.Still, the film is not shaken by these slips. The plot remains cohesive and, just like in the best Shyamalan films, serves as an allegory for more delicate subjects - which we won't reveal, as it contains important details that could be considered spoilers. Likewise, the director surprises by creating a film that doesn't depend on a big twist, like most of his previous projects. Here, we have micro-plot twists, which serve to develop characters rather than provide predictable surprises.The suspense ambiance is developed very well, mainly through the fervent soundtrack composed by West Dylan Thordson, guaranteeing strong emotions with dissonant chords in increasing volume. Mike Gioulakis's photography direction is not far behind, combining well-lit environments, such as Dr. Fletcher's living room (indicating warmth and tenderness), and dark ones, such as all the rooms in the place where the girls are imprisoned (showing loneliness and anguish). The art direction surprises from the costumes of Barry, Dennis, Patricia and Hedwig (Kevin's personalities), which become a good tool to identify the characters, to the rich construction of sets that is elaborated on top of the predictable (but well done) cool color palette.Shyamalan's direction is efficient and the filmmaker repeats what he did in The Visit and again subverts genre expectations - often comedic moments break the tension at unexpected moments and audiences react immediately. In terms of suspense, the director continues to know how to execute everything correctly, playing with lights and frames that leave the spectator on the edge of the chair and with a restless leg, anxious and nervous for what is to come. Although far from being as impactful as The Sixth Sense, Split is a tense, fun and frightening experience performed by an exquisite cast that renews the desire to see more and more films written and directed by Shyamalan. If bigger moments of tension are lacking, M. Night Shyamalan at least offers a nice surprise in the last seconds of the film by trying to create his own Shyamalan Extended Universe (SEU) and revealing that Split takes place in the same universe of Unbreakable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Exactly the same film, just call it something different.DID is already so widely misunderstood and misrepresented (looking at you, self-diagnosed TikTokers!). This is not helping. While most people will understand that this is fiction, many others may think this is how it works.That effect is possibly even worse because some of the information given about DID in this film is true (it is the result of horrific trauma at a very young age and alters do form to protect the rest of the person).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spectactular,"After receiving a pity invitation to a classmate's party, Casey is left without a ride. Two giggling pals in the back are offered a ride home by a nice dad, but they are too preoccupied with their phones to notice that the man who just slid into the driver's seat is actually someone else. The three adolescents awaken in a locked room in a terrifying man's basement after taking a couple aerosol chloroform shots.But perhaps there is more than one of those eerie men. It's both, in a sense. James McAvoy portrays Barry; however, Dennis, Hedwig, or Patricia could all be involved. Due to some of his more troublesome identities, he has dissociative identity disorder, and as a result, he has devised a plot to abduct the two popular females for a ceremony. Although Casey's presence wasn't anticipated, she can't possibly jeopardize his plan, can she?Usually, when a character consults a shrink, it's because the scriptwriter is at a loss for how to subtly introduce exposition. The most interesting parts of Split, despite being a horror thriller, are when McAvoy is sitting on Dr. Fletcher's couch. Split places a lot of emphasis on McAvoy changing characters, but fortunately, he has the acting skills to pull it off well. He transforms from a vengeful clean freak to a flamboyant fashion designer to an intelligent child with only modest wardrobe adjustments.A part of me would want that final statement to be examined by psychiatric and medical professionals, but that part of me does not love Hitchcock's Spellbound. Or Psycho, for that matter, which Split resembles when the screenplay makes some riskier choices later in the game. This is the point when I say that, yeah, Shyamalan still enjoys playing pranks.

Excellent thriller worth the hype,"Not a usually a huge ""M. Night"" Shyamalan fan but this is a very slick, multi-layered thriller with a truly fantastic performance by James McAvoy, ably supported by Anya Taylor-Joy. Well worth the watch. Can't wait for the sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well-made creepy thriller,"'Split' refers to James McAvoy's split personalities - or dissociative identity disorder (DID) - of which he has 23. He plays Barry, Hedwig, Kevin, Dennis, Patricia and a few others you get to see. The film wastes no time, with him abducting Casey (Taylor-Joy), Claire (Richardson) and Marcia (Sula) and they all wake up in a strange room. You're then introduced to a few of his personalities - Dennis is mostly in charge - and they're not all malevolent.He also visits Dr Fletcher (Buckley), who genuinely tries to help him and slowly figures out it's not Barry she's been talking to, but Dennis. The girls try to escape, but are thwarted, as it becomes a race against time before ""the beast"" arrives. This ominous arrival drives the momentum and plot. It's a little slow in parts, but keeps your interest throughout.McAvoy is excellent, with his ability to change expressions, accents and mannerisms fantastic, and Taylor-Joy shows good depth too (Casey's childhood is slowly revealed to give background). The final 20min is frenetic and the ending is both scary, creepy and well-handled - except perhaps for the final minute cameo. Good to see Shyamalan back.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Step For Step Hitchcock Style Nothing New,"Just by watching the trailer for Split, we all know what this film is about. You guessed it, yes that's right, it's multiple personality disorder.Written and directed by the not so famous anymore M. Night Shyamalan, starring James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Hayley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula and Izzie Coffey.The film takes us on the journey of the latest craze, girls taken, and then locked in basements against their will. It's sort of a sado masochism type of film in a way, except it's captor(McAvoy) has many personalities running around, all the while still under supervision of a psychologist.Shyamalan goes through all the predictable steps to make us care about the victims and the villain, we get a surprise ending as to why we have to sit and watch this predictable rubbish, and it's end is just to make the studios buy into Shyamalan's work yet another time, it's all about money to further his venture's for another feature film.Watching the entire film, and after seeing it's final scene, I felt annoyed, and I wouldn't watch this film again. It's the same stunt he pulled with ""Sixth Sense"", this type of ""oh wow"" would of worked 25 years ago, but not now, society is just too smart for this type of silliness. This director is very cocky in my opinion, he's had a few good movies, but mostly duds, while riding on the coat tails of his so called inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. Copying director style is one thing, but making films with Hitchcock step for step direction is another, that's why Shyamalan to me is a sell out, he's doing it for the money, we all fell for that rhetoric with SIxth Sense and Signs, but those day's are over, and there is more younger director talent out there, and it isn't Shyamalan.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Identity,Nice little flick about a madman with multiple personalities (very good: James McAvoy) abducting some girls. Good acting and a suspenseful plot with some twists make this a fine and sometimes even thrilling experience.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The BEAST!,"M Night Shyamalan strikes back! Split is one hell of a psychological thriller that captivates. It has an intriguing premise, a ""horde"" of amusing characters and one for the books storyline that delivers engrossing horror, deserving of a second & third watch.Split is ultimately carried by the dynamic performance of James McAvoy, who evidently gives his 100% to the role. He plays each personality distinctly, whether through voice or expression, paving the way for riveting scenes where McAvoy slips from one persona to another. Through his discomforting yet fascinating brilliance, his character(s) is then able to convey all the essentials of a horror film villain. He is cold and calculated in one scene, violent and menacing in the next, leaving audiences nerve wrecked, on what could happen next. All of these executed, without the need for special effects. Fine work!As for the genius behind the curtains, Split is as well a reminder, of how great a filmmaker M Night can be. His use of dark and claustrophobic visuals, elevates the film's appeal & horror. His writing delivers brooding tension, whether from the captives' struggle to escape, or the masterful depiction of the bizarre elements of McAvoy's DID. His use of therapy sessions for expositions and back stories for perspective, flawlessly enrich the narrative & ensures audience appreciation of his characters. The film's final acts was as well jaw dropping and rewarding, rivaling Sixth Sense as having the best closure for M Night films.Overall, Split delivers quite an impactful watch. The riveting narrative, messages on exploitation & brand of horror are well received through remarkable acting & fine screenplay . It is then a film that cements McAvoy as a worthy actor & M Night's resounding return to form.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm of two minds regarding this movie,"I'm of two minds regarding M. Night Shyamalan's Split. This movie is not his best work, and it's darker than I anticipated. However, it feels like another step in the right direction. It's obvious that James McAvoy enjoys playing the different personalities, and he does a fantastic job with that role. If you like Shyamalan's earlier films like Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense, then you should avoid any spoilers and go see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Welcome Back, Night","Shyamalan has made so many so-so movies of late, so many bad movies, many were writing him off as a one-hit wonder (The Sixth Sense). Of course, his follow-ups to that, through Signs, are amazing, even if film society doesn't see it that way.I never lost faith in him. But, I've never been blind to how bad The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth are.The Visit was such a shock - it was GOOD. Really GOOD. Most people gave it low marks because of the stereotype they had of Night.And then Split. Wow. I stood up in the theater and clapped. ""Welcome back, Night!""Could this film truly be as good as The Sixth Sense?No.It's better.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It could have been great, unique and very original, but there are many things that hold it back from being that.","It's a very interesting film that has great concepts and ideas, but not all of them worked or are executed all that well. The biggest positive is of course James McAvoy's performance and he does a fantastic job that after watching the film, i can't even picture someone else playing the role and proving that he is one of the best actors working today, but his performance is not enough to save it from being almost mediocre at best. You can say it's M. Night Shyamalan's return to form after many failures in the past, but he could have done way better with many of the aspects.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Acting good - story bad,"I have to credit the acting. It was very well done and I have to say that they are the reason I enjoyed it to a 6. But the story was very slow and very predictable. No shock. No awe. No surprise. Just MEH. This was more of a ""drama"" than an actual ""thriller"". I found A Cure for Wellness had a lot more substance and story than this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fine movie, the actors' performance is everything","The idea behind this movie is an interesting one, another unique story told by M.Night Shyamalan in the manner of 'Unbreakable'. Although the 2 stories are very little related, this is considered as being the sequel.The acting was the best part of tyhe movie, as far as I am concerned. James McAvoy deliveres something special, never seen before in any movie and I really appreciate his performance, making the character seem real. Other performances, such as Anya Taylor-Joy's, who I am a very big fan of, were great and fit well into the dynamic of the movie.There is some unexploied potential in this film. It could have been better with certain decisions, but I will not judge the director's ideas. Overall, I found it interesting and it was worth watching it, mainly because of the great performance of James McAvoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
