Why the narrator? Why? Why? Why?,"Everyone acts very well, and the whole film would have been really good if it hadn't been for this weird narrator the whole way through who sounded like he was telling children a story even when saying things like ""they went to bed together"". It was weird. I also feel if it had been more dialogue based we could have got a greater grasp of the characters. I watched it without subtitles but understood the relationship of Juan Antonio and his ex-wife (mostly spoken in Spanish) than I did of Doug and Vicky which just seemed to lack a huge amount of depth. There needed to be some redeeming feature Vicky and Doug's relationship.Anyway well acted but yeah the narrator ruins it. Javier Bardem is amazing as usual.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entanglements Woody Style,"Barcelona is recognizable enough and exotic enough to frame the latest complication from Woody Allen. Allen himself claims to care very little about films. He doesn't consider them the center of his life. Strange, because I do, Woody Allen without his films is...well I don't know who or what he is. Here he ventures again outside New York in a shape and form that reminded me a little bit of Jacques Rivette. Scarlet Johansson and Rebecca Hall, as the blond and the brunette of the title, make a great pair of opposites or seemingly so. Javier Bardem is the artist that comes to ruffle their world and the spectacular Penelope Cruz (getting better and better with every movie) is the hysterical side of the artist's past. We spend a great deal of time sitting at tables eating and drinking while a voice over guide us through their physical and emotional journey. I was delighted, entertained ever aroused. Woody Allen keeps surprising and he's got it whether he cares about it or not.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A triumphant effort from Woody Allen,"Although this film has bizarrely been described as breezy summer entertainment by some top critics (which leads me to wonder if they saw the same movie I did, or just the first half hour), ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is the closest thing to the sort of examination of relationships that Allen became famous for in quite some time (""Anything Else"" counts, I suppose, but lacks the sharpness this film has), and although it is far from as weighty as some of his dramas or even some of his comedies, this is his first really inspired script in a while, featuring a cast of detailed, well-developed characters, some razor-sharp observations on relationships, and a wicked sense of humor.Although I never thought Woody's work this decade was particularly poor (other than ""Cassandra's Dream"" and although I'm in a minority ""Match Point""), it has mostly been completely inconsequential and almost entirely dependent on broad characterizations and heavy plotting rather than real people and awkwardly comic situations (which has always been Allen's strong suit). A career-best performance from Scarlett Johansson, a wickedly entertaining turn from Penelope Cruz, and the absolute revelation that is Rebecca Hall form a great cast along with Javier Bardem in a role that may surprise the majority of the American public (well, for most of the movie, anyway). You can feel Allen's mark on their mannerisms, but they all seem to disappear into these characters, that's how good they are.I'm keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, because it's really worth going into the theater not expecting anything in particular and savoring the film's often unexpected but never contrived plot twists and turns. All you should know is that Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) go to Barcelona for the summer and things get complicated when they meet a charming, mysterious, and rich painter (Javier Bardem) and he makes a rather upfront proposition to both of them. It's best if you know nothing of how Cruz' character impacts the film prior to watching it.In relation to Allen's other work I thought it was interesting that he never attempted to analyze sex. The whole movie is in many ways about sex, and there is a lot of the expected philosophical and psychological examination of the relationships between the characters in the film, but sex itself is never analyzed as it is in much of Allen's work, and is instead treated as the impenetrable mystery it is. That said, Allen's script is extraordinarily nuanced, something that I haven't expected from his writing in a while. Sure, the characters still represent opposing romantic philosophies, but there's a spark in the writing that makes these feel like real people as opposed to mere characters. That spark, that chemistry is there throughout ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", it's there in the vibrant cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, it's there in the performances, it's there in the shot composition, and it's there in the editing, and in pretty much anything else I haven't mentioned yet.The first forty minutes or so of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" may be the sort of romantic comedy (very good romantic comedy, at that) that the advertising campaign seems to suggest it is, but for the rest of the film there's the sort of pessimistic optimism that colors much of Allen's work (if that makes sense, pretend you didn't read it if it didn't), and let's just say it doesn't end well for these characters. There's real complexity and intensity in this film, and all I have to say is this: Woody Allen is back, the perceptive, intelligent examiner of the human heart, that is, not what we've had for the past while. To say this is one of his best films would be ignoring the fact that through the 70's and 80's he pretty much made nothing but great films, but I can at least say that this is on par with some of his better work.8.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
"It's not all that, but it is a good bag of chips!","Vicky Christina Barcelona isn't quite the work of genius that several critics are making it out to be, but it is Woody Allen's most solid film in nearly a decade and by far his sexiest.I will admit that the claims that it's his best movie in 20 years may have raised my expectations unfairly. After all, the past two decades has brought us Sweet and Lowdown (inspired Sean Penn and Samantha Morton), Another Woman (inspired Gena Rowlands), Husbands and Wives (inspired Judy Davis), Bullets Over Broadway (""Don't Speak!"") and what, in my humble opinion, is his most extraordinary film ever: Crimes and Misdemeanors.That said, there is much in the film's Plus Column. Bardem has never been sexier in English. Rebecca Hall is a sublime revelation. Scarlett Johansson does her most consistent and least grating work since Girl With the Pearl Earring. The supporting cast is a treasure trove of great character actors: Kevin Dunn (usually but effectively charmless), Chris Messina (a complicated mix of sexy and dull), Pablo Schreiber (virtually a cameo), and Patricia Clarkson (earthy, tragic and terrific as always).And then there's Penelope Cruz. Incapable of wrong-doing in my eyes since All About My Mother, she is everything you've heard she is. At first, the character appears to be another version of Rahda Mitchell's bad Melinda only dark and Spanish. But she evolves and blossoms, like a mushroom cloud in slow motion.The story is simple and the structure is a bit unwieldy. As a result, the film feels longer than it is and while it does saunter, it's never boring. The screenplay seems more concerned with re-arranging the configurations of lovers and exploring its themes than it does with sustaining the dramatic tension.The films only significant, though ultimately not fatal, flaw is Miss Johansson. For the legions who thought Javier Bardem could generate romantic and sexual chemistry with anyone or anything, well, I have bad news. When she is sharing the screen with both Bardem and Cruz, Johansson's limitations as an actor and as a screen presence.Ultimately, though, Vicky Christina Barcelona is still a worthwhile endeavor. An enjoyable romp filled the requisite angst and passion of Woody Allen's better efforts. Best of all, there's Spain and Barcelona. The landscapes, people and architecture provide even more spectacular real estate porn than Melinda & Melinda. Not only does it make you want to go to Barcelona, it will make you feel like you've lived there and loved it.Despite its unevenness,",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I'm famous for my intolerance.""","Vicky (a neurotic and sexy Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (a neurotic and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) are two American tourists in Spain examining their differing views on love in Woody Allen's breezy and alluring ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". Amidst a tempestuous summer in Barcelona, the ladies are both seduced by a free-thinking painter (a perfect Javier Bardem) whose own life is complicated by his still passionate relationship with his ex-wife (a devastating Penelope Cruz, who has never looked more beautiful).Much like the change from New York City to London invigorated Allen in ""Match Point"", this vacation to Spain has revived some of the director's more artistic aspirations. The scenery is postcard perfect but drenched in that same dizzying lushness that made Allen's view of NYC so intoxicating in ""Manhattan"". The churches, the homes, the art museums, the countryside, the intimate city streets and touristy details make you feel like you are visiting Barcelona along with Allen and his cast.There's also sharpness to the trademark Woody dialog that has been missing for quite some time. Like all of Allen films, this one is endlessly talky, but there's some great subversion when certain lines that seem like throw-aways actually pack a punch when given a second thought. When Bardem first attempts to talk Johansson's character into bed, he says something clich√©d about her being hard to please. Quick witted, Johansson replies, ""I'm famous for my intolerance."" She says it casually, but it packs a bite as it's the complete antithesis of her character's outward desire to be someone who rallies against cultural norms, and she presents herself as someone who is easy-going and tolerant of all.Allen also displays a keen sense of pacing when he creates tension in his build up to Cruz's appearance after her character is endlessly talked about but never seen until about half way through the film. When Cruz finally arrives, her moody whirling dervish of a performance is the perfect spice to liven up the soupy proceedings. Her seething, fiery line readings combined with looks that could kill make her the front-runner for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars.The baseline archetypal characters are essentially clich√©d, but the way in which Allen handles all of their interpersonal relationships is fairly sophisticated and entertaining even when it grows absurd. There is of course that kiss between Scarlett and Penelope but also some moments of Lynchian-lite when Allen photographs the brunette Hall and blonde Johansson similarly to make them seem like they are two sides of the same woman. There's even more weirdness when die-hard Woody fans realize that in some perverse way Scarlett Johansson's character is the ""Woody"" part--as in any film he does not star, there is always one character who represents the part he would've played had he been in it. However, film buffs will enjoy some of the nice touches like when Hall and another go to see Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (one of my all time favorite films) or the repetitive use of a Spanish guitar in the soundtrack whenever Bardem and Hall get together. But then there's the mostly unnecessary voice-over narration that fills in expository gaps and shows Allen can still be a lazy tactician.Woody Allen has always been an acquired taste, even more so in his latter years when he sometimes forgets how to provoke, but his fans should be delighted with this latest European flavored effort. In the end, you'll feel like Javier Bardem is the luckiest man in the world, Penelope Cruz is operating at the echelon of her appeal, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, well, they'll always have Barcelona.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I've been waiting for the past 7 films to find the old woody.,"I just got back from a free screening of this movie. Wonderful, brilliant, thought provoking, funny, great story in the way only Woody Allen could do. The acting was great, the writing was great, the story was great. As well as the fact that it wasn't a poor rehash of Crimes and Misdemeanors like Match Point and Cassandra's Dream. So refreshing on all levels. Javier Bardem embodies the character and truly allows me to forget about his role in Old Country. Patricia Clarkson, a gem as always. The girls were all great. Had not been impressed with Scarlett Johansson since Lost in Translation and was bored with her work in the last of his films but she held her own and did the part great.

"Overly Intellectualized, Forced Drama","6 February 2009. Vicky Christina Barcelona The title of the movie refers to the names of two young women, Vicky and Christina who visit Barcelona Spain and encounter an attractive, brash, seductive, and articulate Spanish man who raises doubts and well as insights in these women. Unfortunately the movie is severely hampered by a distracting, unnecessary voice over, opens earlier with a nice but repetitious musical rendition, and the overly incessant voice of Woody Allen who wrote and directed the movie. It is almost inescapable from experiencing the women artificially parroting Mr. Allen's unique way of thinking and talking which only adds to the awkwardness of the movie.The voice-over is so basically repetitious explaining most of the particulars of what is going on in the movie that it interferes with the acting and expressive ability to allow the performers from telling the story. The movie experience is like having to sit through to separate and parallel portrayal of the same events. The voice-over only serves to either implicitly send out the message that the audience is either too dumb to understand what's going on or the actors are so bad that they can't perform sufficient to relay the story by themselves. A good example is the severe but perhaps unjustified criticism of the voice-over narrative (relatively scarce actually) in Blade Runner (1982) which in that movie provided additional mental thoughts of Harrison Ford that added substance to the movie instead of just supplanted or stated the obvious as in this movie.And why the use of the flashback to reveal an additional relational subplot? To its credit, Vicky Christina Barcelona eventually evolves into a more in-depth and meaningful look at the consequences, complications of relationships often overlooked or skimmed over in other dramatic or romantic comedies. However, this relational ""situational"" marriage theme was also explored with the release the same year (2008) of ""Revolutionary Road"" with as much or more intensity or cinematic impact dealing with a 1950s period piece starring Leo DeCaprio and Kate Winslet who are provided with a script that allows them freedom to act the roles and lives they are portraying instead of Allen's intellectualizing musing of these deep relational uneasy themes.The last part of the movie is cinematically different from the rest of the movie, more hurried, more explanatory, more quickly edited - sort like pushing out a work in progress. By the end, this rather long slice of life piece ends up dissatisfying unable to quench the thirst of an experiential series of events, and neither do the characters in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a Sensual and Thought-Provoking Masterpiece,"""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"": A Sensuous and Thought-Provoking MasterpieceWoody Allen's 2008 film ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a sensual and thought-provoking masterpiece that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer's psyche. The film follows the lives of two American women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), who go on a summer vacation to Barcelona and get entangled with a seductive artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and his emotionally volatile ex-wife Maria Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz).The film is visually stunning, with the breathtaking landscapes of Spain serving as a backdrop to the complex and intense relationships between the characters. The performances by the entire cast are outstanding, but it's Pen√©lope Cruz's portrayal of the mercurial Maria Elena that steals the show. Her raw emotions and fiery temperament bring a visceral quality to the film that makes it impossible to look away.Allen's masterful writing captures the intricacies of human relationships, exploring the complexities of love, desire, and the search for fulfillment. The film is both witty and poignant, with moments of levity juxtaposed with deep introspection.At its core, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a meditation on the human experience and the mysteries of the heart. It raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of love and the choices we make in life. The film's themes and characters linger in the mind long after the credits roll, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.In short, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. It is a film that will stay with you long after you've watched it, and a testament to Woody Allen's enduring talent as a filmmaker.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining but I'm not sure what the award noms are about,"Woody Allen gives us a slight, unassuming treatise on love. One of the title characters recently finished a 12-minute film about love, we are told early on, and it felt like that was to be a mirror of the larger story.Lust, passion, love, desire, betrayal, pride and fulfillment are all examined from a variety of viewpoints and with a variety of outcomes.Interestingly, though, I never felt like Allen was attached to the action in the movie or passing judgment on it: None of these approaches to love is presented as better or worse than the others, none of them has the impact of ""the right way to love."" Because of the detachment, some viewers might feel adrift -- as it is, I enjoy movies that just show me stuff without telling me what the author thinks is right.As nice as it all was, I don't get the award buzz. The movie wasn't superb or terribly memorable, and everyone was good but not outstanding. These weren't unique or even all that interesting characters, and the actors gave them only the depth they deserved.Still, if you like romance, this has some nice scenes and is a bit playful and enjoyable to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An excellent Woody Allen film that comes from a smart and sexy script, delivered with beautiful filming and strong performances from all","I watched this film a few days after I had seen Allen's previous effort, Cassandra's Dream, and I must admit that I was going through a bit of a spell with him because, over the last decade I have almost had to defend his films that I have liked, while also acknowledging the man that are average or worse. However, like Spike Lee, I rarely find a film of his that isn't worth seeing ¬ñ whether it is any good or not being another question. Vicky Cristina Barcelona was out in the US and the fact that I had access to a Woody Allen film suggested that it was better than some of his more recent work (a lot of which I never got the chance to see in any cinema) but I was also wary because this film was well-known for one specific thing and I figured that perhaps it was being helped by that, with the studio hoping the ""A Woody Allen film"" tag wouldn't put the teenage male crowd off paying to see what they came for!I needn't have worried because it is like the man behind Cassandra's Dream and this film cannot be the same person. It is a excellent film and one that Allen's fans will love and perhaps, just perhaps, it may even be good enough to win over those that wouldn't give him the time of day far less the price of a cinema ticket. It helps that the film is firmly back on themes that Allen has done so well in the past ¬ñ matters of the heart, of passion, of love, of lust, of marriage. The whole film plays in its entirety just like one of the many ""discussion"" scenes where the characters discuss these matters over coffee etc and it is this consistency that makes it such a joy because what we see minute to minute engages and that is pretty much what we get from the film as a whole ¬ñ but not as a sum of the parts but as the whole producing the same as the parts but in a different way. This interests me and it is delivered with a colour and flamboyance that somehow never takes away from the intelligence and thoughtfulness behind the writing; I'm not sure how he did it because the narrative is so wild that it could easily have been silly, but he holds it together without it even looking difficult.The use of a narrator concerned me at first ¬ñ particularly since I had just seen Allen S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G everything out in big dialogue chunks in Cassandra's Dream but on the contrary here the narrator is used to link and mostly compliments by being droll and being a great voice (good casting job there). The cast are what will attract an audience to this film and, beyond them just being some very big names, they are all excellent. Bardem is just so effortlessly sexual and sensual that he perfectly fits Allen's writing of this passionate, creative love versus the steady and frankly dull love of Messina's Doug. Hall essentially takes the traditional Allen role but makes it work more than others trying it have done. She doesn't take the mannerisms so much as getting the character right and she is the heart of the film, thrown between passionate love and reliable love. No question which Cruz represents and she does it really, really well. Out of sight for the majority of the film she strikes like a thunder storm, totally wild and full of fire ¬ñ but not to the point where she is unattractive or not tempting, which would have taken away from what she was trying to be. Johansson is easily the least of these talented names but even she does well; I won't say brilliant but she was good. Again, Welch was a good choice for narrator and I always enjoy Clarkson even if she has limited times to shine here.Allen's direction is really good in regards the actors but of equal note is how he and Spanish cinematographer Aguirresarobe have delivered Barcelona to the viewer. The city contributed towards the making of the film and on the evidence of this it will be money well spent. The city looks beautiful, with great landscapes, plenty of colour to match the passion and a real sense that this is a place where art, passion and inspired sex is all around. Beyond being just wallpaper, this is of course a key part of the film's world and it is another part of the reason that this hooked me so easily.Vicky Cristina Barcelona will likely be gushed over in the same way that any recent Woody Allen that isn't rubbish is hailed as a ""return to form"" etc. On this occasion though, such praise is not a knee-jerk but fully deserved. The film is intelligent, passionate, comic, free-flowing and enjoyably light. It looks the part and the cast take the natural, smart script and make the absolute most of it. I guess if you dislike Woody Allen then none of this will matter but to those that even have a liking for his better work, this film will hit the spot. It has been a while since I have had the words ""excellent"" and ""Woody Allen film"" together in the same sentence, but this is an excellent Woody Allen film.",,Anonymous,Romance
Fairly good,"On vacation in Spain two American girlfriends meet a tall, dark and handsome artist who satisfies their needs in unexpected ways.A curious little romance that putters along until about the halfway mark, when the introduction of a new character adds some tension and darkness. The sensibility is middle class - safe and responsible - so nothing really dramatic is promised and the story resolves on a minor note: not too comfortable, restrained in emotion.The performances are good, particularly from the ex-wife.

"An Open-Minded, Nonjudgmental Portrait of the Boundless Scenarios In Which Love Can Be Found","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is among the cream of the Woody Allen crop, in the midst of Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Match Point. It may even be a wiser film than any of them. What Woody has done throughout his film career is seek the answers to his own life questions in any number of ways. Some later films contradict the philosophical implications of previous ones. Some reaffirm them. His foremost theme has always been the complications of love and sex, and this ultimately genre-less film that I suppose could be considered a romantic seriocomedy may be his magnum opus of his sexual and romantic revelations.Vicky, played by Rebecca Hall, and Cristina, by Scarlet Johansson, go to Barcelona for the summer, settling with Vicky's distant relative (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband. A Narrator, present all through the film, the particular matter-of-fact likes of which Allen has never before used, illustrates the two friends: Vicky is no-nonsense and conservative in her attitude toward love and commitment, engaged to the dependable but less than passionate yuppie. She is in Barcelona getting her masters, and is deeply stirred by Spanish guitar. Cristina, in contrast, is impulsive and irresolute of what she wants in life. She is just out of a relationship and wants to forget about her experience making a short film about Love, perhaps a nod to Woody's own admitted negative reflections on his previous works.At an art exhibition, these two symbolically contrasting women observe a notorious painter, played with suavity and charisma by Javier Bardem. Cristina is immediately fascinated with him, and grows captivated when she and Vicky learn that he has undergone a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later, the girls spot him in a restaurant, where he stoically approaches their table and unexpectedly invites them to go along with him to Oviedo, where they will tour, wine, dine and, with any luck, make love. Straight away Cristina consents, Vicky refuses, but Vicky is is ultimately persuaded and the twosome go with the self- designed artistic and drifting romantic on a small private plane through a rainstorm.What follows is a free-flowing rectangle of romance with any combination of Bardem, Vicky, Cristina, and Bardem's unmanageably volatile ex-wife Penelope Cruz, who deserves an Oscar nomination for her work here. There are many ways in which the two American women change for the better and change not at all. One facet of the story is a clash of conventional American and liberated European cultures. Another is spiritual freedom, signified by Vicky's conventional reticence and thus conflicted feelings that she may be missing out on so much, and Cristina's mutability. A lesser title for the movie but an apt one nonetheless could have been Why Not?Woody is expressing through his characters his urge to be free of all psychological and emotional restrictions. In any case, characters as open as Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem's seem to need similarly adaptable significant others. I find it interesting that Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Woody's women, all brought out their inner nebbishes due to intimate involvement with him, as in his eagerness to lift a lover's state of mind, he ends up, sooner or later, virtually turning his woman roughly into a female version of himself. Johansson and Hall's summer in Spain, if anything, releases them from the sludge of mediocrity, particularly that which results from fear and common custom.By saying all that, I have not even come close to giving anything away. The way things turn out would hardly make sense to characters like Vicky, or her fianc√©, and that is what makes it a natural flow from the heart. Woody Allen's brilliantly written, guilelessly directed and convincingly acted Spanish debut-and-swan song is not a comedy for the same reasons as nearly every other comedy Woody has made. It is a comedy essentially because of the culture clash. The film depends on our reactions to things that really are not inherently funny except to unaccustomed eyes. Likewise, the bewildered Americans are just as funny from the other side of the gamut. Without any doubt in my mind, this is not only Woody Allen's best film in years, but one of his very best of his entire 42-film, 42-year career as a writer-director of consistently good films.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen New and Fresh at 72,"Principled monogamists may not like this film. Not only does it show its primary characters in relationships with multiple partners but, with one exception, they are quite open with each other about it. Allen suggests both that romantic happiness is best achieved with more than one person and that it is necessarily ephemeral (I wonder what his young wife, Soon-Yi Previn, thinks). He says in a Los Angeles Times interview with Rachel Abramowitz that Vicky Cristina Barcelona is, ultimately, ""a very sad film.""If so, it may be the brightest sad film ever made. All of the actors are at their best and make immediate connections with the audience. With the exception of an unnecessary voice-over narration (in which Gaud√≠ is mispronounced with stress on the initial syllable), the self-conscious affectations that haunt some of Allen's films are absent. Fine actors are allowed to speak for themselves. According to the Abramowitz interview, Allen ""never talked to the actors, other than to give them stage directions."" The resulting feel is often one of brilliant improvisation.The complex romantic relationships among its four primary characters are what the movie's mostly about and I won't spoil it by going into them. Patricia Clarkson, however, deserves mention for her role as Judy Nash, the middle-aged wife of an American couple who are friends of Vicky's parents and with whom solid Vicky and impetuous Cristina stay in Barcelona (though Cristina soon moves in with the charismatic artist, Juan Antonio). Judy is married to a dull but steady man, somewhat similar to the man that Vicky is about to wed. Vicky confides to Judy about her uncharacteristic fling with Juan Antonio. Judy advises Vicky to reap her passion while she can and arranges another meeting between the two. All of this is low-keyed and entirely believable.As the movie's title suggests, it's about Barcelona as well as Vicky and Cristina. There are many outdoor shots of the city, especially of Gaud√≠'s Park G√ºell. They amount to more than a minor travelogue because structures that are usually photographed in isolation appear with everyday crowds of people. Like Bruges in the movie In Bruges, the city is more than scenic background. Though never mentioned explicitly, Barcelona's anarchist past bubbles to the surface.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The narration ruined the film,"Vicki and Christina have an opportunity to spend the summer in Barcelona. Vicki is to marry in the Fall, and Christina is more of a free spirit.

Therefore it was really unnecessary to have a narrator explain some of the finer points, as the story told itself quite well. Antonio comes into the scene, changing everything. Antonio had a rather unstable wife, who is the real wild card in this movie. It became fun seeing how each of them would handle the situations as they developed, and as complications were tossed in.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's Spanish Triumph,"""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" (2008), a new film written/directed by Woody Allen, is a charming dramedy/romance that takes place during one summer in the capital of Spanish Province, Catalonia, Barcelona which is known as Antonio Gaudi's city. Allen has moved even further away from Manhattan but in his new film, the characters and their dilemmas remind a lot of the Manhattanites from his best pictures with their neuroses, search for love and meaning of life, and their ironic dialogues. We also meet two Spanish characters here played by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. Bardem's Juan Antonio is a popular bohemian painter who would take a serious place in the lives of two American tourists, young women named Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Christina (Allen's current Muse and inspiration, Scarlet Johansson. He is certainly in love with her voluptuous figure and especially her sensual lips. The male characters in at least two his films with Ms. Johansson repeat the same exact compliment to her lips. Time will tell if she ever gives performances as memorable, moving and subtle as Diane's or Mia's or Dianne's). Cruz was easily the best part of the delightful movie. As an estranged wife of Bardem's Juan Antonio, she created the force of nature out of her character. She was unbelievably good - crazy, sexy, beautiful, passionate. She and Bardem stole the show and redefined the term ""On screen chemistry"". Forget Vicky Christina - it should be called Maria Elena Barcelona - after Cruz's character. To her belongs the most hilarious ""A deus ex machina"" scene in the end of the movie that I've seen for long time. Penelope Cruz MUST play in either Spanish movies or in Woody's movies. She reminds me of a Greek mythological hero, Antaeus, the son of Earth. As long as he stayed on Earth, she would give him power and strength to fight Heracles, the greatest hero Greece ever knew. Once Heracles pulled him off Earth and kept him on Air, Antaeus' strength was gone. When Cruz plays in her native language in her Country, she is magnificent. When she plays in inferior American movies, she is nothing but a pretty face and a nice body. It was fun to see how good and effortless Bardem is in a romantic dramedy after his scary Oscar winning turn with the bad haircut and deadly air gun in ""No country for Old Men"". There is also Patricia Clarkson in a supporting role, talented, reliable, and subtle. Barcelona is a dream. I've been there in 2000 and I still regret that we had to leave to continue our tour. The Gaudi buildings and Park G√ºell are alone worth the price of admission. Spanish guitar music would kill you softly with its melodious passion. What is there not to like? For this Allen's devoted fan, ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is a dream come true.It is interesting that Allen himself considers Vicky Cristina Barcelona ""a very sad film."" Yes, it is sad because like in many Allen's films, the characters would not get the answers for their questions. And being truly, deeply, madly in love would not make a couple happy because mad love creates such charged and heated atmosphere between them that they simply can't survive in it. The words of another famous cynic come to mind, ""A Man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her"", and this is a sad realization. What is not sad, though that Allen at the age of 72 still knows how to make a marvelous movie, to which his Spanish project is a glorious proof.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Discovers Space Jazz,"You never know what he is going to do next, but you can be sure that whether we like it or not, a lot of thought will have gone into it.This time a lot of adventure too.Add these three elements:-- among the several masteries he has is the way he can imbue a film with the sense of place, allowing that to penetrate, to saturate. I think he did this with New York before he realized it. Now, even though it is clearly uncomfortable, he is traveling the world looking for other places.Unfortunately, there are few places on the planet that are as visually keyed to emotions as Manhattan. London. Barcelona.I'm really pleased to see him still pushing himself, still placing himself outside his previous success. Here, he works with a person as place. It's a challenging cinematic experiment.-- he merges this experiment with another that he and others have mastered: a single character appearing in three personalities. He only does two at a time in all three combinations. And again it is autobiographical. All Woody is.His three types of women who collectively compose his complex character here are played by Scarlett with whom he clearly has a quiet sexual passion. Here she is adventuresome enough to enter his cinematically composed she-being as essentially sexual being. Her occupation is continuously improving photography which (with painting) Woody and others often conflate with film-making.His second woman is too predictable to describe. Woody has entered Almodovar territory, physically, sexually and emotionally. Cruz merely has to show up in her passionate Almadovar kit. She's an emotional basketcase, a sexual genius, a painter.The third woman is the new bit in this equation. She's the most attractive, the most self aware. Where the film is sets about watching the exploration of selves in place, she is a student of that place. She is the one who sees and fears and yet indulges. She is the true love, or rather her existence is what makes love possible.Her occupation is the ""study"" of Catalon culture.The radical observation here is that she leaves the place, this empowering it.-- and of course the third grand element is not that this is Barcelona, but Gaudi's Barcelona. The place is only accidentally a physical place. It's really a spatial philosophy that suits (and indeed invented) the notion of superimposed ambiguous sexual emotions on space.We are, for all the womanly registration scenes, in Gaudi spaces, either physically or by reference. Energies from the soul recorded, enticed and charmed from the forms we see in two dimensions.If Woody ever were to do a three D movie, this would be the one. Alas, he passes. And he omits the most complex and life- changing place, the crypt of the unfinished chapel. Shame on his advisers.This is essential Tedg stuff. Introspection. Complex love, it's relationship to attraction, what it means to be a woman and how that can be traced in cinematic architectural sex.As a Woodyfold, it ranks with my other subtle favorite which it may well replace in my pantheon of essential films ""Sweet and Lowdown.""Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Love Triangle... or Rectangle,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is the story of a four people struggling to understand what love is or what the feelings they have mean. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are Americans spending a summer in Barcelona. They meet Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) a painter who embodies the concept of European free love. They fall into an unusual love triangle, complicated by Vicky's engagement. It gets even more complicated when Juan Antonio's crazy ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) is thrown into the mix.What makes Vicky Cristina Barcelona different from most love triangle movies, is that there is no animosity between the characters. They are not in competition with each other, they are merely trying to find themselves. Everyone gives a great performance, particularly Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz. Woody Allen is working in his element here are makes a few choices that are unorthodox, but effective. Most notable is his use of a narrator throughout in the manner that was common in the 40s and 50s. The narrator relays plot points that could be conveyed in a quick scene, but rather that interrupt the flow, they are narrated in transitions.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very impressive Woody Allen film...,"Though definitely not for all tastes, depending on whether you relate to the characters and the story. Woody Allen has done better than Vicky Cristina Barcelona, especially Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Husbands and Wives, but it is one of his better films in the past 15 years(very hit-and-miss at this point) along with Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't perfect, it has a very abrupt ending but most problematic was the narration, which was completely pointless and it does feel patronising when you're been told what's happening like little schoolchildren- that's how it was delivered anyway- when it is being shown very clearly. There is no personal bias against narration, providing they move the story forward, but not when it adds nothing and just succeeds in over-explaining things like it does here. However, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is beautifully filmed and the locations are just gorgeous, making you wish you were there in Barcelona. The music score is both relaxing and infectious, and Allen's direction is accomplished. The film is brilliantly written narration aside, the dialogue is witty and thoughtful, by all means it doesn't break new ground but it still has a lot to say and does so in an entertaining and honest way. The story is a slow-burner but the way the characters interact and the way the relationships develop make it a largely compelling one at the same time, complex they are too and while the situations are fairly sensitive in the first place they are relatable as well. The characters are stereotypical(but mostly not that crudely, though judging from what I've read people will disagree with that) and typically neurotic but as is also typical of Allen they are very real as well. The acting is never less than very good, Patricia Clarkson standing out in support but the four leads dominate and all four impress. Penelope Cruz steals the show, she's rarely been lovelier and she always has been a beautiful woman, she is very funny and is fully immersed into the drama. Her scenes with Javier Bardem are among the film's best scenes. Bardem is effortlessly sexy that you completely understand the attraction, and he does very well at being sympathetic and seductive. Rebecca Hall plays a conflicted character and somehow succeeds in making her likable, her accent is fine. Scarlett Johansson is not as good as the other three, having to play the character that we in a way relate to the least but she is very sultry and compassionate and doesn't look uncomfortable at all. In conclusion, not among Allen's best films but very impressive stuff. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A funny and entertaining comedy with grandstanding acting, being co-produced by Spain and USA","Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) visit Barcelona for the summer, staying with Vicky's relative Judy (Patricia Clarkson) and her hubby Mark (Kevin Dunn). Vicky is engaged to the reliable executive Doug (Chris Messina). While Cristina, on the other hand, is spontaneous and unsure of what she wants in life, and for now he has no marital commitments, wanting to live and enjoy to the fullest. Later on, there's a twisted concoction of a plot spinning around larger-than-life lothario Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who sets hearts of the two girls burning. Describes Life is the ultimate work of art !.This is a light-hearted, saucy and fun romp around conflicting ideas of what a good relationship must be and most of the humour is situational. After his successful Manhattan comedies, Woody Allen moved London where he made more serious (Match point, Scoop, Cassandra dream) than previous ones and later on, Barcelona, France (Midnight in Paris, Magic in the Moonlight) and Rome (To Rome with love) where he went on making amusing comedies. The plot is simple and plain , Vicky: Hall and Cristina: Johansson arrive in Barcelona city to stay at the expat residence de Judy: Patricia Clarkson and Mark: Kevin Dunn and a series of loving events happen. This time Allen moves from N. Y. to Barcelona and he displays his tourist-eye view of the Catalan city, all guitars and Gaudi monuments , it is justified by the wonderful location and the production results to be mostly Spanish, financed by producer Jaime Roures. The story relies heavily on a narrator (voice of Christopher Evan Welch), who presents throughout the film the various happenings. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' shows a comic view and scathingly serious of modern relationships in urban Barcelona and about a pair of US beautiful women vacationing in Spain, enthralled by Spanish culture and a peculiar bohemian painter. The sympathetic main andsupport cast are pretty good. Rebecca Hall plays the sensible Vicky , while Johansson is the passionate Cristina, Javier as the seducer who fires an indecent proposal at Vicky and Cristina and sets their hearts on fire. But the honours of performance go to Penelope Cruz as Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's fiery ex-wife, who goes back to the scene late in the day and steals the show .The motion picture was well directed by Woody Allen, although it is excessively talky, and not showing too much of Allen's peculiar personal world. In the beginning Woody made usually hilarious films with hardly any personal comments about his own life in which he used to act, such as : ¬®What's Up, Tiger Lily?¬®, ¬®Take the money and run¬®, ¬®Pussycat, Pussycat I Love You¬®, ¬®Sleeper¬®, ¬®Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask¬®, among others . Subsequently he made several masterpieces. Including a series of movies in which he provided nice direction, investing care enough, wit and warmth, such as : ¬®Crimes and misdemeanors¬®, ¬®New York stories¬®, ¬®September¬®, ¬®Radio Days¬®, ¬®Hanna and her sisters¬®, ¬®Broadway Danny Rose¬®, ¬®Zelig¬®, ¬®Stardust memories¬®, ¬®A midsummer Night's Sex Comedy¬®, ¬®Interiors¬®, ¬®Purple rose of Cairo¬®, ¬®Manhattan¬®,¬®Melinda Melinda¬®and many others . His best movie is ¬®Annie Hall¬®, Allen's most awarded, the Oscars voters were impressed and awarded various statuettes, winner among many other awards, of the Oscar for Best film, Direction, Script and Lead Actress. Rating Vicky Cristina Barcelona(2008) 6/10 . Better than average. The movie will appeal to Woody Allen entusiasts and and fans of the leading quartet: Hall, Johansson, Bardem, Cruz .",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic Woody,"Who knows what to expect from Woody Allen? Most of the films he's made this decade have been pretty unpredictable, and suspiciously Allen has agreed with the public reaction regarding most of them. I thought Melinda and Melinda was a fine, worthwhile effort, Scoop was just mostly mediocre, Match Point was the best film of Allen's career, and Cassandra's Dream was easily the worst he's made. So considering his recent schizophrenic attitude, I wasn't sure where I'd go with this film, but I was still looking forward to it, mostly for Cruz's supposed Oscar-worthy performance and, well, you gotta give the guy credit after so many years of brilliant comedies, and even his failures being interesting failures.The film centers around two best friends (Vicky and Cristina) who decide to spend the Summer in Barcelona, and while there they are both faced with romantic conflicts with an artist, Juan Antonio, who has invited them to his home for the weekend to get to know each other and have sex. But it's not a love/hate, conventional jealous-romance-plot, it's situations are entirely human and almost brooding in a sort of loosely ardent manner. A lot goes on between their relationships, especially with Cristina, who develops among the strangest love circles ever put on film which I'd rather not give away. Vicky, who is about to get married, forms a sudden attraction towards Juan, but I never really saw it as sexual attraction, but rather as an escape from the knowledge of the desolate reality of commitment. Oh, and did I mention Juan's psychotic manic-depressive ex-wife eventually comes into the picture? Despite the absurdity of the entire situation, the whole thing is executed with definitive authenticity. Part of that may be because of the natural dialogue, which was right off the bat the obvious work of Woody Allen. The perfect dialogue combined with the absurdity of the situation created several absolutely perfect moments of comedic timing. It's characters are smart and human, not just self-aware variations of clich√©'d romantic comedy characters. It's situations are not tired and consistently replicated ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl"" plots, but an episodic stream of events packed with energy and originality just about every other romantic comedy this year seemed to lack.But alas, not all was perfect. The film's narrator spoke with an irritatingly robotic tone, along with narration being entirely pointless from the start, and I also thought the film spent too long expressing Vicky's passionless relationship with her husband (which in a way, may have been intentional)... but it's an otherwise tiny flaw which hardly detracted from the overall joyful experience Woody has provided. And yes, give Cruz that Oscar.8.75/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Appealing rumination on romance from Woody Allen.,"Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are two sexy young American tourists taking a summer holiday in Spain. They are both drawn (reluctantly, at first, for Vicky) to a lusty, soulful Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Things threaten to get even more sticky when Juan Antonios' ex-wife Maria Elena (Oscar-winning Penelope Cruz), an unstable artist, re-enters the picture.""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a pretty good depiction of different approaches to love, romance, and affairs, as well as functioning as a fantastic travelogue. Obviously, it would be hard to knock any film with so much aesthetic value and attractive women as this picture has going for it. Writer / director Woody Allen makes sure to keep characters and situations reasonably realistic, giving his story a good foundation. Of course, it does get a real shot in the arm in the second half with Cruz' entrance into the picture. Her fiery performance is quite intoxicating.But the whole cast is fine. Juan Antonio may be a passionate sort of guy, but he also has no desire to be a home-wrecker given that Vicky is already engaged to another man (Chris Messina). Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn round out a main cast in this yarn of people struggling to find their version of happiness.Accompanied by a lovely musical soundtrack, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" may not be on the same level as Allen's weightiest works, but it's far from being mere fluff. It's actually a pretty intelligent script backed up by very attractive settings.This viewers' only annoyance was with the ever-present, and largely unnecessary, voice-over narration.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost comedic in some ways,"The story is a classic example of how a Hollywood script can be so pretentious. There's too many instances where the script completely disregard real human nature and proposes and promotes sheer carelessness and egotistical indulgence over clear thinking. Yet, as I play along and continue watching, I find the movie to be more and more comedic. It's especially so since the story becomes more and more predictable as the movie goes on. Yet the almost hypocritical presentation of the story developments did crack some laughs and made the movie funny for me. The bad thing is that the filmmakers really didn't pay any attention to the more natural story development and just went away with their own somewhat perverted imaginations. The acting overall feels like a standard romance movie job. Scarlett Johansson did just enough to portray her insecure character and Rebecca Hall did enough in portraying her character's deep anxiety. Javier Bardem did better in his action roles than this kind of character.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
He's BACK!,"Woody's back!...and he seems to have finally grown up. I was a huge WA fan back in the 80s when he was banging out stellar works like Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes & Misdemeanors and Husbands & Wives...but remember these works were quite dark in attitude. I thought he had a few amusing efforts in the 90s...mainly Bullets over Broadway, Mighty Aphrodite and Celebrity...but, again, these works were written by an author who is sad and distraught about the impossibility of 'happily ever after.' To be quite frank, I was bored with all his movies this century including Match Point (which I thought was a rehashed version of Crimes & Misdemeanors...minus the laughs).In Vicky Cristina Barcelona WA seems to have finally found his mature outlook on passion, love, and romance. He is now a REALIST. I was overwhelmed by the line, ""The only true love is unrequited love."" He nailed it. Only the lack of resolution can make passion last. Otherwise it either fades or turns into negative emotions such as anger and resentment. These are the same themes Shakespeare examined in A Midsummer Nights Dream. And like that great play, VCB acknowledges that love and passion are a glorious part of life, but doesn't try to pretend that love is perfect or that 'happily ever after' really exists...the movie remains grounded in realism without becoming morose at the end like some of WA's earlier films.The writing is witty, intelligent and intense. The acting is superb (especially Javier Bardem who is a truly GREAT actor). The directing is brilliant and subtle...notice how many times Vicky changes clothes before meeting Juan Antonio which epitomizes her desire for this man AND her confusion about her feelings. Also, Woody seems to have finally dropped his beloved Jazz, which I always found distracting, out-of-place and annoying in most of his earlier movies (the Gershwin in Manhattan being a notable exception).After seeing this movie I went on Amazon and purchased the 3 box Woody Allen DVD collection. Woody's finally back in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nice surprise.,"Romantic comedies are not my genre of choice. I find them predictable. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' turned out to be a pleasant surprise in its unpredictability. The casting was also very well done, with excellent performances, and a good script.The film follows best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) going to Barcelona for their summer holiday. They stay with Vicky's relatives Judy and Mark. Being into art, Mark invites the girls along to an art exhibition, where they are told about artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem).While dining in a restaurant one evening, Juan Antonio comes up to Vicky and Cristina and invite them to Oviedo for the weekend, and hoping to have a threesome with them. While Vicky - who is engaged to be married - is offended, Cristina finds the invitation rather exciting and alluring.Against her will, Vicky joins. What follows is an interesting character study, and events that take unexpected turns - just like life itself. Its also a journey of discovery in so many ways. I loved the film's narration, which was a bit add, but strangely very effective and quite wonderful, actually. It was like a documentary.Javier Bardem was fantastic as Juan Antonio; I absolutely loved him in the role. Penelope Cruz was wonderful as usual, in the role of Maria Elena, Juan's suicidal ex wife.I must confess to enjoying this romantic comedy much more than expected. It dished up a generous dose of hilarious moments, a bit of drama, and even a few sensual moments. Interesting indeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wonder where everyone earns for a living. I think Vicky had some kind of job.

Hooray For The Woodman,"Good news,good news. Woody Allen has produced a fine,new comedy about two attractive young women who make some (potentially)bad choices in life (but hasn't that been a staple in Woody Allen's films since Annie Hall?). Vicky is an engaged woman,who is touring around Spain with her somewhat impulsive younger friend,Christina, when they are approached by a suave Spanish artist,who attempts to seduce both of them. Vicky is a somewhat conservative & pragmatic,and is happy to be with the man of her dreams (a rather boring & mousy little businessman--but aren't most of them?). Christina,however has a bit of the bohemian in her, and is willing to experiment with life. This makes for a sparkling, sexy cocktail that is lovely to look at (shot on location in Barcelona, and makes nice use of Antonio Gaudi's works of art as a back drop). Woody has done better, but compared with dreck like 'Everybody Says I Love You' (rock bottom Woody Allen musical schmaltz),this is one to keep an eye out for.

Not bad (for a Woody Allen film),"This is probably my favourite Woody Allen film so far, or at least the only one I haven't been absolutely repulsed by. It still feels typically self-indulgent, with the impossibly beautiful cast and the rather manicured depiction of Catalonian life. And while it's much less pronounced than in his other works, the pretentious contrived dialogue creeps in a little too often. But despite this, the film is generally quite enjoyable. The cast, Penelope Cruz especially, are predictably mesmerising and I actually quite like the narration- even if it did feel a bit like a rip-off of Amelie. I very nearly switched it off during the opening credits when I saw Allen's name, but it turned out to be a pleasant enough experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen Still Has It,"Many films attempt to explore the oh-so-clich√©d subject - love. Most of these films fail completely. But Woody Allen has proved time and time again that he really does understand this complex emotion in all it's manifestations, Vicky Cristina Barcelona being no exception.It's refreshing to find films like this which don't shy away from the difficult questions and don't try and give easy answers. Vicky and Cristina are two characters who, unlike the rest of the characters, don't know what they want. Indeed, Cristina at one point says ""All I know is what I don't want""; Vicky and Cristina are truly on a quest for love and happiness.They are opposites in one sense. Vicky's kind of love is about commitment and security whereas Cristina wants the excitement of something alternative and the heart-stopping feeling of romance. Both Cristina and Vicky go through considerable development and at the end of the film they are much less sure about their viewpoint. These different manifestations are given equal weight and it is left up to the viewer to decide which is 'right' or 'for them'. It makes one think deeply about what we want out of life and love.Allen has constructed a beautiful tale which is pleasingly unpredictable. The narration which has received much criticism I didn't mind at all and I would argue that this God-affect adds much more scope and the feeling of destiny to the story.The beauty of the subject matter is reflected in the beauty of the setting. Barcelona is given a chance to shine as the characters experience its sumptuous vitality and magnificent architecture. A story of love always seems to work better in these exotic climates. Perhaps because love itself is exotic and other, like the setting.The fine performances from the whole cast add even more poignancy to the story. The beautiful melancholy of Scarlett Johansson, the creepiness yet seductiveness of Javier Bardem (showing his range), the non-believer then confusion of Rebecca Hall and the intimidating, funny yet beautiful Penelope Cruz.Allen proves again his insight into our deep dilemmas and most yearning desires.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful visuals + superb performances = very good film.,"Over the past decade, every few years, film critics create a lot of buzz by saying that Woody Allen's newest film is a ""return to form."" Since he's been cranking them out at a breakneck pace, (one a year for about forty years) and his glory days of the 1970's have long passed, most often, the common conception has been that Allen's work in the 90's and early 00's has been subpar. Now, I can't speak for that, as I've only seen a handful of Allen films, most of which were made in this decade, but I can say without hesitation that ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a very good film. It's being billed as a romantic comedy, but I don't know that that's completely accurate. Without a doubt, it covers the territory that romantic comedies tend to cover, but I think ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a cut above the conventions of an atypical romantic comedy. To be sure, it's funny, but it's funny in a way that's muted, smart, and respectful of the viewer's intelligence, instead of appealing to the lowest common denominator for big laughs. The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly in the case of Rebecca Hall. I really liked her character, Vicky, and her storyline, and felt that Hall was terrific in the role. I'd love to see her get an Oscar nomination. Bardem, despite Juan Antonio's somewhat implausible behavior, manages to somehow make him a completely believable character. Johansson, who has underwhelmed me in everything I've seen her in since her great work in ""Lost In Translation,"" also turns in a good performance. Her character, Cristina, like Juan Antonio, is also somewhat erratic, but she plays it in such a way that it feels authentic for the complex character that she creates. As for Cruz, she's terrific, and very well might receive an Oscar nomination. Her character, Maria Elena, feels note-perfect. What's even better is that these strong performances were attached to a great screenplay, which I think might garner an Oscar nomination. What amazes me is that Woody Allen, a 72 year-old man from Brooklyn, somehow, someway, found his way into the hearts and minds of so many different people from all walks of life and wrote them in a way that feels spot-on. There are scenes in which some characters are speaking Spanish and others are speaking English and the scene totally works. Additionally, the film looks great. Allen captures Barcelona at its best. He really uses the locations to his advantage, but, at the same time, in the end, I really had invested in the characters and took a lot more out of the film than just a bunch of lovely images. See, at its heart, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a study of the human heart and the reasons and thought processes that people use to make choices, just like the best of Allen's work. We might look at the screen and want to tell the character to stop what they're doing or to just ""go for it,"" but we never for once lose sight of who that person is. This wonderful sense of humanity is a big part of what makes ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" a more than worthy addition to the Woody Allen canon, and even more than that, a very good film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The inevitable mistakes we have the right to commit (It's called Living),"I just saw this film.

Maybe because of the bad reviews I read when it came out. One should never read reviews about a movie that one wants to see. One must go and see it and then, later on, if one so decides, one can read the reviews.Most of them usually disagree so much among themselves that it seems they are talking about different movies!! First of all, having lived myself in Barcelona during 15 years I must say I was constantly moved by the different (gorgeous) locations I know so well and used to visit almost daily (Oh, Dear..., one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities I had ever known!!).Talking about Barcelona's locations, I must say that they picked up for this film some of the most expensive, high class, exclusive neighborhoods in that town.After a while I thought: ""These characters are millionaires!"", because practically very few people can afford to live in those places (next to Paradise).The pacing is excellent, the photography gorgeous, and of course, Allen's philosophy (very bitter, ultra-realistic and the point of view of somebody that is already back from everything) if practiced by more people, would make this world a better place to live in.I'm not sure that very young people would have the poise of these characters under similar circumstances.But the whole effect works for the story, it's very entertaining and if you stop to think about many lines, a deep wisdom runs under apparently frivolous talk.The actors, excellent all of them, the girls very pretty and Bardem, as usual, one of the sexiest men walking around on this earth --and what a voice!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

While in a restaurant, the divorced painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) flirts and invites them to travel to Oviedo with him, and also to go to bed with him. The reluctant Vicky does not accept the invitation but Cristina says yes and Vicky travels with her girlfriend. Once in Oviedo, Cristina has a crisis of ulcer and Vicky goes to sightseeing with Juan Antonio; then they go to his father's house and later they go to a guitar concert. Vicky falls in love with Juan Antonio and has sex with him. However, back in Barcelona, she does not tell anything to her friend and Cristina moves to Juan Antonio's house, while Vicky marries Doug. When the unstable former wife of Juan Antonio, Maria Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz), has an OD, the painter brings her to his house and their troubled relationship harmonizes with the presence of Cristina, living a threesome. When Cristina asks for a time to travel to Paris and rethink their relationship, Vicky feels in doubt about her sentimental love.I had a great expectation with ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", first because I am a great fan of Woody Allen, and also because of the Oscar of Pen√©lope Cruz. Unfortunately I found this movie overrated, pretentious and annoying, with excessive narrative in off. The performance of Pen√©lope Cruz is great, as usual, but not to be nominated and win an Oscar. Rebecca Hall has a better and better performance in this movie and Vicky is the most credible character. I like Scarlett Johansson very much, but I believe she needs to give a break in filming with Woody Allen, since her way of speaking and gestures are repetitive, like a female alter-ego of this director.

Let me tell you, if that's your main reason for watching the movie, you will be disappointed. I didn't really expect anything from that scene, even though some magazines made a big deal out of it.I was surprised though to see another woman playing a major role in this movie. She's also playing a part in the ""Frost/Nixon"" movie that came out in 2008. She's not only beautiful, but really talented. While she might not have a brand name as do the other two females playing here, she does hold the movie together.Another comment/user said, that the old Woody is back. Well let's just say, the weirdness factor really went up here. You have many loose ends, you have people acting strange (as they would in normal life too?), but most importantly: They talk a lot (mostly not saying as much as they talk)! If that's not your kind of movie, than you better stay away from this. I actually did like it :o)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody is back and makes an enjoyable movie!,"At my movie theater that I work at for some odd reason we got Vicky Cristina Barcelona 2 weeks after it's release, strange, but I don't know how these things work. But people were walking out very pleased with the movie. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, so I watched it this afternoon. Now we all have to admit, Woody has just been out of his game these past few decades, not since Annie Hall has he had a very memorable film. Nor have none of them have that creative edge that Woody has, but he still has something because Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a good movie. It has a strong story and was very different than any film we have had this year. We have a narrator throughout the film that just tells us the story as if he was reading a book. We have a strong cast that they can all hold their own on scree: Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, and Penelope Cruz. They hold a strong chemistry and make the story very interesting.Vicky and Cristina are best friends who are going to Barcelona for the summer, Vicky is a believer of realistic love and is engaged to a successful man who can make her ideal marriage dream work. Cristina is the idealist of a romantic love and meets a Spanish handsome charmer, Juan Antonio who invites the girls to another city for a weekend. He gets Cristina's notice automatically, but Vicky takes some seducing to get into bed. But Juan's crazy ex wife gets back into his life and just makes things very interesting for Cristina. Vicky starts to question her ideals on love when she is just swept off her feet with Juan.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a very well told story and nothing like I've seen before. Even though I found it to be unrealistic at times, this movie was just different, which we all need and Woody has a talent for showing that, as he has shown us with his private life, lol. But the acting is good and there are some funny moments and some touching one's as well. I loved how crazy Penelope was in this movie, she was like Fatal Attraction scary, yet you could see how Javier's character fell for her so hard, I don't blame him, I found her craziness attractive as well. So I do recommend this movie if you have the opportunity to see it, the characters are cool and the story is wonderful, Woody is back and throws in one last punch in the fight for his career.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"At last, at least, a return to nuances","Vicki Christina Barcelona is a surprising tapas of a movie: it deals with emotions, sex, even sexuality - and does so with panache.Here Woody Allen makes the subtle subtexts shine again; there is a real honesty and openness to the writing - even when paradoxically the characters are hiding their true motivations - that lifts beyond many of Allen's films of the past decade.All in all the laughs are there but in a more knowing sort of way, there are little insights and great performances and everyone obviously enjoyed the process here.We particularly like the fact that this is a film about the heart and the mind; a film that encourages up to be neurotic if it helps us find love, and that anything is more important than settling - though settling is what we are all given.A film to enjoy, a film to make you think, and if Match was about London then VCB is about Barcelona: a more wild, a freer, a more Guadiesque, even Daliesque Allen, and one that we mostly enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" rates an 8.5/10 in one of (my) life's greatest pleasures (that is, Woody's world)","A lot of people complain about Woody Allen's new movies, saying that they lack the brilliance of his old days. Well, I have a different perspective (and I admit I can be a little biased, since the man is my favourite director): for someone who's 72 years old and still makes an average of a film a year (as VCB comes out, his next project is already in post-production!), you can't expect him to make a masterpiece every year, right? So, even though ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and some of his recent works (""Match Point"" included- I find it slightly overrated, and prefer ""Melinda and Melinda"" or even ""Anything Else"" to it) are no ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"", ""Husbands and Wives"" or ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", they're still enjoyable. I have a short list of life's 5 things that are good even when they're bad: sex, pizza, chocolate, ice cream, & Woody Allen's films (not necessarily in that order, depends on my mood). Which means that a ""bad"" Woody Allen (i.e., ""Cassandra's Dream""), is still better than the average director's best. Woody doesn't have anything left to prove anybody (maybe he never did). He just makes the movies he wants, and his admirers (count myself in!) will watch, enjoy them, and beg for more (I hope he makes at least 10 more films before dying, and that he doesn't retire while he's still breathing). Besides, it's hard to resist such a charming cast as this: Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Patricia Clarkson and a hilarious turn from Pen√©lope Cruz; the beauty of Barcelona and other Spanish locations, and Allen's unmistakable dialogue. Even if ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" doesn't carry the depth of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", isn't as funny as ""Mighty Aphrodite"" or as witty as ""Bullets Over Broadway"", it's still another orgasm the Little Red provides us (oh, and if you wanna see it just for the already famous kiss between Pen√©lope and Scarlett, you might be disappointed - it's sexy, but lasts only about 3 seconds). 8.5/10.",,Anonymous,Romance
No country for neurotic  tourists.,"Barcelona is a beautiful city, and frankly I'd watch Cruz or Johansson take the trash out. So there was little chance of this new Woody Allen film going wrong.Allen is beyond both American and European clich√©s, so can play with both fairly well. We see two American tourists enchanted by the surface culture of Spain, and their own inward uncertainty.Allen has the massive advantage of knowing he is only ever telling one story, so finds it easy to refresh his work. That is partly why most good actors will appear in his films and do a good job - as the well appointed cast does here. Rebecca Hall does a great turn as the modern female version of the classic nebbish.Where does this fit into the Allen pantheon? As his power wanes, his control weakens and so the impact of the piece fades a little. But at many points this has the strength of Manhatten or Sisters, and is a welcome addition.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a winning trifecta of an excelente pelicula","The latest Woody Allen cinematic offering ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" sure sent out a few ""Woodys"" to male filmgoers. Two words: Scarlett Johansson! Is there a more cinematic picturesque acting beauty than Scarlett? I think not. However, I am not going to get let my male hormones invade the film review of this very witty and delightful film. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" stars Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio, a Spaniard painter who meets and fancies two gorgeous American female tourists visiting Barcelona for the summer named (yea you guessed it) Vicky and Cristina. Rebecca Hall plays the perspicacious Vicky while Johansson plays the free-spirited Cristina. The unruffled Juan Antonio offers Vicky and Cristina a flight to a nearby Spanish town, good wine, exquisite food, and a ""make love"" offer that he does not want them to refuse. The latter would fall into the entitlement of ""Vicky Cristina Off Pantalones"". Vicky is engaged to be married to a cookie-cutter yuppie named Doug so she rejects the making love portion of the Juan Antonio proposition, while Cristina is all down for the Juan Antonio seduction expedition. Cristina eventually does develop a relationship with Juan Antonio, but a Spanish ""new order"" is intertwined in a ""bizarre love triangle"" fashion when Juan Antonio's fiery ex-wife Maria Elena gets in the picture that eventually converts into a m√©nage a trios Barcelona style; Si Baby! However, the film's central focus is on Vicky's insecurities & neurosis on her relationship with Doug and her uncontainable desirable feelings for Juan Antonio. I think Batman is no longer my summer movie hero, gotta make the change for Juan Antonio; three beautiful women lusting for him, Do I say more? Legendary auteur Woody Allen scripted a brainy but relatable script on passion, love, and romance. He also helmed the picture with an effective unpredictable storyline manner that also had the fringe Spanish benefit of showing us viewers splendid cultural cinematography of beautiful Barcelona. No actor could have played the Juan Antonio role better than Bardem; I will call it ""friendo"" that Bardem will be one our finest male thespians in years to come. Newcomer Rebecca Hall is no kid in the lonely acting hall anymore with her breakthrough performance as Vicky, and Scarlett Johannson as Cristina is proving that she continues to be an effective muse to Woody; do not take that literally. Nonetheless, it is Penelope Cruz's performance as the fervent Maria Elena which should be cruising her to a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination. So reserve your one-way (or three-way) movie ticket to Spain and visit the luscious and passionate land of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting and fun romantic drama that takes twist and unexpected turns in this crazy love triangle!,"Woody Allen always one known for his offbeat and funny romantic comedy films, and I for one must say that I find most of them entertaining. Here this film is more of a crazy complex drama ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" as it's interesting and the love triangle is complex. You have two friends Vicky(Rebecca Hall)a uptight and straight arrow type who views the world as very cautious, and Cristina(Scarlett Johansson)a free spirited and adventurous type of a girl who wants to discover the world. So one summer they head to Barcelona, Spain for a stay with one of Vicky's family friends Judy(Patricia Clarkson). Soon they spot a charming and handsome looking man named Juan Gonzalo(Javier Bardem) who happens to be a Spanish artist who makes his living doing sculptures. And Juan is a seducer who beds and romances both even though it seemed odd he hit the sheets with Vicky. The lust and adventures are nice and good.Only then the twist comes when enter the ex of Juan as it's been much known in Spain about the situation when his ex the beautiful Maria(Penelope Cruuz)tried to kill him. Once again this tough and sexy woman enters the lives of all three and her romance starts back up with Juan, plus she's back to her own aggressive ways of watching him every minute, and many times she will only speak Spanish, as she bucks to speak English. Slowly but surely the drama and emotional sparks start to fly, call Maria tough or just plain love crazy(a well done performance by Penelope)she is clearly the wild card of this film and she leads it to a very crazy love triangle for both Vicky and Cristina. Overall pretty good direction from Woody as he tries to prove love is complex and it can get tangled up and it still leaves many searching no matter how much fun and enjoyment they have. The love scenes were okay, and the chemistry of the cast made it a joy to watch as all were young and sexy performers. This is one love drama to check out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Painting with broad strokes,"Many have referred to the recent career of American auteur Woody Allen as his 'European vacation', having departed his beloved New York to begin experimenting with different narratives and cultural observations overseas. It would seem Vicky Cristina Barcelona proves the end of Allen's 'vacation' (his next film marks a return to New York) and as such, Allen seems determined to make the most of his last departure from tradition, toying with narrative, character and thematic development. The resulting film as such feels slightly piecemeal, but hardly in a negative sense, as Vicky Cristina Barcelona merely brims with the impulsive exploring one would expect at the end of a vacation, and the impulsive sense of artistic whimsy is one difficult to resist.While once again abstaining from his traditional New York locations (this time transposing his pallet from England to Spain) and trademark neurotic humour, Allen demonstrates a welcome return to his acute knack for dissecting and observing human behaviour. Exploring a myriad of sexual habits and practices as well as his usual meditations on the nature and quality of love, the potentially redundant and overdone source material is given a fresh and fascinating spin in the hands of the veteran storyteller. But given his past credentials, it is interesting to see Allen experimenting with a different cinematic voice, albeit one which is still easily recognizable as his. Despite his complex and profound subject matter, Allen's sparse and rather matter of fact script feels almost overly simplistic, the bulk of the character development and contextual grounding of the plot performed in concise, clipped sound bites - rather than the viewer inferring Johansson's character to be neurotic and afraid of commitment, we are simply informed that she is as such, a tendency which comes across as rather jarring at first.However, Allen's shrewdly cunning scripting makes such a narrative voice clear to be a deliberate choice rather than simply poor writing, as if tiding the viewer by with blunt surface description while leaving the inherent subtleties left to be discovered by the viewer. The comparison can be made to Bardem's painter character, as it seems Allen has simply chosen to paint with broad strokes, his deceptively simplistic overtones masking a far more complicated and fascinating underbelly left mainly to the viewer to discover through what is not said, rather than what is.Nonetheless, not all of the film's potential problems can be explained away as deliberate artistic decisions quite as easily, particularly an ill-advised omnipresent narration, which starts off giving the impression of being sharp and satirical, but becomes quickly overused, after which it abruptly disappears for almost the rest of the film. This tendency to tell not show makes Allen's film feel remarkably un-cinematic at times, with the narration seeming a lazy and complacent way of quickening the story rather than letting it unfold, undermining an otherwise refreshingly unique and fascinating narrative. Similarly, the overuse of certain musical motifs becomes frustratingly repetitive, although the beautiful Spanish architecture and locations are captured with an excellent touristic flourish, sweeping the viewer up in the heady luxury of a Spanish holiday as the protagonists themselves.Despite excellent past work as Allen's latest female muse, Scarlett Johansson appears somewhat wasted here, her usual spunky exuberance and sultry charisma appearing oddly stunted. Paradoxically, her character, who in theory should have been the most interesting (the struggling artist attempting to find her niche in life and love, while welcoming experimentation along the way) disappointingly proves one of the more poorly written, and although Johansson does her best, infusing her character with an appropriate degree of teasingly seductive charm, it is a shame her character was not explored more fully. The true breakout star of the picture is Rebecca Hall, last seen as Christian Bale's wife in magician thriller The Prestige. Hall shines as a more typical Allen leading lady, mastering the neurotic self-guessing, pragmatism and guilt-inducing impulsive spells of her character with a particular down to earth yet bubbly style all her own - an entirely credible and hugely enjoyable performance.Javier Bardem is perfectly cast as the suavely overconfident artist just as determined to drink in the pleasures of life as he is cynically convinced of its worthlessness, his comic deadpan and extravagant screen presence making him a perfect foil for both leading ladies. However, it is the entrance of Penelope Cruz halfway through the film when the plot really picks up speed, her suicidal, fiercely proud yet chaotically unpredictable artist and ex-wife of Bardem's character proving a sublime catalyst for the other major characters to play off of. It is impossible to imagine a more fitting performance than Cruz's for the role, her ferocious, borderline psychotic energy proving alternately hilarious and terrifying. Patricia Clarkson also gives a typically strong performance as the family friend of Vicky's putting the two women up for the summer, and Kevin Dunn is a suitably distant presence as her absent husband.Few movies provide such an odd mishmash of quietly whimsical storytelling touches, but there is no question that Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona adds up to an altogether pleasant experience. With appealingly complex undertones discernible beyond the deceptively simple exterior and peppered with an array of terrific performances, while the film may be somewhat of a departure of form for Allen, it is a welcome return to his intelligent introspection and quality of old, and one without question worth a watch.-7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) - Woody Allen's Love Letter to the Streets of Barcelona!,"Written and directed by the talented mind of Woody Allen, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" stars one of the best casting ensembles, ever assembled into a movie, and it tells a wonderful story that's worth telling to all audiences. The movie centers on two American women, Vicky and Cristina, both portrayed by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, who spend a summer in Barcelona, where they meet an artist, portrayed by Javier Bardem, who still has troubles with his ex-wife, portrayed by Penelope Cruz in an Oscar-winning role. This movie follows comedy, drama, romance, and anywhere in between. Woody Allen is a wonderful filmmaker, and he always deliver movies with a unique plot, sharp script, and likable characters. Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, and Javier Bardem are really great in this movie, but it's Penelope Cruz, who deserved her Oscar win, for her performance in the movie. She brought a lot of humor into her character, and whether she speaks English or Spanish, you can still relate to her. I was enchanted by knowing how this movie wanted to make a tribute to Barcelona. The sights and sounds are beautiful, and it was like walking through the streets, without leaving the movie. Along with a beautiful music score and wonderful heart, this movie delivers one of the biggest messages ever seen in a ""love letter"" flick. This is a entertaining, beautiful, well-made, and unique movie from start to finish.

taking a chance on love,"Two young women spend the summer in Barcelona in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona). At first, the women seem like caricatures: Vicky (Penelope Hall) is serious, somewhat conservative, and not much of a risk-taker; Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is a free spirit, artistic, spontaneous, and up for adventure. However, one might look at them as two sides of the same woman.When an artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) invites them to Oviedo on a private plane, Cristina jumps at the chance, while a nervous Vicky goes along just to keep Cristina company. Cristina jumps into an affair with Juan Antonio; for Vicky, it's a one-nighter that destroys her concept of who she is and what she wants. While Cristina and Juan Antonio are together, Juan's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) shows up.Allen makes it clear that in his world (and in ours), many people opt for unhappiness rather than move out of an uncomfortable situation - which in its way, has become comfortable. At least it's the devil you know. While Cristina is seeking ways to express herself through art, and relishes all of her experiences as a means of finding herself, Vicky sees it all as a threat to what she believes she wants.The gorgeous Penelope Cruz is outstanding as the passionate, angry Maria Elena, and Javier Bardem portrays Juan Antonio as one who accepts a Bohemian lifestyle as a matter of course. Juan's and Maria's fights are delicious and very realistic. Scarlett Johansson is very right for the part of the young, natural beauty Cristina, for whom life is always a surprise as she tries to find her way.Beautifully photographed, this is a deceptive film. It's breezy, it's laid back, it's sexy -- like Cristina -- but again like Cristina, the film has many layers. Really good work by Allen - except for that disconcerting narration which added nothing to the film. Otherwise, it's solid.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Vicky Christina Barcelona is a great movie that's very entertaining to watch, and is also very smart, and features some great and beautiful scenery of the beautiful city of Barcelona. I found all the acting to be superb, and the writing is great. I would definitely recommend Vicky Christina Barcelona to Woody Allen lovers and just any movie lover in general.

A privilaged tale that is still real,I hated it almost for the first hour for its blatant disregard about how life progress from the privileged view. But the film embraces that view by portraying the madness of these relationships of these people in chaotic layers. As much the film doesn't know about reality the earnest portrayal of this certain class of people is something that usually ends up as caricatures. Here Allen uses the same characters that are used mostly as caricatures and gave them real life and emotions that is not at all justifiable characters but still humane that it creates a certain amount of empathy for them.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brief wonderful trip to Barcelona,"Take a sojourn for a couple of hours to the romantic streets and country side of Barcelona. The beige pastel landscapes, the enchanted dreamlike streets, the surreal Gaudi monuments and amorous cafes all evoke a romantic escapade in Barcelona. Scenery and setting are an integral part of Woody's great films. As we typically see in Woody's films, like the movie Manhattan, where the sleepy streets and sites of grey, nostalgic New York take on a character of its own as the human characters discourse in front of it, we again feel his new European locale as though we are there ourselves. We are shown a lot of the defining sites of the culturally rich city.Woody is a genius at capturing the mindset of people, of the times, especially with regards to courting etiquette and he continues to brilliantly totally possess an understanding of and be able to pierce into contemporary times. He understands and documents real human emotion and these real people draw us into his movies and this one. He does it with a literary flair and although people don't actually talk like how he portrays them, it is amusing to listen to the literary rich dialogue.The movie resonates with Woody's philosophy and commentary with a tad of humor on his current theme of love and passion. By utilizing two contrasting personalities with contrasting view points on love and passion, woody makes an intriguing commentary on the subject. One with an indulgently bohemian outlook, boldly and constantly searches for the possibly unattainable or nearly impossible ideal which ultimately keeps her in hopeless situations and the other with a more conservative stance has more ""grounded and settled"" ideals and dubiously believes in the happily ever after bit. Both polar opposites are presented an amusingly similar circumstance and it is fun to see how the situation unfolds. Then Penelope Cruz's character emerges as a spicy twist to the story.There is less humor in his later great movies than in the early ones and there is no longer any slapstick. But he still enjoys poking fun at his characters and since they are so believable he is poking fun at real people in a satirical way.One of the most interestingly beautiful movies this year so far. And definitely one of Woody's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love That Woody,"Two girlfriends on a summer holiday in Spain become enamored with the same painter (Javier Bardem), unaware that his ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), with whom he has a tempestuous relationship, is about to re-enter the picture.Woody Allen presents us a story of love, romance, relationships and (to some degree) culture. Whether we are comfortable with the idea or not, the things expressed here exist: relationships beyond strict monogamy, and beyond cheating. The human emotion can know many kinds of love and many kinds of desire, and a handful are explored here (though not nearly as many as in Allen's classic film on bestiality).If you are going to have a seductive Spanish man, clearly it must be Javier Bardem. At different times the part could have been done by Antonio Banderas or others, but at the time was there a bigger star than Bardem? Surely not.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Allen Finds His Romantic and Artistic Muse in Spain with a Sharp, Eclectic Cast","From a thematic standpoint, Woody Allen's latest film offers nothing we haven't already seen in his earlier work like ""Manhattan"" and ""Hannah and Her Sisters"". Like those classics and several lesser efforts, this 2008 romantic dramedy is a distilled examination of why men and women long for romance and how we fluidly fall in and out of love as a result, often with dire consequences and not without personal humiliation. What makes this entry particularly welcome is the full-blooded infusion of Spanish art and architecture that brings an emotional ripeness to the story. It also helps that Allen has gathered a more eclectic cast than usual to inhabit the richly developed characters. This is easily the most enjoyable film he has made since going abroad and probably his funniest since at least 2000's ""Small Time Crooks"".The plot focuses on two American college friends, polar opposites on the subject of love, as they vacation in Barcelona for the summer. As the conservative one who values stability and devotion, Vicky is there to study ""Catalan Identity"" as she waits to return to the states to marry Doug, an ambitious young man who maps out their future with a stifling lack of spontaneity. Failed filmmaker Cristina, on the other hand, is a romantic adventurer who craves unbridled passion with no limits. Their differing perspectives on love clash immediately when they both catch the eye of renowned abstract painter Juan Antonio. He makes a supremely self-confident proposition to Vicky and Cristina to join him on a romantic weekend trip to Oviedo, a picturesque town near the northern coast. Naturally, Vicky is appalled and makes no bones in telling him so, but Cristina is excited by the idea of being seduced by him. They agree to go with him and face unexpected consequences. Things get even more complicated when Juan Antonio's tempestuous ex-wife Maria Elena shows up and forces him to face his weaknesses.Part of the resulting roundelay feels like a throwback to Allen's ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"", but there is also a palpable sense of melancholy more reminiscent of his mid-period films like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Husbands and Wives"". What remains consistent throughout is the filmmaker's incurable romanticism, a freshly optimistic viewpoint that makes the film thoroughly pleasurable despite the familiar set-up. The performances are terrific beginning with Rebecca Hall, a surprising find as Vicky, a young woman who thought she knew what she wanted only to find out too late that it's not what she wants at all. As a typical Allen heroine, Hall lets her initially strident manner as Vicky give way to a resonating sadness. As for Scarlett Johansson, the third time's definitely a charm. In ""Match Point"", Allen exploited her effortless sensuality, while he tried to make her a fumbling Diane Keaton copy in ""Scoop"". As Cristina, however, she gets to blend together her carnal allure and comic insecurity in a more seamless fashion. She has a wonderfully funny moment when she just can't control her titillation at Juan Antonio's proposal in the restaurant.For those who have only recently been introduced to his mesmerizing work by way of his maniacal killer in the Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men"", Javier Bardem is completely convincing as Juan Antonio, a man who effortlessly controls the fates of the three women enraptured by his sensual manner and open soul. Unlike a shallower actor like Antonio Banderas, Bardem manages to move between smoldering and vulnerable with fluency. As Maria Elena, Pen√©lope Cruz finally comes into her own in a non-Almod√≥var film. Taking the concept of a tortured artist to an extreme, the actress blazes with dangerous vitality, even though the role is relatively minor. She brings visceral life to the combative relationship between her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations. The always-reliable Patricia Clarkson is quietly effective as a family friend of Vicki's with secrets of her own, while Chris Messina conveys the right level of unctuous smarminess as Doug.The film is beautiful to look at thanks to the luscious, sun-dappled cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. With Gaudi's most famous work on display, Barcelona could hardly look more appealing on film. Just as evocative is the atmospheric music by a bevy of contemporary Spanish composers. The one aspect that doesn't work quite as well as intended is Christopher Evan Welch's stentorian narration, which lacks the right level of irony to make the ploy worthwhile. Most of the time, it comes across as a conceit to explain parts of the narrative that seem clear enough from the scenes. Regardless, this is a genuine return to form for Allen and well worth seeing for fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The music saved this film.,"I was building great expectations before seeing Vicky Cristina Barcelona, because of its incredible cast and my admiration towards Spanish and Catalan cultures, plus the fact that I visited Barcelona twice before and I was fascinated by it. But unfortunately the film did not fulfill my expectations. I am not saying it is a bad movie, unless I wouldn't have given it seven stars, however there are many choices that this picture took which were not much of a success, like choosing to put a narrative passage every five minutes to give us information about the characters that could've easily been transmitted through dialogue or action between the actors. Another thing I did not like was some performances especially by Scarlett Johanson who's acting didn't convince me with her portrayal of the characters feeling and getting them to the spectators. While on the bright side, the incredibly beautiful score of this movie with its charming flamenco melodies was intelligently employed and added a sort of symbolism to it. In addition, the performances by the other actors were pretty good, Penelope Cruz did an amazing job though I don't think her performance is Oscar worthy, with her appearing only in the second half of the movie in a few counted, but satisfying, shots. Javier Bardem and Rebecca Hall were both pretty fine. In a word, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a fun movie to watch that depicts love from a different point of view and is quite worth a shot.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

MY REVIEW: The Puzzling Love!!,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody Allen never fails to surprise us while showcasing the little complexities of being in love and here he does it in pure Woody Allen style. Story is about two polar opposite friends who fall in love with same man over their trip to Barcelona but they don't know that his ex-wife is about to enter into the already complex equations. Supported with subtle and good performances by an A-list cast ranging from Rebecca Hall playing Vicky who likes to keep life simple, Scarlett Johansson playing ever confused Christina, Javier Bardem playing the womanizer Juan and terrific Pen√©lope Cruz playing his crazy ex-wife. Two things that will remain with you after the movie has ended; First Pen√©lope Cruz nagging in Spanish and Christopher Evan Welch's voice as narrator that keeps you awed while explaining the mood swings of Vicky and Cristina. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Vicky Cristina Barcelona. It's a nice sexy little cracker in Woody Allen style.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Inoffensive; Mildly Diverting,"A 73-year old director apparently encouraging upper middle class poseurs to ""seize the day"" - a la Woody, perhaps? There are a couple of subdued chuckles to be had in this movie, but mostly it seems to be directed toward a special type of regretful woman approaching or just past menopause. There's not a sign of the sharp wit Woody was noted for; instead, it's just a rather bored sigh. This movie is about as inspiring as a New Yorker cartoon, and seemingly meant for the same audience: affluent, pretentious, unhappy.What was Woody trying to do in this film, make Scarlett Johansson seem dense and dull? That's unforgivable. All the actors were absolutely fine, especially Penelope Cruz, but the writing was just not there. I think this was an especially poor effort from the former maestro.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vicky Cristina Wherever,"What a mess. So flawed, with such little substance, no narrative interest at all (as Woody used to give) and the total misreading/generalization of a city.. the love triangles, with Bardem as the common vortex. This is neither in the comedy inclined, narrative exploitive sense Woody Allen used to give it back in Annie Hall days nor in the sexual tension exploitation of, say, Henry and June. He places cardboards and makes them swing around (badly chosen) sets, making them seem dorks with useless dialogs, which underline how such a story of dangerous love/sex balance could never happen with such superficial mundane people;. the voice over: what an insult. Woody Allen was a truly sensitive filmmaker when he was at his best, he built narratives which invite the spectator to find out, make us part of the process, make us follow them, he would give us a peach, and let us peal it. How could he think we needed an annoying fellow literally retelling absolutely every useless action or obvious thought of every character. What was the point? Didn't he trust his ability for visual narrative enough to let us find for ourselves?. Barcelona, or whatever city he filmed in. I'm glad i watched this in Barcelona, because i could get out of the theatre and check that i had just saw a city woody wanted to place in the film, not the real thing. He was so good in embedding New York in the fluids of his kind of narrative, his kind of story, his kind of character, that it truly disappointed me, more than anything else, that e failed so miserably here. Barcelona is not tuned to flamenco. The very definition of ""Spanish city"" may be something controversial (in fact, any real city is an unity on its own, that's another discussion) but if any definition for that can be found, Barcelona will for sure be out of it. How could he place such an amount of ordinary touristic Spanish clich√©s into it? He even places a character who studies ""Catalan identity"". Where was that? She is learning Spanish, not Catalan, and the life she took in the city (not the phony life with her phony husband, but the life she chose to have) is something she could have elsewhere, no need to be in Barcelona necessarily. Th prostitutes Johanson photographs are probably the closest thing we have to a real city in this film. Gaudi shows as a mere highlight of assumed clich√©s, he is shot so superficially as he is in any touristic selling film.It's a shame, it's not good to see an intelligent, yet intuitive filmmaker fall to the pits of vulgarity like this. The only mildly interesting aspect i found here is how he neglects and opposes to the high-class futile chit-chat of American culture that once once the juice that flavoured all his dialogs, in his New York based work.My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Romance

In Woody's dreams!,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) Scarlett Johansson, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem.

So they go off to some retreat. So he has the two American babes to bang - but this guy also has his ex-wife show up to get in on the action. See, he's a real macho man - a dude! Leaves 'um all panting for more. And then? One American gal goes back to her fianc√©e and gets married; one decides to go home - but become a free spirit; the wife calms down after having screaming fits every five minutes.

Fantastic !!!,"Once again Woody explores the themes of 'Magic vs. Logic' but this time it's within the feminine psyche. There's an internal debate about love and whether it's better to have of comfortable relationships versus lusty indulgences. Vicky and Cristina represent both sides of the coin. Cristina is immediately interested in Juan Antonio, but Vicky is a harder sell. Once she spends enough time with him however, she becomes enraptured. While both women have interest in the same man, Allen surprisingly never turns them against each other. Here they are always thoughtful and supportive as they explore their sexuality. While the debate and the characters are the same, this is a much subtler Woody Allen movie. There's more of an elegance to the portrayal of the artist, adultery, and immaturity. All of it feels less forced thanks to of all the beauty & charm Spain beholds. It has the same narrator that annoyed me in ""You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger"" but here it works. All of the actors are wonderful, but the underrated standout is Rebecca Hall who shows such great resilience, and unbridled passion. The part of Juan Antonio was written exclusively for Bardem, so he's a natural fit. Cruz is brilliant as erratic, violent muse. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, but the cast as a whole is superb within this stylishly modern romance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sexy, witty, charming, Spanish love triangle vacation","Woody Allen's film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, is a sexy flick about a m√©nage-√†-trois between Javier Bardem, Pen√©lope Cruz and Scarlett Johansson. Need I say more? It's also the first Woody Allen movie that I have made it through in its entirety. Not sure exactly what that says about me?This was a sexy, clever and interesting film though, with beautiful views of the Spanish city. In fact its sort of a love letter to the city of Barcelona.The script is witty, playful and charming with the story following Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Johansson), two young Americans who decide to spend a summer in Spain where they meet a flamboyant artist (Bardem) and his beautiful but insane ex-wife (Cruz).

Surprisingly charming and fun,"I respect Woody Allen, but sometimes he can't seem to get out of his own way. All too often his heavy dialogue is unrealistic and distracting, and his artsy cinematography fails to excite.Not here, even in a story where art and creativity play a significant role. The dialogue is smart and witty, the camerawork and scenes are lovely, and the story is both charming and compelling. Two American girls on vacation in Barcelona get more than they bargain for with a roguish painter and his maniacal ex-wife. Seduction, flirtations, and the exploration of life and love follow, all set in stunning Spain. A fabulous cast, a full and complete story, and brilliant narration make this little gem well worth watching. An 8.5 rounded up because it was a delight to see. Nice work on this one, Mr. Allen!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty sights and lots of stereotypes,"The film opens with a steady flow of stereotypes and despite the expectations of Woody Allen fans, continues with them to the very end. Let's have painters... because they are so romantic and passionate. Let's have Spaniards... because they are hot-blooded and beautiful. Let's have Barcelona... because every scene taken in it looks like a postcard, or something directed by Tourist Office of Barcelona (which is pretty close to the truth considering the City of Barcelona DID pay for much of the film's cost).The setting and the cast seem to be picked from a poll in a women magazine. Since Antonio Banderas is old news, our readers chose masculine Javier Bardem. For his Spanish partner they chose Penelope Cruz who is not only beautiful, but also the only Spanish actress they have heard of. They also chose Scarlett Johanssen because they would choose her in pretty much any film. And let's have all these beautiful people indulge in wine tasting, flying private airplanes and picking blackberries for breakfast while they muse about art and love, because that's apparently how hot-blooded Spanish painters spend their days in Barcelona.Allen fails to show the flip side of this fairy tale-like Spanish life style, fails to show a sudden twist, a funny moment, his trade mark wit, or at least a hot threesome scene. Johanssen is the only one showing an interesting performance. Hall, Bardem and Cruz are confined in stereotypical roles, and Bardem even looks embarrassed pushing a Latin lover routine.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why you should and shouldn't see Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona examines the pursuit of passion versus practicality; the search for ""whatever works"" in a sexual relationship versus that which is expected of you. As it explores the outer reaches of ""whatever works"" it makes you think about what limits, if any, we should impose on ourselves and each other. It also makes you wonder if everyone Woody Allen knows is independently wealthy. Why you should see it You've seen all of his movies and love Woody Allen. You're Soon Yi Previn and love Woody Allen. You're about to get married and need some input as to whether you should instead enter into an open relationship with an eccentric artist in another country. Why you shouldn't see it You're offended by sexual themes in movies. You've seen some of his movies and don't like Woody Allen.

"Uneven, ultimately disappointing","Vicky is a prim, proper, practical woman. She is engaged to the type of man prim, proper, practical women marry. Vicky's friend Cristina is everything Vicky is not. Adventurous, spontaneous and quite willing to hop into bed with some random man she just met. Vicky knows what she wants in life. Cristina is searching. The two friends are spending the summer in Barcelona. Artist Juan Antonio, of whom Vicky and Cristina know nothing other than he tried to kill his ex-wife (or maybe the other way around), introduces himself and suggests the three of them fly off to Oviedo for a weekend of sightseeing and sex. Mostly sex. Vicky is of course appalled. Cristina is of course intrigued. Off to Oviedo the threesome goes, Vicky only agreeing to go along to keep an eye on Cristina. And then things get complicated.Woody Allen has set up an interesting situation here but the film doesn't live up to its initial promise. Ultimately it is quite a letdown. This seems like a story which should be full of emotion but the movie is oddly flat. The performances of the leads don't help. Scarlett Johansson, playing Cristina, is a blank slate in desperate need of some color. She's quite dull. Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky, comes across somewhat better. It is really left to Pen√©lope Cruz, playing a prototypical Spanish firecracker, to inject some life into the proceedings. The movie noticeably perks up when Cruz is on the screen. Her scenes with Javier Bardem, playing Juan Antonio, have some sizzle to them, a notable contrast to Bardem's interactions with the film's other leading ladies. Cruz brings good energy but not nearly enough to rescue what is all in all a rather boring movie.While not a total misfire Vicky Cristina Barcelona has too many flaws to be deemed a success. The dialogue is rather pretentious. There is an incredibly annoying narrator who just never shuts up. The story, which seemed to have great promise, ends up falling rather flat. Some of the key performances fail to engage. And in the end it all seems rather pointless, there is no satisfying resolution whatsoever. Cruz and Bardem work well together. Unfortunately that which surrounds them disappoints. You can see potential in this movie. But Allen was unable to put the pieces together properly. One of those frustrating movies which you can't help but feel should be much better than it actually is.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"I finally found a Woody Allen film that didn't take place in New York that I enjoy. Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't the first non-New York set Woody Allen film that I've liked, but it's one of only two. I've discussed this at length elsewhere so all I'll say here is Woody Allen just doesn't seem as comfortable behind the camera if he's working out of the country. Match Point is an obvious exception, as there is little to complain about regarding that outing. Anyway, the 2008 film written and directed by Woody Allen followed two best friends spending the summer in Barcelona. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as the pair of best friends, Vicky Cristina Barcelona explores unconventional relationships and the extent one can be fulfilled by sharing love.Two best friends that seem to be polar opposites plan a summer in Spain together before one of them is to wed. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) has always searched for a grounded love and a partner she can depend on as she is conventional in all aspects of life. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) has searched for a love that will set her soul on fire, one that is exciting and unpredictable. Their expectations have led them down different paths, Vicky will soon marry when she returns home, Cristina, who is single again after being hurt in her previous relationship. After a chance meeting with a Spanish painter, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) he invites the girls to travel with him on his private plane to a remote island. Ever the risk-taker, Cristina jumps at the chance for unprecedented excitement and intrigue. Vicky is much more hesitant, even attempting to talk Cristina out of going. They both eventually board the plane with Juan and make it to the island. Cristina becomes ill and it is Vicky that has a romantic evening with Juan. Feeling guilty and conflicted, Vicky leaves the island leaving Cristina and Juan to fall in love. Cristina believes she may have found the excitement in love she's been looking for, that is until Juan's ex- wife re-enters their lives.Social constructs and conventional love are explored in Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody explores what it means to love someone that also loves someone else. Living together in an open relationship and the dynamic of three people that love each other so much that they can't survive without each other but struggle to survive the terms of their relationship provides an interesting character and another fine example of the exploration of the psyche that Woody Allen is so proficient at. The score and cinematography are gorgeous and I'm so happy that the excellent Woody Allen script made a triumphant return. I recently read an interview with Woody Allen in which he lists guilt as a motivating factor to accomplish the things he doesn't want to do, which I found interesting considering the guilt Vicky felt after cheating on her husband filled such a huge part of her character arc. It's always interesting to learn more about a filmmaker and then be able to see more of them in their work than before. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is certainly not the first film of Woody's where guilt has played a large part but it's interesting noticing it after learning that guilt plays a huge factor in his own life.""Life is short, dull, and full of pain.""--Maybe Woody is right, but his films certainly help me cope with that.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Continues Allen's European tour,"One of the better films in Allen's late filmography, this is a delightfully slight tragicomedy about how we are our own worse enemies in the matters of love. The cast is appeal. The writing is crisp. And the story plays out in unexpected ways.But the feature I like best is how the film captures the texture and feel of Barcelona. Allen made a series of films-i.e. Match Point, Midnight in Paris, etc.-set in various European settings. The films vary in quality but they all stand as the most visually interesting films of Allen's career. He manages to capture-in soft light and romantic style-each city through his American eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a delightful story with fascinating characters,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a story where emotions, intuitions, states of mind and feelings are experienced very strongly and expressed widely. The constant self-narration could be somehow disconcerting but the genius Allen provides a narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) committed to making sure that even the most distracting viewer will get everything and won't miss a thing. Vicky Cristina Barcelona has been rightly told to be the cinematic equivalent of a book on tape: a flick watching itself for you and telling/explaining all you see. The three heroines are three very attractive girls/women (Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz) that show chemistry together and prove very fit for their roles. After three English settings Allen has moved to Barcelona (new experiment), showing once more that a suitable filming location is extremely important for the film to be successful (in terms of the story standing up not in terms of audience).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Entertaining and funny, Woody's still got it!","People have been criticizing Allen recently for taking himself too seriously and not meshing his more dramatic subject matter with the comedic elements of his screenplays, thus creating half-assed contrivances like last year's Cassandra's Dream, but Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a sure improvement. No, it's not a completely original entrance into the Woody canon; a lot of his prior themes about sex, love, and the consequences each can respectively produce pop up here but somehow he still manages to make it all seem fresh.Vicky Cristina Barcelona goes down easy. It's a deceptively simple meditation on the connection between love, art, and the ability to express oneself romantically and emotionally through the medium. Watching the film feels like spending a breezy afternoon in the beautiful titular city while the security and assurance one holds so closely crumbles around them. The two titular characters arrive in Barcelona with smiles on their faces, ready to relax and enjoy their youthful freedom, having no idea what's about to hit them.Allen slyly and ironically plays on the whole notion of foreign escapism. Most people hold this notion that they can get away from their current lives and lose themselves in another culture and with this film, Allen explores the sometimes negative aspects of enveloping oneself into something one just doesn't understand. Indeed, it's what both Vicky and Cristina do, as their entire self-confident personas are stripped down to bare nothingness during their stay in Spain, by the simple and simultaneously complex chemistry of two past-lovers played energetically by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz.But none of what is mentioned above is ever treated with the slightest heavy-hand. While it may sound grim, Allen perfectly induces a little comedy around each and every corner to remind us just how ridiculously irrational we can get over the trivialities of love. It's always fun, never mindless, and consistently well-written throughout, as one would come to expect of Allen.There is one glaring flaw however, and that is the often pointless narration. Every now and then a detached voice-over will tune in to describe what we can already tell from the images on screen. At other times, he'll describe the character's feelings or give background on certain situations. It's a lazy tactic that replaces what the actors should already be doing themselves and what the script should've indicated via character development. However, it gives the film this oddly lived-in feel, like an old scrapbook of forgotten memories to a trip to Spain.The performances are all impressive. As expected, Bardem and Cruz are sizzling on screen, their chemistry is completely undeniable, even when it seems like they're about to get at each other's throats. Newcomer Rebecca Hall gives the most emotional performance, as her character is swayed passionately numerous times throughout the film, portraying a woman who is unsure of her grip on life. And Johansson turns in her best performance in a Woody Allen picture, playing a woman whose liberties are challenged by the even more unconventional and unplanned lifestyles of the couple she falls for.In the end, the film is an assurance that Allen still has ""it"" and is feeling ever more confident behind the lens. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a highly entertaining, funny, and often heartfelt play on that little thing called love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
USA vs. Europe,"Woody Allen has moved and he obviously intends to stay in this Europe which fascinates him. Maybe a little too much. And that also goes for the girl characters here, Vicky and Cristina, who becomes engaged in this foreign world. And also foreign love.As always Allen uses his old tricks which you never get tired of. That means his funny dialog, mocking with intellectuals and still loving them. This could be just another Allen movie, if it wasn't for the great Penelope Cruz, who enters like a violent tornado and shakes everybody's lives.A little too much respect for ""European"" ways and ""European"" love, whatever that is. But you're never bored and never will be bored from an Allen movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woddy's at the top of his game,"I usually can take or leave most of Woody's pictures. I am probably one of the few people who think Manhattan is his classic, instead of Annie Hall; however, VCB is at the top of the list.Everything has come together in this one. I don't ever recall so much location filming in one of his films. It really opens up the story. I usually get turned off by a lot of narration, but in this case, it really added to the picture. It will be a crime if Scarlett, Rebecca and Penelope don't receive academy nominations. Scarlett, especially, is a revelation, with a casual, earthy performance.Stay overseas Woody!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting film but could have been better.,"This was an enjoyable film. Penelope Cruz was fantastic (although given a bit too much credit in my opinion), as was Javier Bardem. I also found Rebecca Hall's performance to be very interesting. Having never seen any of her other work, I'm not aware of her acting style, but her constant stuttering and her precise way of speaking were perfect for the character of Vicky and really helped illustrate her intellectual side and how critical that makes her. But I'm not sure if this is simply because she was speaking through an accent. Scarlett Johansson didn't really have much to her role, nor did she add anything, but at least she serves her purpose of looking pretty. Unfortunately, she is outshined by even Patricia Clarkson in a minor supporting part. But casting aside, the film is beautiful and Barcelona is the perfect setting for the story to take place. It's a complicated love story which I found interesting, particularly the three way relationship. I actually wish this was explored more in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
How is this winning any awards?,"Woody Allen appears to be on automatic pilot on this film. For all his grace behind the lens I only got the briefest of chuckles from VCB and spent the majority of the movie looking at the scenery and trying to catch a key grip in the shots.Seriously boring and extremely under acted, it was hard to get in to a film where a majority of the characters are not very sympathetic and, personally, you would not mind seeing hit by a cart of olives before the second act. And of particular regret were several scenes where pretty funny comedy could have been pulled off but were left falling flat. It was as if Allen was distracted while writing and lost his train of though. Caping it all off were the main characters almost sleep walking through the script and revealing nothing of the great actors they are.Serious Allen fans may enjoy this film, but for the rest of us I recommend his older stuff... or perhaps some Star Trek reruns... as opposed to this snoozer. Wait for it on a movie station for free.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen Films Are Now Made In China,"That's right, you read it correctly. Woody Allen's films are made in China. Somewhere on the outskirts of Beijing a small factory is churning out Woody Allen films by the million. They are not too hard to make. Just get a few actors, tell them it's a gab fest add a few neuroses, some middle class food and music with a splash of wine and you have the perfect Woody Allen film.Had it not been for my liking of Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz - see Almodovar - I wouldn't have watched this film. No doubt Bardem will put this on his list of bad memories. Ditto Cruz.It is truly atrocious and so dated. It says nothing. The most annoying part of the film was the commentary running over some of the action. Did I say action? I apologise. Maybe Allen as aimed this film at people who are stupid or suffer from dementia. I have never felt so patronised by such an inane commentary and it wasn't even funny.Next time I want to watch a film centered around Spain it won't be directed by Mr. Clich√©.",,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's World,"Greetings again from the darkness. I have enjoyed Mr. Allen's resurgence and obviously Scarlett Johansson has played the role of his muse. VCB takes a step up even from his most recent offerings both because of Allen's writing and the amazing cast.Scarlett teams with Rebecca Hall, a relative unknown in the U.S. (best known for ""The Prestige"" and ""Wide Saragasso Sea"") to play Cristina and Vicki, two American girls spending the summer in Spain. Scarlett is the free spirit, Rebecca is the engaged, practical one. The film takes off when they are both propositioned by a local painter played brilliantly by Javier Bardem, back in his most macho and amorous element after his trip down psycho road in ""No Country for Old Men"".There are no coin flips for Bardem's character. He wants everything, including both Scarlett and Rebecca. That would be enough for most films, but not for Woody! We are then treated to Bardem's ex-wife, played explosively by Penelope Cruz. She is amazing as the jealous, suicidal artist who transitions into the warm and caring mentor in a very odd communal setting with Scarlett and Javier.What adds the element of Allen brilliance here is the seemingly secondary character of Vicky played by Rebecca Hall. In reality, she is the heart of the story. Feeling trapped into a marriage to a Steve Guttenberg clone played by Chris Messina, Rebecca doesn't know how to handle the awakening since her Javier moment. Woody really pushes us on the topics of love, desire, freedom, loyalty, commitment and marriage. And if you need just an element of creepiness, Rebecca Hall's speech pattern and mannerisms remind me of Woody's-ex, Mia Farrow. Maybe that's why he cast a relative unknown?? Some of Woody's best writing in a long time and a pleasure to watch these fine actors execute. The best scenes are Javier and Penelope, and Javier and Rebecca. Throw in a beautiful soundtrack of Spainish guitar and you have a truly fine film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Scarlet Johansson carries the innocent look she had in ""the island"" and we have Javier Bardem in a completely contradictory style with what he had in his Oscar winning performance in ""no country for old men"".Penolpe Cruz as always sizzles and does what she does best. The movie has Vicky and Cristina having a vacation in Barcelona who incidentally meet and fall for the same guy Juan and both don't know of each others situation.Moreover Vicky is on the verge of her engagement but Christine is still in search of her soul mate.But Juan himself has just faced a divorce with maria(peneolpe Cruz).The rest is all Woody Allen's magic!!!

Yo soy Woody Allen,"After three years in England, Woody Allen ends his European vacation (his next feature, starring Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, is set in New York) in Spain, and delivers his freshest, funniest comedy in eleven years (the wonderfully self-deprecating Deconstructing Harry came out in 1997). In reality, Vicky Cristina Barcelona (the title alone borders on genius) contains nothing completely new for an Allen film: love, unhappiness, neurosis, chronic dissatisfaction. But instead of remaking one of his older New York films with younger actors (Anything Else compared to Annie Hall, for example), he uses the new, more romantic setting to breathe fresh air into the age-old story, supported by a fiery cast.As implied by the title, the main characters are Vicky (Rebecca Hall), Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) and the city of Barcelona, where the two spend the summer together. Vicky, the more rational one, is there to work on her university thesis (Catalan lifestyle) and take some time off before her imminent wedding. Cristina, who is more impulsive, came along to have some fun. Through one of Vicky's relatives (Patricia Clarkson, always as good) they meet an up-and-coming painter, Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), a man who embraces the positive aspects of life despite believing it to be ultimately pointless. In a classic Allen scene, he invites Vicky and Cristina to come with him to Oviedo for a weekend, explaining they will enjoy the sights, the food, the wine and, uh, the lovemaking. At this point, a mildly shocked Vicky asks: ""Excuse me, but who's gonna make love?"" Juan Antonio, as serious as a horny Spaniard will ever be, replies: ""Hopefully, all three of us.""Revealing anything else about the unusual threesome is a disservice to Allen's witty script. An exception would be mentioning that halfway through the movie Juan Antonio's psychotic ex- wife, Maria Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz), comes back home, and that's when the real madness ensues and one remembers why they fell in love with Woody's movies in the first place. For years, his modus operandi has been: take a relationship, mess it up, see what happens. Perhaps the fact that he doesn't play the leading role anymore (in fact, like in his best post-2000 film, Match Point, he doesn't appear at all) has encouraged him to try ""crazier"" things. In this case, the Spanish setting and the casting of Cruz (whom he wanted to work with at all costs after seeing the beautiful Volver) enable to him to blend his classic ""neurotic love story"" with a sort of spoof of the telenovela genre, following the example of the TV show Ugly Betty (which, like most of Allen's work, takes place in the Big Apple). The Spanish actress, matching the feisty intensity she showed in Almodovar's black comedy, is on top form, giving a spontaneous, wild performance that should earn her a second Oscar nomination. Not that her American co-stars are less good: Johansson cements her status as the director's new muse with a vitality that shows how terrific she can be when cast in the right part, while Hall, who is actually British, channels early Diane Keaton (from Woody's golden period) with grace.And what about the male cast? Well, there are only two presences who are prominent enough to rival with the Johansson-Hall-Cruz trio: Bardem and the omniscient narrator. The latter is actually a problem sometimes: it's fine, even entertaining, when he deadpans on events as we see them happen on the screen (especially when he describes an encounter between Cristina and Juan Antonio), less so when he insists on telling us exactly how the characters are feeling. Fortunately, Bardem compensates that occasional lack of charm by exuding loads of it: obviously relishing the opportunity to lighten up his image after his Oscar-winning turn in No Country for Old Men, he replaces that film's icy stare with a smile that could seduce anyone and speaks his lines with a warm earnestness few people wouldn't enjoy.Maybe it's a good thing that Allen's holiday ends here. After all, his London trilogy started superbly and ended on a less encouraging note, therefore it's wise of him to not attempt the same thing with Barcelona and return to America, leaving the misadventures of Vicky and Cristina as an indication that perhaps, hopefully, he has found his way again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Barcelona is definitely a romantic's paradise!!!!!,"Woody Allen has made an excellent selection of actors and location of the movie. Scarlett Johansson ( my all time favorite), Rebecca Hall (my new favorite) who are 2 American girls in Spain, Penelope Cruz , a Spanish girl from spain who speaks English with a heavy Spanish accent and Javier Bardem ( a Spanish actor known for his Oscar winning role in No country for old men) are very convincing throughout the movie. They are good in love scenes and also in having long sensible conversations. If Scarlett Johansson continues to work with Woody Allen she never has to pick up any other accent. She is always an American tourist either in England ( Match point, Scoop )or in Spain. Scarlett Johansson is a good actress . Her body and her voice are her signature. Penelope Cruz did an excellent job of a very possessive lover and also did very well with her outbursts of anger as with silent sexual and erotic moves. Javier Bardem has shown that he is good with a gun and without a gun. 2 movies with very contrasting roles.

"as in the movie ""It's good but there's no salt in it""","I always liked Allen and being myself Spanish and the movie being shot in Barcelona well... It was a ""must see"" to me. After 90 min I can recall is not the best movie of Allen by far. Is not the worst neither. Is like he had to made it so he threw up an average script, hired good actors and set up some ""typical Spanish"" locations and scenarios.There's the mostly unnecessary voice-over narration that fills in expository gaps. C'mon Allen, you have 4 fine actors who could have done it with no needs of this voice and it would allowed to go into the characters more deeply. Dialogues are just fine speaking of Woody Allen. Not as sharp or intelligent as used to be. A master in ""Catalan Identity""? Uummm... well. And how about a master in ""butifarras""? (catalan sausage). The pretext could have been better but it doesn't actually matter. It has no relevance in the movie.I have to say this movie is not about Spain or Barcelona. Barcelona is the scenario that's all. Some actors are Spanish playing Spanish. I can't understand why people is complaining about not being the real Spain what's is portrayed. This movie is about the story of one summer in Barcelona. Could be anywhere. And that's the way you have to watch it.Javier(what an actor!!), Scarlett and Cruz are all good, but it is Vicky character (Rebecca Hall) who stands out giving such depth.I've criticized enough this film but probably cause I expected a bit more. It has its points too. However I rarely find a film of Allen that isn't worth seeing The film is enjoyably light.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whatever Doesn't Work,"I find it paradoxical that Woody Allen's worst films, such as Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona are currently the only ones that are box office successes. His better films are mainly viewed by just a few people in New York, the West Coast and France. Woody's films are erratically released in the UK, so I saw this after his later, much better, effort Whatever Works.Basically, this is yet another remake of Manhatten. The difference is that the emotionally retarded, selfish characters in Manhatten are funny. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is meant to be serious drama. At least I think it is since I did not crack a smile in the entire 96 minutes.We know from the films that Allen made in the UK that he has a tin ear for British English and he sets his stories in a bogus England that has never existed. I suspect that his Barcelona is equally bogus. The film looks like a 1950s travelogue. It has an inept voice-over and some irritating travelogue-style incidental music. The voice-over does not tell us anything that we cannot see: ""They particularly enjoyed the works of Gaudi¬Ö"" (shot of Barcelona Cathedral) ""¬Öand Mir√≥ (shot of Vicky and Cristina admiring a Mir√≥. ""They strolled past the church in the wonderful summer night air while people celebrated¬Ö"" (V&C walk past a church while people light fireworks. ""¬Öfinally winding up about midnight in a little restaurant"", (we see V&C sitting in a restaurant).Juan Antonio, played by a bemused-looking Javier Bardem, takes Vicky for a meal and, at the end, says: ""Would you like to go to hear some wonderful guitar tonight?"". Cut to a scene in a candlelit garden where a small group of people listen rapturously to a guitarist playing Albeniz. It gives the impression that there are guitarists continuously hanging around Barcelona gardens on the off-chance that someone might want to hear some wonderful guitar music. This level of bogusness makes me wonder whether I am being na√Øve about Woody's New York films. Maybe they are equally bogus.Maybe Woody directed this on autopilot while he was thinking about the plot of Whatever Works. Vicky actually says ""Whatever works"" in response to the revelation that Cristina is enjoying a threesome with Juan Antonio and his ex-wife. There is the same ludicrous plot development where Cristina's holiday snaps get elevated to the level of great art. It is funny in Whatever Works but preposterous here. It only serves as an excuse to get Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Cruz into a darkroom for a bit of lesbian action. This being a Woody Allen film there is no on-screen sex so what we have is a film with soft-porn production values but without the soft-porn.The actors struggle throughout to make sense of the ludicrous dialogue. Rebecca Hall is the most successful. At the beginning of the film she looks as though she could be a worthy successor to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow as a Woody Allen muse but eventually even she too is submerged in a sea of implausibility.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretentious but Not at All Awful,"Some reviewers once again don't like a film because they don't like Woody Allen. The criticisms are that they don't like the snobby New York intellectuals. The dialogue is heightened--people don't speak that way. Of course, one can take any movie and criticize it for lack of naturalistic purity. Here, two women find themselves out of their elements. They get into things that drive them to act in ways they don't usually. Yes, the men are boring, but that's just a factor. Most people are boring and we marry them and do the best we can. Only one or two women married Errol Flynn or Clark Gable. And we don't even know if their screen personas were the same as their entertainment ones. This movie sets up a situation and lets its figures interact.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen and his crew enjoying a free trip to Barcelona,"The Spanish National Tourist Office, The Agency for Tourism in Catalonia, The Antoni Gaudi Association and Woody Allen proudly presents Vicky Christina Barcelona, the latest promotional movie targeted for the US market. The list of Golden Sponsors for this movie is the following: The Vacation Department of Hollywood Trade Union, The Macho Lover Guild, The Love-seeking American Girls Club, The Society of Idiotic But Wealthy American Husbands and finally the Merriam-Webster Dictionary of Stereotypes.So the story goes that Woody and his crew got bored in foggy Albion and aspired to warmer climate for a while. They also got allies, as the Spanish contingent in Hollywood wanted a free trip home. They quickly assembled a script, managed to convince some film managers (also just considering a Spanish vacation) and soon they started the shooting in the warm, sunny and lovable city of Barcelona. They also included a few excursions into the script, just to prevent getting bored in the same city for such a long time. Everyone enjoyed staying there, the siesta, the excellent wine, the tourist attractions, the friendly locals, the possibility of flirting and everything. In the end, somehow they even managed to put the film together.And it's not that bad, after all. The story passes as an easy-going comedy: the main line is that two American girls spend some time in Spain and have affairs with a charming Spanish womanizer. This is an ideal story for single female audience, but obviously alienates young and wealthy Gringos: unfortunately they are presented as boring idiots. Not exactly an ideal program to take your girlfriend out on Valentine-Day. Luckily, with non-US male audience the problem is absent, for they can easily identify themselves as the Latin womanizer and can also practice their anti-yankee sentiments.The movie is saved by the fairly good cast and the usual Woody Allen irony. A little bit everyone plays his or her parody, which gives just enough spice to the otherwise rather calculable story.Woody Allen has made much better movies than this one. Still, this is far more enjoyable than the the latest Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller effort or anything else Hollywood nowadays releases under the comedy tag.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sometimes movies don't need to convey any meaning or message to shine!,"I remember when I for the first time saw the Chinese title of Vicky Cristina Barcelona(translated as Midnight Barcelona), I was thoroughly touched---yet hadn't seen it; normally if the title is this intoxicating, you probably can count on the movie to be accordingly beautiful, plus Woody being the director, I looked forward to seeing it impatiently.It turned out to be nice enough to glue me on my chair when I saw it at a very late night. It's very fun and relaxing movie, with charming actors and music. I enjoyed seeing it. Afterwards I asked myself why I like Vicky Cristina Barcelona this much, and the answer, satisfactorily, is that there is no obvious meaning or message it tries to convey.Well, there are a lot of films that contain deep and serious meaning and messages, in the theme or in the camera-directing. Those films are indeed enlightening and they are sort of like our teachers, from whom we learn to live in our world. Yet there are other films that bring us pure fun and in the same process let us relax.Pure fun is very often in little things.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is quite little...you guys know what I mean don't you... The whole movie is like the music in it, friendly, delicate, relaxing, yet very sexy, and seeing a movie like it is pure fun. You don't have to think hard to pick up all the fragmentary threads to get the great idea, and you won't be completely shocked and feel ashamed to be human. Watching Vicky Cristina Barcelona, all you need to do is get yourself in a comfortable sofa, try to experience with the characters the beauty of Spain and its art, feel the actors' charm, laugh when the fun comes, smile when you find you can identify with them, move your body with the end music and plan on seeing Barcelona with your own eyes. What is left when you finish seeing it will be your smile and a refreshed body.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Barcelona,"I was pretty reluctant to watch this movie given that I don't care for most of the actors and I hadn't heard good things about it from the people in Barcelona, where I live. After watching it I can say that I found the movie entertaining and well made, but in many aspects I do agree with the Catalans and their complaints. Most of all, I would really like people to know, and I am an American who has been living in Catalu√±a for the last 20 years, that the beautiful and welcoming city you see in the movie is complete fiction. Barcelona's habitants, who speak a language called Catalan, are mostly poor and can't afford the many luxuries most tourists think. I know artists of all kinds, but not one who could afford to live on the money earned from it. Neither Javier Bardem nor Penelope are Catalans, which bothered some people, but most of the Catalans I know were more concerned with the fact that Bardem's character is from Oviedo, yet Vicky, who studies the Catalan identity (her one reason for visiting Barcelona), says she's interested in him because he's Catalan. Anyone who knows about Catalan identity should know that you are not Catalan just because you live in Catalu√±a. My husband was born in Barcelona, yet the Catalans consider him an outsider, because his parents are from the south. I understand that as American tourists, Vicky and Cristina are more interested in seeing the popular sights, but it would have been OK to show the real side of Barcelona, the heroin junkies (1% of the population, also the most common cause of death), the crime (mostly thieves), the very poor immigrants, etc...That aside, there are many things I did like about the film. As with all Of Mr. Allen's movies, you find incredibly witty dialog and interesting characters who will surely entertain you for the duration of the film. But the best thing about the movie, and this surprises even me, is Penelope Cruz as Maria Elena. I'm usually not a fan of her films or her acting, but she really outdid herself and was more alive than most of her costars. I'm tempted to have her ""Ni√±ata de mierda!"" scream as my ringtone.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is about two American friends who are both in their twenties, who decide to go to Spain for a few months during the summer. The first of two girls is Vicky who is engaged to be married to her fianc√© back home in America. Vicky is studying to complete her masters degree and overall is more of a conservative person. Cristina on the other hand has been in some amateurish type films and she really longs for romance whether it may be a one night stand, or a real lasting one. Cristina is a lot more adventurous which can not always be a good thing and even though at times Vicky and Cristina are the total opposites of each other they still work together well as good friends. While on their trip in Spain they meet an older Spanish artist who invites the both of them to come stay with him at his house and enjoy the many sights around them. Ultimately the film is about relationships. Some that work, others that do not and for people who get left out and are not particularly too sure of what they want. All this is told through narration and of course great dialogue and acting from the cast. Some of the television advertisements for Vicky Cristina Barcelona make the film look like some sexy, or erotic comedy, but I can most assuredly tell you that this film is neither one of those two things. Instead we are treated to a really interesting character study about relationships and the trials and sometimes the not so always pleasant things that happen in them. I found a lot of the film to be an accurate and honest look of this subject by providing us with everyday characters who would probably handle the relationships in this movie like most people of their age, or even older would as well. The writing and dialogue from writer/director Woody Allen is at it's best and he really deserves a Best Original Screenplay nomination for the film not only because of the well spoken, thought provoking and sometimes funny dialogue, bur for also writing and crafting such a story with some unique and overall really human and realistic characters that are examined in this tale of relationships which is a subject that Woody Allen does often and well too. The acting for the most part was really good with a standout performance by Rebecca Hall as Vicky. The other performances are quite good too, but I found Rebecca's performance as Vicky had the most emotion and depth to it and she delivered it perfectly. Spanish actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz yelling back and forth in Spanish at each other is also very interesting to watch and I enjoyed Bardem's playboy character. I'd probably have to say that the weakest performance in the film comes from Scarlett Johansson who plays Cristina, simply because her character doesn't have the same insight or is as dynamic, or as interesting as the other characters. Not to say that she weighs the film down, or anything like that, no not at all, but compared to the others it just really is not a standout performance, but because of the way her character is written, she is not given as much to work with and she is not as interesting a character as say Rebecca Hall's Vicky, or anything like that. Still that would be my only mild complaint about the film, but because of how the film plays out, one weak performance can not stop a movie with otherwise great acting and writing from being a great film. Listening to these characters talk was a very enjoyable experience if you are a fan of good writing and with the interesting dissection of these characters and these honest looks at their love lives I would say it is all done very well. This is also a beautiful looking film and is a lot to take in and think about. Even though I would not call this film a comedy I would say it works perfect as a drama and because of all the mastered writing and acting that went into it, I would say it's one of this year's finest accomplishments and one of the best films of the year so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The commenting voice of screen seemed to be too much present I would have preferred it highlights the past of the characters but not the moments when they are in Barcelona, there the picture speaks well enough It reminds you too often that you see the movie through the eyes of someone else rather then that you are experiencing the picture yourself. However the 'clarifying' voice is of the kind you are keen on while seated in comfortable cinema seat.

Not one word...,"I have the utmost respect for Woody Allen as a filmmaker ( I probably own more than a dozen of his films) and was very excited to hear that VCB was so well received by critics. Wow, what an incredible disappointment it turned out to be. I did not believe ONE WORD of this script- not one situation- not one character. Without going into great detail I'll just say I agreed with many of the negative reviews on this site concerning where the film failed: the narration ( jaw droppingly awful, the acting ( perhaps with the exception of Cruz) and the writing ( how badly did this script need a rewrite). If the film could have been saved it would have been by the last scene- but alas, by then the ship had sunk. I'm not giving up on Woody, he's too good a writer (maybe he could write about something he knows- like getting old- it might not be marketable but it could be great). Once Woody's film persona complained about TV audiences taste level ""having been systematically lowered""- unfortunately that's where his good reviews are now coming from. Oh , and Penelope Cruz being nominated for this instead of ""Elegy"" is an act that borders on the criminal.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Dull, but the story's not bad and the performances are good","The latest Woody flick is set in Spain, where friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) both get involved with an artist (Javier Bardem). Both women sleep with Bardem, but eventually Johansson ends up with him. Hall goes back to her boring finac√©, though her brief affair has distorted her view of her life. Meanwhile, Johansson has to deal with Bardem's crazy ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who is invited back home after a suicide attempt. The story, though perhaps overcomplicated, is a good one. Unfortunately, Allen kind of spoils it by including a bland voice-over narration that over-explains the plot. The narration distances the audience from the action, and the film started to drag for me. And in the end, it felt like nothing much had happened. I didn't care and I doubt the movie will remain long in my memory. However, that's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's a moderate failure for the long-suffering Allen, but it's a success for most of the actors. In particular, I think Penelope Cruz's performance should be considered award-worthy. It'll probably be worth catching on DVD, but I wouldn't especially recommend you be in any rush.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very interesting twist to relationships,"I had never seen an Allen's movie until yesterday. He's famous for being kind of out of the ordinary. Let me tell you I absolutely adored it. I won't spoil the movie at all for you but follow my advice when I tell you to go and see it.But here's some warning: You gotta go absolutely free-minded.This movie shows a very -hmm let's say- DIFFERENT and INTERESTING way to relationships that have always been the same to us. I personally think I'm not able to do that but it might work for others.You gotta see this movie as divided. The first half is about Vicky and Cristina interacting with Juan Antonio (Javier Berdam). I would say it's very funny and entertaining but the REAL story begins with Penelope's apparition twisting the story in a way you wouldn't imagine.As for the acting, my opinion is Penelope's character was the best and her interpretation was perfect. She absolutely won over the movie even though she only appears in the second half of it. Scarlett, Javier, and Rebecca's characters were as well acted as Penelope's but it was the force of the lines they had that made Penelope rise up.As my first review, I'm hoping for you not to be so harsh on me.

Speaking Catalan with Woody Allen,"Woody Allen's on a roll again.Three years ago he gave us ""Match Point,"" a nearly perfect thriller that was unlike anything he'd done before, and last year he directed the under-appreciated ""Cassandra's Dream."" With ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" he's proved that this new artistic reawakening is more than a passing phase.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) travel to Barcelona for a summer adventure. Vicky is treading water until she marries her fianc√©. Cristina, a wilder spirit, is looking for love, or at least lust. Both become involved with a dashing Spanish artist (Javier Bardem) and find that the things they took for granted about themselves may not be true after all, and each leaves Barcelona a little less grounded than she was when she arrived.What makes so many Woody Allen films good is the same for this one. He understands both the dynamics of human emotions and the needs of effective drama, so if he's got even half-way decent actors in his movies the material is bound to succeed. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" he's got better than half-way decent actors. Rebecca Hall is probably the least known of the cast, but she makes one of the biggest impressions, and the movie is ""about"" Vicky more than it is anyone. Johansson and Bardem are well cast and they act their parts well. But it's Penelope Cruz, who storms into the film at about the mid-way point as Bardem's unhinged ex-wife, who you'll most remember.""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" explores the differences between the way different people approach relationships. It's about the difference between those who are artists and those who are not, and it's also about the difference between Americans and Europeans. But it's never judgemental and it doesn't generalize. Every single character, even those with little screen time, is fully developed and respected by both Allen and the actors who play them.

"Superbly Cast, Brilliantly Executed","Upfront: I don't recall a single joke in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" which in itself suggests a film by someone other than Woody Allen. Yet it is certainly one of the best movies Woody has ever made -- focused on the personalities and characters of the four main protagonists. They are the two American tourists, visiting Barcelona for the summer, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), the magnetic Spanish painter, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and his moody, explosive ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). Without giving away too much of the plot, Vicky, the sensible and apparently self-contained one, and Cristina, eager for novelty and sexual adventure, are both attracted to Juan Antonio -- Vicky guiltily and Cristina unreservedly. And into the picture strides the mercurial Maria Elena, complicating an already complicated and explosive emotional mix. The four principals in this film have been brilliantly chosen. And while Penelope Cruz clearly deserved the Oscar she won as Maria Elena, Hall, Johansson and Bardem also acquit themselves with distinction. I don't recall an ensemble in my entire film-going experience that equals these four. Woody Allen has somehow, somewhere acquired a sensitivity that has been evinced only sporadically over his long career. Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters are previous examples but not as sustained, not as free of his characteristic joking. This is a magnificent movie and should have been more widely rewarded than it was. I was particularly impressed with Rebecca Hall, whom I don't remember having seen before, though Penelope Cruz, as the script allowed undoubtedly stole the show without over-acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Important Travel Advisory from a resident of Barcelona :-),"Earlier today, while making silly predictions for the Golden Globe winners, I suggested that ""In Bruges"" was actually funny, whereas the other nominees in the category of Best Comedy were not. In saying that I did an injustice to Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona.""VCB is funny. Just not in that LOL kind of way that ""In Bruges"" was for me. It's more of a wise, unattached funny, the kind that might be written and directed by, say, the Ultimate New York Neurotic.And I really loved the film. If you want an inspiration to visit my area of Catalunya, this film is it in spades. Woody has always had an uncanny eye for capturing the beauty of the locales in which he films. Think ""Manhattan."" 'Nuff said, right? OK, Barcelona and the area of Spain around it are easily as beautiful as Gordon Willis' Manhattan. And it's all right up there on screen, no special effects necessary. It's really a lovely place.But, in the interest of Touristic Integrity, I feel it necessary to correct some of the clich√©s and/or stereotypes that Woody writes into his script, and his characters. I would not wish that hapless Americans, seduced by the vision of the joys of Catalunya as seen by a New Yorker, might venture to my adopted land expecting one thing, and thus possibly set themselves up to miss the real charms of the place. My quibbles with Woody's vision are the following:1. First, not all Spanish women are as attractive as Penelope Cruz. Penelope was considered the Ugly Duckling of the class throughout her school years, and still is. The Spanish don't hold it against her, because she can act. ( On the other hand, Spanish women *are* all as crazy as her character of Maria Elena. Potential tourists, be warned. )2. Second, not all guitarists in Spain are as good as the ones featured in the film. There is one guy in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona who really sucks.3. Third, not all Spanish men are as charming and handsome and have as smooth a line of bull as Javier Bardem does in VCB. That's a myth, as pervasive and as misunderstood as the myth of Penelope Cruz's beauty. The only men in Spain who are as charming, handsome, and well-spoken as Javier Bardem's character Juan Antonio in VCB are American ex-pat writers living in Sitges. They also have a characteristic that Juan Antonio lacks in the film -- humility.4. Fourth, and this is more trivia than a correction, part of the film is set in the city of Oviedo. One of the sights of Oviedo is a life-size statue of Woody Allen, which was installed in 2003. Woody avoided what must have been a Hitchcockian temptation to include it in the film. I guess neurotic New York filmmakers have that humility thing going for them, too.Thank you for your kind attention to this Travel Advisory.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Allen,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)*** (out of 4)Girlfriends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are on vacation in Barcelona when a painter named Juan (Javier Bardem) invites them to travel with him. Both women end up going and falling for Juan but their paths towards him are a lot different. Things take yet another turn when Vicky gets married and Juan's ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) enters his life again. I guess it's not really fair to say I'm a tad bit disappointed considering I liked the film yet I was really hoping for more even though what's here is pretty entertaining. I get the negative stuff out of the way first and for me it was the final thirty-minutes of the movie. The way Allen kept going back and forth between the two story lines wasn't all that interesting to me and I even think Vicky's character wasn't all that well written in the second half of the film. That's really a shame because Hall is very good in her role as are the rest of the cast but it's Bardem who really steals the movie. I really loved his performance here with that Romeo like charm that he pushes on all three of the women in his life. I think he perfectly captures that sexuality he is constantly giving off but it works because of his charm as well. Johansson is making a name for herself in Allen's movies and he's once again written a very good role for her and the actress delivers. Cruz is only in the film for a handful of scenes but she's really, really good here and works excellently with Bardem. As with the recent trend in Allen's films, this one here benefits from the beautiful Spanish landscape, which certainly sets the mood for the film. Allen's choice for a music is a good one and the cinematography is nice as well. While this is an entertaining film I wouldn't call it one of the director's best.",,Anonymous,Romance

Could be two in two,"What helps make a good movie? Just follow a current winning formula, put Javier Bardem in it. Vicky Cristina Barcelona, is Woody Allen's latest creation, and is one of his best in recent memory. What makes this movie shine is not its sharp dialogue or decent story, it's the characters within the movie, that move this picture along in such a successful way. Vicky, Cristina, Juan Antonio (Bardem), Maria Elena (Cruz), and even the city of Barcelona is character in its own way. Every single one of these people are unique, have there own charm and character arcs in the movie that make is come together well.Like the title of this review says, Javier Bardem could be going for two in two years for the best-supporting Oscar, though it's likely he will lose to Heath Ledger's Joker performance. Penelope Cruz provides a phenomenal supporting role as Bardem's crazy ex-wife, and should also garner an Oscar nod this year. While the two main leads in this movie provide fairly standard performances that don't particularly stand out, the character arcs written into are interesting enough to keep the audience entertained. Perhaps the more interesting of the two characters is Rebecca Hall's Vicky, who has extremely convincing moral conflicts that pushes her character through the movie. While not entirely convinced in Scarlett Johansson's acting chops, her Cristina characters bizarre love triangle with Bardem and Cruz, is one of the more interesting story aspects in the movie.Another interesting point within the movie is the use of a narrator to help move the story along, while this could be a double edged sword, this also allows for the story to avoid lengthy scenes of explanation, which are quickly summed up by the narration. This though can help with the characters at time, because he explains psychology for dummies into the thought processes of the characters when necessary.Pros: Bardem, Cruz deliver superb performances as attractive, charming, and eccentric characters. Very interesting character arcs, and moral conflicts within the characters. Barcelona is absolutely gorgeous as a back drop for a summer romance.Cons: Not entirely sold on Scarlett Johansson just yet. Story sometimes becomes dry. The use of a narrator can be hit or miss, even though it hits more than misses. Makes you wish you were in Barcelona... but your not.Overall: A movie most girl friends will try and drag their boyfriends to. If your into psychological movies, with a lighter tone, and great character arcs, see it. This movie will give you something to talk about once you leave the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beddings And Weddings In Barcelona,"As is typical with a Woody Allen film, some of the characters speak with his voice. Sometimes there is a narrator who speaks his words, as in this film. The character that channels his voice the most is Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is the voice of reason, or of reason holding emotion at bay. Her friend, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) represents the voice of emotion unfettered, the romantic ideal.When the two women fly to Barcelona for the summer, they meet an artist who represents the Bohemian lifestyle: wine, women, song, and a commitment to living each day to the fullest. Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) seems to wear his heart on his sleeve. Or is he calculating the best way to bed the two friends? We learn that he has an ex-wife with whom he had a tempestuous marriage. He likes to talk about her for some reason.As the summer passes, there are flirtations and trysts. Artistic expressions and emotional explorations. And the two women learn more about themselves.

"Refreshing, sexually explosive, smart, and a real winner for Woody","VCB offers, first and foremost, a very smart look at romance. It is complicated, emotional, and of course, awkwardly hilarious. The timeless Woody Allen works comedy into his latest - and one of his best - by giving us humor that isn't funny within the movie, but is hilarious to us, the viewer watching the situation unfold before us. Allen's clever and complex outlook on relationships and what romance should be (that there should be no barriers), helps make VCB the most original, likable, and best romantic comedy of the year.Our actors work very well as an ensemble, especially our four main characters. The advertising makes it seem that there are only three main characters. While Bardem, Johansson, and Cruz make up the main cast, Rebecca Hall's character is just as important, and was sadly neglected in the advertising process. It's a real shame, because Hall's performance as the lovably neurotic and straight edge Vicky is a great one. It's a character we've seen countless times, but Hall brings something new to the character this time around. The inner conflict - the perfectly emoted lines - make her character the most realistic in the movie, and therefore she becomes the character the audience latches onto.Bardem and Johansson are...different...in their roles. This isn't a bad thing by any means. It's just that it's hard, as a viewer, to see Bardem go from sociopathic killer Anton Chigurh to the light hearted and free spirit Juan Antonio. Bardem's transition from ""north to south"" is seamless, and he's completely believable in his part, which of course, reminds any detractors just how versatile he can be. Scarlett Johansson's role is nothing new for her, as she's played variants of her character before, and her Cristina is basically a conglomerate. Her performance could have been better, but in no way does it take away from the film. She could have accentuated the 'free spirit' aspect of her character.Penelope Cruz is nothing short of brilliant in her role as Bardem's ex-wife. The chemistry between Bardem and Cruz is electric, and is the emotional center of the movie. Much of who Bardem's character is centers around the performance of the actress playing his ex. Cruz is excellent, with her bilingual, unstable, and explosive performance. An Oscar nomination should be given here, though I don't know if it'll happen.I also feel the need to note the excellent dialog, which is always present in an Allen film. The script is great, and again, an Oscar nomination is possible here as well. The film moves along quickly with beautiful shots of a beautiful city in Barcelona. Allen uses all the city's beauty to his advantage to make the film even better.When dealing with performers that are as good looking as the actors we have here, the sexual tension presented by the film is already at an elevated level. Well, in the case of VCB, the sexual tension between ALL our character is so dynamic, palpable, and electric that you might get a little sweaty in the theater. It's a very sexy, hot, and hormone exciting film. If there's someone you know might be open to having a 'good time' with you, this is definitely the film to put them in the mood. In the end though, VCB is among Woody Allen's greatest movies, and is definitely one of the better films of the year. It's a smart romance movie that is a good break from the stupid and formulaic romcoms that are being churned out every other month.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sense and Sensibility in Barcelona,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) was written and directed by Woody Allen. Allen's movies almost always feature a beautiful woman. This movie features three beautiful women, all of whom swirl around macho Javier Bardem. The plot reprises ""Sense and Sensibility."" Two friends visit Spain for the summer. Rebecca Hall, as Vicky, is reserved and cerebral. Scarlett Johansson as Cristina is outgoing and looking for adventure. They both get involved with Juan Antonio (Bardem), a brilliant painter and, no doubt, a brilliant lover. Into the mix Allen brings Penelope Cruz, Juan Antonio's ex-wife. She screams, she cries, she throws things. And yet, Juan Antonio can never really fall out of love with her.There's lots of hopping in and out of bed, and lots of talk about hopping in and out of bed. However, the picture is PG-13, so there's not much sex on screen. Instead there are great shots of Barcelona and the small city of Orviedo in Asturias.This film isn't much if you sit down and analyze it, but when you're watching it, it keeps your attention. I've never been wild about Scarlett Johansson as an actor, and Penelope Cruz relies too much on her beauty, and too little on her talent. However, I really admire Rebecca Hall whose tall elegance makes the other two women look tawdry.I saw this film on DVD, and it worked well. Note: there's a howler in the movie. Vicky is supposed to be doing graduate work on Catalan culture, but she doesn't speak Spanish. Allen could have pulled this off by saying, ""She only speaks Catalan."" He didn't bother. What is Vicky doing in the library when we see her with a book in her hand? Looking at the pictures?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A perfectly-acted, Artistically sexy and romantic film","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is perhaps a new renovation for romantic comedies. The film has such an ambitious and artistic tone and atmosphere to it. The screenplay, perfectly written, shows true lust and romance that appears at some point in peoples' lives, in this case, Vicky and Cristina. This film does not follow usual 'love' routines, and that is why it really is not a very romantic comedy, but more of the type of romance that you can only dream about, the type of romance that sweeps you away, and the type of romance that cannot always be fulfilled. It breaks all the rules for love, and shows how it does not have to be real, or even lasting. The film's stars, Rebbecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson capture the moods and feelings of their characters perfectly. Javier Bardem plays Juan Antonio, and does a great job, as well as Penelope Cruz, which gives a tour-de-force performance here. The main talk will be Cruz, and that is because, in her few scenes, she completely electrifies the screen with her rambling, lunatic and haunting portrayal as Juan Antonio's ex wife. Her awards sweep has been greatly deserved. But I also thought that Hall has been greatly ignored. She does the best with her scenes, and she is very natural, and realistic. She also gives one heck of a performance.Overall, one very entertaining, artistic, and memorable film. Surely one of the films of 2007 that will be greatly appreciated with time, and very deserving too.",,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't think I'd see this Woody Allen take on Latin loveplay,"Didn't think he was capable of portraying it honestly or with any insight. Surely Barcelona is a long ways from angst-ridden Manhatten. And though I like Bardem's work, and think Scarlett Johansson is always a great choice for female lead, I was leery about spending much time watching Penelope Cruz acting wild and over-the-top at Allen's direction. To my surprise, Cruz was the most impressive of all. In just a few minutes, and she's on only a short time, she manages to nail a certain Latin type that anyone acquainted with the genuine article will recognize immediately. My only complaint is I wish Allen had gotten his camera in a little closer to Cruz as her performance is truly memorable and I would have enjoyed seeing more of her. Otherwise, this is a fun sex comedy which I still have trouble attributing to Woody Allen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody's best work in years!!,"I've always been a fan of Woody Allen's ability to write. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is probably Woody's best work in years. His film stars Vicky (Rebecca Hall) who early in the film fills the screen with prudish discussion and her love for her fianc√©e. Then there is Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) who is openly trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life.The anchors in this film are Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), fresh from his Oscar win for 'No Country For Old Men', his fiery ex-wife Maria Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz) and the stunning city of Barcelona.The screenplay starts with a slow narration where we find American tourists and best friends, Vicky & Cristina, having just arrived in Barcelona to spend 2-months in the beautiful, gorgeous, Catalonian city. The two quickly meet the high-flying, sexy artist Juan Antonio who invites them for a long weekend while pointing out he would enjoy their company in bed. Vicky is insulted while Cristina is interested and very much attracted to Juan Antonio.The film hastens when Cristina & Juan Antonio convince Vicky to come along. The acting and dialogue are fresh, funny and unpredictable. Maria Elena steals the show when she surprisingly shows up and keeps you guessing throughout the film. The chemistry and timing are impeccable; all this reminding you of the Woody of old.'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a romantic comedy set in a most beautiful part of the world with an excellent script, spicy soundtrack and amazing twists and turns.

I kept wondering....,"...why Vicky and Cristina were friends in the first place. I simply could not figure it out; they did not act like best friends of long standing.I pretty much enjoyed the movie. The scenery was lovely. Scarlett Johansson is always a pleasure to look at, although this was not her strongest performance IMO. Javier Bardem was HOT! and the electricity between him and his real-life wife Penelope Cruz was palpable. Like many other reviewers, I found the voice-over narration intrusive and annoying. Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find Rebecca Hall at all beautiful and her performance did not move me, although I was impressed when I learned she had gotten the Ian Charleson Award for her stage work in 2003.But, as I said, I pretty much enjoyed the movie. Though I do have to say that in some respects it was like an adolescent male's prolonged wet dream (can I say that here?)-- not that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but the fact that this particular wet dream is written and directed by Woody Allen kind of creeps me out, for obvious reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Something different from Woody,"I'm not a constant Woody Allen fan - so I loved ""Hannah And Her Sisters"" and then was disappointed by ""Scoop"" - but this film, which he both wrote and directed, is something different. Of course, it does no harm that it is full of attractive people - Rebecca Hall as the restrained Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as the impulsive Cristina, two young American friends spending the summer in Catalonia, plus Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio and Pen√©lope Cruz as Maria Elena, Spanish artists who once had the near-prefect marriage - and of gorgeous locations - Gaud√≠'s Barcelona, of course, but also Oviedo and Avil√©s.What makes the movie though is the relationships and inter-relationships, mainly between these four colourful and contrasting characters but also between Vicky and her fianc√© and an older American couple who seem to foretell where one of the young women is going. The acting is very naturalistic and the script has its fair share of humour in a narrative that presents a shifting kaleidoscope of emotions. When the shaking stops, how different will things be?

"Sporadically Interesting, Constantly Clumsy and Inaccurate","My video store was doing an everything-must-go operation on their music and film articles so I bought a Blu-Ray copy of Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona for 5$ as I remembered that Penelope Cruz's performance was exceptional. When I put it on this evening I couldn't believe how insufferably bad everything else about it was.The story is pretty simple. It's a soft love/sex quadrangle between a guy and three women with a vague Woody Allen lemon flavor. The first woman (Rebecca Hall) is square, rich and fond of art, poetry and music. The second woman (Scarlett Johansson) is more unstable, not-so-rich but not-so-bad and fond of art, poetry and music. The third woman (Penelope Cruz) is self-destructive, not-so-rich but not-so-bad and an artist herself. The guy (Javier Bardem) is square, extremely rich and an artist himself. Together, they go sight-seeing, develop pictures in their darkroom, paint, write poetry, listen to Catalan guitar, have sex and drink expensive wine. And then everyone goes back where they came from and it's over.Almost a decade after watching it for the first time, I can say that Cruz's performance holds up in depth and subtlety and that the film is still worth watching for that (the confrontation scene in the kitchen is brilliant). It actually makes up for Johansson and Hall's often-embarrassing screen time. 
Having said that, it's not their fault; it's the director's. Woody Allen's reputed technique of having his ensemble cast recite his dialogue is responsible for a lot of the film's mediocrity because the lines themselves lack the sarcasm and the grace of his finer work. As for Javier Bardem, he's stuck in neutral gear, trying to temper the monstrous imbalance between Cruz's atomic bomb of a performance and Hall and Johansson's unflavored acting.One of the most frustrating elements of the entire film is the voice-over that constantly explains what the audience is supposed to figure out on its own if the film is well directed, but for some reason Allen doesn't want you to think. He'd rather have a narrator tell you what the characters are feeling or take you through an ellipsis of questionable subtlety. So for example the voice-over would tell you someone's sad when they're supposed to be sad. Maybe the director doesn't want you to think as mentioned before, or perhaps wants to think for you for ego-related reasons, or maybe tell you what to think for pretentiousness-related reasons. Whatever the case, the audience ends up feeling useless and stupid.
I find the use of voice-over in a fiction film very questionable in general, and quite problematic in Vicky. I always have trouble understanding why some directors try to blur the line between cinema and literature. There is no separation between novel language and screenplay language in here. The voice over in Vicky Cristina Barcelona is like an audiobook with optional shots. 
Not to mention that the characters speak nothing like real people. Woody Allen's really happy having one woman recite another woman's character bible instead of giving the audience the pleasure and luxury of unveiling it. This might have been fun a few times in the past but now it looks like narrative incompetence (which might actually be true).
The editing is flaky as well. I can mention several close-ups where I would've liked to see the reverse shot instead of being stuck with the original shot lasting several seconds longer than needed (which, in a feature film, can feel really awkward).You've asked for a Woody Allen film and you're getting one. 
You get the color corrector who explodes the yellows to make the film look Spanish, artistic and old. Spain is yellow.
You get the aforementioned manipulated acting (if you mute some scenes you'd think Scarlett Johansson is saying ""I was told to stand like this!""). 
You get punk rock explained to you by Woody Allen: a grandfather who refuses to publish his poetry because SCREW THE SYSTEEEEEM. See, Woody knows everything about the Sex Pistols.
An excerpt from an unknown black-and-white film also makes its way out of nowhere to accompany a piece of lost voice-over midway into the film. Vicky Cristina Barcelona wouldn't be a Woody Allen film without him lecturing us on cinema. On classical cinema. On what's ""good cinema"" and what's ""bad cinema"". And we could go on and on about almost all other artistic disciplines. Classical guitar, for example, is ""good music"". It's the Catalan version of a standard Woody Allen jazz soundtrack. Taking pictures is also ""good art"" (with a silver camera, of course, not those decadent digital cameras!).
Also, the more sensual scenes of the film beg the question: has Woody Allen ever actually seen a romantic sexual encounter, let alone between two women? I'm speaking for myself but I don't think two people have ever caressed each other's arms for two seconds and started having sex right away without prior signals. Ever. Not even in Humphrey Bogart movies; at least they argued before every kiss. The events that lead to sex in Vicky Cristina are too neutral.But the worst sin of the film is that its creator has no clue whatsoever who he's catering to. 
Who are the people who watch romantic comedies? 
Who are the people who watch sex comedies? 
Who are the people who watch the romantic sex adventures of Woody Allen characters in Spain? 
Who are the people who watch comedies, considering that Vicky qualifies as a comedy in Woodyland? 
""Two university graduates go wine-tasting."" 
""Two BFF's suddenly have passionate sex and fall in love with a wealthy painter (throw in a suicidal ex-lover because otherwise it's a non-story)."" 
""A woman happens to be studying Catalan painting and happens to fall in love with a Catalan painter who happens to still have feelings for his destructive ex who happens to be a Catalan painter."" 
What's the demographic for that? 
After some thinking, now I know. 
It's the people who, like Woody, think that only straight, vanilla, female polygamy is cute and acceptable and who worship the director for ""shining a light"" on that. 
It's the people who, as much as you criticize a Woody Allen film, will always answer ""Hey, it's Woody!""
It's the people who refuse to admit that there are very specific reasons why 9 Woody Allen films out of 10 lose money and that ""art-house"" is not an excuse.Vicy Cristina Barcelona has its interesting aspects but it perfectly shows you that Woody Allen really lives in his own bubble. Almost all of his movies from the 21st century lack the substance to make up for that and Vicky's one of them. This used to bother the fans, now I don't think anyone bothers anymore.All in all, the quality of the film is awfully mediocre. Long story short, towards the end, the square girl gets shot by the unstable woman. The square girl tells her husband Doug that her former Spanish teacher shot her by mistake. Doug buys it. That's the movie we're dealing with.And that's one of the ""good"" 21st century Allen films. If you want, you can go watch Larry David scream at the camera for an hour.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One Of The Most Honest & Intelligent Movies About Love, Romance & Relationships","As a man, I am obviously not a fan of romance movies like women are. The reasons why most men do not enjoy them are obvious, most of them are made for women, thus they pander to women and make the movies all too girly, and in addition they make them unintelligent and cliche and generic.This movie is the opposite of all of that. While it is romantic in its use of artwork, it is not girly. It is a highly intelligent, sophisticated and brutally honest look at romance, love and relationships, the way we experience it in the real world of dating, not the way most hollywood movies portray.Of course you need a film mastermind like Woody Allen to portray this. And this, to me as a film buff, is his masterpiece. I consider this to be his best film. It is so eloquently written and directed. Some films are works of art. But this is fine art.And he couldn't do it without the all star cast he lines up for it however. Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz and Scarlette Johansen star in this film in some of the most lovable roles of their careers.And this film goes where no other films dare to go, at least not seriously (some late night comedies do, but in a comical way, this of course is different). This film explores the very complicated concept of polyamory and its complex dynamics. That is dating multiple people at the same time. For in this film 3 women fall in love with the same man, each with a different type of relationship with him, and each other. As a social scientist this movie was a delightful exploration of the social dynamics in dating and relationships.And the romantic artistic portrayal of the depth of these emotional situations and relationships and the complexity of it all is just so charming. Especially with the narration. But this movie is not just a feel good movie. It exposes all of the parts of love and these relationship dynamics that most of us people who believe in love, (especially us polyamorists who believe in it in abundance), do not like to talk about and face.Through the characters having to process their own romantic feelings, it helps you to process them as well. Something most dumbed down romance movies just do not offer you. Nor do they offer you the level of art that this one does as well. So this is a movie that any Romance genre loving female will like, but which any intelligent man will enjoy as well.In fact I believe this is the best romance film ever made. An easy 10. And a must see for any film lover.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sadly Disappointing,"This film left me scratching my head. As so many others have pointed out in these posts, the characters, without exception, are self-indulgent, spoiled, unlikeable hedonists who occupy their own tiny, self-absorbed worlds. While art, romance and relationships are intended (I suppose) to be examined and appreciated, the film succeeds only in trivializing and ridiculing anything of real value and merit.The film lacks any stamp of Allen's typical wit and humor. In fact, I'm hesitant even to call it a comedy since it would be cruel to laugh at people so vacuous and pathetic. Sadly, the script gives the normally stellar cast precious little from which to create believable characters -- the result being a hodgepodge of clich√©s and stereotypes.

"Good postcard film, but postcard film anyway","I'll be brief, since I don't like reviewing films that much. However, I just hope to warn any possible viewers giving my point of view in what I believe is a good movie that could have been much better if it wasn't such an awful representation of Barcelona.With this film, Allen claimed he wanted to make a film ""where the city was the protagonist"". Well, in this, the film is a miserable failure. The whole representation is like some sort of anti-septic city, beautiful and monumental, almost like some earthy paradise, with people owning large houses and living beside the mountain. Of course, I couldn't ask for Woody Allen to make actual social commentaries- that would be for someone else- but I think he exceeded a little the whole ""beautiful shots"" a lot, it's almost like a tourist guide, there is nothing of the true Barcelona here. Rumours say that Allen was pressured to make such a nice view of Barcelona by the government of the city, that paid for part of the film. I am unsure, however the most ""realistic"" part was when he showed the street prostitutes, the rest is purely postcard. I was expecting this when I heard he would shoot in my city, which is in fact very beautiful and monumental, yes, but also has another side, much larger and much more charming (even if darker) that has been completely ignored.The rest of the film, I enjoyed a lot. I am glad Penelope and Bardem were cast in the film, as they make- to my taste- the most interesting characters in the film. The relationships of the characters are interesting, and even though they are mostly clich√©s, the way they are used is very intelligent. It could have been better, but I can't complain since the film kept me interested most of the time, even though it bugged me a little with it's excessive voice over narrations, I was expecting a whole Jeunet style ""like/don't like"" scene at any moment.But this review is mainly a statement from someone who lives in Barcelona, just pointing out the representation of the city is fake and forced, purely promotional. Sure, it is still beautiful, but not the way Woody puts its. Hell, it would have been much more credible if Christina had been robbed at least once.",,Anonymous,Romance

Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona made me want to watch more Woody Allen films. It's eye-opening expose of love in all it's guises and the complexities surrounding it. The characters are multi-faceted individuals who change and grow in striking ways as the plot unfurls, and it is highly unlikely you'll be able to guess who'll end up with who in the closing moments. It maintains a consistent level of quality throughout, but the midway point when Penelope Cruz's unstable ex-wife role is unleashed, definitely moves things to a higher level. A well deserved Oscar for her, methinks.The only other Allen movies I'd watched before this one were Sleeper and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask ( that was a mouthful... lol) which were hardly indicative of his usual fare. Say what you like about the bloke's somewhat neurotic perspective, or his controversial lifestyle choices... he can both spin a good yarn and write compelling people in his films.

The city of Barcelona and Oviedo are so romantic and artistic. Credit also goes to cinematography.On performance side, Rebbecca Hall and Penelope Cruz were stand out. Rebbecca Hall as defensive but emotionally weak was pure fun to watch. Penelope Cruz gave the performance of life time. Her Spanish style English accent was genuine. I mean she was born to do this role. Scarlett Johanson is beautiful and convincing. Javier Bardem was also suitable as a painter.

Unfortunately, Woody Allen has delivered a movie that only asks these questions for people that have a virtually unlimited money supply, a vast amount of free time and a lifetime of worldly experience with which to explore these questions.Most people must squeezes these question in the short period of time in which they are not accumulating rent money and getting breakfast for the kids.Yes, many of us have experienced the moment of choice between taking the sure bet and rolling the dice for a superior experience.

One of Woody Allen's best,"It has become fashionable to 'dump on' Woody Allen these days. People say he's past it, his films aren't what they were, why doesn't he dry up. That is all nonsense. This film has all the freshness and verve of the Woody of his youthful prime. People forget that 'Take the Money and Run', his first film, was terrible. It took him a long time to become as good a director as he is. He had to struggle against categories, trying to be serious sometimes (it could be said he has always been serious, and his humour was a blind). In this wonderful film, containing some of the funniest of scenes, and from which he is absent as an actor, we find a serious tale communicated to us as a hilarious comedy. The biggest and best surprise of the film is the radiant performance of Rebecca Hall. Many of us remember the way she dominated the British television mini-series 'The Camomile Lawn', as a child of about ten, stealing the scenes from many famous adult actors. Now she has become a big girl (indeed, surprisingly tall), and her childlike charm has been preserved as in amber, inside a sensitive adult persona, giving an irresistible mixture of inner innocence and outer 'seen it all' confidence which she has created for herself as an exterior protective layer. Woody Allen has always had a genius for bringing the best out of women in his movies. Some of the most memorable and glowing female performances in cinema history are to be found in his movies. I would rate that as his greatest gift to us, exceeding even his comedy and his pathos. In this film, two other splendid actresses also excel. Once again, we see an incredibly incisive and intuitive performance by Scarlett Johansson, this time as a girl who doesn't know what she wants, but only knows what she doesn't want, and isn't too sure about that either. By getting inside this character, Johansson shows us the inner vacuity of the girl, who is a kind of charming village idiot who wanders the world, beautiful, alluring, and passionate, and about as clued up as an old boot. This character relates to Rebecca Hall's ordered and sensible girl in a sublime symbiosis. Into this heady mix comes the other gal: Penelope Cruz at her fieriest and most intensely Spanish, ranting, raving, loving, hating, cursing, firing pistols, sobbing, collapsing, springing up and having another go, - it is all so magnificent. The man they all dance round is Javier Bardem, a narcissistic painter lacking in real talent, who cannot help himself, but remains a serial seducer even while telling all the girls he loves Penelope, when she isn't trying to kill him, that is. How did a man of Woody Allen's age write anything so wildly passionate as this? And direct it so successfully? Inside some older guys there is a teenager full of testosterone struggling to burst out: and he does! This film has so much energy and passion, you would think it had been made by someone in his twenties. And it helps that Hall and Johansson are at their very peak of attraction and allure just now, all of which is brought out by that magician, Woody Allen",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smokin'!,"You can't ignore him, this Woody Allen bloke. Gone is the succession of one liners. Long gone. Gone is Allen himself in his annual outing. Gone is an addiction to New York. So what do we have left?Well, we have a European tour which now reaches Catalonia, and quite pleasant it is too. Pleasant. I think I found Match Point ""pleasant"", but I may have been in the minority there. I think we may have to get used to this. The older ones, you know, ¬Ö Distant memories, but enough to grant Woody leeway. I think we now have very much a Ronnie Corbett arm-chair joke ¬ñ cosy, familiar, and professionally executed. But forgettable.So just in case that turns out to be the memory let's mention some interesting contribution from Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall; a new side to Javier Bardem; and an outstanding performance from Penelope Cruz who I suspect has set the anti-smoking lobby back thirty years and in fact may even have caused Operation Trident a headache or two.

What a ridiculous film... but somehow it drew me in...,"This plays like some kind of two-for-one parody of European art films and the Woody Allen back catalogue. Every scene sits on a spectrum between absurd and inappropriate. The script, the production, and the characterisation are all open to ridicule.Yet for some reason I couldn't stop watching. I wanted to see where it went. And it very nearly becomes an engaging treatise on love and relationships.Penelope Cruz is astonishing and brings an authenticity and energy that was sorely lacking before her arrival. Barcelona and Spain are shot beautifully. Rebecca Hall and Javier Barden manage to salvage their characters after a dubious start. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johansson.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Film,"A very uncharacteristic Woody Allen movie which does not take place in New York, and it not particularly comedic, but is very good. The cast is terrific. A young Scarlett Johannson stars as a follow up to the Steamy Allen thriller, Match Point. Javier Bardem is great as the central figure of this romantic adventure. Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz are great. This is a very interesting movie. The scenery and the landscapes are beautiful. The strength is the characters. Javier Bardem is always so very good in every role. The narration is the weakest aspect of the film. This is a fun, and unusual time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
its woddy allen what did you expect,It is not a master piece but it is not bad at all. Truly my only critiques are why is Scarlett so blonde and what the hell does the narrator add to the storyline I mean it's a movie isn't it supposed to be visually comprehensive?,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Zelig-ing Almod√≥var...and quite well,"Fans of Woody Allen have gotten used to him ""honoring"" other directors (Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock), but I'm not sure any other director could get away with what he does. Woody Allen's talent has always been as a writer, and in this outing, he writes. Perhaps over-writes. The voice over narration digests a lot of the circumstances here that I think the audience would have be capable of doing and become more involved had it been omitted. This is a gorgeous film, well-edited, fully developed in its analysis of a well-worn path (that would be ""love""), and I wished Allen would have trusted what he'd put together.It's a rip-off of several Almod√≥var films, ""Talk to Her"" being the most ""honored."" While both films share the same cinematographer, I think this movie rises a level above Almod√≥var's film visually. And what a beautiful setting this is.Surprisingly, the weakest element of the film is in the performances of the two leads of the title, Vicky (a lanky Rebecca West) and Christina (the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). You could accuse Allen of losing his ear in some of the exchanges between the two which sound reluctant and improvised. But others in the cast do very (very) well.Patricia Clarkson needs to be in every movie made. She brings such conviction to any role. Putting ""sexy"" back in his work after ""No Country for Old Men,"" Javier Bardem is not only watchable, but quite believable as the hedonist who threads the women in this film around his, uh, finger.And then God created Pen√©lope Cruz (let's all give thanks). Funny and tragic at the same time is quite a feat, but she pulls it off effortlessly here proving her work in Almod√≥var's ""Volver"" wasn't a fluke. Any time she's on the screen only Bardem matches her acting. We're left wondering (as Cruz' character wonders) what can Bardem possibly see in these two American tourists?I almost skipped this film, but it was quite enjoyable at every level. It's Woody Allen's most successful work in years. While ""Match Point"" was fun, it was plot heavy. And let's face it, no one talks the way people talk in a Woody Allen film. But here his graduate school dialectic is appropriate for the two leads, who are immersed in their degrees. By the end of the film a lot of the stuffing has been knocked out of those who believe matters of the heart can either be measured and weighed or bear no consequence to the participants, and it's welcome to see Allen turn the tables on those who over-intellectualize the Universe¬Öand love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody en Espanol,"Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlet Johansson) are the two main characters of Woody Allen's latest romantic comedy, but part of the ingenuity of the film is that the third name, Barcelona, is a character itself. Aside from the locales and hot-blooded, romantic atmosphere with Spanish guitars and wine in the night and gorgeous architecture during the day, which Allen and his DP capture wonderfully, the other characters Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) seem to spring out almost naturally out of this balmy city and country. It may be Allen's last international film for a while (according to reports his next film will be back to New York), but it's maybe the best at evoking this effect of a place on the characters (or, in spurts, its Jules and Jim inspiration).Vicki and Cristina, as we learn from the Barry Lyndon-esquire authoritative narrator, are on leave from New York City in Barcelona for the summer, Vicki for studying purposes and Cristina as her friend whose looking for something new creatively after a bad acting experience and an ex-boyfriend. Almost immediately after shacking up with friends Judy and Mark (Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn), Vicki and Cristina are approached one night by local painter Juan, who tempts them (or rather Cristina) with a week end in Obejo. Cristina falls for him immediately, but Vicki, already engaged to Doug (Messina) back in New York, is resistant to his charms - which, by the end of the week end, gives way to a passionate encounter.But after this, there's more complications, and not just with Vicki and Juan (or the surprise arrival of Doug to Barcelona for an also surprise wedding) and their suppressed affections. There's also Juan's ex-wife, Maria, who had a volcanic relationship and who comes back into Juan's life while Cristina is staying with him. To say much more would reveal and spoil a lot more of the fun and romance and questions Allen raises about monogamy and the complacency of marriage. Which, on the surface, might not sound like the 72 year old filmmaker is pursuing anything new to cover, as he's explored marriage, infidelity, and, as Maria Elena says at one point to Cristina, chronic dissatisfaction with lovers.And yet when it's at its best, and here's the surprising part, Vicki Cristina Barcelona is Allen's funniest, most intelligent and well-acted romantic comedy in many years, maybe even in this decade (which maybe isn't saying a lot since this and Match Point are the closest he's reached to greatness since the 90s). It works because of the actors dedication to the material: Cruz is a total tornado of a presence here, with this and Volver her best performances to date; Bardem, again, shows his layers in Juan as a man of romance and love and lust but also tenderness and humor and rage and all these things that show how great an actor he is; Hall is very good in a part that some actresses might sleepwalk through if not coached and coaxed right; Clarkson, for just one or two scenes where she reveals her own fractured marriage to Vicki, is great; and Johansson, who as a given is stunning in her appearance, reveals again in the context of a Woody Allen movie how underrated she can be as an actress- when used right and not just as ho-hum window dressing.It also works because Allen knows how to write dialog and relationships so brilliantly, maybe better than anyone working in film today in terms of simple but all-too-complex revelations on the trapped nature of the human condition, the struggle of what love is and what it is to be an artist, or simply how to function with someone that you love, but don't ""love"" in that same way one meets a sweeping-off-your-feet romance in Barcelona like so. The scenes he writes here are so good, and are so cool in being a kind of Woody-version of a Spanish soap opera (hysterical couple and three-way included, though not graphic), that he almost gets in the way of it with the narration. This last part is the only real significant flaw, as unlike in Husbands and Wives, where Allen used narration in a documentary style and to shorter bits of effect, here it takes some getting used to having a person talking as if reading excerpts from a trashy romance novel, and pops in giving those ""and then she never felt the same way again"" kind of notations to a character or scene that are just unnecessary.If you love classic Woody Allen romance comedy, and you also are interested in how he's starting to get a little riskier, a little more interested in the existential angles of his characters that he's touched on off-and-on for years and has only finally (Match Point and Cassandra's Dream) opened up in full bitter glory, this is the pick of the rest of the summer, maybe even of the year. Overall, you just don't get rom-coms this smart, or just plain funny and perfectly PG-13 outrageous, as Vicki Cristina Barcelona gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not that good.,"I am usually a big woody allen fan, and with all the praise given to this movie, I was eagerly anticipating to see Woody back in form. Sadly, I was disappointed. I found the film to be very pretentious, from the music, to the narration, to the insights on art, love, in a world inhabited by shallow people. These are people Woody would have been made fun of in the 70's, but instead he seems to take these people too seriously. I did, however, find Javier Bardem's character very likable and amusing, because he seems to be the only with a sense of humor about this kind of self-absorbed life these people are living in. The one thing great about this movie is the cinematography, beautiful, vibrant, warm, the scenery and the characters are beautiful to look at. Maybe I'll watch this film again with the mute button on.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Scarlett Hot and a Hell of a Plot,"Woody is witty and Woody can write. Woody Allen is a legend in his own right. Yet for a writer/director to re-invent himself and become even better after forty plus years of film-making is astonishing. Indeed, we all can appreciate the quintessential Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979) Woody Allen, yet I must say that with a directorial achievement like Match Point (2005) and this written and directing magnum opus that is Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Allen is reaching his prime at the one-can-only-imagine-but-still-wouldn't-put-it-past-him end of his career! From the premise of two American girls spending a few months in beautiful Barcelona, Spain, to the moment where a Spaniard sweeps them away with one of the best pickup line in film history, this film captures the audience and does not let go. The picture feels like an incredible fantastic voyage with all the nuances and subtleties of a decidedly credible characters, context, complications and conclusion. Allen is able to contrast, appeal, intrigue, attract, convey, question and move. The only way you may want to snooze is if you're a dreamer like some of the characters.Effortlessly, art, language and many iterations of love are explored in an enchanting, engaging and almost transporting way. If the movie had to have one fault it is but an irritating detail I've notice: Vicky is studying Catalan culture and we do not get to hear any Catalan language which is near impossible, the action taking place mostly in Catalan Barcelona. After the New Yorker spent years and films describing, delighting and even naming a movie after his city*, and giving justice to London in his last two Johansson features, Woody will unfortunately get this wrong about the eclectic Barcelona.Scarlett Johansson stole the show in Woody's Match Point (2005) and Scoop (2006), but here she is equally polarized by the challenging and crafty performances of Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz & newcomer Rebecca Hall. Scarlett is her nonchalant gorgeous self, but what creates the sensuous, easy yet forbidden, high sexuality is a sumptuous synergy of the writing, acting and directing. A mental, affecting, visual and visceral arousal is cultivated throughout the movie and takes so many forms that you feel you've been privy to an emotionally charged sexual extravaganza.Beyond the sexual tension, the plot makes for a very interesting, innovative and captivating human relationship roller-coaster as we can expect from an Allen screenplay. We are left with a sort of romantic comedy for grownups. There are no overly graphic sex scenes, yet the movie smells sex and feels sexy from title to credit. Much credit is due to Allen for his vision and his ability to harness acting and technical talent to bring to life this evocative, down-to-earth, film epiphany.""Life is the ultimate work of art."" And how about this for a tagline!?! Simply brilliant, simple but brilliant.. Besides interesting conversational dialog and narrating monologue, Allen's text include such originality as Juan's father not wanting to publish his beautiful poetry in attempts to get back at the world. When Vicky finally asks why, Juan becomes philosophical. Lots to think about, to feel and to digest¬Ö This motion picture is a daring and savory meal. A poetic paella perhaps* Spike Lee may be the only real contender for hardcore pro-NYC film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, romantic, terrifically acted if flawed film","For me this was not a one of Allen's great films, but was an entertaining, diverting one, with two terrific performances by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, a very good one by Rebecca Hall, and a decent one by Scarlett Johanssen.But Johanssen's character comes off as very shallow, so the complexity of her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more than adolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film, but here it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film from feeling deeper and more complex. None-the-less, a romantic bittersweet film I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointment,"I chose to watch this movie, expecting romance and comedy. Instead I found myself with a drama that basically has no point. Though Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem deliver impressive performances, the two leading ladies, particularly Rebecca Hall, fall flat. Not only is she unable to portray any emotion or moment realistically, the story lacks any true message or beauty beyond the surroundings. The narrator seems completely out of place and is painful to listen to when images could speak so much louder than his words. While there are brief flashes of light in which a thought is touched on, none are developed. Also, the characters themselves lack true development. None seem to grow from their experiences, simply filling stereotypes and lacking true human psychology.Overall this movie was a bitter disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didactic Doldrums,"Here's a story... of a lovely lady... who wanted safety and predictability in her forthcoming marriage...And here also... is another lady... and all she wants is bohemian rhapsodies...Okay, there are certainly worse and duller Woody Allen movies, but this is nowhere even his modest achievements, and part of the problem is that Allen gives us no more than didactic sketches of his two main characters, Vicky and Christina, courtesy of an extremely tedious voice-over.Javier Bardem comes off as a little more three-dimensional, but not by much.Oddly, the day after I watched VCB in the theatre, I saw Edward Burns' 1996 SHE'S THE ONE for the first time. No one would ever think STO a masterpiece of social melodrama, but without a lot of cumbersome backstory Burns' story gave viewers characters that were well-thought out as characters standing on their own and in interaction with other characters.I wish Woody Allen could do this well again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Well cast and scenery succeeds,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona possesses an energy, an intelligence and most of all, a passion that hasn't been seen from Allen in years. Gratefully, the filmmaker completely avoids making either of his actresses stand-ins or proxies for himself as he has done in the past, allowing Johansson and Hall to find the truth and humanity within their characters without forcing them to subscribe to some neurotic shtick, much less any of his other Allen-heroine clich√©s. Best of all, he crafts a completely believable portrait of each woman's uncertainty and in the process creates an interesting cross-section of romantic ideals between Vicky and Cristina's opposite perspectives.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen finds a place for his relationship drama/comedy overseas,"When you think classic Woody Allen and then you think of the last 15 years Woody Allen, two sharp and distinctly opposite thoughts come to mind. Classic Woody is all about the people, crazy neurotic people looking for love and self-fulfillment/discovery. Last 15 years Woody is all generally...weird. ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is finally Woody finding himself in a modern context - taking what made him famous and making it work with multiple audiences.""Barcelona"" takes place in the city of the same name as two women, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johannson), best friends with distinctly different views on life and love, are both smitten by a Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem). Both women's definitions of love are called into question by the odd but alluring man and even his definition is called into question when his ex-wife (Cruz) enters the picture.Allen tells this story in a highly narrative way, even using actual spoken narrative from an omniscient objective party. It's used to start to get us into the characters heads and sort of cleverly gives us expectations about what we are to see in addition to foreshadowing. It's a much more direct, yet still artsy way of telling a very Allen-like story involving love triangles and threesomes and such. While it may sound provocative, it makes actual sense as to why Allen chose for certain events to happen.This is also a very artistic film. Allen has simply moved his love of New York City to another city overseas. The culture and the landscape play a very pivotal role in creating a mood for this film, some motivation for the characters to do things they wouldn't have before the film begins. It definitely leaves you longing for a carefree, overseas adventure.Most importantly, this is some fine relationship drama. All the conversations are easy to follow and extremely easy to relate to. These aren't mind-altering ideas about love -- well, maybe with the exception of threesomes -- but they are provided a different, unique context that is the beautiful city of Barcelona. Welcome back, Woody, we missed you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good movie partially undone by terrible narration,"I almost stopped watching this movie at the 10 minutes mark. That first ten minutes was pretty much nothing but a narration of events by someone who sounded like he was doing a Power Point presentation on economics. I don't know why Allen felt the film needed a bland American narrator, but he did. The truth is, Allen himself would have been a far better choice; when he speaks, he sounds like he means something by it.The narration, of which there is a great deal, is also almost entirely unnecessary; you could cut it out all of the movie and you would still know pretty much was going on. The narrator says nothing about the characters that you can't glean from their actions, and I would think Allen has been around long enough to have heard of ""show don't tell.""However, since my girlfriend said she loved the movie I decided to keep going, and once the narrator took a pause and the characters started talking, they were pretty interesting (in fact, more interesting than the glib assessments given by the narrator). The story has the typically messy romantic tangles Allen is so fond of and it's interesting to see it play out. The actors are all very good, each making their characters likable. Sure, everyone in the movie is little more than a stereotype (tempestuous Spanish woman, free spirit, over-planned American), but the actors make these characters more interesting than they really are.While neither deep nor especially affecting, the movie is, when the narrator isn't speaking, quite charming, offering a romantic vision of Spain and a story that keeps moving even if not a lot ever happens. Cut out the narrator and it would probably deserve to be rated one star higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The difficulty of defining love,"This is only the third film by Woody that I catch(the others being Annie Hall, which I loved, and Manhattan, that I enjoyed), but I've heard that some of his more recent work is unimpressive when compared to the older; having not been exposed to the ones people speak ill of, I maintain that this is him doing well. Granted, it is perhaps not hilarious... I think it's really the kind of comedy that garners chuckles, and it certainly isn't trying too hard with any of the jokes(I didn't feel like I was constantly supposed to be laughing), and this is definitely clever. And no, this is not *the* most romantic movie he's given us. That doesn't mean it's bad. What this is, however, is a smart, open-minded and not judgmental piece about love that doesn't, as many would on account of the material, stoop to the lowest common denominator(with that said, the sensuality of the stars isn't exactly lost on the camera operators). The stars all shine. This is only the second time I watch something with Hall(The Prestige), and she really does perfectly in portraying a young woman who wants to be rational and pragmatic in all areas. Johansson is stunning as the adventurous Christina. Cruz is always a pleasure, especially in her mother tongue, and her role as the unstable artist is marvelous. Bardem I've seen in Mar adentra(and Collateral, though I do not recall him in that), a picture I cannot praise enough, and he is spot-on as the charming and direct painter Juan Antonio. The fact that not a single one of them is flat or one-note is a real credit to the script(that's a nice amount of development in 90 minutes), as is the realistic relationships between the credible characters. There is a lot of sexuality(if no nudity, and much is implied or mainly dealt with through dialog), a little violence/intensity and infrequent strong language(several of the words are in Spanish and subtitled) in this. It is not for children. The DVD comes with three trailers. I recommend this to fans of the genres, Allen and/or those attracted to the concept of it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Curiously detached,"Movies are famous for being a visual art form and directors will go to great lengths to ensure that a shot will convey a message, reveal an emotion, or support the plot. In contrast, Woody Allen uses a disembodied narrator to explain important plot elements, character's backgrounds, and future events. It makes the whole move seem like a rough draft and removes the viewer from the emotional impact.The dialogue and actors are superb. Javiar Bardem as the seductive man of few and direct words who drives women crazy. Scarlet Johanssen as the free spirit who knows exactly what she doesn't want. Rebecca Hall as the woman who overthinks everything.

Funny in that Johansson used the term ""lost in translation"" and ironic in that Cruz always comes across better in Spanish and something gets lost in translation when she acts in English.In summary without giving away the plot, Allen remade his point that despite society's and our efforts to have a life structure give us meaning and purpose, life is what it is, appreciate whatever beauty and joy you may come across. All I know is that after seeing it, I had a silly smile on my face for a few hours (before I had to go back out on the ledge).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona: Woody Allen has got his mojo back","Before watching this movie, I was expecting an odd sex comedy. But actually, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is lot more interesting than that. Woody Allen has directed and written not only a love story, but he has captured the soul of Spain in a way I seen few American directors been able to do. Of course, not all the performances are great. I was never a big fan of Scarlett Johannsen and her performance as Cristina did little to change that fact. Rebecca Hall gave a better performance as Vicky who seems (in the beginning) to be attached to this idea of a stable and normal life, but who then is attracted to the wild passionate life that Catalonia has to offer her. But really the performances that make this film work, which really represent the heart of this movie, come from Javiar Bardem as Juan Antonio Gonzalo and Penelope Cruz as his ex-wife Maria Elena. They give the most passionate, fiery performances of this film. Then add these great performances the wonderful Spanish architecture, the atmosphere which is electric, the classical guitar music, and the often hilarious dialogue, and what you end up with is a film that comes close to being a gem. The ending is also suitable, if not quite unexpected.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
(- Scarlett = Success),"Far from Woody Allen's best, with that said I am far from sold on Scarlett Johansson. In my opinion she has been very lucky to work with good directors and be surrounded by great actors. In this film she is completely out shined by both Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, more so then any of her previous films. All I could think during this film is how a movie about Bardem and Cruz's characters would be way more interesting and at the same time spare me from Scarlet Johansson and her winy voice and sub par acting skill. Woody Allen is known for his quick, witty and intelligent dialog and most the time throughout this film it's present and promising, except of course when Johansson makes her attempt at it. The dialog does not sound at all convincing coming out of her mouth, it is as if she has no clue what she is saying and how her character should be delivering her lines. Not to mention the fact that her character doesn't even seem smart enough to talk the way she does. In another Allen film, Matchpoint, her part was to play the sexy, alluring and tempting girl, so natural that comes easy to her, but here she stands out like a sore thumb. Anyway back to the film itself, about three times this film feels completely Woody Allen, the characters are smart, witty and very interesting. Then later they turn winy, self obsessed and just plain boring in there search to find the meaning of love. Blah.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This love could be acceptable when you feel a passionate Spanish blow,"I watched a Woody Allen's film ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" following ""Match Point"". Although I've watched only two of his films, he is good at depicting a trivial matter in ordinary days cynically and dramatically, I think. In this film, he portrayed a matter with a sprinkle of pop and fascinatingly that are likely to be happened, that two girlfriends on a summer holiday in Spain where they both love a Spanish guy.Sexual adventurous Christina (Scarlett Johansson) and her friend Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is engaging with a safe man. Two girls took a holiday in Barcelona and met a guy Antonio (Javier Bardem) who believes ""Only unfulfilled love is romantic"". Of all things, the two girls, at the almost same time, are fascinated by the man. Vicky seems to be a million miles away while her boyfriend Doug (Chris Messina) who she left in NY was calling her. She knew that it shouldn't be occurred to her, however, she can't help to love with him. In the meantime, Antonio's ex- wife who is emotional disorder and passionate woman Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz) emerge. Emotional movement of Cristina x Elena x Antonio, Antonio x Vicky will attract the audience into the film.Interestingly, a thought of Spain=passionate country could be thought that affair is not taboos, rather better thought of following one's honest feeling. If you are a woman you might think which girl is similar of you in love. This square relationship amongst the three girls surrounding Antonio could be not a nasty, rather beautiful, which might be the reason that the film was shot in Spain as well.Scarlett Johansson cannot be somewhat an adult woman, though, she played a fascinating role in this film because of her satisfactory position for Woody. While Pen√©lope playing a passionate and hated woman may be fascinating, strong and sexy that might be personal fancy for actors. Pen√©lope is in her element in her role even though she is struggling to play roles in Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What happens in Europe stays in Europe...,"One thing I've noticed about nearly all of Woody Allen's movies is that, regardless of how good the rest of the movie is, the dialogue is generally written and performed with a nearly flawless realism that pushes the surprisingly intricate stories along at a pretty fast pace, often leaving me with the feeling that the story is bigger than the movie and has to be squeezed to make it fit. In order to do this, Allen has recruited the talents of Christopher Evan Welch to provide a narrative voice-over and tell the portions of the story that can't be passed on simply through images and dialogue.Unfortunately, I developed an inability to see Woody Allen as anyone other than Woody Allen no matter what movie he's appearing in. This is a condition that has endured unchecked within me for the last ten years, since the release of Antz, which starred an animated, insect version of Woody, but who was nevertheless still Woody. He did write the movie, but the narrator speaks in such a distinct Woody Allen style that it becomes a little confusing why he didn't just narrate the thing himself. Or not have a narrator, that might have been a good idea, too. The narration thickens the story and gives it more detail, but it also makes it feel rushed. Here's a little example ¬ñ""Vicky was already thinking of herself as a kind of expatriate, not smothered by what she believed to be America's puritanical and materialistic culture, which she had little patience for. She saw herself more as a European soul, in tune with the thinkers and artists she felt expressed her tragic, romantic, free-thinking view of life.""The movie is about characters that Allen can clearly relate to, but that most people in the audience will fail to relate to. We envy their lives, but for the most part we have nothing in common with any of them and thus it becomes difficult to care about them. Luckily, the primary characters, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), and Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) are played by three tremendous actors, and their performances are glowing.Vicky and Cristina are best friends who decide to spend a couple of summer months in Barcelona with Vicky's family, who live in the area. Vicky is studying Catalan studies, so it seems like the perfect destination. She's into romantic stability and is happily engaged to a man named Doug, who is completely dedicated to her but is, unfortunately, also a massive tool. Cristina, on the other hand, is more impulsive and unpredictable, not afraid to take risks and invite a little turmoil into her life. She recently worked for months on a 12-minute film about love that she then hated, and is now getting shakily into photography. She wanders around Spanish towns taking clich√©d photographs of empty alleyways and people, either just sightseeing or for some reason thinking she's doing something original.While the two of them are eating in a charming caf√©, a good-looking Spanish man approaches them and invites them on a trip, leaving in an hour, to a small town called Oviedo, where the three of them will eat good food, drink good wine, and make love. The different reaction of the two girls sets up the premise that supports the rest of the movie. Vicky is horrified and offended, Cristina is immediately intrigued and ultimately accepts, with ""no guarantees.""What follows is a remarkably well-told but dense story about highly developed characters who lead fascinating but chaotic lives but who live in such a way that it's nearly impossible to relate to them in any way. It reminds me of the characters in William Faulkner's intolerable novel ""The Sun Also Rises,"" who also live in Spain and have nothing but money and leisure time. Such a lifestyle is difficult for me to understand or care about.Juan Antonio is an abstract artist of some acclaim, and has famously been through a violent divorce which was well-covered by the news media. Evidently he and his wife tried to kill each other, but of course their stories differ wildly. A complex series of events leads to Cristina living together with Juan Antonio in his home in Spain and Vicky back in New York and suffering through a series of new emotional hurdles, until one day Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's ex-wife, tries to commit suicide and ends up living with Juan Antonio and Cristina because she has nowhere else to go. Where the movie goes from there is where it really gets interesting and strange, but I won't give anything else away.By the way, I don't know if you realize this, but European vacations have an astonishing ability to wreck American relationships if only one half of the couple is making the trip. This happened to me with a girl that I dated in college who once traveled in Europe for a summer, and I didn't even find out about it until more than a year later, and by that time I had already gone to Europe myself and committed the same crime! What is it with that place??Oh and just so you know, one of my best friend's here in China was born and raised in San Sebastian, in the Basque country in northern Spain, and he was deeply unimpressed with the movie. He says it felt like nothing more than a ""Lonely Planet Guide to Barcelona!"" Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the story-telling and the performances, particularly the lack of predictability and the many narrative twists and turns. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
cool story i guess,"Ok so I don't know if i hate it or love it. The narrator was annoying at first so I was kinda icked out and how they presented theses two female characters almost as the two ways men think of women. However as the movie carried on I did appreciate how Cristina wasn't made to be the type of woman you don't want in this society but more of the person who she is, just a woman who knows what she doesn't want, and living her life as she pleases. Now on the other hand Vicky was a really great at her switch you almost forget her previous attitude which she had at the start. And then she's just lost and realizes what she's been missing, but at the end actually making change is hard especially for americans so realistic ending.

Feels like Pedro Almodovar,"If you've ever seen a Pedro Almodovar film certain elements of this film will seem familiar. The film takes place in Spain, partly in Barcelona and there are beautiful sets and scenery.The relationships in the film are complex. Two American girls spend July & August in Spain and meet up with an artist. Both of the girls find the artist attractive but only one is free enough to act on her attraction right away while the other is much more guarded.The film is well done and well shot. It is sunny, vibrant and colorful. There is one thing that bothers me about this film though and I think I wanted more clarity. The end is a bit murky and I think it would have been better if the male character had shown some strength & had been more honest with the women. Just because you are blunt doesn't mean you are being honest.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another great Allen movie.,"The latest offering from the now veteran Woody Allen is set in the Spanish capitol of Barcelona and sees the director giving the city the treatment he has previously lavished on Manhattan and London. The story centres around Juan (Bardem) who is a carefree painter with an unhealthy fixation on his ex-wife; the feeling is mutual to the point where they just can't shake each other, but enter two friends on holiday to really throw a spanner in the works. Vicky (Hall) is happily about to be married and has her whole life planned, Cristina (Johansson) on the other hand is floundering she doesn't know what she wants but she does know what she defiantly doesn't want, the two decide to spend a few summer months together in Barcelona which is where they meet Juan and eventually his ex-wife Maria Elena (Cruz). What follows is a typical Allen story packed with twists and turns and great one liners, never big on set pieces the beauty of Allen's work lies in his excellent script work, his characters talk like they are real not like actors delivering lines and the situations he places them in requires just that. The cast is strong and with Gaudi as a major backdrop the lives of the characters unfold over the few months and create an enjoyable film packed with humour, heartbreak and plenty of Spanish sunshine. Allen is once again making films that are very unique to him and ultimately very watchable for his audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Scattered Romance In Catalonia,"'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' follows the same track of the usual Woody Allen movie about unusual relationships with a touch of comedy. Previously he has tried something different with 'Matchpoint' and 'Scoop' but this movie can be labelled a 'typical Woody Allen comedy', if you like. Here too he explores relationships. The narrative structure is pretty similar but I wonder why Woody chose not to do the voice-over himself. The dialogues have the irony, humour and philosophy of Allen's usual style. The cinematography is vibrant and the score is both whimsical and romantic.Allen takes full advantage of Barcelona's beauty and gives us glimpses of the typical tourist locations such as the Sagrada Familia (since the title characters are visitors, why not?) but also the stunning natural landscape shots. I like that he portrays it as an artist's city for that is what makes it a unique place in the world. Gaudi's works also play a small but significant role. It is his works that draw Vicky to Barcelona in the first place until this is replaced by someone, Juan Antonio.Rebecca Hall is quite a pleasant surprise. I had first seen her in 'Frost/Nixon' where she has a strong presence, but here she is brilliant. Scarlett Johansson is quite alright. She's overshadowed by her co-stars. Javier Bardem is unexpectedly cast as a charming, smooth-talking seducer/artist and the actor is simply great. Patricia Clarkson is effective in a small role.But the real star is Penelope Cruz. Cast against type, she is terrific as the neurotic, manipulative.. (well I shouldn't list more spoilers).. Maria Elena. It's one of her best works to date and completely different from what she has done for Almodovar (contrary to what many have said).The characters are very familiar when you think of Allen's previous film and I doubt it would be wrong to guess that they are a part of him. Thus, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is an unconventional romantic comedy (though typical Woody Allen) but that is not to say that it's a summer flick. The movie does have layers and depth that reveal the dark side of relationships, attachments, desire and commitment.",,Anonymous,Romance
Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"""Vicky"" (Rebecca Hall) is the more sensible and realistic of the friends. ""Cristina"" (Scarlett Johansson) tends to fly more by the seat of he pants - and both have come to the lively and vibrant city of Barcelona for an holiday. Almost immediately then encounter the typically mischievous painter ""Juan Antonio"" (Javier Bardem) who invites them for a weekend at his. Initially this story rather goes as we might expect, but the emergence of his ex-wife ""Maria Elena"" (Pen√™lope Cruz) and ""Doug"" (Chris Messina) who's the rather nice but dim boyfriend of ""Vicky"" now provides us with all the ingredients for a sexually tense maelstrom set amidst the temperamentally unsound worlds of art, wine and sunshine. I think this is Woody Allen's writing at it's best here. It's funny and poignant whilst at the same time light-hearted enough to allow the actors to develop the characters in a natural and engaging fashion. Bardem is great as the painter but it's Cruz who really shines here. Her portrayal of the highly-strung ""Maria Elena"" is at times embarrassing, then hilarious then - when she has a gun, well that's just downright dangerous (even if she couldn't hit a barn door with a shovel). It's a great looking film using the beautiful city and it's Gaudi architecture as a fitting backdrop for a drama that Christopher Evan Welch narrates (sparingly) in an almost sarcastic fashion. It packs plenty into ninety-odd minutes and is a strong example of an ensemble cast working well together.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

What did improve with Woody Allen?,"I have always liked Allen's movies. They are an instant magnet for me. So, whenever a new movie of him emerges, I make an effort to watch it. Not that I rush to the cinema theater, but I mark it as a memory note to watch it whenever it will be on TV. But a beautiful technological revolution in the way movies are shot, transformed the experience of watching Allen in something even better. Lack of action in the movie no longer reduces the quality of the colors and its brightness, so you don't need to attend such movies, in order to enjoy fantastic shots and breath taking views. That's exactly what has happened in this movie. No more exquisite dialogs surrounded by dull sceneries limited by inferior shooting technology, but exceptional images with the same high quality scenario. So everyone wins, and Spain is interwoven in Allen's film just as beautifully as it would have been in a touristic promotion. And by the way, the plot is wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Henry James in Barcelona,"Woody Allen has contrived a contemporary version of a Henry James or Edith Wharton story of Americans in Europe. Like those two great American writers it hinges on polarities. The Americans are opposite of the Europeans, in this case Spanish, it leads to humor, misunderstanding and occasionally something illuminating in the way each society behaves. It also tends to rely on clich√©, a word Allen employs often as criticism, but it is present here, although it is a sophisticated clich√©.Just like James and Wharton the exposition of American morals, in all spheres, and with it, a wry critique of American philistinism is engaging. Vicky is all puritan accomplishments and rational objectives; Cristina is adventurous, and as the pompous husband of Vicky says, she is contemptuous of the American bourgeois life-plan.The criticism of philistinism is apparent in the lifeless and materialistic way the American characters talk: the house they have Vicky and Doug have planned for instance, but mostly it is in the foreignness and otherness of art in Barcelona, they must acquire, possess, learn about it, it in a way that is absurd to the Spanish who live with it. The father poet of Juan Antonio who will not publish anything as an example of an artistic life lived without the materialist aim of money and book sales. It's an American stereotype of a European, which is just another but fancier clich√©. And the tempestuous relationship between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena is an extended Latin stereotype that might have been taken from an olive oil commercial.The most curious feature to the film is the voice over, written with care in real prose. Again, it might have been take from James. While it adds layers to characters and insights into the drama beyond the camera, it distances the actions on-screen and betrays their motives. At the end it almost cheats the audience of what they have sat through.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's Romantic Satire Holds Together Well,"This little film is more than a typical Woody Allen comedy that thrives and grows as a running joke. Its constant undercurrent of satire is pulled off nicely, thanks to a centrifugal performance by its lead man, Javier Bardem, a Spanish artist who becomes involved in a casual love triangle with two American tourists -- played coyly by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson.Bardem's steady and understated acting shows off his versatility when contrasted with roles such as the psychopathic killer in ""No Country for Old Men."" Meanwhile, Hall, as 'the girl next door' and Johansson, as the drifty hippy type, are glued together in their contrasting roles. Johansson proves romantic comedy best suits her talents (and not superhero movies).Penelope Cruz won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and deservedly so, for her part as a fiery former/current lover of Bardem's. Other supporting roles of note are Chris Messina as Hall's shallow fiance/husband, and Josep Maria Domenech as Bardem's old, wise father.The movie was narrated by Christopher Evan Welch, who died at the age of 48 only five years after the film's release.It's a good Date Movie that cuts across the dramatic scenes with refreshing breezes of Allen's brilliant satire.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"moderately good, not a triumph","This is a pleasant piece of Allen whimsy, not the dazzling triumph that some reviewers are talking about. It has little of the true emotional heft that Matchpoint or Crimes & Misdemeanors had due partly to the fact that it has a narrator distancing us from the characters whenever it threatens to get too close.Performances are good all around, but the characters, with the exception of Allen's ""Spanish"" actors, are uninteresting, completely self-absorbed and seem to end up unchanged at their core.To add insult I viewed it at our local multiplex. They are no longer able to adequately handle movies sent to them on 35mm (they only know digital) so consequently there were issues in starting the movie, and the masking was appalling.

"Narration and blah, blah, blah","If this is a comedy, so is ""No Country For Old Men' Nothing here is funny. Fair enough, but unfortunately not much is interesting either.

The principles talk Woody Allen pseudo-deep talk and then talk some more; in fact, they talk so much that a narrator has to actually tell us what is going on. They have sex here and there, which is filmed so that it is almost as boring as the talking.The characters only make sense if this were set in the 1960s, and even then, they would be particularly naive for that time. They change at the whim of a script that seems written for a ""let's get five more minutes in here"" purpose. What should be complicated transitions are handled by a word or two from a narrator, who even has a word or two about characters' thoughts.Barcelona is beautiful. Go there for a visit.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona Review,"Woody Allen made an original drama three years ago in ""Match Point"" and he has made yet another one here. Though it contains the typical Woody views on artistic angst and existential qualms, this movie has a fresh and entirely original feel to it. Partially because of the beautiful Barcelona settings and the attractive faces on screen, it is a visual treat to behold. Not only that, but Allen gives a fine portrait of two good friends who find more than expected on vacation. It certainly is little more than fluff, but it is fine, well-made, well-acted fluff at that. It is certainly the sexiest movie Woody has made yet, even succeeding over ""Match Point"" three years back.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A playful and sensual trip to Woody Allen's Spain,"Woody Allen made himself a prolific, global film director with his humor from the New York scene, his satire on the Jewish life and all its highly enjoyable neurotic characters who concerned over and over about the themes of love and romance. In his latter career he has turned his nose away from New York and to Europe, making three films back-to-back in Britain, he makes another environmental change with his latest feature and travels to Spain, and its Barcelona. Once there, we're given a peachy story full of gorgeous Southern European life. Javier Bardem plays Juan Antonio, a ravishing, passionate painter that seduces the double-entry of Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who's there to give further studies to the Catalanian language, and Christina (Scarlett Johansson), who's exploring her artistic abilities. They soon learn about his ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), a woman who stabbed him with a knife before leaving him, and who sooner or later will return like fireworks.'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is a lush experience, with a soft-focus lens Woody creates a sensual and humid touch to the characters who mostly flirt, discuss, makes love and fight - the main ingredients of romance. Woody lends us a voice-over narration that explains the many narrative plot-holes, and so he paces through the hot summer days of Spanish landscape with the characters going along, making for important but also less important, but not necessarily less enjoyable, dialogs and interactions. And when Cruz's Maria Elena shows up, the film sparks a new flare. She's a firework of everything we thought we knew and didn't know about the great actress - just listen Bardem and Cruz exchange love and hate in the language of Woody Allen, in both English and Spanish, it's fabulous! 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is what Woody Allen loves the most; observing romance, and what we humans make of it, and don't make of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Highly overrated, erotic fantasies of aging Woody Allen don't make for a good movie...","What a bore. I am just back from the cinema and highly disappointed with this movie. I am a fan of Woody Allen's early work (like ""Manhattan"" etc) and was delighted to read that with this movie, he was said to be back to his ""old style"". What? OK. Let's be fair. It was esthetically filmed and not a complete nuisance to watch, with good actors. But that's all. That's why I give 3 out of 10. Basically, the story is very dull. It's a mediocre piece of work (ok, Allen is no genius, but at least he used to be pretty entertaining). It made me think ""is this showing the aging Woody Allen's erotic fantasies?"". What is the message? There is no plot that is worth the mention. And character development? No. The passion(s) that develop are not even that: developed! They are not credible. I felt that the audience is made believe that the shown emotions exist this way - but it's that: make-believe.

Woody Allen's heart.,"I'm not going to add much more to what's already been written. Yes, it is a somewhat tedious film in terms of style, but, like another reviewer commented, it is fairly solid in terms of Allen's later work.What we have here is some pretty pointed commentary on an age old dilemma, and its manifestation in modern times. We are witness to the temptation of the mad-handsome-artistic-genius to two young woman who are ostensibly social opposites. Both escape, but not before succumbing to this man's charms and false promises.Ultimately does it really matter what a person's past is? It should, but is not always pertinent. As many an investment broker and banker has stated ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results."" Again, ultimately it is the human need, the human heart, that wins out in the end. And isn't that what really matters? The tawdriness was a weakness, and perhaps would've been best avoided. We see the weakness of the characters as they ignore all the warning signs, and go through the motions of ill fated decisions. Fortunately it all works out in the end.Production values; standard Wood Allen fare, I think I miss him narrating the film, and would've appreciated him as a minor character... maybe an art instructor who witnesses the whole thing first hand.Regardless, I found the film entertaining, though hard to digest in one sitting. Yes, I too subscribe to his ""earlier funnier ones"" theory, but appreciate the art he's created in his later years.",,Anonymous,Romance

Scarlett Johanson played a very mysterious and perplex girl in the movie which was quite good to watch. Rebbecca hall played a confident character yet in so many ways she found herself in the ocean of perplexity which makes this movie sensible and real to watch. but for me the star and the surprising part of the movie was Penelope Cruz... the moment she made the entry in the movie..entire movie started making more sense...got more entertaining...she did the perfect job. one of the best thing about the movie was how aesthetically woody Allen portrayed the beautiful and sensual chemistry between Antony, Cristina and maria Elena, it could have got either way more in a sense of erotica but was handled pretty much well by woody...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Technical flaws defeat promising concept,"I am a Woody Allen fan (who isn't?) and therefore I always look forward to his films. I admire the fact that he is a relentless pusher of boundaries and that he tries to do different films.Unfortunately however when he is not present as an actor (he has a great screen presence) his films can lack a certain something and this is unfortunately the case here.The missing Woody isn't the main problem however. There are in fact two major technical problems however which fatally flaw the film.Firstly, there is an entirely unnecessary voice-over which grates on the ears and adds little to the plot. Voiceovers can of course work well, in context. Michael Caine did a great verbalisation of his thoughts in Hannah and Her Sisters for example which was crucial to the plot.In this case the voice-over had no connection to the film, wasn't done by a character in it and instead appeared from nowhere as a sort of invisible omniscient presence which was simply unrealistic and distracting. All it did was suggest that the director felt his tale wasn't being properly told by the cast or the footage shot. The plot wasn't difficult to follow so a narration really wasn't required.Secondly, much of the dialogue in this film is in Spanish or Catalan. None of this is subtitled, leaving large gaps in scenes. It almost seems like the Spanish lines are completely unnecessary and are just in there for 'colour'. Yet why should we sympathise with characters if the director can't be bothered providing their words and thoughts to the audience? With these issues resolved perhaps the film might have worked. Cruz and Bardem were quite charismatic and charming and the plot wasn't bad.Unfortunately Johansson was as pretty as ever but seemed rather vacant and Hall (who can be very engaging as Starter for 10 proved) seemed to struggle with a rather pointless part.In short then a disappointment. Allen needs to find a more charismatic muse than Johansson (Match Point was rotten as well) and the complete lack of genuine humour and indeed humanity in the script means this is way below his high standards of the past.On the brighter side however the use of Barcelona as a backdrop worked well and its beauty shone through the film.As I say I am a fan of Allen in general and much of his recent output I have liked a lot, Melinda and Melinda was excellent for example as was Curse of the Jade Scorpion but this film needed a stronger script and there needed to be a point to the story.My partner and I watched the Odd Couple just before this film. While comparisons between old and new films are inevitably unfair it does make one wonder if the new crop of bland good looking so called 'stars' deserve the label compared to the greater brighter talents of the past.No one can be a genius every day however and Allen's cinematic legacy is already assured. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Woody Allen as few honors the beautiful Barcelona on a mature plot, and seeks to address love, passion, jealousy, right and uncertain, finally, the pursuit of happiness","In the 2000s, Woody Allen entered into a contract with DreamWorks that corresponded with what the critics thought was their worst stage, launching films like Small Time Crooks (2000), Hollywood Ending (2002), Anything Else (2003). With Melinda and Melinda (2004), the director flirted again with the drama, leaving the comedies that were far from genius director of yore, as in the classic Annie Hall (1977). Allen even returned to the spotlight of awards and recognition with great Match Point (2005), where he first worked with Scarlett Johansson. Allen then returned to comedy in his next project, Scoop (2006), also with Scarlett. After launching the unwelcome Cassandra's Dream (2007) with Colin Farrell, Ewan McGregor and Hayley Atwell, the director decided to leave London where he made his last three films and visit Barcelona, another beautiful European city in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which ends becoming one of his best works in recent decades.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are friends and spend holiday in Barcelona. Vicky is sensible and is engaged in matters of love. Cristina is pure emotion and fueled by passion. During an art exhibition, the two are enchanted by the painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who invites them later during a dinner for a trip. What they did not know is that the gallant seducer maintains a troubled relationship with his ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). And things are even worse because the two, each of their shape, are interested in it, initiating a complicated ""square"" loving.Woody Allen uses this film again the figure of the narrator, recurring fact in his filmography. Through a narrator, writer and director presents the opinions of the protagonists about love. Vicky and Cristina are two Americans who will spend the summer in Barcelona when a distant relative of Vicky's family who lived in the city offered to receive them in July and August. Vicky was completing her master's in Catalan Culture, the theme for which was interested because of his great affection for the architecture of Gaudi. Vicky could not bear the suffering, nor attracted the conflict. She was firm and realistic, and looked in a man seriously and stability and was engaged to Doug (Chris Messina) precisely because he is decent and successful, and because he understood the beauty of commitment. Already Cristina, who spent the last six months writing, directing and acting in a short 12 minutes, you just hating, had broken up with another boyfriend, and was eager to change the air. She accepted pain as an inevitable element of passion, and was resigned to putting her feelings at risk. When the two know the Spanish painter Juan Antonio makes them a proposal, is that the film really begins. The charming artist invites them to go to the city of Oviedo and they slept together later. As one might imagine, Vicky felt offended and amazed at the arrogance of the artist, while Cristina accepted and eventually convinced her friend to accompany them on this trip.The great success of Woody Allen is to create situations of engagement between the main characters giving the necessary basis for the development of the story. During the trip to Oviedo, Juan Antonio first got involved with Cristina, but due to an infection that left her stomach in bed resting, he ends up having to spend the rest of the weekend with Vicky, who gets involved with the painter. Between a visit to his father Juan Antonio, a presentation of Spanish music and intimate city tours, they end up having sex. When Cristina recovers, they return to Barcelona and it's time for passionate friend to be invited to drink wine and know his house, and also realizing interrupted a shag in Oviedo. While Cristina is increasingly involved with it because they look pretty in the way of enjoying life, what does that even go live with him at his home for the rest of the summer, Vicky cannot stop thinking about the weekend he had with the Spanish artist, and everything becomes more complicated when her American boyfriend decides to go to Barcelona to marry her. On the other hand, the unstable former wife of Juan Antonio, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) tries to commit suicide, what makes Juan Antonio to take her home to live with him and Cristina as she has nowhere to stay.When Maria Elena comes into play is that the story actually grows. Disagreeing with the end of her marriage to Juan Antonio, she wants anyway back to live with him. And, therefore, establishes a relationship up to three: she, Juan Antonio and Cristina live together, which shocks Vicky. Who also arises about the same time is Vicky's fianc√©, Doug. With the presence of the character is more evident in Vicky insecurity that takes care of his person, along with the feeling of guilt for having her boyfriend beside her feeling desire for Juan Antonio. The dynamics of all these relationships is the big secret for the film to be friendly and really work. Even though transition from one subplot to another does not keep pace with the previous scene, the acting of the cast handles all the scenes.Between love situations involving the quartet's main plot, Allen builds a sensual and engaging plot without showing explicit sex scene. The most sensual and provocative that we see is a lesbian kiss between Scarlett and Penelope Cruz. Another hit is that Barcelona is placed as a movie character, not as a mere backdrop. The works of Gaudi and Miro stamped in secular architecture as well as the narrow streets enchant the viewer. All rentals are beautifully photographed by Javier Aguirresarobe, using brighter colors enhancing the look picturesque and peaceful city in favor of the long novels. As the film was funded by the city of Barcelona, it was natural made an advertisement tourist town, but Woody Allen able to show that beauty without spoiling the story at any time.The script has many moments that conflict reason versus emotion, impulsive versus methodical, well expressed in the attitudes of Vicky and Cristina. The cast includes Rebecca Hall is the one that stands out alongside Javier Barden. The British Rebecca acts not in so expansive way and passes through their eyes and body language all the more realistic, planned and methodical Vicky, who is troubled when passion arises in your life unexpectedly, leaving - the split between security a marriage warm and a consuming passion and no future. Javier Barden is perfect as the seductive painter Juan Antonio.The best known Spanish actor in activity, Barden lends all its charm and naturalness abroad that will cause a change in the lives of foreign friends. Who does well is Penelope Cruz. Unmistakably it operates with a much greater force when speaking in Spanish, much more natural and convincing than when he speaks English with an accent unbearable. She spends all the emotional instability of Maria Elena competently, but it does not appear on the scene both as expected. It's a beautiful performance, but to win the Oscar and the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress for this interpretation was a bit much. Amy Adams and Viola Davis for the film Doubt and Taraji P. Henson in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button who competed with her were undoubtedly much more deserving of the award. Of the main cast members, is precisely the muse of recent Allen films that most disappoints. The volatility of the stock Cristina are obvious, but Scarlett Johansson is the least that stood out among all. However, she exudes sensuality from the way you dress to the way of speaking.Along with the beautiful images of Barcelona and the romantic mood and sensual, reverently art direction fellow Spaniard I√±igo Navarro - the same as The Machinist (2004) - in building internal scenarios full of detail, as the home of typically Spanish Juan Antonio, or the choice of natural outdoor scenes used abundantly. Woody Allen as few honors the beautiful Barcelona on a mature plot, efficient, with a certain amount of humor in his dialogues intelligent, and seeks to address love, passion, jealousy, right and uncertain, finally, the pursuit of happiness as the goal of the people however apparently appear to huge differences. In the end, we are all human and we feel everything intensely.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't know what I think about this film,"Did I like ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" or not? One might think that it would make sense to hold off writing the review of the film until I make up my mind, but I'm not, since this conflicted feeling is at the heart of the film.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johannsen) are two best friends who are vacationing in Barcelona for the summer. While there, they are asked abruptly by an artist named Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) to spend the weekend with him. They eventually go, and the weekend sets in motion a series of events that cause Vicky and Cristina to really examine what they want in a relationship (Vicky is engaged, and Cristina ""only knows what she doesn't want."" ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" starts out strong and ends even stronger, but it lags in the middle. I think it would have been a lot better if about 20 minutes had been cut during this period. The characters talk, but nothing really happens during this time.The acting is strong. Rebecca Hall is very good as the practical Vicky. She knows what she wants and is satisfied with her future, at least until she meets Juan Antonio. Scarlett Johansson is slightly less impressive as Cristina, who is experimenting with the possibilities. Javier Bardem continues to impress as the artist/lover Juan Antonio. He's a seducer, and not ashamed of it. Yet he has a big heart. However, the best performance belongs to Penelope Cruz. She dominates the screen as Juan Antonio's volatile ex-wife, Maria Elena. She has some serious issues, and Cruz never lets us forget that Maria Elena can be set off by just about anything.The best thing about ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is that it looks great. The cinematography is gorgeous, and very atmospheric. However, the film has some big flaws. First off, the narration is on going, and it gets old. It helps, but it gets in the way of the story. Second, of course, is the flat middle. Nothing much happens, and boredom sets in. Fortunately, when Cruz appears, the film gets back going again. Finally, the ending doesn't fit. An ending like the one Woody Allen gave this one seems to belong in a different film.It's not ""Match Point,"" but I guess it's recommendable.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
When something starts has to end...,"""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a movie in which we watch two girlfriends on a summer holiday in Spain who are getting involved with the same painter. This painter has also a strange relationship with his ex-wife who also enters in his life for one more time.I liked this movie because it was something different than the usual movies with the same subject. I also liked the interpretation of Rebecca Hall (Vicky) who I believe was the best in this movie and had the most difficult part because we watch her emotions change and this was the most difficult part that had to do in this movie. The only interpretation that I can compare it is the interpretation of Pen√©lope Cruz who was really great on his part. About the interpretation of Javier Bardem who played as Juan Antonio I have to say that I did not expect anything less than this, he was great for one more time. Scarlett Johansson who played as (Cristina) was equally good but not as good as Rebecca Hall.Finally I have to say that ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a nice Romance movie which is nice to watch but do not expect much messages to think of after this.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretentious.  Boring.  Awful.,"Have you ever wondered how much narration you could possibly stuff into a movie? Have you ever wondered how many times the word ""art"" can be uttered in a film? Have you ever wanted to see the sexual musings of a dirty old man, who then proceeds to thumb his nose at monogamous relationships? THEN THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU! For me, though, this movie was awful. The ""art"" talk and name-dropping was pretentious and non-stop. The approach to open relationships completely ignores the very thing that causes most of them to fail - jealousy. All of the characters are self-absorbed and reprehensible, except for the ""straight"" men Woody is trying to demonize.This follows in the suit of the newer Woody Allen movies, becoming more insular, more perverted, more ego-maniacal.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Alive, vibrant and emotionally resonant.","Woody Allen is a filmmaker known for his somewhat counter-culturist views upon romance, love and the modern relationship in all their nuances and tiny, overlooked details that elude the consciousness of your average audience member. As a result, Woody has never quite achieved global acclaim from audiences world over, and has, to this day, stuck largely to the shadows of movie-as-art cultists and to the pages and pages of film reviews penned by adoring film critics.Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which unmistakably sees the director returning to a form that has been rather murky in his latest works, is no real change of pace for the artist, sculpting an anti-romance of sorts that reaffirms tragic, romantic love in ways of truth and transient beauty rather than clich√© and formula. This blatant disregard for cinema, and indeed society's views upon what love is, should be and should not ever thrive for, is sure to grate on the more reserved viewer's willingness to attach to a world stripped of its fa√ßade and safe, cosy pretensions. If anything, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, despite its minor faults here and there, attains a sense of coherency and fulfilling social catharsis that propelled the director to stardom decades ago, all the while without tiresomely repeating himself.Of course, one of the ways in which Allen immediately distances himself from both his previous works, and the very idea of traditional, American-filtered romance is by shifting the location from skyscrapers and hot dog stands to villas and small markets. Taking place entirely on location within Barcelona itself, Vicky Cristina Barcelona manages to strike a tone that is both romantic and yet without whimsy pretence; for sure, there are elements to Woody's story here that border on breaking the illusion of passion that he is adamant to create, but such instances are too often overshadowed by the director's keen eye for beauty kept in check with a distinct key of realism.This extra blend of unpolluted truth and introspection into love comes sharply into focus with the movie's central male character who comes in the form of bohemian artist and lover of life in all its bitter cruelties and tragic delights, Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem). Juan, at times, can be a little overwhelming, not just for those on screen, but for those watching it all unfold; his very outlook on life isn't the accepted standard for romantic films of this kind, and yet this is his very pulling power. It's not long then that the two female (American tourist) love interests of Juan soon come to see that not only is Juan something quite unlike anyone they have met before, but that his very presence unsettles their preconceived ideas and plans that they thought ¬ñbeforehand- were perfect.It is this element of Vicky Cristina Barcelona that gives it its real zest and subtle form of vibrancy if you will, establishing a formless, boundless, counter-viewpoint on love, romance and sexual relations. As such as Juan's bohemian mind state often dictates, Allen reflects the ideas of said lifestyle in his portrayal that goes beyond his characters' development and at times even seeps into the narration and artistic deliverance of his feature. From the beautiful, elegant on-location photography that complements the script's themes poignantly to a score that establishes a romantic, foreign overtone to everything that is played underneath, Vicky Cristina Barcelona provides a romantic film experience that does not pander to the expectations of its immediate audience, instead giving a sharp, focused, and all the more convincing and compelling portrayal of romance that questions the very reasons we fall in love in the first place.Most Hollywood features refuse to ask such questions however, and it would seem that a large majority of audiences would rather not be presented with the answers either. Yet as has been the case with Woody for many decades now, such under-the-rug apathy never did interest either him or his admirers, and in that vein at least, Vicky Cristina Barcelona satisfies by telling a story sure to adored by anyone ready for art that speaks in its own whimsical, neurotic yet safely grounded and human, honest and beautifully poetic way. Granted, there are some problems inherent to the overall experience that Mr. Allen paints us here (one of which simply being that I wanted more), yet cushioned with four flawless performances, chemistry that leaps off the screen and a screenplay that consistently breaks boundaries without resorting to stultifying disregard for narrative, Vicky Cristina Barcelona most importantly feels alive, vibrant and emotionally resonant.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Romance
"Woody Allen made another ""Woody Allen film"" about the capital of a European country","Let me start by saying that this narrator in the film is a very bad choice, because he only spoils everything. If it weren't for the off-screen narration, this film would be another tolerable work by Woody Allen, a 7/10 film that you will watch with pleasure, and after a week you will forget about it.All his recent films set in the largest cities of Europe can be summed up as follows - pretty people, nice views, love and a simple story that always goes in one direction towards ""a happy ending"" (what according to Woodie Allen means the life of a person unhappily in love). This film fits exactly into this pattern and doesn't stand out above the level of previous works.If someone likes Woody Allen's cinema from 2000 to 2020, this film will be the same as they liked in recent years. If someone, like me, doesn't like what Woody Allen has created over the last 20 years and prefers his earlier films, then there is nothing to look for.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good romantic movie.,"Woody Allen is one of those directors that either we love or hate. I confess, I am the exception: I don't like nor hate, I've never had much contact with his films. This film was, probably, the first of his work I saw from beginning to end, and I liked it. It has a somewhat unrealistic but acceptable script in which two American girls get involved with the same man during a summer trip to Barcelona. Both are dissatisfied with their love life for different reasons: Vicky attaches great value to commitment but needs passion to support it; Cristina is very passionate but she cannot be in a relationship because she always feels something missing. In this duality lies the great criticism the film makes to the emptiness of American society, described as very conservative and worried with appearances. On the other side the Spanish Juan Antonio and Maria Elena, a former couple whose love is deep and destructive to the point of not being able to live without melodramatic fights. Through them, Allen seems to criticize the way of being of European society, described as being very liberal. The whole movie is a clash of mindsets of different people, representing very different civilizations and different ways of facing love.Of course, this is all based on Woody Allen's own views. I, for example, have a very different idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat Europeans and Americans are like, and I don't think they are so different. We must not forget that American society has been shaped in the image of Europe. Never has Europe seemed to me as liberal and open-minded as the film suggests, and even Latin countries (like my own) are quite conservative, partly because of religious issues, although its also true that they're becoming more liberal (maybe too much). But this only proves that these ideas are points of view, debatable and subjective. Either way, the way the characters behave is very interesting, creating situations that are very hilarious. The narrator works well and has an excellent voice. Concerning the actors, they're all big names. Bardem and Cruz, however, deserve special applause for the way they ended up standing out, starring in some of the funniest scenes. Rebecca Hall did a good job in the role of conventional Vicky, giving her special psychological depth from which she falls in love. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role, not surprisingly but also without disappointment. She was OK most of the time. A note of praise still for the very careful cinematography and for the choice of filming locations, who knew how to take advantage of the landscapes and tourist icons that we associate with the Catalan capital.Intelligent, beautiful, passionate, romantic, elegant... there would be several adjectives for this film. It's not enough to shut up those who hate Woody Allen but, for those like me, who are not familiar with his work, it's enough to give him more attention from now on.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A beautiful movie, real artwork!","Absolutely beautiful movie! I discussed this movie with a friend of mine and we came to the conclusion that it was a love movie for guys. Bardem plays the role of a man every man wants to be like and everyone in the theater guy or gal was seduced by his approach to life and love. Nothing to add really about the layout of the movie except for masterful work by Woody Allen in choosing the settings, the themes and directing this superb cast. The moral of the film is interesting because although it is a light picture the reflexions it brings upon you are quite serious.Definitely a must see that will be in my home DVD collection soon!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bit dissappointing,"There was some good writing here, and the performances by Bardem, Cruz and Johansen were great..... but the plot was a bit odd. There was some good build up and development, but the plot overall seemed unresolved, almost like the movie needed another 20% to complete the story. Writers would say there was no ""pay off"".The narration, as some have said, was jarring, possibly because of the choice of narrator, or perhaps it would have been better without it and the dialogue could have revealed the story instead.Overall, great acting, characters.....with a flawed unresolved plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Few Small Observations,"I won't go into a lengthy review that I could do no better than some already offered. I just want to make a few observations about a movie that I really enjoyed and found engaging.First, Rebecca Hall's performance as Vicky should not be overlooked. She doesn't have the fireworks to play with except in one scene late in the movie, but she conveys brilliantly the dilemma of a newly married young woman with her conventional life planned out having serious buyer's remorse. There are some subtle takes she does that make me ache for her.Second, I love the other three main actors but was disappointed in Bardem's performance. Knowing the kind of performance he is capable of--""The Dancer Upstairs""--it seemed to me that this one was to some degree ""phoned in."" Third (and last), I'm not a great Allen fan or aficionado, but I found many of his directorial choices for this film quite brilliant. Not the least, the work that must have gone in in post for the sound track. Delicious!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but not great,"Despite not being one of Allen's best efforts, VCB is above other recent outings. It's an interesting and adult story, a bit of a throwback to his late 80s/early 90s sex/love/relationships dramas, after a stint of crime stories and silly comedies. The exceptionally good looking cast and setting (my city :-) also help maintain the interest, of course, and the photography is brilliant. The story is irregular, however, in that it strains credibility at some points, while at others you feel it doesn't go as far as it could have, some characters seeming to be let off too easy from their predicaments; and the performances are irregular as well, Cruz and Hall being the obvious standouts, and Johansson the weakest link. The voice-over narration, while necessary, is a bit excessive. And the songs are, quite frankly, unbearable!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love and Death (by boredom),"I don't understand the raves this movie is getting. The only masterpiece Woody Allen ever made was ""Manhattan."" Even ""Annie Hall"" got too coy and cute for me. The early comedies were sublime because he had a sense of humor about himself. I had high hopes for ""Vicky, Christina, Barcelona,"" (principally because I knew Allen wouldn't be in it playing the usual old lech who thinks he's irresistible to a much younger starlet). However, I found the dialogue banal, the sense of drama non-existent and the narrator beyond annoying. The humor, if there was any, passed me by. The reviews called it ""sun-drenched,"" but at least at the theatre in which I saw it, the picture was murky and out-of-focus at best. Most tedious movie I've seen in years, a huge disappointment.

Minor Woody Tale,"Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), two American friends in their twenties, are holidaying in beautiful Barcelona prior to Vicky's marriage to the dull but worthy Doug (Chris Messina). They meet Juan Antonio, accomplished artist and dedicated Latin lover (Javier Bardem), who proposes going to bed with both of them, preferably at the same time. Cristina is keen, but passes out and it is the guilty Vicky who has a night of passion before marrying the unsuspecting Doug. Afterwards, Juan Antonio and Cristina get together, and, surprise, form a relationship. Alas, the idyll is interrupted by a blast from Juan Antonio's past, his homeless and unstable ex-wife Maria (Penelope Cruz). Juan Antonio can't bring himself to turn her away, and the three of them start living together. At first things go well, but then¬Ö Well, the movie succeeds as travelogue. The locations are authentic and beautiful. The acting is fine, especially the two Spanish leads. But this is a slight story about two emotionally shallow and not very interesting Americans abroad. The real people are the locals. We are also kept at a distance from the characters by a bland voice-over. Perhaps Woody Allen, a long-time student of American sexual manners, is aiming to contrast the Spanish and (wasp) American approaches to affairs of the heart. The Spanish go for romance as if life depended on it, the American regard it as just another life goal, like a college education, or a well-paid middle-class job. The Americans are strangely discontented in the warm Catalonian environment, while the Spanish seem to belong there, which of course they do.I'm not complaining (it was after all a free in-flight movie being shown before the release date here) and it was lovely to see Barcelona again after 10 years, if only on the back of the seat in front of me, but I'd have to say Woody's best work is behind him. I saw Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" afterwards ‚Äì now there's an ancient director who still can produce, as well as act.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pen√©lope Cruz,"There are about a handful of film-makers whose influence on their films is unmistakable. Woody Allen defines this group and among Americans, only Martin Scorsese's influence is as pervading. This makes it hard to speak about Allen's films without his views on life, death and relationships getting more than a passing mention. Having seen only one prior to Vicky Cristina (Annie Hall), I'll stay away from reflections on that. A few things struck me. One of them was the way Barcelona was shot (Vicky is seduced by Bar√ßa, Juan Antonio is representative of the moods the city brings out in her). Excuse the digression, but Spanish Guitar ! How convenient ! The cinematographer (a chap with a wonderfully cinematic name Javier Aguirresarobe) and Allen capture, not merely the sights of Barcelona, but also the charming homes (villas had to be a Spanish term), caf√©s and cobbled, undulating roads. It feels as if Barca is both seductress and seduced. All the characters in the film are in love with it and the resultant effect on the viewer is a seduction that lasts about hundred minutes.The other seduction was Pen√©lope Cruz. She does a Maria Elena that nearly overshadows everything else about the film. It is in Allen's understanding of what her character signifies to the trio that this is avoided. Her portrayal is more poetry than prose. The beauty, grace and poise of it is bewitching which makes the irrationality of her condition vexing, and annotates our interest in her character. If Spain is anything like Maria Elena, then it is worth savouring. Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio is the bedrock of the film. The only way in which I can say anything about the performance is in the assurance of his juggling act.Strangely, some of the film's pitfalls lie with Vicky and Cristina. Where there ought to be shades, Allen gives us diametric opposites. This, for me, is an easy way out on the part of film-makers. I guess it makes the character scripting process all the more easier. Despite that the contrasts are a little too gaudy here and muted colours could've given scope for multiple viewings. The real issue is in its germination to the voice over which, plainly put, should've been scrapped. It robs the film of a subtle touch, or a hidden hand rather. Ultimately, the performances from Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson hold our attention and keep it from straying too much. Rebecca Hall, in particular, is every bit the revelation that people have made her out to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A delight,"Woody Allen's latest film is a return to comedy, after recent wanders into darker territory. It cannot be said to be a crushing, comic examination of humanity's madness in matters of love, but it is a subtle, clever and highly entertaining piece of humorous cinema which hits the spot quite expertly.The theme of the film, as it is with so many of Allen's films, is love and what the heart really wants. It is, however, incredibly light-hearted about it and swings through the brief running time with ease. Vicky, an engaged girl with safe and definite views on love, and her friend Cristina, who is much more given to passions, no matter how fleeting, have their worldviews challenged by their respective relationships with local artist, Juan Antonio, who embodies the passion that Cristina likes and the Catalan philosophy and lifestyle which Vicky adores.The story is quietly involving, as the characters are entertaining, well defined and beautifully played. Rebecca Hall continues to impress with a really beautifully executed performance here, which is as wonderfully understated as the rest of the film. Scarlett Johansson delivers a performance which draws on the talent which she has shown before now, but still doesn't quite live up to the promise that she gave us in ""Lost in Translation"". Javier Bardem is, once again, magnificent to watch as he oozes charm through the course of the film. And who could forget Penelope Cruz, whose controlled madness is fuelled into the ideal form of Juan Antonio's insane former wife Maria Elena? The actors have got a good script to work with here, as Woody Allen delivers a piece of writing which is delightfully restrained, constantly amusing and, at points, devilishly funny. There are numerous lines and moments which could be quoted, but that would spoil them.As a result of all this expert craftsmanship, Allen leaves his audience with a little gem of a film, which is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is a wonderful way to pass an hour and a half.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretentious Woody,"Two American women spend a summer in Barcelona and become involved with a local artist with a psycho ex-wife. Bardem is the stereotypical European artist with a tortured soul who is so irresistible to women that they are willing to share his bed five minutes after meeting him. Hall and Johansson are OK as the women who can't stay away from him. The film is pretentious and rather boring until Cruz enters the picture half way through as Bardem's crazed ex-wife, bringing with her the energy and passion that the film otherwise lacks. The score is tiresome and the superfluous narration is annoying. Allen continues to churn them out annually although he rarely has anything fresh to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody should have done the voice-over,"A perfectly enjoyable movie by Woody Allen, arguably one of the most under-appreciated directors in contemporary America. The story of two close friends during a summer vacation in Barcelona continues Allen's recent streak of movies set in Europe. This isn't Manhattan, but the backdrop shots are beautiful nonetheless. The two main characters couldn't be different, though during the movie their reactions to events begin to crossover to some extent, at least for a while. Excellent performance by Pen√©lope Cruz, who I think is a much more convincing actress when she acts in Spanish, I guess not surprisingly. But the movie's major attraction is an understated but superb performance by Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky. Also of note Javier Bardem, playing the Spanish Latin lover. One complaint: the narrator voice should have been Allen's. You can just hear him coming through loud and clear, even though that's not his voice.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's Spanish Adventure,"Woody Allen is easily considered a great director, with films like Annie Hall and Manhattan being recognised as classics. But in his more recent efforts critics believed Allen has lost his mojo and his recent films have been set in London rather then his native New York. But critics consider Vicky Cristina Barcelona a return to form for the writer/director.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are two friends from university who plan to spend the summer in Barcelona. Both are very different people, Vicky was a very grounded academic type who wants stability and a committed relationship, whilst Cristina sees herself as a artistic type, who wants to take risks when it comes to romance. Both meet up with the charming artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who takes them to the city Oviedo. Vicky does not like Juan Antonio whilst Cristina was very attached to him, but the three form a friendship as the 3 deal with relationship problems. Vicky being stuck with a stuffy, conservative man, Doug (Chris Messina) who seems to have no real adventure, Cristina has to do handle her drive to be artistic and self-destructive nature and Juan Antonio has a psychotic ex-wife, Mar√≠a Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz).Allen does write a script with drama and witty dialogue. The tone is down to Earth, with a light-hearted touch to it and colourful direction. The characters are well rounded, all with their own personal problems, even the well rounded Vicky. The characters are what makes the film interesting and makes you care about what happens to them. There is a good cast in the film, with Cruz and Bardem being the best of the lot. Both are very entertaining as the more extreme characters of the film. Hall and Johannson too perform well, this was one of Johannson's better performances. Allen himself is able to combine the ideas of people looking for exciting and creativity, whilst others want security. There are drawbacks to both of those and it is shown in the film.Allen uses a narrator throughout the film, at times it gives the film a Kubrickian like quality in films like The Killing. But at other times in the narration is just used to skip over details that we need to see for ourselves, particularly the relationship between Juan Antonio and Cristina.At times the film also felt hollow with it's talk about art and culture, with Cristina being pretty much a young female version of Allen. Whilst the characters themselves are interesting and the act as the main drive for the film, the plot itself is not remarkable, with moments of lack of focus. Ihe ending too felt rushed and was basically lacking some power that it should have. This's is what is preventing the film from gaining a higher rating but it does have moments of interest.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Typical Woody Allen,"This was the longest 92 minutes in the history of the world! Listening to Bardem drone on and on was impossible. The music was simply terrible and a downer so that it was, in fact, the best part of the movie. Maria Elana should have been allowed to commit suicide and maybe the movie could have ended in 60 minutes. But it was never convincing that she wanted to die or had any reason to want to die. It all goes to the vision, or lack there of, of the director. There has never been a great Woody Allen movie. We can debate Annie Hall some other time I am positive that the only people who like him live in New York and LA. He was great at stand up. It has been all down hill since",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Human Heart is Very Complicated Muscle,"Woody Allen is a brilliant story teller. Vicky Christina Barcelona proves that.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Christina (Scarlett Johansson) are about spend their summer in the beautiful Barcelona Spain. Vicky is going to get married next fall and Christina is pursuing to find herself. The two meet a sexy stranger Juan Antonio (wonderful Javier Bardem) who suggest a weekend trip to Oliviedo. Christina is instantly attracted to the man who is attracted the both of beautiful women. There begins a complex relationship between number of people. More spices is thrown into the mix by Juan Antonio's crazy ex-wife, Maria Elena (great Penelope Cruz).Allen is master of handling a complicated relationships and striking dialog. His language is witty and filled with pathetic humor. The cast is chosen very well. All Johansson, Hall, Bardem and Cruz handle their part very well. Also it was nice to see Patricia Clarkson again on the screen because she is a such a good actress. Penelope Cruz really shines as a loony ex-wife. It wouldn't be surprise if she would be awarded with an Oscar.Vicky Christina Barcelona isn't so unpredictable as Allen's masterpiece ""Match Point"" but it offers laughs and enjoyable drama comedy. The movie also makes you want to travel to lively Barcelona!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
C'mon it's a Woody Allen,"Voice narrations were something......very very unique.I cannot say that they were outright bad or completely unnecessary to the film.It was merely a choice director made.It's a sad film.Yes it is.But it is a Woody Allen film and he does manage to make it a funny one,in his usual subtle manner.It a humor of good quality.(I don't know if Woody Allen meant to put comedy in this one.If he didn't mean it....well)At the end of the film,I just smiled.I was amazed at the stupendous pettiness and meaninglessness of the whole thing.Of the film,of love in 'Juan Antonio' life.It hit's in the scene in the art studio when Antonio's ex-wife breaks down after shooting around her gun,and there comes a really really laughable situation when they are just talking gibberish(film's made for English speaking audience).It's a Humor very difficult to define or to explain,but all and all I'll call this film a comedy.Not a funny film but definitely a Comedy. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An advertisement for Vacationing in Spain,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona Woody Allen can add another masterpiece to his collection with VCB. Allen is remarkable in catching the beauty of Spain, and the beauty of his characters at the same time. Once again Allen takes on the topic of relationships, but this time he makes his characters even more disoriented with what love really is. Javier Bardem, fresh off his stellar performance in No Country for Old Men, plays Juan Antonio a Spanish painter. Antonio is the prototypical ""Don Juan"" and he oozes with European masculinity. It takes no time for the friends Vicky and Cristina to both fall under his spell. The perplexing love triangle turns into a ""love square"" when Antonio's volatile ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) reappears into his life. Allen does such fascinating job at showcasing the culture and landscape of Spain, that it makes every viewer want to jump on a flight to Barcelona tomorrow. Strong acting performances make this the best Allen movie since Match Point. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
pleased when Penelope Cruz finally arrives,"A rather smart and sexy script and smart enough of Woody Allen that he can use a rather lot of the narrator so there is less dialogue needed for the actors. Allen has his voice all the time anyway but it is usually so pleasant that we are happy anyway. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are great and we almost don't miss Johansson who is ill in bed much of the time. Of course we are really pleased when Penelope Cruz finally arrives and even if she is a little over the top, but less so than her work with Pedro Almodovar. I didn't think the art and photography bits were so good but all with the love and sex was really good and the sparkling Gaudi and Miro architecture spiced up the otherwise moments when Allen thought it might get too dull with that narration.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great cast gets the best out of Allen.,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a movie of beautiful parts that never quite solidify into an equally pleasing whole. It doesn't have a ""plot"", but instead it focuses on the relationships of a few people over a summer in Spain. The narrative focus switches between three main characters as they all seemingly go through changes, only to end essentially where they began.Every actor and actress was cast perfectly. Javier Bardem is beyond charming, and really it's more accurate to say that he embodies the role of Juan Antonio instead of acts it out. Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson are all so hypnotically beautiful that it's easy to overlook the fact that each of them gives some of the most outstanding performances of their careers. And I can't talk about beauty without mentioning the picturesque scenery of Spain. I wanted to visit there before, but now I think I'd rather travel there than any other place in the world. The theme song, ""Barcelona"", was the cherry on top of it all. Each time I heard it during the film, I just had to crack a bit of a smile.The main theme of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is how different kinds of people look for and respond to different kinds of love and relationships. Each person who watches it will probably relate differently to the actions and thoughts of the main characters, because they all represent the various human perspectives of love. They all seem so refreshingly authentic, in an urbane way. There was very little romantic idealization going on (to my relief).Vicky Cristina reminds me a bit of Closer, even though its motif lies in the completely opposite direction. Ultimately there's no resolution, no progress in the lives of the characters. It feels like the viewer simply lived among the characters and viewed their lives for a few months, and then left again. Of course, every movie doesn't have to have a tidy ending to be good, but in this case it's a double-edge sword. The ending was so abrupt that I was left wanting to know more. How (if at all) were the characters changed by their summer? Is it unfair for me to wish for a Vicky Cristina Barcelona...Part 2?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's a European variation on the old Woody Allen staple,"Woody Allen is a guy that keeps making variations on the same film over and over again, sometimes with lackluster results, but sometimes with sparkling results. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of his better attempts at the same story.In fact, the Spanish setting helps give the film a sort of air of freedom that I haven't yet witnessed in an Allen film. Granted, I'm only acquainted with his older works, so perhaps he'd achieved that before. Again, he draws characters that are interesting, but in this case, they bordered on slight, being more than ciphers for himself, but not by much. And that's the thing, even without Allen physically on screen, the characters he writes still represent aspects of who he is and I think by dividing himself between Vicky and Cristina (believably played by the lead actresses), he weakens their characters. They are, after all a little flat.Another problem with the film is that it's content to tell the story instead of show it. The magic of movies happens in the show, but Allen cops out and throws an omniscient narrator (very clearly a stand-in for his own voice) who describes what's happening on screen and relates information about who everyone is. The first half of the film really spends a lot of time setting up and without any notable dynamism, I found it a little boring.Once the interpersonal conflicts start happening, the movie picks up. In fact, the Cristina sections of the film sort of flag because they lack any real conflict, but just move along smoothly. Vicky's sections are a little more interesting, but it's still only slightly engaging. I think that with storytelling and characters on the weak side, the film's real strong point is in building atmosphere. VCB is sort of an exploration of Barcelona and in that sense, it captures some of the magic in its air or, at least, Woody Allen's own fascination with the land pretty well.In the end, VCB is a story about people with problems with finding what they want, whether out of the drive to achieve what they think they want or the inability to settle on what it is they want. A common Allen theme. But the Spanish background and gliding vibe help keep it somewhat interesting. Allen's easily done better, but VCB is just interesting enough that I wasn't disappointed. Still, it's not a dynamic film and lacking most of the elements that's found in Allen's best. As such, I can only recommend this film to those who usually enjoy Allen's films and want a different take on his usual neurosis. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poor writing is the downfall,"Well, if you've got a boring concept and lackluster writing, it's hard for even the best director and the most inspired actors to redeem a film. That's what we get here - boring and lackluster, and of course, Allen qua director cannot be expected to redeem Allen qua writer.I kept on watching, hoping that the movie would finally blossom in some interesting way. It never did. Sure, there're some pretty sights of Barcelona, and I am always at the ready to be enthralled by the shear beauty of SJ and/or PC. But there really was nothing there. An uninteresting story about uninteresting people. Sad, actually.(As a parenthetical (wholly parenthetical) - what a mistake to set a film in Barcelona, indeed a film in which one of the major characters has a recent college major in ""Catalan Identity"", and not have Catalan play any role at all. Bizarre. ""Speak in English"" is Juan Antonio's constant refrain to Maria Elena; I suppose Allen means that to mean something, but speaking in English is, apparently, the limit of Allen's capabilities in this film, and a very pedestrian and uninspired English, as well. . . )As to the scads of 8 and 9 etc stars for the flic; well, I'm just at a loss to explain them, apart from ""de gustibus non est . . .""

Woody Allen searches for love in the heart of Spain,"Vicky Cristina BarcelonaDirected by Woody Allen.Starring Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz.Woody Allen's latest film finds the writer/director exploring love and all of its manifestations through the experiences of two American tourists on summer vacation in Barcelona. The girls, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson, in her third Allen film), both fall for Juan Antonio, a local painter and lothario who still mourns the disastrous failure of his marriage. Antonio (Bardem) is something of a conundrum to both girls: Cristina, because she has always enjoyed strange and mysterious relationships, and Vicky, because she never has.After a secret affair with Juan Antonio, Vicky tries to force herself to abide by her old life plan. She is engaged to a successful New York businessman but suddenly finds herself doubting what she thought she always wanted out of love and life. Cristina picks up where Vicky leaves off, falling in love and eventually moving in with Juan Antonio. She is all the while unsure of her new life with the charming painter, especially when his ex-wife (Cruz) comes back into the picture.Penelope Cruz is wonderful as Maria Elena, a mentally unstable muddle of emotions. She and Bardem have great chemistry, during tender moments of intimacy and heated bouts of screaming. She stirs things up just as the film starts to get a bit too predictable. Her scene with Johansson's Cristina, developing photos in a darkroom, is very sensual and not soon forgotten once the movie ends.The film is typical of Woody Allen with its sharp dialogue and fully fleshed-out characters. However, ""Barcelona"" is slightly hindered by unnecessary narration from Christopher Evan Welch. The commentary adds nothing to the picture and sometimes glosses over scenes that require more attention.Allen tends to be a better writer than director, but he really utilizes Spain's beautiful city as a fantastic backdrop to his picture. He manages to do for Barcelona what he used to do for New York so many years ago. By filming the city's culture instead of generic monuments, Allen manages to unearth its heart. If Spain's tourism industry sees a spike in visits to Barcelona, they ought to send him a check.""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a solid, thought-provoking film that is a great addition to the long list of Woody Allen's works. It is not unlike his 1977 classic ""Annie Hall"" in its comical and sometimes unsatisfactory view of love, although Allen tends to focus more on cynicism than witticism these days. No matter, at least he still has something interesting to say.Final Grade: B+",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Vicky wow,Cristina Wow Wow,Barcelona Ultimate Wow...","Wow that's what you could tell when you watch this simple movie.This is a director's special kind of movie.Yes Woody has marked his directorial performance in this movie.The story line is so simple just a summer in Barcelona for two American girls.As always the narrator starts with his beautiful voice about the lead girls of the movie and tells about the line of the story.I would say Woody's movies are the language at its best as always.He has gone through a complete cultural research of Americans and the Catalans to build this story.The main plus point of this movie is the location where it happens yes the Spanish towns especially Barcelona, it was like a trip for us when we watch it on screen. You will surely cherish it.Acting wise the casting was excellent. Especially Penelope's character and acting was at its best.Also Rebbecca hall and Scarlet were stunning in their characters.On the whole movies like this kind I would put it under a Genre ""Culture reflection movies"" (category).Overall it as so beautifully presented for eyes and our viewing experience on the whole as well.The BGMs were perfect.Once again Woody rocks.....I would give 8.5 on 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The comic half of love stories,"For sure Europe has made consistent changes in Woody's mind and all that's happening around him as an observer and as a misunderstood artist as well. Also seems that he wants to express it in a so intense way that all his best creative processes in the last 10 years are happening in Europe than when living in his loved Manhattan.It's obvious why his mind seems so much more clear and his movies seems so more coherent now than before. Manhattan is a concrete jungle surrounded by chaos and cars and people crossing streets and a place where you can find anything anytime anywhere, but you will never be able to find answers for inner questions. So it's always the search for an inexistent thing. In Europe, as things happens a little slower and everything in that continent has a cultural explanation for everything, or an intense artistic feeling for every moment, that's why most of the artists find themselves crossing the ocean. And we can feel that happens to Woody.I never appreciated his movies so much as now. Like I said, he seemed to me a totally chaos before Europe and now he seems a lot more coherent and expressive, and we are able to feel that. It's not like Woody is trying to be something else, he's there all the time with all his perfectionism and questionings, extracting from life the finner feelings that we are always trying to hide, but he is not that messy expressionist picture anymore.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of his best works because he unified all his discussions thru the years in a loose movie that carries you naturally over his own ideas and personal questions and fears that we all heard before. For me, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is the opposite of Match Point (2005), and both of them are what he was trying to express with Melinda And Melinda (2004) and its both sides of the same story, the comic one and the tragic one. While Match Point is the tragic one in London, VCB is the comic one in Barcelona. So, it was necessary two different movies in two totally different places to show what Melinda And Melinda fails a lot in Manhattan. But that is a totally Woody Allen thing, I mean... he never gives up an idea till the time he feels fully completed in satisfaction with it.Also is very interesting why he chose Spain as background of the comic love stories, because that country represents all about love clich√©s and the appreciation of a good wine in bucolic warm places surrounded by colors and history. That is another huge twist in a career that always suited in inexpressive cold places filled with whisk.But the most interesting fact of the movie - and each one of his European movies - is that there are always American characters searching for something outside their native country, and there are always other American characters always trying to push them back to that American way of life that those ones were trying to escape or forget someway. And that seems to me his consistent idea that no matter how better and creative he fells in Europe, there's always a foot in New York.It's unfair talk about how much better are the actors or the characters separately because all of them has a whole importance in Woody's mind and how they were able to express it in his own artistic ways. But the actors here perform their characters with sincere brilliance and they are so consistent and well directed that is refreshing.No doubt Woody keeps getting better and better thru the years and I'm rediscovering the pleasure to watch his movies all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do NOT watch this!,"I thought that this film was so boring! Penelope Cruz won an Oscar for this....and for what?! Yeah she was good at playing a crazy woman but I thought that her part was very small and that the storyline was slow to develop and never reached a climax. Pathetic if you ask me! I'm never watching a film with Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz in it ever again! This film isn't thrilling, inspiring or romantic.

great stuff from Cruz,"Woody Allen already knocked me out with his talent with Matchpoint, which was probably one of his best movies ever. Over 70 he had found a second career with remarkable movies. Along his great quality for dialogs, Allen has the quality to get the best out of actors. Bardem as always is fantastic as the artist with a lack of talent and an image which makes every women love him. Johansson with he lovely eyes and a little chunky body has one of he best roles, but the biggest actor on the screen is Penelope Cruz who lives together with Bardem in real life. Cruz acting in Spanish or Englisch is a complete difference. Cruz acting in an European film instead of an American film is the same story. AltoughWoody Allen is Amnerican, this film feels European. Cruz performs fantastically with power. Her role as unbalanced, aggressive, highly talented, very intellectual artist is phenomenal. Compared with her roles in other American films Cruz gives a top end performance, also due to the passion she feels with Bardem. A good movie, not a great movie, but good due to the acting and an excellent cinematography. I really loved it. 8,5 /10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Woody Allen seems to have a riot of a time making movies outside of New York, and truth be told, I find them pretty enjoyable, though some would argue I should revisit his earlier films to understand what's great. Then again, his ""muse"" Scarlett Johansson and a more contemporary cast are an interesting mix to gain a fresh following from a new generation of audiences like myself, lapping it up on Allen's wit, narrative creativity and candy eye cast.The reason why Barcelona was chosen, and hence in the title, was because the City had sponsored Allen to make his movie there. I guess if Uniquely Singapore would do so, this could have been Vicky Cristina Singapore. Then again, I suspect some boardroom terms and conditions might have made it very pro-tourism video like. Of some of the earlier co- productions I have seen with the Lion City's money pumped in, you can't help but feel that shots of our landmarks almost always come across as something made for corporate videos, and relied plenty on those tracking shots, or worse, dug out from archives.But in the hands of maestros, this feeling somehow doesn't even come into the picture. Landmarks become just another non-intrusive backdrop, or worked carefully that they become essential to the story without drawing attention to themselves. I guess we could all learn from this film how to do reward a city that graciously allows itself to be filmed and filmed using some of its investment.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is so titled because it is a tale of the two titular best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) who spend their summer vacation in the Catalan city. It's an exploration of contemporary relationships using two characters whose view on love comes from total opposites. For Vicky, it's all built on the foundation of commitment, of being very structured and organized about it. For Cristina, a failed short filmmaker by her own standards, it's to take the bull by the horns, and to grab relationship opportunities in a rather cavalier manner.In a test of their resolve, they meet newly minted star Javier Bardem who plays Juan Antonio, a suave, witty and sweet talking painter who audaciously suggests that they travel with him, and thereafter sleep with him. For Vicky it is near impossible given that she's on the verge of getting married and a definite contradiction of her principles, but to Cristina, it is a plus point in have a complete stranger come up and telling them honestly what he wants to do with them. So begins the exploration of love and relationships in 3 acts.The start is a bit slow as Vicky gets to have a spanner thrown in her plans, that once you've tasted the forbidden fruit, you'll likely be clamouring for more. It's a wake up call and examination of a life that she thinks she wants to have, versus one that she probably would like to have and enjoy it a lot more. It's the classic tussle between freedom, and being shackled, of conforming to the idea that being successful means a good career with an equally career-successful husband, in an artificially created lifestyle involving small talk with colleagues/friends and the likes.Cristina's dalliance with Juan Antonio shows how their carefree attitudes and bohemian lifestyles might attract and inspire each other to greater heights and the pursuit of new dreams and skills, though I welcomed the arrival of Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) somewhere at the halfway point, feisty and temperamental ex-wife of Juan Antonio, as she stirs the pot a lot more, and truly the three of them engage in quite a parasitical lifestyle, feeding off one another's energy, sexual and otherwise.All the cast members perform up to expectations, though I reckon that Scarlett haters will continue to loathe her presence here. Javier Bardem does an about turn from his extremely dead serious role in No Country for Old Men, and here he's quite the Casanova in his pursuit of women. It doesn't have plenty of big moments and never lapses into melodrama. Events get presented as is, without the need to exaggerate, and it's always a plus point to have a dash of humour added as well in Allen's signature style. It might seem fresh and breezy on the outside, but underneath its veneer is some serious study into human romantic relationships that you'll be left pondering for some time after the end credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would make a good tourist ad,"I just have to say, I currently live in Catalonia. And I'm a bit fed up with all the Catalan nationalism I'm surrounded by. But this hasn't much to do with the film, actually there's hardly anything 'Catalan' in the it, only the fact that Cristina is studying 'Catalan identity' just because she likes Gaud√≠ (quite absurd, I like Mondrian but I'm not gonna study dutch identity because of that!). The whole movie looks more like a 'visit Spain!' ad than anything else, the scenes in Oviedo are merely a touristic walk with all the Spanish stereotypes you can think of, Spanish guitars and all. The actors are good, but they struggle to make believable a script that is preposterous and ridiculous, especially Penelope Cruz has the worst character of her carrier. Allen seems to have lost not only his touch, but also common sense, putting films like this (or Cassandra's Dream) in his CV. It seems like he has to change city every 5-6 years to give some fresh air to the same old plots he has. For the ones who don't know, the film is set in Barcelona only because the government paid good money for it, otherwise it would have been somewhere else. It's just so hard to me to believe he is the same director of Manhattan.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A triumph for Woody Allen's filmography!!!,"""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is an eccentric film about the meaning of love, which builds an entertaining scenery for open-minded movie-goers, but fails to impress as much as Allen's most acclaimed work. Outstanding performances, mostly by Spanish actors Javier Bardem and Pen√©lope Cruz make burn the screen. However, once again, like in almost every other film by this filmmaker, the real star is the story itself. Then, Woody Allen consolidates as the greatest screenwriter in American cinema history.The film provides a twisted and unconventional look of human relationships, and is joined by a hilarious narrative and joyful music, as well as beautiful pictures of the European city where it is located. Undoubtlessly, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a film to celebrate, and a triumph for Woody Allen's career. For sure, it's the healthiest Woody we've seen in the last decade, one that dares to make this film a whole new vision of human feelings and the ways people react to the ups and downs of life.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The story lacks some details,"The synopsis describes well the action of the characters in the film. So, I don't need tot turn back on this point. My point is that I think that the story lacks some details on two points:1. I consider that at the end of the story, when the characters are back in United States, they aren't back to the ""starting point"" as some people wrote. That is, back to the state in which they were before traveling to Barcelona.They aren't back to the state in which they were before traveling to Barcelona, because something new happened in their lives. This doesn't mean that their lives changed, but that their way of looking at life must have changed. This new way of looking to life should have been pointed out by the author.I can't believe that the author consider nothing: (i) having an intense affair with a foreigner, while being engaged to marry someone (Vicky) (ii) having an intense affair in a threesome scheme with a very intense couple (Cristina)2. I consider that the relationship between the three characters in the threesome scheme, should have been explored a bit more to help me understand better what was going on between Cristina, Maria Helena and Juan Antonio. The way this relationship was actually described makes me think that this threesome scheme was just a fantasy in the author's head. And, I'm interested in something more than a mere fantasy. Actually, my real life experience goes farther than the story in question.The film is very good and I liked to watch it. My comments are only due to the fact that I would have liked to learn more about the characters mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Psychoanalysis in sunny, beautiful Barcelona.","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a new kind of romantic film for Woody Allen, yet it still retains many of the classic Allen themes. It captures a certain kind of open-mindedness and tolerance that few people have but would surely want to have. Watching this film, I was never quite sure of what Woody was trying to say regarding the importance of artistic motivation in life or how it affects relationships and personalities. But then again, maybe there isn't much to say on the subject.Like nearly all of Woody Allen's movies, there is a deft blend of comedy and psychoanalysis in this story, though less comedy than I expected. What is really intriguing is how Allen sets up the plot, with best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) each symbolizing the two aspects Woody sees as essential to the female. Vicky is the intellectual who devotes herself entirely to her studies and has puritanical and idealistic ideas about love and life. Cristina is the artist, open-minded and more aware of the possibilities life offers her than Vicky. Into their lives comes the brash and sensual painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who shows a much different side than his horrifying performance in No Country for Old Men, at once both passionate and caring for each woman in his life.But the real fiery passion at the center of the story is Maria Elena, the ex-wife of Juan Antonio played with sexy charisma by the immaculate Penelope Cruz. She enters the story about 50 minutes in, yet immediately becomes the only thing we can look at. It is at this point that the plot slightly steers off course as we are led to believe that a polyamorous relationship would form almost immediately between three of the characters and the utopian effects it creates. Still, Allen crafts a beautiful and charming story set in the gorgeous, sunny Barcelona with stunning buildings, attractive people and a meditative tale about what happens when art and life collide, and the lasting effects it can have.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dry, Boring, Lifeless, Inept","""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is yet further proof, if proof were needed, that Woody Allen has no soul. Watch carefully; when he passes mirrors, is there any reflection? Javier Bardem is one of the sexiest men, and best actors, alive. Penelope Cruz's is a living Barbie Doll. How could Allen take these two sexually attractive creatures and build a lifeless, bloodless, dry as dead leaves, utterly boring, inept film around them? How long has Allen been making movies? And yet he commits a cardinal sin that the greenest tyro is warned against: a movie is a *movie*, not a book. Let your movie tell your story. Don't provide voice-over narration. There are exceptions of course; film noir, for stylistic reasons, relies on voice-over narration.But why, in this pathetic, amateurish exercise, is there a nerdy, dispassionate, uninteresting, flat, white male voice horning in on the action, and narrating almost every scene? Two beautiful young American girls get into a taxi cab at a Spanish airport. The narrator, sounding like an antiseptic-soaked cotton swab, there to remove you from any suspension of disbelief, or involvement, you may have been able to conjure up, announces, flatly, ""Vicky and Cristina are two beautiful young American girls. They are getting into a taxicab at a Spanish airport,"" or some such cloddish, invasive, commentary.Did Allen do this because he knows he is too old and too marked by his tabloid love life to appear in his own movies? And, so, rather than having to watch Allen on screen, directing everything, including the viewer's emotional response, with the fury of a puppeteer who doesn't much like or respect his own puppets, but, rather, envies them their youth, beauty, and sex appeal, and so makes them as ridiculous and empty as possible, we have to endure this grating voice of voice-over narration? I mean, really. You're a filmmaker. You are blessed enough to have *Javier Bardem* and *Penelope Cruz* in your movie. What degree of arrogance, of cluelessness, would lead you to believe that the audience needs to be *told*, by this nerdy little American male voice, what Bardem and Cruz are thinking, feeling, doing, when these superb performers are on screen, acting everything out with their top notch talent? Anyway, the plot is a bore, and utterly without insight. The movie is all about screwing and it says nothing new or true about love or people or relationships. The viewer is given nothing to care about, to cry over, even to laugh at. Watch the movie Allen was trying to make, ""Jules and Jim.""",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody in khakis and sandals,"What could be more romantic than a summer vacationing is Barcelona? You're surrounded by art, history and breathtaking scenery. You meet people you've probably never met before and will most likely never see again. You can immerse yourself in an entirely different culture, learning something new about life and yourself with every passing day. Or, you can leave your every woe from your difficult life behind you and let it all fall away into the ocean. In Woody Allen's latest, VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, Vicky and Cristina (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannson) do just that. Vicky is going to learn while Cristina follows in hope of escape and before the summer is out both will learn that that which is inherently romantic is also inescapably complicated.Vicky and Cristina are the kinds of friends that would likely not become friends if they met at this present moment but are good friends regardless because of a long and cherished history. Vicky is practical to a fault. Everything she does has purpose and function, including her fianc√©, Doug (Chris Messina, who played the same ""I am everything that is wrong with America today"" character at the end of ""Six Feet Under""). Cristina cannot stomach settling into herself, as she can't stand that self, so she recklessly pursues paths of abandon in hopes of finding solace. They are opposite in everything they do, right down to their hair colors, but they find one common interest while abroad, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), a painter with a dramatic reputation. Juan Antonio is a player but he isn't playing. He's unassumingly smooth and sexy in shirts and pants that are dressed down by playful sneakers. He is a passionate man and his provocative proposal to have both ladies join him for a weekend of food, music and lovemaking brings out the American prude in both Vicky and Cristina.Still, the vacation does everybody good, including Allen himself. Stepping out of New York and into London for his (brief) return to form, MATCH POINT, rejuvenated a vision that was once great but had recently become monotonously unwieldy. Going to the Barcelona countrysides for his 40th feature has a similar effect, in that his vision is refreshingly alive. Still, it is different than the London Allen of late. In Barcelona, it feels as if Allen were on his own vacation. This is Woody in sandals, a loose fitting tee and khakis. Sure, he's still neurotically smothered in sun block but his grip on the film is relaxed, more organic. In fact, the film's underlying criticism of American materialism and structure suggest that Allen is happy to be away for a while. Besides, if he weren't overseas, he might not have had the chance to work with Penelope Cruz. Cruz plays Marie Elena, Juan Antonio's ex-wife who tried to kill him before ultimately leaving him. Her insanity and is eluded to so often before she actually graces the screen that by the time she does, one shakes with anticipation for her arrival. Cruz's presence is overwhelming, a tumultuous force that commands attention and can either destroy or nurture from one moment to the next. She elevates the overall quality of the film to exciting heights and it was already pretty great before she got there.After years of troubled relationships both on and off screen, Allen is still going back for more despite it all. Having been around a few blocks though has given the man a fair amount of insight. He may not know what makes the perfect recipe but he's still in the kitchen cooking because he knows that when you do get all the ingredients just right, you're in for one hell of a good meal. He throws all of his characters into the fire knowing full well they will all get burned but that they will also all be better people for it. For all its complications, love or sex or however you choose to define your interaction with another human being (or with two or three for that matter) will ultimately transform you. The same can be said for VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, a flame well worth getting close to.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen does it again.,"Writer-Director-Actor, Woody Allen always puts out interesting product. He built his good reputation on writing, directing and acting in is movies. QUite a feat.In Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Allen writes and directs, but does not acting. Although I like a Woody Allen film to have Woody Allen in it, I must say that I found this movie entertaining. Not as much as the films with him in them, but I liked it just the same.Allen captures the story about two girlfriends who become enamored with the same man, when his ex-wife is about to come back into his life, beautifully. He is able to extract the humor with the Woody Allen touch as well as present us with a deeper emotional drama that may resonate with many.The actors are all very good and capture our interest. The direction works wonderfully as does the screenplay.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Woody Allen's View of Love, Infatuation and Relationships","Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others. As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements. In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film. Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina) while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent. The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a m√©nage a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene. Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain.Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Pen√©lope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket. Watching them both is reason enough to see this film. As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere. The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast. If it just didn't superimpose that narrator as a tour guide....Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
American girls are easy,"I liked one third of this recent Woody Allen film, the Barcelona part. I've visited the city two or three times and shot in golden light, it's beautifully brought to the screen in all its Gaudi and Miro-Inflected glory.Unfortunately his actors keep getting in the way of the scenery and worse they're talking the most pretentious nonsense and acting out the most ridiculous story you could imagine. It all starts in a Barcelona bar when two rich and supposedly intellectual adventure- seeking American tourists catch the eye of a swarthy Spaniard who immediately abandons the company he's keeping to proposition the pair of them by inviting them to join him on a private plane ride to Ovieda where he confidently asserts he will sleep with them both. Well girls, the Spanish word for ""Police!"" is ""Policia"", which is of course what anyone else would shout under the circumstances, but in Woody's world this is plot development so naturally they go with it and of course it duly happens. Did I mention that Javier Bardem as said Spaniard is a temperamental artist with a complicated love-life and that Scarlett Johannsen as the free spirit of the two girls is a short-film director-cum-photographer and that Rebecca Moore as the passive, vulnerable one has a degree in Catalan? So everyday, as ever in Allen's films. All the time he's with them, Bardem talks about about the stormy relationship he had with his ex-wife which is when you realise that Penelope Cruz must turn up soon and sure enough, she does, having failed in an overdose attempt and now keen to start a m√©nage-a-trois with Barden and Johannsen.Okay, I can't write this anymore, my memory's hurting at the remembrance of it. This is an absolutely awful movie from a so-called master-director who has lost all sense of timing, finesse and skill. He even employs a narrator (again), an actor with a voice uncannily similar to his own younger-self to move the story along or tell us how his characters think, which in retrospect is helpful as the viewers need all the help they can get to follow the convolutions of the story here. If Woody wants to regale us for the umpteenth time about the relationship between the sexes, with a little twist contrasting western reserve and Latin passion, he has to do it with a better written, played and directed piece than this. It's an absolute mess, trite, contrived and about as far removed from reality as I am from the moon.Oh and that little flamenco ""Barcelona"" number will drive you crazy too, by the end.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
flows wonderfully,"Sometimes you don't need an over-dramatic climax to make a good film. The story flows wonderfully and each of the characters are equally fair amount of spotlight. Each of them feels reachable and believable. The music is just fantastic. The scenery, paintings, and photography are just beautiful. Chrstina is dreamy, free, and spontaneous while Vicky is realistic, hard-headed yet longing at the same time. Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio is definitely sexy and pitiful while Penelope Cruz really deserved the Oscar she won for her performance in this film. This film will leave a smile on your face. A truly entertaining, light-hearted Woody Allen's creation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent comedy-drama,"I wish people could comment on a Woody Allen film based on its merits rather than its being a Woody Allen film. It seems that the main topic of discussion about a Woody Allen film is about the director. Has Woody lost it? Is this film among his best, or is it just average? Is this typical Woody Allen? Why isn't he as funny as he used to be? Don't you hate Woody Allen films? Doesn't he always just cover the same ground? It seems that people have become obsessed with reacting to the director rather than to his films.I wager that if Allen had made this film under a pseudonym, it would have been tagged as a refreshing work of a talented director. And that is what it is. The photography is lush; every scene is beautifully lighted and shows great care in its presentation. Consider the scene in the fruit and vegetable market where the merchandise is carefully arranged and the colors are a feast for the eyes, or the verdant backdrop for the picnic with the flowers gently swaying in the wind. The sights of Barcelona serve as a mini travelogue and enrich the film. If nothing else, Allen has become very accomplished in his presentation and he has to be ranked as a skillful director.The story is about two attractive young women spending the summer months in Barcelona where they become entangled in a love triangle with Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). When Jaun Antonio's ex-wife enters the picture, she squares the triangle. The actors are all on target with Rebecca Hall being a standout as Vicky. Barem plays Juan Antonio with such charm that he refutes any early inclinations you might have that he is a snake. He is a smooth operator, but he is never less than honest.The musical score featuring guitar works by Albeniz, de Lucia, and Serrano (among others) complements the warmth of the photography.I was puzzled by the all-knowing narrator who makes occasional observations throughout the film. I have nothing against such in general, but here most of the narrator's comments are superfluous and simply describe what can be otherwise deduced.There is one scene that epitomizes the movie for me. It has Jaun Antonio talking to Vicky saying, ""Love requires a perfect balance. It's like the human body. It may turn out that you have all the vitamins and minerals, but if there is a minor, single, tiny ingredient missing, like ... salt, for example, one dies."" In response Vicky deadpans, ""Salt?"" A truth is punctuated with a humorous response.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
AAAAARGH! Can somebody shut that narrator up??!!,"From the first minute I was irritated by the voice-over of idiotic narration that simply broadcasts hideous laziness on the part of Woody Allen. Why would he assault us this way? What does he think he added? He apparently just wanted to make subtle showing of character unnecessary -- but then why bother making the movie at all? Let's see: Maybe he thinks no one can make Scarlett look as good as he can. Or maybe he thinks Javier Bardem is overrated and set out to prove it by forcing him to talk like a robot and squelch all his sexual power. Oh, I know: maybe he just wants to show that he's such a genius that it doesn't matter what the actors do; they're really little more than mannequins, really, for him to hang his designs on. I imagine him squeezing the spirit out of the greatest actors alive, and can't understand why superstars like Bardem and Cruz would agree to work with him. Except for Penelope Cruz, Allen has managed to turn his whole talented cast into body-snatched versions of himself, as usual. I'm fed up with him.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ah Barcelona,"Vicky and Cristina are young American friends about to spend the summer in Spain. While both have different ideals, they are about to share a similar experience, resulting in a life upheaval.Woody Allen cannot stop. He has made a film a year for the past thirty years. The two best things about Woody Allen films these days is that he has finally discovered Europe and that he is not in them. I for one, was over his incessant whining. I'd much rather his observations on people arrive from the mouth of Scarlett Johansson as it does here.Javier Bardem is luminous as is Penelope Cruz and the delightful Rebecca Hall. The setting is rich, the characterization is spot on and everything falls into place. Not so his last outing, the dreadful 'Cassandra's Dream', which seemed so false, despite the cast of Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell. It's intriguing how a filmmaker like Allen can get it so wrong and then turn around and deliver a little gem like this. Ah Barcelona",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Juan Antonio - an inspiration,"This is one of those movies Vicky Cristina Barcelona, that i go and watch without any review reading or asking around how is the movie? To my surprise i see Woody Allen as the director, i was like this would be an interesting and complicated storyline.Th only thing that i love in the movie are the characters. First character Juan Antonio (played by Javier Bardem). Ina nutshell, very commendable about his character is that he manages to bed three women, spent time with them, get attacked by one of them, without any guilt or malice. He uses the language as an amazing form of lost in translation excuse to be with all of them. for all the Guys out there, Juan's character is ultimate balance between women-sex-life-creativity.The other characters are also good in this movie, specially the one played by Pen%C3%A9lope_Cruz Maria Elena, she is hyperventilating and just about either kill someone or herself for an obscure reason that will build in her mind. There is this scene where she actually goes through Cristina's baggage just to know, if she had any intentions of killing her. This is of course my favorite sequence from the movie. Cristina (played by Scarlett Johansson) is an eccentric and ready to for an adventure even in an relationship. Then there is Vicky played by Rebecca Hall, who thinks she knows what she wants. But then at Barcelona where she come to spend her summer vacation with Vicky, things go in a way, that not what they seem like.This movie, still has its own scenic beauty of Barcelona, it has its own ups and downs in the movie, and gets you thinking as to why would someone want to get oneself so involved that is unable to focus on other things. I love the end to the movie, of course you need to watch the movie to understand the complexities that one goes through being in multiple relationships and still manages to survive.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perhaps it was the weather but Woody has found his muse.,"Perhaps it was the climate; I know that any time I go to Spain my mood lifts considerably and I am invigorated. Whatever the reason, ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is Woody Allen's best film in years; a warm, funny, cheerful and erotic picture filled with the spirit of Almodovar yet unmistakably a Woody Allen film. For good or ill no-one but Allen could have made this picture and while some may find his pre-occupation with pseudo-intellectual Americans with no interests outside of painting, photography, poetry or movies a crashing bore there are many of us who can still respond to that warm and generous affection he still holds for his emotionally battered and somewhat anally retentive romantics. This is a movie that hearkens back to ""Annie Hall"" and almost everything in-between and if he himself is now too old to play the bruised and battered romantic fool there are many others, younger and not necessarily of the same gender, willing to do it for him.The problem recently, of course, is that Woody has been too quick to put his aphorisms and gags into the mouths of others as if it is he who is saying them and the result hasn't always worked to his advantage, here there is an easy -going naturalism to all his players that is distractingly un-Woody-like even if the situations and great swathes of dialogue are typically his. This is a film of considerable charm, luminously photographed in warm, Spanish sunlight by Javier Aguirresarobe and performed to perfection by the entire cast. Allen is a great actor's director who has already directed six players to Oscar success, (and Cruz as the passionate if unstable Maria Elena, here, being the latest). If there is no immediate Woody doppelganger we can still trace elements of him in both the characters of Vicky and Christina, (if Christina is more prone to the kind of tics we associate with Woody, it is Vicky who emerges as the more sympathetically drawn stand-in), and both these characters are beautifully played by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson.Spain is represented by the erotic charms of Javier Bardem's bed-hopping artist and Cruz's tempestuous ex-wife and they are both terrific. Bardem, as we all know, is one of the best actors in the world and Cruz seems to get better with every picture. If there isn't anything fundamentally new here, don't despair; many film-makers will never reach the level of gentle, ironic maturity that Allen displays in this film. He may be an old man now and, yes, it's possible that his best work is behind him but this doesn't feel like an old man's movie. Having just about hit the bar with his last several films and having nose-dived totally with the recent ""Cassandra's Dream"" this feels like an artist getting a new lease of life. It may be Spain, it may be the sunshine, it may even be the ghost of Gaudi; whatever, he is finally back on top.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Welcome back Woody, weve missed you.","If I were to tell you that Woody Allen, director of the exceptional Annie Hall, were back on top form you would most likely not believe me. Understandable of course considering he hasn't made a good movie for several years, funnily enough the truth is that he is indeed back on sparkling form with ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" his attempt at a romantic comedy showing off a beautifully ensemble cast including Javier Bardem, Scarlet Johansen and Penelope Cruz and while the premise may feels worn out and ultimately dull there this unusual chemistry between the three just mentioned that works as a huge advantage in favour of this movie. Even at the dullest point the movie remains a charm if simply for its colourful characterisation.One thing that stands out like a sore thumb is how wonderful Penelope Cruz is. Ultimately she's a brutally tormented characters unable to deal with her own ghosts and looks nothing but unstable for 90% of the movie. Honestly said, it's an Oscar calibre performance hitting all the right notes allowing her audience to see the pain she's experiencing.Woody Allen's romantic drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona stars Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as best friends Vicky and Cristina. As the movie opens, the pair of twentysomethings travel to Barcelona so that Vicky can work on her post-graduate degree. The two meet the charming artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who offers to take them on a vacation and make love to them. Vicky, being a happily engaged young woman, refuses, but Cristina is eager for this life experience. A love triangle begins to coalesce, and things grow more complicated when Juan Antonio's passionate, unstable ex, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), arrives to stay after a suicide attempt.Ultimately, in exploring this distended romantic triangle, Allen never comes down on the side of either the dull stability of marriage or the unpredictability of the boho threesome, but his position remains clear. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is another in his persuasive arguments that love, for all the complexities and pain it throws up, is still worth chasing. And along with art, perhaps the only thing worth chasing. The performances of Bardem, Cruz, Johansson and Hall are delightfully inventive, with Cruz in particular relishing the tempestuous nature of Maria Elena and her tantrums.Vicky Christina may not be much in the long run but as it stand its a fun enjoyable fell-good romance movie with spectacular cinematography, sumptuous acting and a director that, for now, remains a one to watch. Allen has crafted a wry and thoughtful film about the peculiar stirrings of the heart, which is certainly his most accomplished piece of work since Match Point, and his funniest in the eight years since Small Time Crooks.Verdict: Believe the hype, Woody's back and better than ever with Vicky Christina Barcelona. While the territory is familiar, the terrain is new: Allen shoots his title city with an eye for its art and architecture and while undoubtedly forgettable, you'll have a blast watching it. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is so engaging so much of the time that it feels like a modest rejuvenation: evidence that a summer in Spain can do wonders for a writer-director who may not have outlived his prime. For my overall rating i give Vicky Christina Barcelona 4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
How to Ruin a Good Movie with Voice-over Narration,"Although I enjoyed ""VCB"" more than any of Woody's movies since, say, ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" I was stunned at the amount and sterility of the voice-over narration. I'm of the (widely-held) opinion that narration should be used on the rarest of occasions and sparingly when it is used. Not only is there way too much of here, for some reason Woody chose an actor with no character or familiarity at all. It was as if Woody instructed the theater managers to have a descriptive audio feature installed so the entire audience could hear...as if he'd made the movie for the blind! Voiceovers, if they're required, should neither explain what the action on screen is, nor what is going on inside the characters' heads. ""VCB"" fails on both counts. And it's a beautiful movie that's ruined by it! Here are three recent examples of well-done VO, IMHO: The Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (also starring Johannson, as it happens); Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby,"" which is responsible for the terrific payoff at the end; and Scorcese's ""The Age of Innocence."" (Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" is the perfect all-time example of VO.) The first two are VO's of characters within the film, while the third is by Joanne Woodward, whose work adds wonderful flavor and texture to the already sumptuous images without overwhelming them, and it helps keep the viewer within the time and period, bringing the voice of Edith Wharton herself voice to life. I'm knocking 3 points here because of ""VCB""'s poor use and uselessness.I suppose what fuels my displeasure more than a little bit is that I realize that Woody Allen has completely ""goyed"" himself; there's none of his wonderful Jewish witticisms and insights - and JOKES! - of his classic '70's/early '80's period. He's had WASP envy of rich Manhattanites for decades, from ""Interiors"" through ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" finally reaching full assimilation with ""Match Point."" ""VCB,"" even though it takes place in an exotic locale, proves that Woody is a full fledged WASP; you can't even tell he's on the outside looking in anymore! When I got home I had to watch ""Manhattan,"" which, after 30 years, is just as beautiful and engaging as it was when first released, and is one of the great romantic comedies of all time, even more so than ""Annie Hall"" (wait...maybe that's where the symptoms began, back in Chippewa Falls!]. Woody's VO at the beginning of ""Manhattan"" is describing the main character of the book he's trying to write: ""He romanticized New York all out of proportion..."" Woody Allen has succeeded in doing so with ""Barcelona."" The running joke in ""Stardust Memories"" was the complaint of Sandy Bates' (Woody) fans that he should make more movies like his ""earlier, funny ones."" My complaint: how 'bout making some more like his earlier, GOOD ones.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Really Really Really Good Film,"""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" skillfully intertwines music and narration to underscore the multifaceted nature of love, challenging the conventional confines of monogamy. The narrative deftly explores the intricate dynamics of attraction and choice, subtly highlighting the idea that genuine connection transcends societal norms. The delicate portrayal of Vicky's refusal to yield to a conventional approach to love, coupled with the evocative guitar sequences, adds a layer of depth to the storyline. Furthermore, the film adeptly addresses the reality of marriages where individuals might prioritize companionship and material benefits over affection, presenting a thought-provoking reflection of human complexities within the realm of modern romanceSome say the script was written by a 5 year old but they are denying that love doesn't solely exist in the dimension of Monogamy alone and it's different for everybody and also,it also wears out,to deny this reality is tantamount to foolishness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A critique on contemporary society,"I love this movie because shows undermined the foundations of the family in today's society, just like the Match Point. Life based on feelings,Lust and Inner desires... Woody Allen works admirably in this area. But the brilliance of Woody's work is limited to only a few films... Allen's works often involved his political and racial ideas and this is a drawback . This movie can be a challenge to the so-called betrayal. For example, We see a middle-aged woman who initially appeared to be committed to his wife and.... also end of movie. But the film can not be a perfect movie and there are some problems compared with a powerful film like Match point. Sense that while watching the film, the viewer is transported is a carnality sense, Instead of a sense of excitement that is necessary to movie. At the end of the comment, this is a good movie about family challenges and I suggest to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Whatever you choose in life it will be a compromise,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a hugely entertaining and pleasingly unpretentious film. Woody Allen has always directed female actors particularly well and he gets stunning performances from Rebecca Hall (Vicky), Scarlett Johansson (Cristina) and Penelope Cruz (Maria Elena). The fourth member of the m√©nage √† quatre, Javier Bardem as the Catalan artist Juan Antonio, is also very good indeed, as is the supporting cast.The film could have been pretentious and offensive twaddle in less assured hands than Allen's. Two beautiful young American women on holiday in Spain falling for the same mature Latin lover doesn't sound very original or engaging. But the contrast between the two young women is nicely drawn and rings true and the location shooting and the naturalistic dialogue adds to the authenticity of the story. The shock to the plot when Penelope's Cruz's Maria Elena storms in is at once both hilarious and frightening - but also convincing.Allen has an amusing gentle dig at self-satisfied middle-class America with his depiction of the dull as ditchwater Doug - Vicky's fianc√© (Chris Messina). I knew that I was going to hate him when I heard him call Vicky ""Babe"" - and I wasn't disappointed. As the movie unfolds the key question is whether Vicky will choose dull old Doug or exciting firebrand Juan Antonio as her partner. The former choice would almost certainly be for life - the latter probably not! When Woody Allen is at his best - and this film is very close to being in that category - it is satisfying and cerebral entertainment. The characters are not from a comic book but from real life and whilst a degree of poetic licence in the plot is necessary to move the story along it is never incredible. And as audience members we will empathise with the characters in a way that is much less possible in a more traditional Hollywood movie. We care about what happens to Vicky and Cristina because we like them and understand their dilemmas. They are serious and bright and attractive and real.Is there a deeper meaning to Vicky Cristina Barcelona than, just, the romance and the charm? Is it in any way a ""message"" movie? I think that to some degree it is - and that the message is to consider living every day with the thought somewhere in your mind that it might be your last - Juan Antonio says as much at one point. And, of course, it is also about the luxury of choice. To choose between alternative lifestyles, alternative partners, alternative compromises. Each choice is a compromise to some degree because perfection is not just elusive it is impossible - the question is how far short of the ideal will you have to settle for?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very significant waste of time,"This was the third Woody Allen movie I've watched, and so clearly I'm no Allen expert. However this film satisfies me that three is enough.This was an appalling film. The characters were 2-dimensional and uninteresting. I didn't care enough about Vicki or Cristina as characters to be interested about their relationships with each other or with Juan Antonio. The first half hour of the movie is annoyingly disjointed, as it is frequently punctuated by a very unnecessary American narrator, pointlessly telling us about who the characters are and what they're doing, instead of allowing us to understand them through an old-style technique called 'acting'.The character of Juan Antonio's wife spends the entire movie screaming, telling us more about Allen's own relationships with woman than about the characters in this film. And again, we don't care about her - we just wish she would shut up and go away. The only character that isn't 2-dimensional is Vicki's husband - he's so flat he's 1-dimensional. The term ""cookie cutter"" is used by the characters, and that could not be a more ironic description.The cinematography is lovely and there are some great shots of Catalanian architecture, including La Sagrada Familia (studied intensively by Vicki yet who still refers to it ignorantly as ""Gaudi's Church""). The script is recycled and the plot is uninspiring. The movie left me feeling emptiness and disappointment - please take this as a health warning and save your own time for something better.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The characters are so predictable and right of the bat we know who is going to deliver the drama, who will be comedic and who is going to be the tragic one - you just sit and wait anxiously for the bomb to explode, fantastic!. I was not entertained by the male protagonist but they rarely are.So Johansson is herself, the poor thing cannot act to save her life but she fits her pigeon-hole just fine, the British chick is cast as the annoying uptight sidekick and delivers on that front plus she is the real eye candy here not Johannson.The whole movie is stolen by Cruz, who is as hysterical, unpredictable as only the Spanish can, she has the charisma in buckets. One star less because we do not really see how beautiful Barcelona is and it is a big let down. Shame the city partially paid for the movie to be shot and it is not featured heavily, I would expect more.

"Love and Honesty, Existential Baggage and Self-Realization","THE ONLY BAD ELEMENTS OF THE MOVIE:o- The cigarettes. They took up too much of the emotional interactions, and tainted the nearly perfect scenery of a beautiful, difficult exploration of very tender sentiments with filth.o- The paintings composed by two of the main characters, Maria-Elena and Juan-Antonio. I suspect Woody Allen has the same opinion about that vacuous crap posing as ""modern art"", which is partly why Cristina's artwork is so much more profound, even though at the same time she's shown to be very insecure about it. I'm sad we only get to see very little of it, fleeting glimpses.o- The ending.THE REST OF THE MOVIE: It was great, though I have a really hard time forgiving the director for the ""bad elements"" described above! The way the movie was promoted when it first came out was terrible; it gave a really wrong impression through the promotional clips, ""coming attractions"", trailers, previews and posters: I vowed to boycott the movie for a few years and watch it only after the commercial and pseudo-intellectual fake excitement had passed.And so it happened. I'm really glad I watched it - the movie is MUCH better than anything I expected! One element I'm really happy with is that there's a male main character who's actually good for a change, a person to look up to: Juan-Antonio is gentle, cultivated, has real depth, is honest, caring, tender, and even handles tremendously difficult, potentially lethal situations, with emotional flexibility that's guided by true love.I'm sure that all the three main actresses will receive a lot of praise for portraying really well the primary characters who struggled with nearly impossible situations, handling them through very genuine personas.It was clear that all four of them worked hard to portray with as much immediacy as possible feelings and behaviours which are either entirely outside the range of ""acceptable normalcy"" or totally perverted by male-chauvinism. But Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem took on extra burdens: what the movie demanded of them was to convey and bring to the surface aspects of being that only people who have struggled deeply with themselves can do. This is not to say that Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall did not act well - on the contrary, they were great! - but their roles demanded only parts of their conventional self, what comes easily and naturally to them.I was really worried, before watching it, that the movie would have been an ode to the filthiest and sleaziest aspects of authoritarian and patriarchal perversions of male-chauvinist fantasy, ""prettified"" by Woody Allen into a pseudo-philosophical pretension. I'm so glad I was wrong! The movie really and honestly grapples with some of the most beautiful AND difficult aspects of polyamory - multifaceted relationships built on love, honesty and transparency - that it should probably be one of the first movies on the list of items for shared viewing and dialogue, especially for people who are new to the polyamory community.

It gives the impression it was made very fast and with no real interest. The story itself is not original and it's all about young rich Americans coming to the old country just to search for themselves (a story told so many times by so many). And mostly there 's no interest at all for Spanish culture, history and society. Barcelona becomes a small fantasy world. While this vision - a world whose borders are defined by the status of a middle class on the verge of extinction - worked perfectly in his early masterpieces of the seventies and eighties, here becomes flat, boring and mostly annoying. This can't be the real Allen! When is he coming back to tell the wonderful stories with which he has fascinated everybody? I want him back!",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annoying self righteous male chauvinism in again stylish Woody Allen film,"Since Annie Hall, Manhattan, Interiors, Hannah & Her Sisters I have always looked out for the next Woody Allen film; How he makes neuroticism hilarious, his insight in the dependency on self destructive relationships by people you expect to know better (the intelligent, intellectual kind) and the beautiful, stylish sets where all the issues take place, really take my fancy. Together with the decor of beautiful and smoldering Barcelona I treated myself to this film. The only bad thing about Woody Allen's latest movies I find the casting. In lack of Kate Winslet he chose Scarlett Johansson who I am totally allergic to since I saw her in The Horse Whisperer, because she keeps looking and acting like a six year old. I'm sure she's every man's wet dream with her over-the-top flirtatious platinum presence, but if I were a man I'd find Penelope Cruz brave ""don't bullshit me!""-attitude a lot more appealing. She's a real challenge and I like her style! Javier Bardem is the totally annoying self righteous, assumptuous male chauvinist with an attitude like he is ""Gods gift to women"". I could totally relate to Vicky's reaction like ""Oh pulease... take your phony act and ass elsewhere."" (Too bad she gave into him all of a sudden, because you don't grant that creep such victory.) But... I loved the art he made! (Wonder what artist made those paintings for this movie?...) Pretty entertaining movie with good insight of people's sometimes so-unlike-their-character actions. Once you have hit your nose that hard you know how to stay away from men like Bardem and see in the future 'TROUBLE!!!' written all over their forehead...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably one of the best feel-good-movies,"For some reason I felt like living on the wrong place on earth, after I had watched this awesome movie. Woody Allen, who is far away from being my favorite director, has created here an unconventional love story that might not gets under your skin all the time, but teaches some good lessons about love and its diversity.The main cast makes a fantastic job. The trio, consisting out of Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Pen√©lope Cruz, who has also won an Oscar for her role in this flick, is absolutely lovely as a group of rival women. Javier Bardem, who has already proofed that he is a great actor in ""No Country for Old Men"", gives us an extroverted Spanish artist, who enjoys spending his lifetime with various women.The beautiful shots of Barcelona and its countryside and the perfectly chosen music create an intense feeling of traveling to Spain again.The dialogues are diversifiedly written and filled with comedic nuances that makes the film at any moment diverting. Allen also dares to use a lot of Spanish dialogues in here, so the movie is getting more authentic.Compared with all the best films in this world, it might be not outstanding, but absolutely unique in its message about love and creative way of introducing a country.So if you are searching for a light entertainment, I would necessarily recommend ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"".Excuse me for my not so good English.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stylish and beautiful,"To call it a masterpiece or a Woody Allen classic would be a major stretch. What it is is a satisfying and fitting conclusion to Woody's European vacation from himself, which started with Match Point and continued with Scoop and Cassandra's Dream. Its major weakness is that it's simply not a Woody Allen original, but a homage to cinema that he loves. For that reason it still feels less authentic to me than even the more mediocre of his classic pieces. But considering the staleness of some of his recent New York movies, I feel he did the right thing by taking this much needed break. And having recently seen the wonderful Whatever Works, I'd say that it worked and he's now ready to return to 'real' Woody Allen films.That's not to say that Vicky Cristina Barcelona is not an effective and entertaining film by its own right. It's sensual and emotional like few of his movies ever were, and it's incredibly beautiful. A lot of the credit should go to the actors. Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson, both among my favorite actors, do a commendable job, but Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall are the real surprises here, and they're the ones who really dominate the movie. With phenomenal acting like that, coupled with sharp dialog and beautiful cinematography, it's a very enjoyable, though somewhat forgettable watch - despite some flaws like the narration and annoying music.On a side note - while stylistically little of what goes on here is original Woody Allen, his themes are all over, and it's no accident that the phrase 'whatever works' slips out of Rebecca Hall's mouth - the connection to the film that has that title is obvious. Knowing now that Whatever Works was a script in work for over a decade, it's conceivable that Woody decided to lead up to it in this more escapist film. Viewing both films as a double-feature, it's easy to conceive it to be another attempt from Woody - as he did try (successfully) in Crimes and Misdemeanors and (not successfully) Melinda and Melinda - to tell the same tale twice, as a comedy and as a tragedy. And viewed like that, it almost actually works.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh My God - Did Woody get paid for this tripe?,"I've just sat down to watch this movie, with an open and mind and a degree of excitement.

Don't waste your time its 90+ minutes of your life you will not get back! EVER!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is not a sad movie,"It's awesome how Allen achieves to display such sad, intense, and disturbing plot as a light and even curious turn of events. I personally disagree in labeling this movie as a sad one. Even though we can find polygamist relationships and a lot of insanity it's easy to identify with all four of the characters at at some point.The result: we can find ourselves comfortable with a natural search for stability. Confortable with jealousness and desire of monogamy. Confortable with the need of passion in life brought by new feelings and experiences. Enchanting and infinite number of possible combinations can be made from this characters.We won't find as much great long dialogues as we can in other Allen's films. However we'll end up loving the description of Barcelona and the attempt of falling for the ""Catalan Identity"" through the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

the trials and tribulations of the rich and beautiful,"In his latest romantic escapade, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen, that wry purveyor of modern relationships, turns sexiness into a purely aesthetic experience. Of course, that's not all that hard to do when you have a cast of drop-dead gorgeous actors exploring the fine art of love and lovemaking in a drop-dead gorgeous setting.The two main women in the story represent diametrically opposed views of love and men. Vicky is the clear-thinking pragmatist who, when it comes to the opposite sex, opts for the stodgy and reliable type over the dashing romantic ideal - a preference reflected in her choice of fianc√©, the stuffed-shirt Doug, whose dutiful dullness makes him a perfect fit for Vicky's middlebrow conception of domestic bliss. Cristina, on the other hand, fancies herself more as the free-living Bohemian type, a gifted amateur photographer who prefers the more ""dangerous"" breed of man - one whose propensity for living life in the moment simmers just beneath the surface of a handsome appearance and smoldering sexuality.When they travel to Spain for the summer, the two best friends almost immediately find themselves entangled in a complex romantic relationship with Juan Antonio, an abstract painter who inflames the women with his cultured temperament, his devil-may-care attitude, his smooth-talking ways, his raw animal magnetism and his Old World passion for life. And as if all that weren't enough, we get a fourth ingredient added to the already spicy brew: Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's beautiful, volatile and possibly mentally unbalanced ex-wife whom the artist has clearly never gotten over - and apparently never will.As always, Allen achieves a remarkable complexity both in his characters and in his view of how romantic and sexual attraction actually work. This is reflected most intensely in the character of Vicky who, after a brief but sizzling encounter with Juan Antonio, comes to question her old willingness to settle for staid conformity and emotional security over all-consuming passion and romance. This, of course, puts her whole future marriage in jeopardy as well as her friendship with Cristina, once the latter becomes the live-in lover of Juan Antonio. But Cristina has problems of her own to contend with when an emotionally distraught Maria Elena pops up unexpectedly, taking up residence with the newly formed couple in Juan Antonio's home. With each additional twist of the plot, Allen brings new color and depth to his canvas, as now the complexities of Juan Antonio and Maria Elena's self-destructive love/hate relationship suddenly come racing to the fore.At times the emotions are so raw and close to the bone - and the truths about human relationships so pinpoint in their accuracy - that the movie becomes almost unbearable to sit through. Or at least it would if the tone itself weren't so consistently scintillating and lighthearted and the setting so eye-popping and sensuous. In fact, I predict that Barcelona - so richly photographed here by Javier Aguirresarobe -will be experiencing a tourism boom for years to come thanks to this film.Although it was Penelope Cruz who earned a number of awards (including the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress) for her work as Maria Elena, all the actors in this film - Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson and Chris Messina - deliver rich, outstanding performances. And it may just be me, but the singsong, deliberately simplistic narration that Allen has attached to the story appears to be an homage of sorts to Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim,"" probably the most famous romantic roundelay ever committed to film.The conclusion ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" seems to come to is that NEITHER approach to love really works in the long run - that while too little passion in a relationship may lead to a life of endless regrets over unrealized possibilities, too much passion can result in burnout, serial infidelity and mutual self-destruction for the individuals involved.Perhaps, Friar Lawrence's advice to the impetuous Romeo and Juliet - ""Therefore, love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow"" - was right after all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Open Letter to Woody Allen,"Dear Mr. Allen: While I struggled to watch your movie, which cost me a certain amount of money and time, I could not help but arrive at this thought: maybe it is time for you to retire. I don't say this lightly. After all, you are fully entitled to continue pursuing your career but if you do, try not to duplicate this ponderous, pretentious clunker that was trying to make some kind of statement about people and relationships and life, but winds up just feeding the audience a bunch of pseudo-philosophical mush. If you're going to tell a story, at least try to make it interesting and ease off on the use of narratives. The characters in this story are uninteresting, uninspiring and unlikable and if you were trying to create another Sideways for women, it does not work. Your movie lacks the freshness and zest that made Sideways so wonderful. Relationships come and go, people are fickle and confused and are chronically wanting more to fill in the emptiness. We already know that and you don't have you take it upon yourself to try to drive these points home because frankly who can like a movie that goes out of its way to make people feel sad.Also, your movie deals with issues such as marital infidelity, mental illness, cultural conflict and anger but does so in such a heavy-handed and pedestrian way that by the time the movie is over ... and in this movie time drags ... nothing has been resolved, everything is a mess, the characters go on with their lives and the conflicts persist. The American men are portrayed as vacuous wimps, the Spanish man as a cloddish fool, his ex-wife as a shrieking banshee and the American women as weak, suggestive dummies. Wow, what a movie! So Mr. Allen, please don't make another movie like this. Do a remake of Play It Again Sam instead.By the way, your movie causes me to wonder whether you ever watched the movie For Whom The Bells Toll with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. This movie is also set in Spain but unlike your movie, the characters, especially the women, are strong and resourceful. Or let's contrast the mushy characters in your movie with those found in Double Indemnity or Mildred Pierce. Mr. Allen, please ... Please ... PLEASE do not make another movie like Vicky Christina Barcelona. All you are doing is perpetuating groundless stereotypes that are not funny.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Why does Woody Allen have his actors do Woody Allen imitations?,"Very entertaining film. And, yes, it IS breezy summer entertainment"". As for the person who said that it is ""boring and lackluster writing"", all I can conclude is that you are insensitive and not very bright. It is a ROMANTIC piece, with original and insightful writing. I DO agree that the ""speak in English"" over and over was a bit annoying. Woody Allen certainly has a few flaws.The main thing that bothers me that I notice in most Woody Allen films is the actors doing a Woody Allen imitation. It really stands out for me. Why is it that no one else notices this? Both Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) do it very noticeably - especially Vicky. They stutter and stammer and over-analyze exactly like him. Does he direct them specifically to do this? I have seen this in several of his films. Weird.Aside from this, I really liked this film. It was a nice exotic Summer escape for the viewer just as it was for the two girls living out a Summer fantasy in Spain.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody get's back to making boring and meaningless films,"I was interested to see Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Woody Allen had made such a good film previously with Scarlett Johansson and I was hoping to see same level of excellence that I experienced in Match Point. All my expectations were crushed when I saw this meaningless and empty drama about stereotypical people and their boringly predictable relationships.Actors were fine - all of them. Problem is in the script. Allen seems to write movies as someone writes TV-series. Easily sketched empty characters in an exotic location experiencing some tacky romance - and the torture ends only when the main characters has been ""in love"" (had sex) at least with two other characters. Allen almost always writes love triangle and most times fails to express some deeper meaning through the life of main character. Some writer from the 'Bold and the Beautiful' could have made the script for Vicky Cristina Barcelona.Woody Allen makes a film in a year - for some incomprehensible reason. He's making films on a conveyor belt and that is reflected to the quality of those films. I hope he would stop for a while and concentrate more on the quality of the script.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody in Europe,"Allen's love letter to Barcelona finds now elderly director transported in a place completely different from his beloved New York and enjoying a romance with this magical town. Shots and characters are ""typical Woody Allen"" but it all have a new, spicy, Spanish flavor - no wonder, because it is one of the most intoxicating places I have ever visited, there is a strong atmosphere here unlike anything one might encounter elsewhere, be it architecture, history, people or simply combination of it all.The interplay between two American tourists (Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall) and magnetic local couple who can't live with or without each other is pure Allen that reminds me on his previous movies (""Hannah and her sisters"" for example) where close group of people live, love and hate surrounded with class, privilege and comfort - no one seriously works here, its all talk, wine sipping, artistic friends and pursuit of pleasure. Ah yes, this is Spain so we get classical guitar, poetry, paintings and lots of Gaudi. Nothing wrong with that, except that in its heart this is still a tourist's impression of Barcelona - no wonder that work of local directors like Almod√≥var, who are inspired with dirt, sweat and blood strikes me as being far closer to home. Allen's world is a different one and he is not interested in anything so prosaic as ordinary people who can't afford to simply flight a plane to Oviedo on a whim.Javier Bardem and Pen√©lope Cruz are both excellent, true heart and soul of this movie. None of their American colleagues come close to their passion, charisma and presence. Perhaps it was not Allen's intention but where his American expatriates relocated in Barcelona appear spoiled and bored, it is locals who are grounded, firm and determined. However, it is very enjoyable to see director so inspired by new locations and I only wish him to live a hundred more years and making movies around the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remarkably Entertaining,"I just watched this movie yesterday the first time. It's most entertaining ever. I like Woody's movies without Woody in them. It's somehow an oxymoron. However, I feel he did better jobs as a director when he's not acting. I don't like intense romance stories. This one has right amount dramas. Recently, I watched Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"". I fell in love with her works and started reading her books. I think when writers left some room for readers to imagine is a more desirable approach. Movies used to sell fantasies to audience. Now they resonate with people. I will say I like them better now than then. Happy endings might be working but we need to be inspired sometimes.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good for the first 10-minutes, then................","Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) get involved with Juan (Bardem) who is still involved with his ex-wife Maria (Cruz).In the beginning of this, Juan comes over to the table where Vicky and Christina are and asks them to go to some Spanish island, see some sights, have some good meals and make love also. Cristina is game, but Vicky is not, but the point here is the dialogue that took place in this exchange was the best give and take in any movie that I have heard in a long time. And,I thought: Woody is back.But, like a lot of comedies where the best stuff is in the beginning and then peters out as the movie goes on, the same thing happened here. If there was comedy or good lines later on, I missed them all or they went over my head (could happen). It turned out to be another TV soap opera and I lost interest. Woody was back only for the first 10-minutes of this movie. After that there was no hook and he gave up.Whoa! I lost interest only because of the story, not because of the stars like Ms. Johansson, Ms Hall (kind of looks like Scarlett ), and of course, Ms. Cruz. The acting by them and all others was fine. Mr. Bardem will be another Benicio Del Toro given better scripts. Mark my words.But, after that stirring exchange in the first 10-minutes when Juan introduced himself to Vicky and Cristina, the story petered out as did everything else and I was waiting for this to be over.

Vicky Cristina Bedazzling,"The two (make that three) female leads in this movie are absolutely must-see to-die-for gorgeous. Rebecca Hall shines engagingly as conservative Vicky. She absolutely rules! THe part written for Scarlett takes a while to pick up, and I was initially, during the first half, surprised that she would have bothered to play this much smaller role than her co-star. But then it does change. As for Penelope Cruz, she is of course great, although her character is grating most of the time.Immediately off-putting though, was that cheap effect, the voice-over narrative. Bad idea. Could have been avoided. I suspect it is an editing trick to make the movie run faster, which of course works, but is really, really lame, and from an experienced director? No!My other gripe is the weak ending. Come on, did the film crew overstay their welcome in Barcelona? Did their visas run out? No more film? Woody ate something bad? Budget cuts? So they just packed up and left, Game Over, The End? Had a Part 2 in mind, but nothing came of it?As far as visual attractiveness go, movie is tops. But script fizzled out. I think most people would agree that it had a great start but did not live up to expectations as story progressed.I would encourage everybody to see it, despite its flaws. It is ultimately charming and very realistic.And, I am not one of those chronically dissatisfied people, with reference to the dialog by Maria Elena, I just had to point out that this one isn't quite as perfect as it promised to be coming out of the gate with that wonderful, wonderful scene where Juan introduces himself to Vicky and Cristina as a suitor for a threesome.

A glorious film which truly delivers.,"Woody Allen has never been at the top of my directors. However, after watching Vicky Christina Barcelona - I was blown away. The glorious cinematography in beautiful Barcelona captivated me, and so did the unique, strange and mind-bending plot which left me unknown of where I was going and what was going to happen. Absolutely un-predictable.Three leading ladies, and a sexy hero as a lead makes the film even more enjoyable. The believable performances by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson made the film sexy and relatable. The seductive Javier Bardem gives a gorgeous performance, which left me captivated and hypnotized. But all the attention goes rightfully to the beautiful Penelope Cruz who gave the performance of a life-time, as a troubled ex-wife. Her portrayal was haunting and fabulous, and her presence made the film beautifully odd and dark. Her Oscar-win was deserved.Many criticize the film for having no 'plot', but I do not agree. The film is triumphant in telling the story of what love is and the different challenges with it. It is by no means a romance, and I myself find it difficult to classify the film - but isn't that part of its beauty? Woody Allen created such a dysfunctional work of art that has left many wondering what the film is. The power to do this proves the films brilliance.Vicky Christina Barcelona is a glorious film which truly delivers. The haunting performances, stunning scenery and captivating story-line makes this one of the juiciest films 2008 had to offer. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

But I just saw the movie in 2022, so maybe it's just the movie doesn't age well? Maybe if I seen it when it first come out it wouldn't be this bad?One thing I know that they should've done is to hire a better narrator!!! The voice is not good, the tone was boring and not engaged, sounded like he's rushing through the line and simply didn't want to be there.Anyway... it was interesting to watch the film but as someone who would watch movies more than once, this one I think watch once is more than enough.They also put this under comedy genre...

Don't expect anything!,"People are complaining about this movie and I think it has something to do with their expectations. I've read reviews saying something about Woody and romance. If you're searching for that don't search here. This movie isn't romantic and Rom-com is hardly fitting for it. It's an intense drama done in a really lighthearted way (it is also a comedy although it's subtle and the laughs are few but well placed) and it works without denying the depth of the drama and that's why this movie is charming: A great script with some great lines, an outstanding cast with 4 very strong performances in the center (yes 4!) and some good capturing of Spain through the photography. It makes you think but while it's very serious in the core it's quite uplifting. The movie could have been negative so easily but it delivers through the right atmosphere.You should probably watch this movie if you like more subtle comedies and appreciate some depth in theme and a good approach to it.This is not one of Allen's best but it's a good one and you should absolutely watch it if you're a fan of his.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Upon what do we build our deceptions of love and happiness?,"Okay, let's agree: there's a lot of baggage the comes with watching Woody Allen films.That out of the way, this jewel of a movie continues Allen's ""postcards"" movies (Manhattan, To Rome with Love, Midnight in Paris, etc) that use the settings as an additional character, and as with the others, he makes them appear to be the sort of place we would like to visit.Beyond that, I love ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona;"" the characters are drawn intimately and played to perfection by the actors. The plot is almost irrelevant, but the story blooming from the plot is beautifully-paced and edited. There is no one here unlikeable, of course (this is consistent with Allen's filmic style), but three marriages which have an inborn itch (and only in one marriage do both parties realize the emotional devastation they are visiting on each other).Vicky is marrying into boredom, a fate which frightens Cristina; Judy is stuck in a vision of her life dissipating unhappily into the mist.Final note: does anyone ever have financial difficulties in any Woody Allen Film?

Woody Allen hates women,"As a man who married his own daughter, Woody Allen is not someone whose views on women one would want to feel comfortable agreeing with. Finding contempt with his opinions is made easy by this astonishingly juvenile movie in which he attempts to make us believe that he is celebrating the complexity and variety of women and their needs, wants, and passions, but ends up painting all four women in the story as exactly the same. All women, according to this movie, are eternally discontent, unsatisfied with any semblance of stability or balance, and crave only danger and chaos, whether secretly or openly, whether they live it or just dream of living it but don't dare. It is a disturbing all-the-same-once-you-scratch-the-surface view of half the human race that is matched only by his similar one dimensional portrayal of Europeans (i.e. non-Americans). They're all the same aren't they - but they're not like ""us' so who can figure 'em out? Hey that's a great basis for a comedy. Isn't it? A sick movie by a sick man.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona was a pretty intellectually stimulating movie,"I'm usually more a fan of Woody Allen's earlier work when he was very much of a funnyman than his later ones when he seems more serious in his intent. So it is with that in mind that I found this one, about two American women (Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson) who found themselves in Spain and end up encountering a painter (Javier Bardem) who has an ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), pretty enthralling throughout but also feeling a bit detached since while I was expecting a comedy, I didn't expect-and didn't get-too much laughs. It was fascinating listening to all the Allen-esque dialogue and getting what he was intending so on that front, it was pretty entertaining. So on that note, Vicky Christina Barcelona is worth a look. P.S. I recognized one of the players, Chris Messina, as currently being in the TV series, ""The Mindy Project"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Wody Allen,"I like his way of narrating the story. Very abnormal, unhealthy, and complicated relationship but telling it with no embellishment and exaggeration and too calmly to be not funny.

The way he uses the setting, Barcelona.. he captures the essence of the city and gives the chance for audience to appreciate it from far away.

Can fluff sink like a stone?,"Each Woody Allen film seems to be worse than its predecessor, and this one continues the free-fall - although nothing could ever be quite so appalling as ""Scoop"". In this example, we find the city of Barcelona resembling a glossy 1960's travelogue with an annoying voice-over droning endlessly about the shallow dilemmas of a collection of characters plucked from some back-lot limbo of romance-fiction rejects.The plot (such as it is) tells the story of a suave, tormented artist, Juan, attired in his Playboy-approved red satin shirt, who sets about luring two American nymphets into his bed. Unfortunately for these vapid young women, Juan is still emotionally involved with his ex-wife, Maria, who is portrayed as a stereotypical Latina spitfire with suicidal impulses. Nothing much that approaches drama, comedy or interest occurs during the film, which allows an audience to focus on the characters - or lack of them. Women should be justifiably incensed by the portrayal of Allen's females as silly, self-absorbed, easily-manipulated neurotics - but 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' is an equal-opportunity disaster - the self-entitlement and pomposity of the male characters makes them even more unlikable.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vicky Christina Barcelona - A Woody Allen Classic powered by Pen√©lope Cruz,"""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is a film by Woody Allen about Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), who spend a summer in Barcelona where they meet an artist, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who is attracted to both of them while still in love with his unstable ex-wife Mar√≠a Elena (Pen√©lope Cruz).Allen really convinced me with the main plot, bringing in plot twists, funny, quirky and realistic dialogue. While I loved the idea of the two main characters, there was just something missing. I have to pin that on Allen's character writing, which usually is the best of the best. But the two supporting characters Juan Antonio and Mar√≠a Elena both had beautiful, complex characteristics written on them.Johansson and Hall's chemistry was magnificent, evene when hey were not in scenes together. There was not a second where I didn't believe they were best Friends. But when Cruz entered the picture, I was overwhelmed. Her ability to portray a character so convincing and so real, even if you don't understand a single word she says, as she only speaks Spanish in the movie is scary. Bardem and Cruz's chemistry is extraordinary, thanks to both of their truly great acting skills. The Plot is very well thought out and Allen proves his ability to write Rom-Com's once again.Overall this movie is a well written and thought out film by Woody Allen with incomparable acting by Bardem and the great Pen√©lope Cruz.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Male day dream land, in L.A. by the Med.","I loved this, it revolved around the relationship of Juan and Maria, an art couple from hell. Fantatastic to watch, just dodge those flying bullets, just as well it wasn't 3d.I know it's not supposed be about them, it's about a couple of girls spending their summer in Barcelona. Barca looks great, but why fly 3,000 miles, to a city by the sea with mountains behind, where they speak Spanish, when you could have gone to L.A.?The films does give the impression that American go round the world in their own bubble and don't engage. This for me was a problem, at the end of the story Spain was a mess and America had completed their plans regardless of the personal cost. There was no arc of transition for the American characters, they arrived fully formed and left that way.I didn't care that much about the lack of arc, just glad that I had met Juan and Maria.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Allen goes to Spain- with two American women,"Vicky and Cristina are two American women who spend some time in Bracelona in the summer.There they meet an artist called Juan Antonio Gonzalo, who wants to take them to Oviedo.There the three of them could make love, among other things.Vicky, who is getting married to Doug, could never imagine doing such a thing with a stranger.But Cristina is first in line to go to Oviedo with this man.But soon also Vicky finds herself in the small plane to spend a weekend with this man.Cristina becomes sick, so it's Vicky who gets to spend some time with Juan.And she finds herself falling for him.But Juan also has a bad-tempered ex-wife called Mar√≠a Elena, who has stabbed him.Cristina, after feeling better, finds herself living with both Juan and Mar√≠a Elena.So things get pretty hot soon.In Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) Woody Allen takes us to Spain.And he has gathered a great cast with him.Pen√©lope Cruz plays Mar√≠a Elena.Scarlett Johansson portrays Cristina while Rebecca Hall plays Vicky.Javier Bardem plays the part of Juan Antonio.Chris Messina is Doug.Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn play the parts of Judy and Mark Nash.Pablo Schreiber is Ben.Christopher Evan Welch works as Narrator.I've seen Allen doing better than this.As a comedy it doesn't work.It simply doesn't make me laugh.But the drama works much better.It portrays these American women as psychological beings, who do some searching of themselves.The movie has some memorable stuff, not only the kiss between Scarlett and Pen√©lope.And the dialogue is very Allen.So Woody has made a pretty successful trip to Spain.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A rare Woody Allen film that wasn't for me,"Let me start with what I liked about this movie. I liked the sexual tension that the movie had and every actor played their respective character extremely well. I loved the dialogue even though at times it seemed a little much. The camera movement and angles were fantastic and I've always loved how Woody uses the city (no matter which city) and its landmarks to the point where they become a character in its own right.What I disliked about the film was the narration. I like narration when it gives an extra insight to a singular character(s) but I don't like narration to be used to tell me the story as if it was a book. To me, that is taking the easy way out of making a film and it tends to cheapen the actors skill in telling the story through the characters. The narration I feel makes the characters interactions feel almost like filler. I didn't like the introduction of Vicky's classmate character who gets the wrong impression about their spending time together. That character offered nothing to the plot or to any development of Vicky's character. Even Vicky's husband, played by Chris Messina, I felt wasn't used properly. I didn't hate Vicky for her indiscretions and nor did I hope they would remain happily married once she made up her mind. I was left very complacent about the characters.I felt very disappointed in this movie because I wanted to love it. I wanted it to be the next Woody Allen film that I would really love but was very disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

It isn't clear why, other than to include scenes of Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem fighting in Spanish. Allen's habitual, relentless claustrophia remains as present as ever, though, and we barely ever get out of a house, a room, a tight shot on a stilted conversation.

Treading water,"Two young American women, a lusty Spanish artist. A love triangle.With Vicky Christina Barcelona, Woody investigates some common conceptions (and preconceptions) about love, and why it's more about balance than numbers. While consistently interesting, some might find its quirks annoying. For one thing, a narrator intrudes on the story at regular intervals, as if needing to explain the plot and the characters. It's a common- enough device, but in VCB, it comes in the place of deft exposition. It's what many hack directors do when the film in the can isn't enough to make the film lucid. In a film with constant references to art, it reminds one of the various European features that present their stories only through dialog and acting.The two female leads, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen, put in good performances, but they would have been so much more effective if they could rely on conveying the plot through their acting.By explaining everything as it goes along, the story itself becomes rather predictable The narrator hints at an exchange that will later become significant; instead of being surprised by the plot turn, there's almost a feeling that there are so few dramatic moments that the narrator has to nudge us awake for the subtleties.It's one of Woody Allen's worst faults - trying to explain everything. At least in VCB, the characters have unique voices (unlike the director's 80s and 90s dramas where they'd all sound like the same person).VCB is competent, with good acting, but basically unspecial.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't waste your time - Woody Allen talks to himself through dull characters. The End,"Woody Allen has created some great work throughout his career. This however doesn't fall into that decreasing category. It is an altogether boring, self indulgent piece filled with characters that speak in the same voice. No one has anything close to resembling an arc or development and every central character ends up exactly where they started having learnt nothing from their experiences. One might call that a spoiler however there is nothing to spoil as nothing happens of consequence. It is completely flat and uninspired. Even a decent (but not Oscar worthy in my opinion) performance from Penelope Cruz can't save this film from itself. If you want to see Penelope Cruz turn in a good performance you can go anywhere else and get an all around better experience. Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty awful miscasting by Woody.,"Really disappointing, shocked that this film managed to recoup its budget.I watched this film and kept hoping that something would happen it never did.Another serious miscasting did not help, only Woody could pick someone as unattractive as Javier to be the object of so many beautiful womens desires. Was there no one like Johhny Depp, Brad Pitt or someone plausible to pick. Now I know that there will be plenty of middle aged women who will be swooning over Javier to most men he still looks like the creepy guy out of No Country for Old Men. Woody would have been better off casting himself as the romantic lead at least there would have been a bit of comedic Gonzo value to this dross.Only in Television land and in the movies would this plot be plausible, I hope when I reach the end of my days I do not think of all the movies that I wasted part of my life watching, because this would be near the top of the list.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

could have done better,"I think this movie is like one of those shrimp flavored chips they sell in Asian food markets. Tasty but lacking in substance.First some good points. I was watching this with a European traveler friend who identified a lot of the background as actually being of Spain as opposed to being budget filmed in Canada. The cinematography is excellent and did I mention 3 of the hottest women of our era? For fans of Woody Allen movies, this is nothing new. Scarlett Johansson who appeared in Matchpoint a couple years ago reprises her role as the third wheel in relationships. Perhaps I've been jaded by too many Woody flicks, but it seems the whole debacle of adultery and dissatisfaction with one's lot becomes a bit repetitive. I'm walking into the movie knowing full well that there is only one twist--what happens at the end.Of course, this movie's also boasts that are 3 lovely women involved and one guy becomes the lucky stiff, but the triangle/quadrilateral never quite materializes because there is no real tension between Cristina and Vicky. Penelope Cruz was a standout in playing a neurotic psycho ex-gf but other than a titillating threesome, fails to inject any real conflict into the relationship.This brings to mind another failing of the movie which I'm sure most males would agree with-- three lovely women. Come on Woody, is the best you can do a PG-13 movie? Seriously with all the infidelity and lust and sexual innuendos, is it asking too much for some boobies? I'm not a thirteen year old who's never seen naughty parts (and certainly if I needed to I'd watch Bikini Surfboard Vampires) but it detracts from the immersion--in this case escapism-- of the the movie when you're trying to imagine that a shaky closeup is tantamount to a passionate love-fest.At the same time in the other direction, this movie doesn't leave much to the imagination. Unlike other Woody films, I don't know why this one necessitates a narrator. In Annie Hall, we get some interesting voice-over insights but this narrator seems shallow and patronizing--telling the audience such obvious trivialities as ""they(Vicky and male interest) had a good time"" after showing them having a sight-seeing session together. As far as I'm concerned, the only time to break the ""show and don't tell"" rule is if you're doing a documentary.It's a shame that Allen has painted himself into a corner of such niche films because he certainly could do better.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film of absolutely no consequence.,"Dear Woody AllenDo you remember ""Bananas""in 1971? I reckon that was perhaps your last film to offer at least some entertainment and a few laughs.Your offering here is beyond embarrassing. Just why, why, why did you feel a need to make this film? It is not funny, it does not entertain, there are no insights, it has no depth, it shows us nothing we have not seen many times before, it mostly doesn't even look good, despite being set in great Barcelona. It is not a comedy, it is not a drama, but it surely is the most lazy piece of film-making I had the misfortune to watch in a long time. And the voice-over is so incessant that one is almost surprised that you have managed to fit in the occasional actual dialogue and movie 'scene'. If you really need this much voice-over to tell your story (well, what banal story there is), perhaps you would be better served trying a radio-play next time - or perhaps only one angle directly on you just reading the script straight to camera. Having said that, there is the odd moment in the arguments between semi-exes Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem when the air just crackles - I suspect this has little to do with your direction or script, but is an indication of what fantastic actor and actress they can be. It puzzles me that you still manage to attract such gifted people to your puny projects. As it is, this film is utterly hollow and simply cringe-worthy.Please do us all a favour and retire from film-making soon, surely you don't need the money anymore and I certainly can't see that you feel driven as an 'artist'. Listen to your therapist, go on a cruise, take a girl somewhere, drink a long, long cocktail, but spare us your puerile, pubescent and badly made fantasies.

Book on Screen,"Woody Allen has lost all conception of subtlety. He is a great writer, but a poor film maker in this case. This movie is a book on screen (in the sense of being a sort of book-on-tape). You are narrated almost every aspect of what should be visually shown. The point of a good movie is not to be told what is happening, it should be seen by the subtle nuances of an actor's performance. To add insult to injury, the narrator's voice is out-of-place and distracting; it recalls you constantly to your own position as a spectator, preventing you from becoming as entranced as you should be by the spectacular performance of an all-star cast. I have no doubt that some pseudo-intellectual will criticize this critique by claiming it ignores the depth or concepts explored by the film, concepts which I wholly admit are intriguing and worth the time spent to explore, but my criticism is not directed to the ideas surveyed. I do not hesitate to say that the script must read as an insightful reflection of life and love by a man with obvious experience in both, but do not placate criticisms of this film based on some nostalgic respect for the old Woody Allen, whose previous movies have earned that respect of their own merit. Consider this independently and those rose-coloured contacts melt-away to reveal what is left¬Ö a poor visual adaptation of a brilliant script.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

An emotionally unstable man who unlike the three women, is the one who doesn't know what he's looking for.I find it pathetic and Woody Allen once again displays his old fashioned views on matters of the heart.At the same time I find the plot quite interesting and empathize with each character's concerns about their moral compass, as well as their misgivings about how far their limits can go.

Sunk by the voice-over!,"I'll put up with almost anything from Woody Allen, but the atrocity of the voice-over sinks this film beyond redemption for me, that plus the lazy ""tourist fiction"" treatment of Barcelona.This is a pity, because the dialog is great, the acting good and the cinematography wonderful. Penelope Cruz deserves her Oscar and Scarlett Johansen's young female version of Woody (complete with ulcers for goodness sake) is priceless!But the script background detail seems to have come entirely from the Barcelona half-page in one of those ""Europe in a week"" guides ‚Äì Vicky studies the architecture of Gaudi and ""Catalan identity"", Juan Antonio paints like a cut rate Miro (while Maria Elena paints rather good Miro pastiche, a nice touch), Juan Antonio's poet father seems to be Lorca if he had survived the firing squad.Now, about that voice-over! My theory is it was written by Woody's lawyer and voice-acted by his orthodontist. Half of it is telling us what we can plainly see on the screen whilst the other half annoyingly and tritely tells us what the characters are thinking. Put a little more faith in your actors and your audience Woody!I cannot resist some quotes:""Lunch was served on the terrace"" - over a shot of a terrace with people eating a meal while the sun is high in the sky.""Vicky met her fianc√© at the airport"" - over a beautifully framed shot of Vicky hugging a guy with suitcases (with whom we've just seen her make wedding plans on the phone) in a big glass building with airliners maneuvering in the background.""Cristina, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena went riding in the country"" ‚Äì shot of three familiar people riding bikes down a country lane.""Judy's plans to save Vicky from her fate were put on terminal hold."" - Come on, either they were terminated or they were put on hold, it cannot be both ‚Äì was this doggerel even edited?The first time I watched this film I genuinely thought I'd accidentally engaged the audio description for people with visual impairment!

Beautiful and Vacant,"The first part of the film is a smash, but the whole thing rapidly falls apart. The story is simply not credible and the way the characters are drawn is even worse. I have always had mixed opinions about Woody Allen. I thought Hanna and Her Sisters was brilliant, but the weakness in Allen's films I think is the writing which is why I generally do not care for his work. He was a stand up comic after all - hardly an Ingmar Bergman. And therein lies the rub - Allen always scratches the surface of life the way a stand up comic does - he simply cannot get into the core of life the way Bergman does because Bergman is an artist and Allen will always be a stand up comic. There were so many things that annoyed me about this film that it would be pointless to list them here, but it is classic Allen - vapid and inane but great to look at and wonderful to hear (the music).",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Anton Chigurth was more likable than Juan Antonio,"I admit I watched this to see Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz but this film pretty much portrays their characters as weak, impulsive and in Cruz' case...psychotic.Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem who I also like) was a user and manipulator, I know it's a chick flick and maybe women get off on his lusty, artistic, peasant persona but he was a user and quite immature, I didn't connect his actions at all with artistic as being the reason for his lifestyle. He was just a louse. I saw it immediately in his first scene.What was Allen's point? The ending makes it appear both Johansson and Hall were left as unhappy people due to J. A. Did Allen have some need to punish them for their infidelities and poor choices? Was he trying to show Europeans as free spirited while Americans are uptight and sexually frustrated? It seemed the whole film was based on sex and not any emotional attachments.I didn't feel good about this film. Watching people attempt to self destruct with no affirmation of goodness at the end...hard pass.At least when portraying Chigurth, Bardem left no doubt about what he was.

When Woody became Edsel...,"Today I got disappointed twice: first when watching this movie, second when reading these comments. ""Beautiful"", ""fresh"" or ""Woody style"", used by others, are probably the last words that come to my mind after recalling that experience of terribly wasted 90 minutes of my life (at least, I haven't paid for it a penny, the price of wasted time is high, still) - ""Edsel"", that's probably the word fulfilling all the feelings about this Allen's movie.I feel like seeing completely different movie than the others, with their plenty-of-stars ratings. ""My"" movie was based probably on a short, not more than 15 pages long story of an aspiring writer, who thinks that telling a story without any point is OK. The director, aspiring one as well, then took this topic and made a documentary of it, narrator being the utterly ubiquitous part of the realization. He somehow got those superstars of Southern California to act in it, so he probably got some connections, and, if he learns from mistakes he made in this movie, can be expected to become one of the numerous ordinary directors making seven sterile romantic comedies a year.....And then you realize, that both the writer and director were Woody Allen. When I watched his earlier films, I usually laughed a lot, cos those were filled with irony and fresh joy of an extraordinary presentation of something ordinary. Now, Woody is just ordinary. It's not this movie only - seeing Melinda and Melinda was also an experience you wonder what the hell have you made to deserve it, for without some fun put into it by Will Ferrell, it is completely stupid. And now, Woody came with Melinda Melinda Barcelona minus Ferrell...It's a shame that one of the best movie makers of past is embarrassing himself with crap like that.

Like a dumbed-down Almodovar movie,"This is quintesensial Almodovar. I've always noticed how much in common the Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar have in common and no picture conveys it as well as when Allen goes into his Spanish counterparts territory filming a movie in Barcelona of all places.Unfortunately for Allen the comparison between the two doesn't speak too well of the New Yorker as the plot, the dialogue and the script in general seems to be taken from a forgotten Almodovar drawer full of his artistic failures.Two best friends - the proper Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and the adventurous Christina (Scarlett Johannson) go on the ultimate holiday to Barcelona, Spain. This is to be their last adventure before Vicky gets married to the ultimate catch - rich and well bred Doug (Chris Messina). Touring Barcelona the two come upon a seemingly narcissistic famous painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), who offers them a proposal only a fiery Spaniard could make - fly with me to Oviedo, where the three of us will have luscious sex. Christina is quick to agree, but Vicky just comes for the company. One thing leads to another and...At times funny the movie watches more like a light comedy. But there is no real flair to the movie or sense of purpose with a pathetic performance from constantly lip-playing Scarlett Johannson. A stand-out performance is made by the Almodovar actress Penelope Cruz, but this is far from one of her better roles, especially in Spanish cinema.All in all a movie I would only recommend to die-hard Woody Allen fans, but apart from that it is essentially forgettable.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Positive - Barcelona, Rebecca Hall and... a choice","Usually I am not too critical on films - every time I find in movie at least something useful and try not to be regretful even if the film doesn't meet all the expectations. Though that time film really didn't give as much as I hoped. It was bit monotonous and even boring. And too simple. Movie authors didn't surprise at all. Unfortunately only 5/10. Maybe the reason of disappointment was extremely positive reviews and ratings of film that I checked before watching it. :) But let's speak about some positive things, too. Firstly, Barcelona as a venue with its nice cultural places was exotic, attractant and very different of the most cases - it's wearily every time to see almost only big and modern US cities in films. Secondly, Rebecca Hall was just brilliant - in my opinion her performance was brighter then more known Johansson and Cruz. And finally film provides many options how to perceive relations in our lives - it doesn't enforce any ""only-true"" point of view, everybody can make his own conclusion. Personally I watched it with Vicky's eyes because she was the one who got most of new experiences and got undeceived.p.s. Probably females would like this movie more as for me it seemed typical melodrama (just with some deeper psychological aspects, not so ""cheep""). p.p.s. It's my first comment on IMDb.

OK - that aside, the movie wasn't all that good. You really have to love Woody Allen's style to appreciate this movie.The story's setup wasn't very believable. Basically, 2 lady friends are ""out of the blue"" propositioned by a local artist who wants them to travel with him to another city to sightsee and have sex (all three of them together). And of course ... they accept ... ya right.No matter the cleverness and speed of the dialog, that basic setup is hard to swallow. There are a few other improbable actions further on in the movie, but it starts there.On the plus side, the acting was really good and the dialog brainy and witty. However, the discourse sounded like Woody Allen talking instead of real/normal people.The intense confrontations between the characters and social conflicts that arose were kind of interesting - but not enough to recommend this movie to the average moviegoer.If you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll probably appreciate this film far more than others.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wasn't very excited with the narration but that is not that important. It wasn't up until the middle of the film that I finally realized that it was lacking basic elements. Firstly and most important of all Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona is missing the notorious humour of Woody Allen. Even Match Point had a weird and morbid sense of humour in some moments. But VCB has none of it. Secondly the characters miss eccentricity and that special something. Not a contemporary artist leading a bohemian life, not even an open love triangle can't keep the interest high enough. And lastly we come to the end. I have nothing specific to say about that, it's simply disappointing.The cast is great and their performances are pretty neat and professional. Overall it's not all bad but it's lacking basic things as I already said. I'm a Woody Allen fan, not a fanatic, but I have loved films like Annie Hall, Love And Death and even Match Point. This is not a Woody Allen film.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Typical 'Late Woody' fare: annoying instead of entertaining,"It's been ages since Woody Allen made a decent movie. Small Time Crooks, Match Point, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Cassandra's Dream and this one: all of them terribly clich√©d, hollow and with a total lack of movie-making skills.Take this one: an annoying voice-over, which does nothing more than literally describing each and every scene (""They go to a restaurant, have some wine and talk"") sets the tone. The acting too isn't terribly engaging with Rebecca Hall more irritating than sexy, Scarlett Johansson terribly under-used and the usually fine Patricia Clarkson in the typical Diane Keatonish role of the kind of woman you rather not want to get into a conversation with. Only Penelope Cruz is decent, but has such a small and confusing part that one can't really understand why she won prizes for this.And the story? You tell me. Two American female tourists get caught up in a complex relationship between a Spanish painter and his ex-wife. Could be interesting, but the result is not. This is all presented in typical Woody-fashion: all talk and nearly no play. But if you expected any insights, a slight bit of entertainment or something else than the usual clich√©s about Spain and his inhabitants: look further.Can we make a deal that from now on Woody Allen gets the treatment other directors who make this hollow, borderline amateurish and self-indulgent fare get?

"New York , London, Barcelona,  Allen keeps doing the same movies","When I sat down for Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona, I had already read several critics praising his latest masterpiece and I was hoping to enjoy this one, especially since Scarlett Johansson appeared for the 3rd time in an Allen picture and she has been always a favorite of mine. Alas, I must confess that it took me 3 tries to watch the movie through as I was really a bit bored about the story, the acting and most of all , about this 'nerving' narrator. While the picture is very nicely photographed and shot around Barcelona and the actors give their best, especially Javier Bardem, the story in my view never takes off and in the end i kept myself asking questions about what was the message that the movie tried to convey.There have been Allen Movies I really loved , Radio Days being my favorite, but this one is not my choice of viewingNote : 5.1 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a waste,"So, if we ever doubted how important a director is to getting the best out of actors, here's the proof. In the hands of Almodovar, with his rightly favoured stars of Barden and Cruz, this could - and possibly would - have been a fantastic tale of emotion & confusion. As it is, we get two of the brightest stars of Euro cinema reduced to 2-D pastiches of ""passion"", with astonishingly pointless & witless dialogue.Woody - you were better than this. We all know you're past your prime, but why don't YOU accept it, & go back to the style when you had a lightness of touch, wit, and verve?Scarlett - the camera loves you, but you're gutless without someone behind it who knows what they're doing. Woody ain't it. OK, I thought ""Lost in Translation"" was abysmal, but that's because I'm not entertained by superior imperial racist crap. You were fab in ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", because it was about your stillness & inner radiance. Try taking a few REAL chances rather than going, ooo, this might make me look edgy. For now you're just a curvy Keira.Bardem, Cruz - learn from this. Neither of you have anything to prove, after all. So don't work with icons because they're icons from the past. Work with them because they turn out art in the present.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Luke warm Woody short on comedy and drama.,"Woody Allen has all but exhausted his neurotic comedy routine in this dull and vapid tale of romantic intrigue and sexual tension. He's taken the show on the road to Barcelona, Spain and installed female characters (with the assistance of a male narrator) to verbalize the same anxieties that Fielding Melish, Alvy Singer and Danny Rose turned into comic brilliance.In Vicky Christina Barcelona we are presented with two American women, one grounded, one scattered who fall under the spell of a magnetic Spanish painter with Picasso bravado. Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) has little trouble bedding the free spirited Christina (Scarlet Johannsen)which to his dismay is short circuited when she comes down with food poisoning. Vicky, engaged to be married, resists Juan Antonio until the the right blend of Spanish guitar and wine do the trick. Humiliated by her backtracking she hides the truth from Christina who becomes heavily involved with Juan and moves in with him. Conflicted Vicky meanwhile agrees to marry her boyfriend in Barcelona. Back at Juan's place, passionate and unstable ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) moves in with him and Christina and spices things up.VCB is neither complex or convoluted, it's just plain dull. Vicky and Christine mouth much of the same in-certitudes and anxieties found in most of Allen's films while displaying confident intellectual banter and newly discovered artistic talent. Vicky soaks up Gaudy and Catalonian culture and drones on about ""turgid intellectual imperative"" while Christina in under two months is on the road to becoming the next Cartier Bresson. In unabashed stereotyping Allen utilizes his ""hot blooded"" Spanish leads to bring and instill passion into the proceedings but his tepid dialogue and action prevent it from building and it is left to a narrator to move things along.After nearly forty years of film making Allen has become a genre in himself. He was a major player during American film's last Golden Age in the 70's but since the late 80's has been hit or miss (mostly miss) with similar scenarios, dialogue and characters lifted from previous films. Farrow and Keaton have been replaced by Johansson and Barcelona pinch hits for New York City but Woody remains Woody and the lipstick he attempts to puts on this pig smudges quickly.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Deja Vu All Over Again.,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/You can't call Woody Allen's latest film crap. The truth is, if his name wasn't attached to it, it would pass as a serviceable piece of estrogen pandering movie-making, yet even without his name, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is plagued by the all-too visible Woody Allen watermark. At this twilight stage in Allen's career he seems hellbent on proving Renoir's rumination individual filmmakers are doomed to make the same film over and over again. The problem with this pattern of redoing everything he's done before, Allen is dangerously close to tarnishing his reputation and is well past the point of evidencing he's merely a mortal. It hurts to realize that this American icon is not a genius...he's just a guy who found his little niche and was savvy enough to perfect it. But Woody perfected this art nearly twenty years ago and in the twenty years since, he's done nothing but turn his art into an archetype.As longtime Allen watchers have come to expect, the actors may change, but the characters and the non-stop dialogue remains exactly the same. Perhaps there's comfort in this familiarity, which would explain why critics and his adoring followers are so reluctant to call Allen out for this sham. How many times can one stomach the same neuroses, the same speech patterns and rhythms, the same interchangeable references to classical music/literature/cinema and the same setup and delivery of jokes? Worst of all, the plots have been recycled so many times that they've become transparently predictable.Unless you're not acquainted with Allen's formula, seconds after polar opposites Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) meet the charming Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), you know exactly how ironically the events will play out. He may not be the genius we all once thought he was, but Woody is still a very smart guy, begging the question: isn't he aware of the pointlessness of remaking the same film ad nauseam? Isn't it embarrassing for him to reveal how incredibly limited his palate is? Isn't it humiliating to show he's got nothing left to offer? Does he even care?Yet despite the well worn formula, VCB still manages to be a watchable movie with a handful of great (albeith isolated) moments. Bardem and Penelope Cruz prove to be the scene stealers, perhaps taking liberty with their native tongue and adding a truly foreign (and fresh) dimension to the carefully regurgitated screenplay. Their chemistry proves to be as convincing as it is compelling and without these two, VCB would have been lost in expanding bog of forgettable films Woody has dutifully churned out on cue over the last few decades.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen tired of talking about men and women?,"With a good and even not so much hidden dose of witty shrewdness, Woody Allen chooses a cast of talented, besides charming, actors and actresses to patch up a quite low-range movie. Unfortunately, an attractive cast, together with a seductive city like Barcelona, are not able, by themselves, to provide a sense, in the end, which is not banal or annoying. Of course, talking about love in an original way, capable of conveying a new perspective, or simply stimulating thought or emotion, is hard work: when the history of man is too old, when everything and the opposite of everything seem to have been told, re-told, analyzed, even the genius of Allen seems a little resigned to this matter of fact and tired of talking of men and women which seem to be unable to communicate something authentic. What he offers to us is the old and trite commonplace of the dichotomy between passionate, adventurous love, on one hand, and stable and safe affection, on the other... I think too little for a highly gifted and experienced director like Allen. As I said before, the whole cast does its best to raise the film from the general impression of banality, some situations are amusing, intriguing, the solar and hot environment help to create a pleasant and enjoyable atmosphere. However, the final result doesn't hit the mark: boring and d√©j√† vu, too harmless.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Its like a Travel Channel documentary, with annoying narration and a yawn-worthy plot packaged within","Woody Allen's work has been around for several decades, creating quite a livid and faithful fanbase that dedicate their lives to watching his yearly films. His films range from romantic to mysterious to even sometimes the realm of science fiction. After a brief slump that was cascading through the 90s into the early part of this decade, Woody Allen re-enters the mainstream with a string of successful and acclaimed movies he filmed overseas. Allen's success derives from his deep flicks about love, affection, sexuality, etc.; and they reached their peak in terms of tone and theme in films like Match Point and Scoop, his ""comeback"" movies. Riding the success wave with his latest muse Scarlett Johannson, Allen now heads to Barcelona to deliver another tale about the complexities of love.Let's get one thing straight here: the man is a tad on the overrated side. Surely none of his movies can truly resemble that of your usual romantic comedy dribble, but its nothing spectacular. Perhaps it's the fact that I'm still bitter that Star Wars, one of the greatest films of all-time, was defeated in the Oscars by Annie Hall. But it could be that his sense of humor is extremely dry, his views on love are just absurd and become repetitive, and the films never quite take off. His movies start in shallow waters and remain in shallow waters, with every so often a curveball being flung by for good measure. Vicky Christina Barcelona is no different; it's a film that doesn't quite take off, even with grand performances, a nice soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography.This film is about two women (The Muse and the unknown Rebecca Hall), one engaged and the other free-spirited, spending the summer in Barcelona. Upon their wanderings, they run into a handsome and charming painter (Javier Bardem) who wants to make love to both of them. A few twists and turns later, Vicky gets married but has doubts about what she wants in life, and Christina moves in with the painter; only to have complications arise once the ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) comes into play. Like previously stated, Allen's movies are never predictable or dwell into stereotypical territory, but the film lacks any sort of dramatic or comedic tension.To further simplify why this film can never be viewed as good or great in my eyes, Vicky Christina Barcelona presents a total of four main characters in a world full of love trying to figure out what it is. No conflict really arises, no climax is ever actually approached, and we never really care for anyone nor do we hope for someone to end up with someone. We are just witnessing, not really interacting or choosing sides. Plenty of dialogue, but very little of it actually enhances the plot. As a matter of fact, we learn most about our characters whenever the narrator (that comes out of left field most the time) describes the scenario at hand and how everyone is feeling.Nothing is more hampering to an actor or actress' ability to perform than a narrator in the background telling you how they feel. This is what hampers everyone's performance, we know how they feel not because of their actions or reactions, but because some guy in the background is mentioning their sentiments. It's annoying, and perhaps why critics believe Cruz didn't deserve her Best Supporting Actress Oscar, even though personally I'm glad she finally earned something for her work.Not bashing everything though. The cinematography is absolutely stunning here, as Barcelona looks its absolute best on the big screen. One would wonder how much better it would look in Blu-Ray; it can pass off as a Travel Channel documentary. The sets within the city are fantastic as well, further emphasizing the beauty of the setting. Adding to the allure of Spain is the fantastic choices of music. The classical guitar and laud-back music are like little finishing touches on the cinematic shots of the towns and restaurants within the city. Allen's direction has definitely improved over the years, as he broadens the horizons and films more than just characters muddled in dialogue. Too bad he couldn't write a better story.Bottom Line: I love him. I don't love him. I might love her. I don't love her anymore. We should all love each other. More or less, this is almost every single Woody Allen picture, and this one is no exception at all. But unlike Annie Hall, it doesn't even end very properly, by not proving enough closure. If you pressed mute throughout the film, you'll see why some credit should be given: the sets, scenery, and direction. Removing mute reveals relentless and repetitive dialogue and annoying narration; both elements ruining the acting and music of the entire film. This isn't the worst film of the year, but is indeed far from the best. Vicky Christina Barcelona is reserved for those who truly enjoy Allen's work‚Äîthe good, the bad, and the pretty.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another Disappointment Fueled By Uncritical Critics,"After reading a couple of over-the-top reviews in New York publications, I was anxious to see Vicky Christina Barcelona. I felt that I had not seen a truly enjoyable Allen movie for about two decades, believing that Allen -- although he talked the self-disparaging talk -- had long ago begun to take himself much too seriously. And this was before his despicable personal behavior in ending his marriage for his stepdaughter (using, undoubtedly, many of the rationalizations he has raised to gospel in this movie).I'd hated Matchpoint both because it was improbable (which I can tolerate in an otherwise well-conceived and executed work) and because it is difficult to ""hear"" Woody Allen opining on moral ambiguity. Although I realized that there were possible mines lying in wait in VCB, the reviews were so good; I had just (finally) seen Bardem in The Sea Inside and liked it very much; I am going to Barcelona in a few weeks; I had just seen Elegy with it's wonderful performance by Cruz, so I figured how bad could it be??Barcelona and the cinematography were beautiful and Cruz was stupendous. Bardem, Hall and Johansson were all pretty wooden (which could be attributed in part to the script) and neither Hall nor Johansson is fit to share the stage with Cruz (or even Bardem for that matter). In fact, if the truth be spoken, from most angles Johansson has a decidedly porcine look no matter how they dress her up. And imaging a neo-Picasso falling for Johansson or Hall was truly funny. Sure, wanting to get into their pants was credible -- as Dave Van Ronk said in Cocaine Blues, ""You take Mary, I'll take Sue/Can' tell the difference between the two/Turn 'em upside down.""Worst of all, both the overlying narrative and the screeds of the various characters on the subject of sexual freedom and not succumbing to a banal life with a person one didn't truly, passionately love had a terrible effect on me visually. It was as if I were one of Annie Hall's WASP parents....the speaker's face, whoever it was, would turn into schlubby Woody Allen right before my eyes and the sentiments were rendered vapid and ridiculous without the redeeming humor of Allen's early movies.Moving his films out of New York has not saved Allen from the pit of self-indulgent, pretentious twaddle that he fell into sometime at the end of the eighties or in the early nineties.Since writing this I have visited Barcelona, where I learned that Allen was paid to use Barcelona & to promote it.

unrealistic clich√©,"I mean, I know Woody loves clich√© characters, but here it's too much... And these clich√© are also not-believable.

The artistic girl Scarlet looks like a bimbo when she talks, and she dresses without any kind of style or personality, I mean, did you ever meet a early twenty something years old who writes, direct movies and make pictures, that goes around with that bourgeois style? And Barcelona looks like the stereotype Americans have about Europe. They drink Italian coff√© again and again like it's Nescaf√©. The only true character in the movie is Rebecca Hall. I suppose it's her story, because all others characters are unrealistic. Bardem looks like a zen enlightened master, just to end up fighting like a bitch for who knows what. Most fascinating performance was Penelope Cruz'. But I guess this movie was a success mainly because it talks about threesomes and sapphic sex other than unhappy marriages, and it does it in an open way, which is all good, and I agree with it.

Vapid Fantasy,"Anyone who's seen 'Notting Hill' or 'Amelie' will be familiar with the type of film that offers a view of a city dreamed of in a tourist guide, without much resemblance to reality. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' does the same for the Catalan city, with the added proviso that it's not even made by a local, but by Woody Allen. So it's a view that uses Barcelona (and its stereotypes) as a backdrop while concentrating on two very American characters, and completely uninterested in, say, the difference between Catalonia and Spain (which is a fairly essential thing in Barcelona) or indeed any other hint of authenticity. Allen is of course famous for making films about people obsessing over their sex lives, but in this film, where everyone is (without exception) rich, beautiful, talented and essentially unemployed, it's a good job that they do - they certainly don't have any real concerns to engage them. This film was celebrated as a return to form by its veteran director, and it has a certain style, but it has absolutely nothing to say about life as lived by real people in Barcelona, or elsewhere.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

This town was deserted in the scenes and looked too fake and unrealistically tranquil.

Penelope Cruz is Exceptional - Movie is mediocre,"Woody Allen makes two types of films; the witty crime caper and the life affirming romantic comedies. This undoubtedly falls into the latter category.I love and rate Woody Allen (my favourites include; Cassandra's Dream, Scoop, Match Point, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Small Time Crooks), but I am categorically bored with all his attempts at romantic comedies (Annie Hall ¬ñ Overrated and boring) and where the only plot is for the characters to better understand them selves or their lovers, partners or who ever. I just don't care.I guess in films like this, you have to really be able to see yourself in one of the main characters to really appreciate what is going on. Vicky ¬ñ a woman, Cristina ¬ñ a woman and Juan ¬ñ a womanising eccentric artist. Unfortunately, as the two title characters belong to the opposite sex, I could not relate to what they were going though, as for Juan his character only exists in books, movies and possibly Barcelona.I didn't find the film funny, or even remotely entertaining.

The scheme seems to work pretty well and pretty the same way in many of the films of Allen in the last two or three decades - it works due to the fluency and witness of the dialogs and of the splendid actors that love to star in his movies. This is not however his best cinema in my opinion. Allen is at his best when craziness exceeds and displaces the thin intellectual wit - an Yidischer Mamma speaking from the skies or a spectacled sperm cell waiting to be launched to fulfill his destiny. It is not the case here. VCB is another Manhattan story of Allen, disguised as an European summer comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love Story of the Pentagonal Variety,"Woody Allen is, of course, a native New Yorker, and most of his films from the earlier part of his career, including masterpieces like ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"", are not only set in the city, but can also be seen as celebrations of it. Starting in the mid-2000s, however, Woody began to make films with a European setting. ""Match Point"" from 2005 was the first of a number of films set in London, and ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""To Rome with Love"", both from the early 2010s, are set in the cities referred to in their titles.""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" from 2008 is another film from Woody's European period, shot in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Oviedo. It has been described as a comedy-drama, but there is really not that much comic about it. Like ""Match Point"", it is more of a psychological drama, although one centred upon love and sexual relationships rather than the more philosophical themes canvassed in ""Match Point"".Vicky and Cristina are two young American women who visit Barcelona for the summer. Although the two girls are friends, they are very different in personality, Vicky being more pragmatic and traditionalist, whereas Cristina is more of a romantic free spirit. Despite their differences, both become romantically involved with the same man, a modernist artist named Juan Antonio. That might seem like a classical love-triangle, but the geometry of the triangle is too simple for many modern film-makers, and love-triangles tend to expand into quadrilaterals, pentagons or sometimes even more complex polygons. This one is a love story of the pentagonal variety, the other two parties being Vicky's fianc√© Doug and Juan Antonio's ex-wife Mar√≠a Elena, who is still romantically interested in him.The film was well received by the critics, and was nominated for several Golden Globes. Pen√©lope Cruz won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The film is therefore one of those frequently called in evidence to refute the often-advanced theory that Woody has been a spent force, incapable of original or interesting work, since around 2000 (or, in more extreme versions of the theory, since around 1990). It is not, however, a favourite of mine. Although it is supposed to be a psychological drama, the psychology never really seems convincing. Neither Woody nor Rebecca Hall, who plays the part, ever made me believe that the supposedly cautious, conservative Vicky, engaged to another man who loves her deeply, would fall for an obvious lothario like Juan Antonio.Both Juan Antonio and Mar√≠a Elena embody Anglo-Saxon stereotypes about the Latin races. Juan Antonio seems to be the direct antithesis of all those introspective, neurotic, self-doubting characters, generally played by Woody himself, from earlier Woody Allen movies. He never seems to have had a moment of introspection or self-doubt in his life. Apart from his art- from what we see he belongs to the flinging-a-pot-of-paint-in-the-public's-face school of painters- his interests (although not necessarily in that order) are eating, drinking and lovemaking, and this last goes hand-in-hand with an invincible conviction of his own irresistible attractiveness to women. I was just hoping that Vicki would react to his advances by slapping his face and exclaiming ""I'm not that sort of girl!"" but that sort of thing never happens in the movies, at least not to arrogant, self-confident Latin lovers.As for Cruz's Mar√≠a Elena, she is not so much a character as the embodiment of that old Anglo prejudice that every Latin woman is a passionate, hot-blooded spitfire, who is forever either proclaiming her love for her man in the most extravagant terms or threatening to kill him. Mar√≠a Elena takes this bipolar tendency to such extremes that it becomes clear that she is mentally and emotionally unstable; she doesn't just threaten to kill Juan Antonio but actually makes an attempt on his life. At one point Juan Antonio, Cristina and Mar√≠a Elena end up living in a menage-a-trois which also involves a lesbian relationship between the two women. That struck me as more of a male fantasy than anything likely to happen in real life; Cristina might be a freewheeling, free-loving nonconformist, but you would have thought that even she would have recognised the obviously crazy Mar√≠a Elena as someone to steer clear of.The film is generally attractively photographed- it would be difficult to make an unattractive film in Barcelona, and the acting is generally of a decent quality, although I thought that Scarlett Johansson was better in ""Match Point"" than she is here as Cristina. There was, however, little to dissuade me from my view that Woody's main forte is comedy, albeit often comedy with serious overtones, and that he is rather wasted when he turns his hand to psychodrama. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Either/Or,"Is this film an exquisite comico-erotic fantasy travelogue? Or a cautionary tale of following through on the artistic impulse, as destructive as it is creative, and beyond the pale of civil society? Are we right to look on these spoiled characters with contempt? Or are we jealous? And can we live in a world without them? Is a man who can't live without women a lover, or just weak? Are women crazy, or misunderstood? Can a woman know herself completely? Does art give meaning to life, or does it simply keep the void at bay? Will you liberate yourself? Or will you wait for death to do it for you? Or is freedom simply an illusion? These are the questions asked by this film. For madmen only.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bedazzled,"After confining himself to New York all his life, Woody Allen has now discovered Europe. You can sense his excitement with it all...artists...old buildings...genuine culture rooted in real history, and most importantly, liberated attitudes. Europeans will find his sense of wonder painfully naive. This film is for those who have never heard of Gaudi - Woody seems determined to introduce him to us, as if it is all something new. Okaay, it will be to many, but the real problem here is the idealisation of everything.In Europe you apparently get to live in a millionaire's mansion simply by splashing (literally) paint on a canvas. Even supermodels are artists...nay, geniuses. And the magic of Europe is infectious - Cristina (Scarlett Johanson) miraculously discovers her true talent as a photographer (together with a pretentious rediscovery of the darkroom). It's a shock to discover Woody is really so unsophisticated as to think we need to be handed these little artistic homilies. New York must be a narrower world than New Yorkers think.There's a threesome in this film that comes about simply because everyone is, well, so wonderful in Europe, so avant-garde, so uninhibited - it's a love affair with a continent. Anyway, even if you're European and are choking on this, as well as the usual Allenesque stammering, plus the nagging suspicion that the awful title is infecting the whole film with its ungainliness, you can always simply sit back and enjoy the view. Johansson is gorgeous - and a fine actress in the right role, if only this were one - and Rebecca Hall, who gives a fine, assured performance that holds things together. Javier Bardem seems to be the new Gerard Depardieu, but like Depardieu, should stick to his own language. Woody should stick to New York.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Love,sex and lust","Vicky and Christina are two girlfriends who decide to spend the summer holiday in Barcelona,little did they know, they would both get tangled up in Juan Antonio's life, a charming free thinking Spanish painter who has a turbulent relationship with his ex-wife,Maria Elena.Both girls grow very fond of Juan Antonio but for different reasons.While Christina is experiencing life; Vicky is trying to escape from her ordinary relationship with her fianc√©.When Maria Elena returns things get really spiced up... Vicky Christina Barcelona is a tremendous film,and hands down,the best scrip Woody Allen has written in the last decade.Everything just falls into the right place,from the beautiful scenarios to the witty speech which is a well-known trademark of Woody.You just can't help but appreciate this beautiful story.The acting was superb.Javier Bardem was the perfect choice to play Juan Antonio as he seemed so comfortable in the role.Scarlett Johansson sort of reprises her characters in Scoop and Match Point.Rebecca Hall was quite a pleasant surprise and Penelope Cruz was very good as the crazy and screwed up passionate ex-wife but not good enough for an Oscar nomination as some individuals are saying.This film should really win a Best Acting Ensemble award tough.Don't miss this film, its a great story with all the necessary ingredients to please a movie lover.8/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Fresh and vibrant work from Woody Allen,"This film is about two American tourists meeting a charming and free thinking artist in Barcelona. Their love lives are never the same again after a series of entanglements.Vicky and Cristina are very different people with opposite ideals. And yet, they somehow fall for the same guy, wrecking the lives of all three of them. This entangled mess is well developed and engagingly told. It gets me interested to know what will happen next, and I feel for all the characters. I feel for Vicky's confusion, Cristina's jealousy and Maria Elena's neurotic outbursts. Together with the great background music and vibrant visuals, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" is a refreshing work from Woody Allen. It lacks the constant babbling dialogs that appears in many Woody Allen's films, but it still feels like a Woody Allen film. I enjoyed it from start to finish.",,Anonymous,Romance
