How on God's green Earth did this work so well???,"The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.
Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?
Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Stan Lee Is Smiling Right Now,"A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great.

the most visually stunning film I've ever seen,"There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The better the art, the harder it is to find the right words to describe it.","Updated review 4-9-19I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Game Changer,"Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

So Much More Than I Expected!,"So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Creative, funny, engaging, and exciting","There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.Overall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.",,Anonymous,Animation
Nicely animated but totally overhyped,"I really enjoyed the animation, the art and the music. This movie has a real comics feel to it. However, it is far from being the masterpiece everyone is talking about.

Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.","Heads-up: I'm only going to be talking about Peter Parker in this review. I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back!

"Too kid friendly, but good!","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done.
For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans.
A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Captures Your Attention From The Get Go!,"What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

Slapstick for the ADHD-generation,"The visual style is unique and impressive, but choppy movement caused by dropping the frame rate in order to make CGI look more like hand-drawn animation. There's just too much of everything all the time. The creators should take more time and build ambience and atmosphere. The constant visual fireworks feels like an ADHD nightmare.The overabundance of childish slapstick comedy gets old really fast. Too bad the creators didn't have more ambition for more compelling writing. Miles Morales is a one-dimensional and uninteresting character.

It's just okay.,"The visuals, while extremely ADHD are beautiful and help mask the usual uncanny valley physics that plague CGI heavy movies. That said, what is actually happening in some scenes is pretty vague, generally it's too busy.The story telling is competent, when the writing isn't tripping over itself with overly concious lines, or progressive character tropes. At least unlike most such movies, the messaging doesn't entirely overtake the plot, and there is actual character development.And even with those progressive tropes, there is some messaging around courage, and tenacity, typical of heroic movies that are often absent in the more wish forfillment progressive typical story telling.Although for a hero origin movie, there is very little trace of self sacrifice, which is it's essential nature. Still, whilst it is somewhat hamfisted message fiction, they manage to wrap it into a plot that makes the film servicable and tucks the messaging into places where a less observant eye might miss it.In general, it's safe to say this is pitched at kids. Which makes me not the target audience. It's neither good, nor bad, whilst the comic book graphic style in itself is worthy of some praise.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Out of This Dimension Good! 100/10 off the Charts!,"I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me!

"Anyone can wear the mask, but no one can rock it like Miles Morales","I'm blown away, this movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the dialogue and storyline is so heart-warming.
The characters are memorable, they all bring their own emotions rubbing off on the audience, and the humor is right on, its daring and hilarious and doesn't seem forced like you might see in some of the MCU films.
There's been 7 Spider-Man films in the last 16 years and this might be the best one yet, its pays its respect to the past films while driven on its own storyline adventure, being such a known character the movies still comes out as original.
The cinematography and animation are gorgeous, definitely oscar worthy. I'd say this is one of the best superhero origins movies ever made. Then there's the numerous amount of easter eggs, be on the lookout for those.
I can't say the movies underrated cause its be treated just as it should be, but if there's one thing that its underrated its the soundtrack, the funny thing is the soundtrack is the exact type of music Miles Morales would listen to, so I guess you could say there's a touch of realism.
In the end all I can see is go see this movie for yourselves, the visual experience is amazing, its touching and serious, funny and witty, brings more emotion than some of the superhero movies you'll see today and best of all if your sick of superhero movies this is a complete different and fresh start of the genre.

"A film for all peoples, except the Epileptic","I had my doubts when Sony said they they were making a new cartoon Spider-Man movie, considering their last outing was the Emjoi Movie.
The trailer displayed the artwork pretty well, but still I didn't want to get my hopes up. The reviews made it sound like the best Spiderman movie ever. So I went to the movie theater and watched it with my brother. And I was, in short absolutely captivated.Miles Morales is a teen protege growing up in Brooklyn with a hard nosed cop for a dad, a loving mother and an uncle, Aaron who helps him explore his ambition as a graffiti artist. The problem is the new school he goes to isn't the life he's looking for, and he is doing all he can to get out of it, against his family's wishes.But that all changes when he meets three people: a girl in his class named Gwen Stacy, a 26 year old blonde guy named Peter Parker and a radioactive spider.Because of a portal opened by Wilson Fisk, the dna of. Spider-Man attracts in alternate Spider-Ma.... i mean Spider-People, dragging them all into Miles' Brooklyn neighborhood. It's up to them, including a middle aged and cynical Peter, Spider-Woman, Spider- pig, and a depressed and grungy Spider-Man Noir, to stop Kingpin from using the portal again to rip a hole in the space time continuum.But that being said, that doesn't touch a bit on how hilarious, how heart breaking, and how endearing the scenes can be moment by moment. The animation and concept art go hand in hand, and gives the film a high tech, pop art appeal like nothing the world has ever seen at this scale or skill.

The different Spider-People (Persons of Spider?) could all carry their own films, showing off drastically different art styles & a great voice cast. The animation is some of the most uniquely stunning visuals I've seen on screen, looking like comic book pop-art brought to life with newsprint texture, dialogue bubbles, & fluid motion. The writing is tight with plenty of heart & tons of laughs. It's a coming of age tale about a teenager who doesn't necessarily want to be a hero but feels that he's the only one who can in his realities time of need. I hope to see more from this animated Spider-Verse in the future.",,Anonymous,Animation

am i watching the same movie?,"This movie has one of the most boring and predictable story lines I've seen in a long while. i'm giving spider-verse 5 stars out of 10 because the animation is beautiful, especially the comic book spreads but the animation cannot hide the plot weakness, since if you know the title and the first few minutes of the movie, you largely know the plot. The only reason I didn't leave one hour into the movie is because my companion fell asleep and i didn't want to wake them up, but the movie is also painfully long. Bottom line, I would rather have spent my time re-watching Tobey Maguire's 2002 spider-man.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

This different approach of animation is simply mind blowing,"There have been so many spiderman films, each of which was cut off from a sequel and rebooted over and over. However, this could alone stand out to be a much better spiderman film in comparison to them all. Into the spiderverse takes you on a sci-fi adventure of multiverse, a spiderman film we have all been waiting for.The animation alone stands out to be the best feature about this film. This new style of comic book animation is top notch and a must watch especially for comic book lovers. The efforts taken in creating and rendering this film was worth it. The film is innundated with so much of high quality design, byzantine animation, one can't take their eyes off the screen and even afford to miss a scene.Even though it has a small run time to it, as most animated films do, this film offers a good character development and good storyline which is unpredictable at times making you shout out ""wow"" especially if you are a spiderman geek.There is an adequate amount of humor. The humor is not forced at all, it has good one liners that makes you enjoy the film from the very beginning. Into the spiderverse is a fun, fresh take on the spiderman story filled with excellent quality content, brilliant animation, lots of humor and exciting action sequences.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Visually Beautiful but the Good Part of the Story is in Another Dimension,"It started of well and I knew by the trailer what I was going to expect. I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash, this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues, it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills, voila!, he knows it all, like the back of his hand.People who say this is the most visually stunning film they have ever seen are those who haven't seen films. All those who have given this a rating standing at 8 point something have been blown over the visuals of this film which is great but every film's basic foot lies in it's screenplay. This is sloppy writing. Aunt May being kind of Iron Man and all. There is a moment in every new super hero film where the hero falls short of confidence and then a few scenes or a lot of scenes later the confidence is regained. Here it happens in the very next scene. What a load of BS. Spider-man sticky web sticks to his hand easily and is a disturbance for him but it is conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky webAnd Nicoles Cage..Are you kidding me...His way of talking makes it irritatingly meme funny. Depressing. His character was a complete waste.But definitely much better than Captain Marvel.

The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people.
The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping.

I give it 10/10 only because the highest score is 10,"On a scale from 0 to 10, this movie deserves a 12.
I have never seen an animated movie that mixes together 4 entirely different art style so well. Sony has truly produced a masterpiece. When we talk about comic book movies, we too often think of everything that MARVEL has produced in the past 10 years, but into the spider-verse reveal to us what a comic book movie can be and should be. This is a movie that's special as it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"My expectations were high for this film, it managed to exceed them.",It's just really good. I can't even describe how amazing it was. Go see it. Now!,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hm,"I had no great expectations at all. Let's start with that. I haven't seen a single picture of the movie, so I had no idea what I was going to watch.I've seen the great reviews of it, some stating that they were expecting something super overrated and it turned out to be the opposite.
So.Here I'm. Long story short, I accept the fact that the majority of the people who have seen this have low needs. That's why movies such as Roma for example generated only $3m at the box office. People in general need easy movies, don't have to think at all, more colours the better, some silly jokes and there you go.
That's why they don't make movies like the Fight Club today. Those kinda movies don't get the money to be made because people wouldn't watch them. Sick and might be hard to accept for some of you, but it's true. De Palma and many others states that people tasted Cola and now they only want to drink Cola.This movie was predictable. I didn't like the style of it, but it was ok. New, but not good. It had it's silly jokes, many nonsense things. TONS of PLOTHOLES.
Also it was easy. VERY EASY. If you have seen any Spider-Man movie, series or something, then you have already seen this movie. Literally.I was just waiting when comes that moment that will lift this movie up that would make it to deserve it's score. I was truly hopefully waiting until the ending. Every scene somehow just kept bringing more and more nonsense things into the way, not even caring about the rules of the movie itself. Then at the end we had a Clark Kent moment, when he puts his glasses on and nobody can recognize him and the movie ended.Visually wasn't good. Have seen far better visuals in an animated movie.
The best thing about the movie was the uncle's theme song. I liked that.Otherwise this movie is no different from the most of those that take place in the top250.Not even close to The Lion King, Your Name, Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies. Even Monster Inc. had more in it.It is currently no. 26 and with it the no1 animated movie. Which is funny because it had 1 Oscar nomination only. WALL-E had 6. Toy Story 3 was even nominated as best feature. Both of these movies and better by far.So, in my opinion this movie is just a great example of what people need today and how easy it is to impress them. It was far harder before.It is going to win it's award for the same reason. But it wouldn't even deserve to be nominated. Hollywood is full of people that don't know what a movie is or should be, they just take part of making one trash like this.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A franchise on drugs,"Most of us have dreams. Not the ones about having a billion bucks or getting that girl, but the night time ones. So most of us would agree that in that twilight zone our brain unleashes its creativity, no longer bound by the constraints of reality, and that allows us to dream the most crazy and amazing stuff. And most bizarre and incoherent also. Especially if there were some substances consumed beforehand.In that sense, I'd agree with those who say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animation film we could dream for. I'm far from the comic book culture, but even I can admire the visual style of this film, made so that any still out of it could actually pass for a real comic book's frame. That aesthetics is brilliantly done, no questions about it.The rest of admiration, however, heavily depends on how much you are into TV cartoons, comic books and Spider-Man himself. This film loves to reiterate over and over again that it's based on an established universe, so there's an abundance of Spider-Man movie references and other allusions. If such things make you gasp in awe and maybe even shed a tear of nostalgic affection, you'll love it all. But for me as a non-Spider-man-acolyte, this soon became somewhat boring. I wanted to see something new, something unexpected.And something new I did receive! In the form of a slapstick action multiplied by the pseudo-scientific stuff as grotesquely absurd as it was far-fetched. And I can clearly see how Sony was inspired by the likes of Big Hero 6 and its outright fusion of the Western and Eastern kid entertainment culture, and of Ant-man and even Dr. Strange and their abundance of moving colored specks and nonsensical words in lieu of common sense. The deeper we go into the Spider-Verse, the more bizarre it looks, feels and acts, until we're forced to accept that there are no rules anymore to cling to and that pigs can indeed fly, just as trains.I do appreciate bringing a new stylistic vision into the world of full feature animation. But I can't say as much about bringing a popcorn bucket of LSD along with it, turning everything into a final battle from Final Fantasy, with its constant sparkle and rush and a muffled feeling that it used to mean something, but now you can't remember what exactly and it's way too late to stop and think about it.It was a fascinating trip while it lasted, but praising it as something more than that would be like retelling your dreams to someone else: you'd end up realizing how little sense your words make and feeling embarrassed about the whole idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Spider-Man Movie Sony Needed,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an ambitious film. Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall.
Instead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time.
Luckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie.
Into the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth.
There is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse: And with that the Oscars lose the last bit of credibility they had,"Where could I even dream to begin on this one? An animated Spiderman film that sits at time of writing as the 41st highest rated movie on IMDB and won an Oscar? Who'd have thought such a thing was possible?So the movie has been hyped left, right, center and diagonally, I've literally not heard one single bad thing about it but the facts mentioned above left me stunned! What could this possibly be to be heralded in such a way?Telling the story of a young man who is also bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superpowers. Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next.So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it.The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film!It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.
It tries to be funny, but comes across childish.
It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice.Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in.8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant).Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart.I just don't get the appeal.The Good:Some great writingGreat ideaThe Bad:Animation hardly flowsUnexpectedly sillyPlot holes that are unforgivably stupid",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord, have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively.

Meandering and cringe at times,"The word meandering sums up this movie very well. It just takes so long for the story to get anywhere. I'd say it takes about an hour into the movie for it to start moving. I kept reaching for my phone from time to time because I just couldn't focus. The humor is very hit or miss. There are some things inserted obviously for a younger audience. While some of the jokes did make me laugh, some also made me cringe or feel awkward.I liked the animation style but then again I'm a fan of anime. So I didn't have a problem with it.I couldn't like Miles very much. He was at least A LITTLE more likable in the PS4 video games. I don't understand why people are saying Peter was made out to be an idiot to prop up Miles in this movie. Miles acted like a weakling and a coward for a GOOD portion of the film. Despite the other universe Peter's circumstances, he at least was fighting. Besides, I think they made him that way to act like the fallen hero/mentor cliche.The female characters were more interesting than the male characters. Why don't they get there own movies? Gwen's story sounds a lot more interesting than Miles. And how she obviously was a ballet dancer and uses that in her fighting. It's interesting. But, I guess people of color trump a white woman?Overall, it's okay. But I don't see what all the fuss is about. Young kids will probably love this. But if you're always watching movies like me.

REMARKABLE,"To start with: I am an enormous Spider-Man fan. Added to this: I am a huge fan of Miles Morales. Now hearing this you may assume that I'd love anything with Spider-Man... and... I mean... you're not wrong. I don't think I outright 'hate' anything Spider-Man related. But at the same time, no other Spider-Man movie has had me writing reviews on Amazon, Fandango, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes singing its praises.Into the Spider-Verse is (to me)- without a doubt- the best Spider-Man movie yet. And to be fair, if there was ever a movie I was skeptical about, it was this one. Sony Animation-- the same people who did The Emoji Movie and the Smurfs films-- making the first Marvel animated movie (not counting Big Hero 6)?? Was't looking too good... But DANG did they knock it out of the park! Not only are the visuals outstanding-- using 3D animation in an almost unprecedented way where it seriously looks like it is a living comic book-- but the cast, soundtrack, and story are all phenomenal. For anyone who reads the comics, there's plenty of Spider-Man fan service. For anyone who doesn't, there's plenty here to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout.

I don't think it's as good as the vast majority seem to think.,"Into the Spider-Verse is very beautifully done when it comes to animation and art. The music is good and very fitting. The voice actors are also very good.However, I don't think the story is particularly interesting, and it is very predictable, and the movie felt a tiny bit too long. The movie is pretty funny though. There are a lot of characters in the film and some feel underdeveloped, especially Kingpin. He felt too weak and was uninteresting, and I have always found Kingpin interesting otherwise.. I didn't care much for the characters except for Miles Morales and Peter B. Parker. There was no real depth and development for any other characters. The other characters were just there to make the movie more fun basically.It's a good and fun Spider-Man movie, but I don't think it's as good as the vast majority seem to think. I saw this movie for the first time in 2019. I have now watched it a second time and I still feel the same about it. I rewatched it now because I want to see Across the Spider-Verse and I hope it's better than this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A modern animation masterpiece. A genuine game changer for both animation and comic book movies,"Rishi Joe Sanu was watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
8 hrs ·
I'll run out of superlatives describing how good this movie is. Not only is it already my favorite best comic book movie but it may even be one of the best animated films I've ever seen, rivaling Pixar's best. The animation pops and brings comic book pages to life right down to the 'Kirby Krackle'. Animators have attempted this unique blend of 2D and 3D animation styles that just work wonders in translating the comic book feel to motion unlike anything before. A very visionary alternative to the 3D Pixar style that has become the industry standard since Toy Story back in 1995. It's even psychedelic in parts. They've done some clever use of dialogue boxes, thought bubbles and transitions that are unique to comic books. Every single frame is brimming with Spiderman references ranging from iconic to those obscure deep comic book lore. The screenplay is crisp and sharp too. I'd totally be okay if the current live action superhero boom ends with Avengers 4 next year (just because I'm already committed) and shifts to this format going forward. #IntotheSpiderverse is an innovative, kinetic and endearing masterpiece. If you have the option to watch only one movie this holiday season then pick this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

What a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon,"Dear Marvel fans, since I knew Spider Gwen is dubbed by my idol Hailee Steinfeld, I really wanted to watch this Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse movie. Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead. Thank you producer, director, casts, and crew to deliver this amazing movie to us.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great cartoon, but not a great film","The Spider-Verse is probably the most beautiful cartoon movie ever. It unites classical comics, nice jokes, and very interesting design. So many human hours were spent that it really deserved an Oscar.
However, if we distance ourselves from the design: the plot is somewhat boring and very predictable. Due to the excessive amount of new characters they were not developed and seemed to be very one-sided. Indeed, it is not possible to sit on a fence in this case, but I would like to see fewer characters, but know more about each of them.
What is killing me is the overall rating. I don't believe it is appropriate to compare cartoons and movies, where real people play and show real emotions.
I wasn't hyped by it, but a nice evening killer, definitely worth watching once.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A non-superhero fan's view.,"I personally not see the appeal in movies like this. However, when I sat down and watched this in theaters, I'd have to say that it's the best movie I've in 2018. For those who haven't see this film, I won't spoil any of the plot points. Getting that out of the way I loved many styles the film portrayed. The films way of creating a layered animation, in which, you can see multiple different versions of the same person or object. It mostly gave off the feel of looking through the eyes of a spider.I was also happy to see in this film that they didn't keep dragging on the same story, but just using different actors or scenes. No film, like Spider-Man Homecoming, gave a new outlook on Spider-Man. With a diverse cast whom all seemed to voice act perfectly, my favorite being John Mulaney, they didn't just feel like a bland group of individuals. Instead, the film allowed for the audience to really connect with each character. I don't think that the animation ruins it, I also don't think that it would have changed the quality of the film if it wasn't animated.So, what can a really say? Well, I came into the movie theaters expecting another super-hero movie, but instead, I got to watch a miraculous film that makes me want to become a super-hero fan. It was perfect and amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not for the average adult,"If you just want to watch this movie because its 8.5 and on IMDB's top 250, then stop right there. You will be baffled. Even if you appreciate the style as a change of pace of some sort, character depth and development is severely lacking, and the dialogue comes from the 8-ball of kid's screen writing.On the other hand, if you're a kid, you'll probably find this very imaginative and fantastic, and it is, for that target audience.

Split Personality,"Overall, I found the whole thing underwhelming. While the animation and comic book style is excellent, the movie suffers from a monumental case of identity. Excluding the parallel universe concept, it initially presents itself as grounded/realistic. Average kid just wanting to be a kid, etc. But then it heaps on unspectacular one-liners/physical gags reminiscent of old cartoons (Kingpin's design and Peter Porker) I felt like I was watching a Dreamworks animation film, and although I easily classify myself as ""young at heart"" and am always a fan of classic Looney Toons(Tunes?) I didn't find much particularly funny here. Which leads to the question: who is the main audience, young/older adults or primarily kids? It doesn't really play strength to either. Is the movie an ensemble film? Not really, Miles is so much the main focus that the rest of the could've been left out entirely or just appeared at the end and it probably would've made a tighter film. None of them get to personally shine or have a memorable moment. One can argue that's part of the charm of ""Anyone can wear the mask"" but I disagree.Honestly, if it wasn't for the eye strain from the 3D then I most likely would've fell asleep.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The BEST depection of Spider-Man yet!,"This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
THE spider man movie,"I gotta day I thought this movie was going to suck because of that awful emoji movie by Sony. Boy was I wrong. This probably my favorite spider man movie. It as great characters, great comic book action, great emotional moments, great animation. I also liked in some particular scenes they were down for using violence. In the movie a character gets crushed and another one gets shot. Although it didn't actually show any blood or anything, it's still a bit over the top for a PG movie. But I'm glad they had the balls to do that. It also feels like your watching an actual comic book. Like they have those sound effects like when spider man thwips his webs and when characters punch and kick each other and explosions go off. It feels like a panel of a comic come to life. I also like how they make peter and Gwen's backstories hilariously sad. This is actually a pretty funny movie. I was suprised that this movie was funny. I also like they have journeys for the two main characters that are wrapped up by the end of the film. This film also shows how the character of spider man is so inspirational and important. How he matters not just to the marvel universe but how he relates to people who read his stories. And the post credits scene is probably my favorite of this year. Wait till the end to see it. I pretty much loved everything about this movie except probably Kingpin. He was underdeveloped a lot and I wish he was given more to do. Overall though, Spider man into the spider verse is a blast of a film and I am going to give it a 9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the Best Spider-Man Feature Film Ever Made,"Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.In this film, which is loosely based off of storylines that are very similar to how this movie plays out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales as he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops the same (and more) powers as his hero, Spider-Man. After an event opens a portal, it's revealed that his universe isn't the only one. There are endless dimensions out there with parallel characters and creatures, all with similar backstories. From Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham, this film explores the classics as well as the bizarre, which I fear will probably turn off some average moviegoers who haven't experienced these characters yet, but if you can't embrace a film like that, it's probably not for you anyways.From the very first teaser trailer, I was very intrigued by the look of this film and how different it looked from most animated films out there today. With only a couple of notable films in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Arthur Christmas, Sony Pictures hasn't had the best track record in terms of releasing animated movies theatrically. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has given new life to that notion, because this isn't only the best they've ever produced in my opinion, but it's the best animated movie that has come out all year. The unique style leaps off the screen and made me find another layer to love, on top of the fantastic storyline and characters surrounding it.Yes, the origin story of Peter Parker is the one that everyone knows. That is very much present here again, and nearly every one of these characters share similar backgrounds, but it feels as though the filmmakers expect the audience to be in on the joke of that. This movie is very meta at times, and it works very well if you're invested in the movie as a whole. At the emotional core of this movie is how these characters differ from one another and how certain circumstances can be worse than others. There are some fantastic life lessons to be learned by children here, and for that, I only loved this movie even more.In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse impressed me on many levels. It gives you the Spider-Man action that you've come to expect from this character, as well as giving new life to it. The character of Miles Morales has just as many layers to his story as the classic Peter Parker one, but the inclusion of each one of the side characters here fleshes him out even more. This is one of the best superhero origin stories I've seen on the big screen in years. Filled with heart, emotion, plenty of action, and eye-candy as far as the eye can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of my favourite films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good entertainment but not as per Hype,"There are many highly positive reviews on this movie promoting it so I went in expecting something spectacular but after watching this movie I consider it over-hyped.Don't get me wrong, its a good movie and fun movie to watch, just over-hyped. What's refreshing about this movie is the artistic animation style which differs from traditional animation and the introduction to the new Miles Morales story line which also brings with it new supporting characters as well.The animation is creative, artistic and entertaining to watch, but the story line and character development in itself is still not as good as Pixar/Disney characters. It tries very hard to make up for it using animation FX and great action sequences, but I could not really emotionally relate to the characters like I could for Pixar/Disney. Having said this, thank goodness the most likable character is the main character of Miles Morales. The villains in this movie is not as well fleshed out as say in other live action TV series/movies where they are also featured especially the main villain whom is better featured in a currently running TV series.Overall-good entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Holy... I can't even... YEAH!,"This had better win some Oscars.Okay, from the beginning: this movie is excellent. It is a thrill ride from start to finish, from being inventive to charting a new story to introducing so many good characters. Miles Morales' story is unique, emotional, and above all, fun.Performances: they're voice performances, so at first glance there isn't much to consider, but once you get further into the movie, you hear these actors truly commit to their characters. Shameik Moore's voice embodies Miles Morales perfectly, and Jake Johnson finally finds a character that's not a stoner; he does have fun with it. Haliee Steinfeld is exhilarating and perfect as Spider-Gwen. The rest of the cast... they're all fantastic, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Go Spider-Ham!Direction/Writing: with three different directors, you'd expect this to come off as jumbled and incoherent, but it is not that at all. The scenes are well executed, the fight choreography is exhilarating, and the way they blend animation is simply stunning. The writing was soooooooo goooooooood. Phil Lord really had a story he wanted to tell, and he didn't skip out on any opportunity; somehow, we'll be laughing one minute and bawling the next. He really left it all on the field, especially with all ridiculous avenues he decided to go down with characters like Spider-Ham, Penny Parker, and Spider-Man Noire. The best part is it all works! The villain, Kingpin, is a bit sidelined, but it doesn't matter in the end because the story is about Miles and the people in his life. There's a moment in the trailer where Miles jumps off a building and we get this beautiful upside-down shot, and that moment is somehow even more satisfying given everything that leads up to it. The combo of story and characters truly does work.There's so many things I could talk about, from the immersive world to the killer soundtrack to the fact they use sound effects that correspond to the character's respective universes. You can feel the amount of time and effort that went into this movie, and you can feel that feeling of satisfaction that it paid off. It's a truly unique movie and inventive experience that is a sight to behold. (10/10)Seriously, Academy, look at this movie. And give it like all the awards.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Style over substance.,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. This film looks stunning for 90% of the 100min runtime. I will say however that the editing is so sharp and quick, that I thought I was going to have an epileptic fit! Also it played on the 3D blur that the old red and blue comic strips had, which sometimes made me slightly troubled as to whether I was in a 3D showing with no glasses!The story was half decent, especially around Miles and his family. I thought his relationship with his uncle was particularly a strong point. No spoilers here though!As for the rest of the movie, I once again will reiterate that Spider-Man in general is feeling exhausted. No matter what is done with the character whether it's Miles or Peter. We have been watching these characters since Toby brought him to the big screen nearly 20 years ago, being rebooted over and over. It's wearing thin for sure.Thank god this movie had a lot of style.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rock solid Spiderm-Man Movie with superb visuals,"The Trailers to this already were pretty promising. I was a bit skeptical tho because it's still sony. Fortunately, my scepsis was proven wrong.First and foremost: the animation in this film is drop dead gorgeous. The last time I saw animation this innovative, was with the lego movie in 2014. The soundtrack is surprisingly good too. The story is pretty basic, but the pacing, the action and the humor all work perfectly as a whole. Especially the student/mentor relationship between miles and old peter parker plays out exceptionally well and serves as the emotional anchor of the movie. The rest of the side characters fall pretty flat, which isn't that bad because they give more room for miles. The only one that really bugged me was Spider-Ham, who was just a bit too over the top and silly. The Villains are ok, but nothing mind-blowing. The third act disappoints a little bit because it feels a bit overblown.Overall, Into the Spider-Verse is fun, action-packed family entertainment at its best, with a few minor issues here and there.

It's fast paced so you don't have a whole lot of time to really deeply understand and immerse yourself with the characters. Because of this it creates some unbelievable characters (characters whose decisions don't always make sense because you don't fully understand their motives, desires and psyche). The movie isn't confusing, just that the characters deeper motives for things either feel very cut and dry or aren't explored fully or deeply enough to create these complex characters we typically see in other movies with this high of a rating. This movie is still 100% worth the watch but don't expect the same level of storytelling as other movies with similar ratings.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A different take on Spiderman,"Watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse with my daughter today and both of us enjoyed it.

Fast-paced creative animation,"Spider-Man can be anyone.I found ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" to be a bag of mixed quality. Let me start with what I found to be its strengths:Amazing animation and production design, and good performances on the voice cast.The faults were clear as well: a bit of a messy script with much focus on aesthetics, very fast pacing and not much investment into the character arcs. Example given: King Pin was never really an unstoppable force, nor very threatening when encountered close-up.All in all a treat and original in its visual style, but fundamentally lacking a mature script, as well as well-developed character arcs.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good Spiderman movie. Terrible 2-D animation. WAY overrated.,"I honestly don't understand the hype. The movie was fine. My kids enjoyed it about as much as I did (I'm 35, they're 6, and we all love superhero movies). I really enjoyed the movie at times, and was bored at other times. The comedy was great and the plot was original/decent. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I thought we were being shown the 3-D version. I looked around to see if people had the glasses on. The random guy next to me was doing the same, and he left to get glasses for him and his kids. He let me try them to prove to me that the animation was not in 3-D, but rather was just bad animation.Here are my guesses for why the ratings are so high:
1) Only really big fans of Spiderman, comic books, and/or cartoons have seen this movie, so the scores haven't been evened out by the average moviegoer.
2) Many reviewers saw it in 3-D, and the animation looks like it was designed solely for 3-D. If I felt like wasting my money, maybe I would've enjoyed it more.
3) Critics are mostly nerds, and the nerdy critics are the only ones who watched this. They're probably all the same critics who love the CW superhero shows.
4)I don't see how this is higher than a 7.5 on iMDB, and 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Gripping, But Preachy About Identity Politics","I so want to agree with everyone that this movie was amazing and fantastic and perhaps the best thing since the invention of sliced bread, but when you look closely there are significant problems.Let's start with what was good;1, the comprehensive construction of Miles as a personality, from his dialogue to his jokes from his singing to his clumsiness, this was realised in micro-gestures and facial expressions as was Miles' father and uncle, a brilliant piece of animation.2, the movie created a comprehensive atmosphere and style and was planned and executed to an inch of its life.3, you were gripped from the start, whilst watching the movie there was a great dramatic impetus, you were desperate for a conclusion.4, the music, graphics and minute detail was all brilliantly realised.What was not good;1, if you take out the character development, that must be secondary to the story, we have boy infected by spider, trying to stop the Kingpin from using a machine to bring back his dead family, this is hardly a substantial story.2, if, and I believe it is the case, that the story above was incidental and that the ""real"" story was ""everyone can wear the mask"" this is using or abusing the vehicle of Spider-Man to advance forward a political agenda.3, if we had a parallel dimension then Spider-Man would be the same in each dimension, just as New York was the same in each dimension, if we had a alternative dimension then nothing would be the same so there would perhaps not be a Spider-Man, this was jumbled thinking at its best, which is it?4, we had blatant gender and racial appropriation and a whole array of divisive stereotyping that was used to underpin a political agenda, it was perhaps even gross tokenism, let's say no more.It cannot be right to use a movie to promote ideologies of globalisation, political correctness and identity politics and embed this within the core of a movie and this needs to be called out for what it is, this is indoctrination and liberal authoritarianism bordering on brainwashing.I did enjoy the movie whilst I was watching it but afterwards I felt I had been cheated, preached at and manipulated to a political world view, that is the latest Hollywood fashion trend, that places identity above everything and we are all citizens of nowhere.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS,"A fresh take on Spiderman that leaves you wanting more. The fight scenes were incredible and the animation style was used to the movie's advantage. Visually very stunning and although there are things in the movie that were rather underdeveloped, e.g. Prowler, overall it didn't detract from all the good that the movie brings.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best animated movie of the year BY FAR,"First and foremost, I know everyone is talking about the animation and how the animation is great and how the animation is revolutionary and how it puts animation 10 years ahead or something. All of that is true. I can confirm all of those things. Little easter eggs are hidden in the animation, and it's so stylistic and fast. When you do a close up on a person's face, you can see little dots and circles in their face, just like in comics. I don't know whether this movie was hand-drawn, 3D CGI, or a mix of both, but whatever it was, it was breathtaking.Second, the performances. Jake Johnson was so good, I will only hear him as Peter Parker. Nicholas Cage should just stick to voice acting, as he was better in this than he was in Teen Titans. I don't know how Shameik Moore sounded like a teenager, but he did. Speaking of good impressions, Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron sounded like a completely different person in this movie, I didn't even know he was in this movie until the credits rolled. Oscar Isaac plays a certain spoilery role, and Hailee Steinfeld is amazing as always. John Mulaney was the biggest surprise, as Spider-Ham was much more enjoyable than expected.Next let's talk about the story. So original and creative, and full of twists and turns. The villains are all menacing, (especially a certain female villain, who turned up being wayyy more creepy than she had any right to be). The script is super tight, and each character uses different words, like Nicholas Cage's character, SpiderMan Noir, doesn't use any words that were made after the 1930's. Lord and Miller are probably one of my favorite duos in Hollywood right now. Their writing is so sharp and quick, and I love it.Other surprises: Without spoiling, what they did to Aunt May was super unexpected, and was simply hilarious. I could never guess what the end credits scene would be, and I wouldn't want any other scene than the one we got. Speaking of scenes, the Stan Lee cameo in this movie almost made me tear up, but then he cracked a joke, which made me laugh, but made the scene even sadder.This is by far the best animated movie of 2018, and possibly the best movie of the year. I can't wait for the sequel.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Long live the Spider-Verse, just outstanding.","This is a straight up animated masterpiece. The animation style, the universe(s), the voice acting, the story telling, everything is amazing. I feel bad for the other animated films this year, because Into the Spider-Verse blows them all out of the water. It's hard to believe this is the same animation studio that made the smash hit The Emoji Movie. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still my favorite from the hero, but this one is not far behind. My only, tiny complaint is that the villains weren't very fleshed out, but with the multiple Spider men and women needing adequate backgrounds and screen time, I can easily look past it. This is a superhero movie for the typical fans or the oblivious viewer, creating the always beautiful message that anyone can wear the mask. We're all a lit bit Spider-Man.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny but flawed.,"Overall I really did enjoy this film for the most part. For me it worked best when humour was used and it failed miserably in the ""emotional"" scenes but hey ho it is a cartoon aimed at kids so there is bound to be the odd saccharine moment (or ten) to be expected. Visually it was a bit of an assault on the senses at times but overall worked for the film. My most hated thing about the film was the gawd awful soundtrack. Highlight of the film goes to ""Spider pig""",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Did we all watch the same film here???,"Didn't really care for the film when it was first announced mostly because of the odd looking animation and the character Miles Morales, who I'm not a fan of, in this case screamed ""Look! black Spider-Man gets his own movie now!"" all over. But after the overwhelming praise this film got, it's every detail from animation to story-telling receiving colossal praise, I had to see it.With all the hype, I thought I was gonna watch a masterpiece that would blow me away and boy, was I wrong. The only thing I enjoyed about this film were some dialogues from classic Spider-Man and noir, Miles felt extremely generic, another story of how someone who isn't talented or capable at first BUT gets better because he ""believes in himself."" of course. The villains in this are just so bad. We have one villain for a simple emotional twist, throw away villains like the FEMALE Doc Ock, Tombstone and Scorpion. And Kingpin another attempt with the overused ""sympathetic villain"" trope who's design is absolutely horrendous, it literally looks like his head is attached to his chest, they could have at least given him his classic white suit which they of course didn't. The plot is extremely generic and predictable, it has some decent moments but overall nothing memorable. Don't get me started on the god awful soundtrack.My main problem with this film is the PC, SJW, diversity angle. It's just extremely conspicuous how there's such a HUGE amount of colored people even at a prestigious school that according to liberals are filled with the white privileged elite, it's just so ironic at this point. Even the villains. Either my standards are too high or everyone else's have lowered drastically. I love being proven wrong, I had low expectations when seeing Logan and John Wick 2 and I ended up loving those films. Either this movie is for a certain demographic of specific age or I'm one of the few insane people that think it's extremely overrated. Spider-Man 3 was at least entertaining, this is above everything is just boring.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing,"Very cool cartoon. Unusual animation that especially emphasizes character styles. Shown bright and rich world around. Incredible and memorable soundtrack that you want to listen. In the cartoon there is a tribute to the creators of the characters: Sten Lee and Steve Ditko. The characters worked out well, but I wanted to see more of the relationship between Miles, Peter and Gwen. And also see more Fisk, as he showed little. And perhaps this is the only drawback for me. And in general I advise you to watch the movie especially in the New Year and especially if you are a fan of Marvel.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse will hopefully blow your mind as it did mine and a couple of friends of mine!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his adult nephew. We all were enthralled by the tale of the various Spider-Heroes depicted in this film especially the main one of Miles Morales. Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing. Nice of the credits sequence to also dedicate the movie in memory of him and other co-creator Steve Ditko.

Best Spider-Man movie EVER,"I Have loved the Spider-Man comics since being a kid, and have followed them for 40 years since. I can honestly say they have brought the comics to life.It uses comic print type graphics while still having that clean HD computer generated look, giving the characters in focus superb colouring and life. At times the back ground was out of focus, i guess this is on purpose, but felt like badly edited 3D, but this didn't distract from the overall look at times it almost feels like a live action film.It a fantastic storey which feels like its been ripped straight from the comics. It is jammed packed with the proper Spidey humour, and gives us the usual moral questions which makes up every great Spidey Character. There is great action sequences throughout, and you do get invested in the main characters emotional journey.It has everything a great Spider-movie should have, but you get more Spidey for your $$. If your a fan of the whole Spider-verse thing have patience and wait till the end credits it is worth the wait.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Absolute best movie of the year,"When I first saw the teaser for Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse last year, I was hyped, the animation was beautiful, but we got little story. I can safely say that Sony Pictures Animation has made the best Spider-Man movie to date, and best movie of the year. The story is your typical story, near the end it does get a little too bunched but I am more than willing to forgive it for that. The characters are excellent, I am no fan of anime at all but I loved the unique anime style and expressions Peni Parker gave, I loved the cartoonish nature of Spider-Ham, Related to the edgy nature of Spider-Man noir, Felt sympathy for Miles, emjoyed Peter Parker, and loved Gwen. The action is great, no more needs to be said. And to wrap this review up: The animation is AMAZING, never before have I seen such creative style in animation, this is the best animation I've seen ever. It follows the style of a comic book and does it perfectly.Overall go see this movie asap. 9.8/10 (rounded up to 10/10 in the actual star rating)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is a good movie that one might enjoy, but the animation is not great, and the voices are not great. I have seen many animated films, and there is an unnerving aspect to this. I would say that there is something missing, that is hard to describe. Perhaps it is the description of the characters, or the pace of the story, but this film did not feel right to me. I did not come out of the theater with that outstanding feeling that one gets when he has seen an outstanding film.

Best spider man movie!,"I was expecting a great movie when I saw this, and it still blew me out of the water with how amazing it was. This film gives nonstop punches with awesome fight scenes, and plenty of fresh humor between the fights.Each of the voice actors felt perfect for their counterpart, even Nick Cage as Spider man Noire.But of course, what I loved the most was the amazing animation. Unique, accurate, and every different spider man has its own art style! Penny has a more manga art style, Spider Ham has a very cartoony style, and Noire has the 40 and 50's crime show vibe. And it nailed ALL OF THEM!The plot took some turns I really wasn't expecting, and tons of tiny details put into the movie made me pleasantly surprised. For example, how real those moments in school felt before Miles was spider man. All that talk about puberty had me dying.So, I'm conclusion, if you like action movies, see this movie.

The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard in my life, both in movies and series.The leap of faith scene is the best scene I've ever seen in my life. When Miles met the other Spider-Men and stood in front of Peter's suit, the suit was too big for him, but after his dad's words, it fit him perfectly. Beautiful. Then, when he's in the building and lets go, the broken glass appears because he's still scared, but he does it anyway with that great song that fits perfectly. The shot of Miles inverted with the city below is beautiful because it really shows that he's rising, becoming better. When he climbs up the place where he fell before, saying ""wooo,"" because now he's ascending and not descending. The jacket with the shoes looks incredible with the suit; I wish he had kept the suit with the jacket, at least, because it looked so good on him.The Prowler and Kingpin are super threatening. The song they play when the Prowler attacks gives you goosebumps. At any moment you pause the movie, it's a beautiful shot.

One of My Favorites!!!,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Review:Into the Spider-Verse is a new Sony animated movie about Miles Morales, a Spider-Man, who discovers multiple versions of Spider-Man from different dimensions after an experiment gone wrong. I absolutely love Spider-Man. He is my favorite character of all time so I was super excited for this. I loved Into the Spider-Verse! Everything was definitely thought through very carefully, taking into consideration all the comics and backstories for each character. The story was amazing. It was trippy and just fantastic. It wasn't really predictable for the most part which is really good. The voice acting was really good. Shameik Moore as Miles was by far the best part. His emotion was really good and you could feel for him like you knew Miles. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker was really good. I thought that Spider-Man was funny and just enjoyable. Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron was very good. Mahershala is just a really good actor and if was cool to hear him voice acting. Brian Tyree Henry player Jefferson Davis and he was a great voice actor for Miles's father. All the characters had great development. There were three Spider-Men that came later on that I really liked but didn't have too much exposition on them, but it made sense for them not to have to much. Throughout the film when we meet all the Spider-Men they do exposition on them and they do it in a comedic way and for those three they didn't need to go too deep so it worked. Also the villain of the story, King Pin, had a great design and looked like a good villain but he kind of failed a little. I could see his views after his backstory was revealed but I wanted just a little more out of him. This film had some of the best animation I've ever seen. They made it like a comic book and it looked beautiful. Also the movie is a bit trippy so some of the scenes were just beautiful looking. I could talk about this movie for a long while but I don't want to get into spoilers. If you love Marvel and Spider-Man there is no way to be disappointed. I would recommend it for sure. It'll be nominated for Best Animated Feature for the Oscars (it was nominated for the Golden Globes). It's now hard to say if this or Incredibles 2 will win. This movie has higher ratings but Incredibles 2 is Disney and they almost always win. Once again see it! I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse!!!My Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I didn't care for it... but maybe I am missing something.,"The first time I saw Into the Spiderverse... no kidding, I walked out. I freaking hated it. I didn't care for Miles Morales and his stupid uninteresting family dynamic BS between him and his felonious uncle, I didn't care for the ugly, choppy looking animation, nor did I like the stupid, overly cartoony ridiculously goofy tone. I don't care that this movie has all the spidermen in it, by the time all these other guys start showing up... it's too little... WAY too late.I watched it again recently and sigh... I still hated it. Seriously, I freaking despised this movie. Why people love this movie is beyond me... and yet... it won the OSCAR for best animated feature!!!! Slow year for animated films maybe?Well, maybe, or MAYBE I'm just missing something. I just find absolutely nothing of redeeming value whatsoever in Into the Spiderverse. You've got to also bear in mind I LOVE the MCU Spiderman. I think Spiderman Homecoming and Spiderman Far From Home are really good movies. It's just very difficult for me to take this movie seriously when it's so overwhelmingly goofy. I think that's my problem.And yet... kids and adults alike SOMEHOW like this movie! So maybe I am missing something, and maybe I should concede that this just isn't a movie for me. I didn't like it at all, but hey I guess chances are you and your kids will.",,Anonymous,Animation

Too Much Action,"Conceptually its brilliant but like every other superhero movie, there are way too much unnecessary action scenes which ruins the 2nd hour of the movie. Its visually stunning for an animation film and manages to be lively throughout by mixing humor and action like the Homecoming movie. But too often the characters are left under developed like the Spiderman Noir which really was disappointing because I was looking forward for Nicolas Cage. The soundtrack was fine and the song placements were perfect and as for the casting goes its very diverse and is a good representation for BAME. Overall its an interesting film with a great post credit scene but the major drawbacks are excessive action and a basic 3rd act.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"Disappointing. I was looking forward to this movie for two reasons: a great voice cast and the whimsy of multiple Spider Man/characters from varying dimensions. But instead of building interesting characters (heroes and villians) I was presented with a number of long, chaotic action sequences robbed of dramatic (or comedic) tension by the lack of well articulated characters and interpersonal dynamics. There was also a production anomaly that was puzzling - there were times when the animation was blurry as if drawn for 3D (there was a 3D version, but that wasn't the one I was viewing), so, I hastily put on my 3D glasses, which I happened to have at hand, and it was still 2D, just blurry ... odd(?).

Amazing and spectacular,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse is an absolute masterpiece and easily the best Spider-Man film of all time. A funny, emotional and fresh story that plays with the tropes of an origin story to great effect. It also maintains clear focus on Miles yet still manages to give all the other Spider-people plenty to do whilst exploring the inspiring message that anyone can be Spider-Man and of course, redefining animation forever.Shameik Moore imbues his version of Miles Morales with a loveable awkwardness that matures into a crowd pleasing confidence, resulting in one of the most satisfying character arcs of recent memory. Jake Johnson is perfect as Peter B. Parker, with an equally satisfying arc as well as a humour and vulnerability that make him one of the best renditions of Spider-Man.Rounding out the main trio is Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, closed off without being cold and the most mature of all the Spider-people. The rest of the cast are a lot of fun with John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage being the most memorable, playing exactly to the strengths you want them to.Rodney Rothman, Peter Ramsey and Bob Persichetti craft a beautiful film, the animation style is so unique and full of detail in every frame whilst staying true to its comic book roots as a comic book come to life. The pacing is also extremely impressive, managing to balance all these characters as well as a rogues gallery and do it all in under 2 hours.The music by Daniel Pemberton and the score are both incredible, both are given the time to shine at the right moments without overshadowing the other and Pemberton's score is unlike anything you've ever heard previously that starts strong and never gives up.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ah Man!,"What a superb Movie.In coming into this movie I was blank. I know much about Spiderman but I don't know enough. Not sure if any of this movie is accurate or not although this movie was really good.This movie is about Miles becoming a new Spiderman, adapting to his ability and trying to get the other Spidermen back to their universes.The animation was only a problem at the beginning for like 30 second then i got use to it.A few popular spiderman villains show up. The main Lead Villain is none other than the Kingpin who is basically trying to do what Cable did in Deadpool 2 movie but he is more sinister because the movie portrays him like such. He was able to over power 3 spider mans while giant Green Goblin struggled.Pacing in this movie was great, time went by fast because it was such a great film.We got to see various spiderman's from other universes. 2 Of which I think were forced in my opinion.The scene where Miles find out about the Prowler is probably the best scene in the movie.To conclude great movie. One of Sony-Marvels best since Spiderman 2. Its a fun flick for children who would understand the concept of universes and Spiderman fans.Again I know enough spiderman but not enough to say I'm a spiderman fan.

One of the all-time greatest animated films of all time,"I have rarely been so completely blown away by every facet of a single film as I was by this movie.

The art style was so unique and gorgeous, I kept whispering ""wow!!"" like every ten seconds. And to cap it all off, the story, the lovely, perfect story. You think you've seen Spider-man, you think you know what to expect. This was so much more than just an origin story. This was a whole world. This was a boy reaching for everything he could be. And it was a look into what makes Spider-Man one of the most beloved Marvel characters. It isn't just that he punches bad guys and saves the day. It's that he loves the people he saves, and craves connection to the people in his life and his city. This movie had so much heart. I cannot recommend this movie enough.

"Awful Pandering ... Terrible Movie, Period.","This poorly constructed CARTOON does nothing but reinforce the stereotype that comic books are a childish medium. It also helps exemplify a lot of what is wrong with modern Marvel itself.Juvenile virtue signaling and forced unnecessary diversity is placed above what made the source material great in the first place. It tries to drive home both points to nauseating levels (literally because the choppy animation was designed to induce seizures and appeal to ADD sufferers) Between the ""bip and baps"" reminiscent of Adam West's Batman was a story that featured minority Spidey becoming near invincible because his father gives him a speech through a door. And don't forget infallible Mary Sue Spider-Gwen who is automatically better than all the boys because you know...vagina!!!That aside, the story and characters themselves were apparently written by twelve year olds to appeal to twelve year olds. Spider-Pigs, anime robots and Alfred-like emotionless Aunt May surrounded by ruined classic Marvel villains (horrid distorted representations of Scorpion, Doc Ock, Kingpin, etc) Yes, they leaned on the misrepresentation from the Ultimate line but that garbage failed in print for a reason. Why puke that in to animation?Overall, it's easy to see why older fans are rejecting this thing and why the box office was so light. Thank God for that anyway. Here's hoping this nonsense stays out of the MCU.",,Anonymous,Animation
Ugh - Bendis,This film has moments but I am not a big fan of Brian Michael Bendis and his weird politics or the inside jokes he filters into work. This film is Bendis on steroids and LSD. Peter Parker is a washed up white guy (hello America) and the future is Miles Morales - a black / latino kid & a white woman (Gwen) who is independent and puts Miles in the friend zone. They rip the classic Kingpin design of Bill Sienkiewicz. I honestly feel this movie was trying to brainwash me or something. I wasn't big fan of the animation.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Animation style was aweful,"The plot was decent, characters were OK even if there were a few too many of them. The action was intense for a PG movie, perhaps a little too much. I probably would have rated this PG-13 and then not brought my 5yo daughter. She was jumping out of her seat several times when scary monsters with fangs break onto the screen unexpectedly with loud noises.The worse part was the animation style though. There are lots of reviews praising this but either my theater messed up, or the animation style was just terrible. It was like watching a 3D movie without your 3D glasses. Everything in the background had that 3 color hue around it. Foreground stuff was fine, but it simply made the background art look terrible. I had to look around the theater a few times, and double check my tickets to make sure we hadn't gotten into a 3D movie without the glasses.

loving Miles,"Peter Parker has been happily the one and only Spider-Man saving the city over and over again for the last ten years. Miles Morales hates his new school although he is taken with fellow new student Gwen Stacy. His policeman father tries to keep him away from troubled Uncle Aaron. He stumbles upon a battle between Spider-Man and Wilson Fisk with his henchmen, Green Goblin and Prowler. A portal is opened between the Spider-Verse.I really like Miles Morales. He's great with Gwen Stacy. The hair bit is hilarious. I'm over the moon for the first act. My first instinct is to have Jake Johnson play both Peter Parker. He's better acting as a slacker but if he could play the first Peter Parker, it would more compelling to see the change. The other issue is Gwen Stacy. She shows up before the incident. The movie explains it away as time travel but it would be better if it simply switched a couple of scenes. Overall, this is fun, imaginative, and glorious animation. It is also a great introduction to different Spider characters and holds potential for the live action movie world.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Animated Film of the Year,"We've gotten to the point in this golden-age of comic book movies where studios are starting to feel more comfortable taking storytelling risks. With Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Sony not only took a huge risk with the animation style, it's lead character, and bold story choices, but it's actually a very good film in its own right. Blending a heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and a bold animation style, Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man film to date, and one that should garner all sorts of accolades. If it wasn't for an ending that gets bloated with hectic animation, it could flirt with some of my favorite animated movies of all time list.

Greatest animated movie of all time!,"Spider Man: Into the Spider Verse is one of the greatest and most original movies I have ever watched! It has a completely fresh and different style compared to any other comic book movie I've watched, now I don't just think this is the best animated movie ever, I think it's the best Spider Man movie ever, the best superhero movie ever and one of the best movies ever, which is a massive accomplishment. Considering the Sony movie that came before it was The Emoji Movie, most people were skeptical, but leaving that theatre, I have no doubt in my mind people were blown away! The idea of a multiverse is sick, but it's even sicker when it is executed like it was in Into the Spider Verse, it is often considered the best Spider Man movie of all time, even by Raimi trilogy fans (such as myself) and it definitely deserves that title. It balances seriousness and comedy without falling down, and that ""What's up Danger?"" scene is magnificent and one of the best scenes in cinema history!All the people from different Spider-verses are likeable and hilarious, every scene could be made into a poster because of how aesthetically pleasing the entire movie is.

"""Anyone can wear the mask.""","I like that line! It made me feel something.My first time watching this ever and I really enjoyed it. (Duh, right?) A unique style of animation that you'd think would be a detriment to the action scenes, but it really isn't.The action scenes were a lot of fun.Most of the jokes landed for me. I especially enjoyed the slapstick. The birds... LOL!All of the voice acting is great, for the most part. I especially liked Jake Johnson, Nicolas Cage, Kathryn Hahn, and Hailee Steinfeld.Likeable characters with satisfying arcs.Miles was a fun protagonist to followMy favorite character was Noir Spiderman. And I felt Nicolas Cage was a good choice for that character. His voice made him sound old-fashioned, and his voice helped make the character funny without even trying.I love how Miles learns how to be Spider-Man by reading Spider-Man comics.The twist with Prowler was unexpected.Speaking of twists, when the Doctor revealed her name to be Olivia Octavius I was like, ""Oh crap.""I like most of the character designs.I liked the music.However...The more I think about it, the more I think the usage of a certain licensed song was inappropriate. I'm aware that this is a common criticism and it's common for a reason. It happens at a moment in the film, where it supposed to be emotionally resonant, and it kind of takes away from the intended impact of the scene.I think the movie feels longer than it is. That might change on my second watch.I personally did not like this movie's choice of having Kingpin as the main villain at all. I feel like there are more threatening villains they could've chosen, especially in this movie. I wish the main villain was just Kathryn Hahn's Doc Ock. I found her threatening-enough, as well as deliciously sadistic. And I found Kingpin's design to be incredibly distracting. In all honest, I cannot stand his design. Hahn's Doc Ock looked awesome. I also didn't like Goblin's design. Why is he giant? And where's his glider? Or Scorpion's. I don't like the fact he looks like the Scorpion King at the end of The Mummy Returns.While I didn't mind the Porky Pig Spider-Man, John Mulaney's voice was very distracting. It reminded me of Steve Buscemi in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. (Don't watch that, by the way. Unless you're a masochist. Or if you want to know how to not write a script.)How did Kingpin teleport out of his van before shooting his gun? There was no sound from the car door opening or closing. Then again, maybe it's cartoon logic? I mean, how does he even fit in that tiny car? Lol. Also, during that scene, shouldn't have Miles' Spidey-Sense gone off? Or does that only work if the gun is being pointed at him? The slow-motion following the gunshot was unintentionally funny, too.I did not feel for Kingpin's plight whatsoever, and that's not a result of his character design. I just didn't like him or his role in the film.Also, when you break down the plot, it's pretty standard. However, the animation style, characters, action, and humor make the generic plot totally worth it.Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite Spider-Man. Yeah, I have nostalgia for the Raimi Spiderman movies, and yeah, I am a Raimi shill. But even if those things weren't true, Spider-Man 2 would still be my favorite. The poignant story, the music, action, the villain, Alfred Molina's performance, etc. Plus, there are things in it I personally connect with. Although, Gwen Stacy in this movie is a lot more likeable love-interest than Mary Jane.Looking forward to watching Across the Spiderverse.

Joseph Campbell Meets Bansky Meets Spider-Man,"This is among the best films of the year and I really don't know what is the best part of it. The screenplay deftly interweaves a compelling origin story for a hero while deconstructing the notion of the monomyth while grappling with the cultural weight of Spider-Man. The screenplay is sharp, funny and emotionally resonant. Miles is a great character. Not a mere clone of Peter Parker but a person in his own right with unique foibles and desires. The screenplay does a lot to demonstrate the particulars of representation lead to different tonalities. It manages to make a really obvious twist hidden in the process of doing that as well. The story is great.But it is also realized in some of the most vivid, alive animation I have ever seen. The film's CGI is expressive in ways that CGI rarely is. The directors lean into the stylistic implications of the story, each of the Spider-people have a different look for example. But they manage to make the film feel whole and unitary. Best of all the mainstay of the animation feels like the bright marvel style of the 60's mixed with the vibrant world of street art. (Miles does graffiti). Comic panels, lettering, action sound text etc all make appearances. It was a massive risk that pays off. The visual scope of this film is amazing; it is simply incredible how alive this film feels despite the stylistic artifice.This is a film that truly works in every regard.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Spidey-sense very common in this radioactive spin on the web-slinger,"Using misaligned colour templates, like 3D without the glasses, for portions of the screen that were out of focus was a bold step. Bring them together and our eye is drawn to that now sharp part of the screen whilst everything else goes out of focus, or rather misaligned. What a different way to direct the audiences' eyes. Maybe a subliminal nod to the existence of parallel realities.
Like all good PG animations, the creators build a bit more depth into the narrative which makes the film a coming-of-age tale, leading the young viewers into the world beyond. Despair and faith, loss and hope, and all those adulty type themes are threaded through this three-dimensional ... no, MULTI-dimensional tale.
It is a silky-smooth incorporation of comic book panels, colours, and shading into a big screen motion picture.
The city slicker wit had me laughing out loud aplenty although it is occasionally too clever for this semi-rural simpleton.
This was a Tuesday night 9:30pm session with about a dozen adults and no kids so it was probably wasted somewhat without its target audience. Nevertheless, it is good to see the PG-rated teen animated epic is in capable hands.

"Even with a large story and five different Spider people, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an entertaining movie with a story and look that's all it's own","We've got Peter Parker. We've got web-shooters. We've got a group of villains called ""The Sinister Six"". Yep, we've got a Spider-Man movie again. It used to be we would go several years between the further adventures of New York's web slinger. Now were going months. In fact, Spider-Man had a big part of the MCU epic Avengers: Infinity War back in May. So what's going on in December that requires an additional movie? You'd be surprised by how vast the comic world is that does justify another movie.Like how many people have played a particular superhero, many people have played Spider-Man aside from Peter Parker. One popular addition is of another New York kid named Miles Morales. He garnered phrased for being the first half African-American, half Puerto Rican character to play a superhero. He was also noted for taking Spider-Man back to a youthful demeanor as Peter Parker in the story was getting a little old. But it doesn't stop there. There's also Spider-Woman, Silk, Spider-Noir, and even an anthropomorphic pig called Spider-Ham who operates on cartoon logic. While we don't exactly get all of them, we do get a bunch of them, along with an origin story for Miles in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Young teenager Miles Morales (played by Shameik Moore) is adjusting to a new life at a prestigious boarding school academy, at the insistence of his cop father Jefferson (played by Brian Tyree Henry) who wants a better life for his son. Miles wants to impress his parents, but finds comfort in his more free spirited uncle Aaron (played by Mahershala Ali). One night, while the two of them do some graffiti art in a hidden area of the subway, not only does Miles get bitten by a spider, but also witnesses a battle and death of the popular Peter Parker Spider-Man while spotting Kingpin (played by Live Schreiber) working on a large machine that takes affect.Like Peter Parker's story, Miles starts to notice changes like sticking to walls and spider senses. He visits Peter's grave to think about what to do next. Its here where an older Peter Parker (Played by Jake Johnson) meets him and asks for help to help him return to his own dimension. While uncovering plans from Kingpin to open several dimensions, Miles also comes across Spider-Gwen (Played by Haile Steinfeld), Spider-Noir (Played by Nicolas Cage), Peni Parker (played by Kimiko Glenn) and her robot, and Spider-Ham (played by John Mulaney) who all help figure everything out.As you can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse juggles a lot and almost makes the mistake of cramming too much for one movie. Amazingly, the script not only keeps every character listed above in check, but also makes it a great story for young Miles Morales. If your worried that this is another origin story, this is one that puts a lot of focus of Miles and his relationship with his father and uncle. I can't disclose why, but it really creates new pressure that Peter Parker never had to face.In terms of the rest of the characters, I really like this side to Peter Parker that we had yet to get from the other adaptations; a Spider MAN. A man whose gone through so much and had his heart broken several times, that he's more of a broken hero that needs fixing himself. His story balanced out well with Miles. He also gets a good scene involving the aunt May of this universe, almost like seeing a living ghost that was very sweet. While I don't want to give too much away, each Spider person gets their own arc as they navigate their way through Mile's world.Let's talk about the animation, which looks great. Rather then going for a Pixar/DreamWorks look, this Spider-Man story has a comic book-look that takes advantage of that fact, along with that it's also animated. Unlike a lot of live action movies where use of computers can occasionally be distracting if not done well, it all blends well, especially with the action sequences. The angles remind me of the comic pages I still turn, given the use of color and word bubbles, that never become annoying, and are used accordingly to amplify the drama and comedy. This is a movie with the rare distinction where it's all it's own.I'll give this ten Spider-Man comics out of ten. This was a fun and different Spider-Man movie that we needed, even more then Spider-Man: Homecoming. It could come off as too weird for some, but given the story's focus is still on this kid's growth as a hero and a teenager, it never felt overwhelming. It was an odd example of everything accidently fitting into piece. This is an absolute recommendation. Swing in and go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A rare mold-breaking superhero movie,"Great family movie. We took our 6 and 8 year olds. The animation and creativity are incredible. It's one that is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I wish there was more of Miles's relationship with his mom, but at least his dad has heart.. so does his uncle. He's not just a steriotypical toxicly masculine police dad. Also wish there was more Gwen, but Miles is a great character and I'm glad he was the focus. Miles is the best superhero we have had in a long time. This could be the blockbuster of the year. It's fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Missed the Mark,"The visuals gave me a headache due to the choppiness of the framerate. I personally found the story to be clichéd, and I did not connect with any of the characters beyond surface level. The film has tonal stability, and it is well directed, but I just did not connect with it the way I do so many other animated features. I would give it a 6/10, a one time watch for me. A solid film for kids, but nothing more. Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms is still the pinnacle of 2018 animation for me. Watch it and formulate your own opinions, but for me, again, I just did not see what all the hype was about",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Real and Objective Review,"I'm not caught up in the history of Spider Man or how the franchise has evolved over time. With that perspective, it's easy to judge this movie on its own merits. The animation is flat-out amazing. Rather than the the pages of a comic book coming to life, the creators have succeeded in pulling you into their world. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The story line is passable but mediocre at best. The characters are bland and for an animated multi-verse the villains are uninspired and unmemorable. I'm glad I saw this in a theatre in 3-D because at home on a small screen it will be like watching a Sunday morning cartoon. Albeit, one with a 90M budget.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very well picked voice actors. I'm looking forward to see where they take this next.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I liked it more than Spider Man : Homecoming,"The film is like a comic book come to life, I mean that's the look the filmmakers where looking for. Attempts to be two things at once, a Spider Man film and a sort of parody of a Spider Man film. It does have heart, and never goes to far into silliness. The animation is really amazing, takes the audience into this world. And I was wondering when we where gonna see the other Spider characters, and here we finally do and it was worth it.I hope we more movies with the characters of Spider Gwen, Miles Morales, and Spider Man Noir to name a few. It has a great story, telling us about things in case we get stuck in sub plot. Now I it differs a little from the comic. But I expect a lot of times in comic book movies. Hope to see more Spider Verse movies in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Groundbreaking experience!!,"Wow this movie was honestly a lot better than I ever thought it would be! If you are a big fan of spiderman and a huge ned, you are probably gonna love this movie! If you are not really familiar with spiderman, other than the movies and MCU, like me, are you gonna like it? Well.. I certainly did!This was amazing on almost ever level! There was a great story and character arc about accepting the responsebility, not having to do everything yourself and that failure comes with the job! I got quite emotional a couple of times! I enjoyed the characters and villains as well! They have motives we can understand!However.. despite all that, the most groundbreaking part of this movie, has to be... the animation! This movie looks absolutely amazing with some out of this world shots! The style reminded me of Arcane at times! It seriously looks so damn good and they pull no punches in terms of creativity!

"Perfect, hits all the right buttons.","Absolutely spot on. Respects the history of the characters and story, but has a totally new fresh look. Visually amazing, its hard to absorb EVERYTHING that is going on on screen. I did have to go,out and make sure I wasnt in the 3D theater; some of the background items have a double outline that gave the impression of a 3D projection. I found out this was a production choice and I was in the right place. I think the way to tell a perfect melding of voice acting and production is when you look at the character onscreen and think ""Wow, they're really giving a great performance"" then realize, it's a cartoon, not a person in n the screen. You've been drawn in...they did their jobs well. Nice tributes to Ditko and Lee can be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It clearly took much time and thought into producing it. Best Spider-man movie hands down. I saw it twice already and I might just go see it a third time!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good!,"I did not expect such a good movie going into another Spiderman Movie. But Marvel did a great Job showing us another Story out of their huge Comic Book Universe.
But seeing only 10 Reviews on this Page is a bit overrated. First of all the Animation is really mind-blowing and a completly new Style. This is incredible and i hope more movies risk something in this area. The Movie felt like reading an actual Comic Book which was surprsingly fun. The Soundtrack helped the Movie to create Emotions and felt cool because it fits in our Time. The Story was overall not bad, but nothing great happend. As i said earlier, it felt like a cinematic Comic Book and this also means that the Story was nothing more than this. Therefore it was a way better story than average with a lot of Humor and Action. but nothing that will be remembered long.
So Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse was a very good Movie with a solid Story. You should definitly check it out if you are interested in the Animation Style or you are a Fan of the Comic Books. Good job Marvel, try out more things and you will go in the right direction. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I'm so f$""&ing happy they made this movie","In a land where every movie feels like it's trying to be Ironman, and all of the major studios are trying to play catch-up to marvel, leave it to a collaborative production between marvel and Sony to make one of the most fun and unique feeling blockbusters in recent memoryThe story is a slightly altered but true to form adaptation of the Miles Morales origin story from the comics, prividng the same complexity and themes in his successful debut. The supporting cast perfectly intertwines the usual familiar faces with the additional characters from the alternate dimensions, leaving the pacing and focus tight and centered around Miles' arc, while also allowing every character to have meaningful moments that make their presence in the film necessary and earned.Visually, this movie is stunning, and the inclusion of comic book panels and stylings makes this movie feel like it literally jumped off the page. This makes this easily the most visually distinct comic book movie ever to hit the big screen and I'm genuinely so grateful for the hard work the creators clearly dumped into every frame.Stop feeling like you're getting robbed by big studios with long running franchises and go give Sony all your money for making this film, they deserve it.

I've Been Sucked Into This Spider-Verse. And I Don't Want Out.,"""Another Spider-Man movie,"" you ask? Get excited as 'Spider-Verse' breathes new life into our familiar friendly neighborhood hero. It is slickly and gorgeously animated in a way I have never seen Western cinema attempt before. This is the closest we will get to a comic book coming to life.For a movie jam-packed with main characters, they find a fun and extremely efficient way to introduce them all without getting too repetitive or too dumbed-down. Minimal expositional dialogue gives way to creative visual devices and recalls that are implemented so satisfyingly because they treat the audience like the smart people that we are.If you are looking for humor (meta or slapstick), lessons on power and responsibility, shocking twists (for non-comic book readers), meaningful cameos, tear-jerking emotional scenes, action-packed sequences, then you are ready to swing into this universe. I, for one, am sucked into this Spider-Verse. And I don't want out.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was painful,"I expected a lot from this movie. I really tried to like it, but I couldn't. The animation was confusing and annoying; lots of colours and psychedelic effects, poor use of frames, etc. The story didn't really make sense, and the characters just weren't relatable to me (mind me, I'm a 20 year old latina, but I just LOVE Peter Parker. Is the personality that matters). I found Miles dislikable, as well as Peter D. (Or B?) Parker. Other characters didn't have enough screen time to show any personality. It was long, boring, and the humor wasn't as good as other SpiderMan content. I had to force myself to watch it to the end because I already paid for it, and well, maybe it'd get better at the end. It didn't. I guess I can't understand the hype.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Thank you, Marvel!","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
Non-spoiler review
Easily the best Spider-Man movie made to date. That's isn't much of a stretch, because the others, while some have been good, are just not great. Why is this the best? Simply stated, it is 100% faithful the the source material-the Marvel Comics.
While the mainstream Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is fantastic, those movies have been adapted for mainstream audiences and morphed into their own laws of their established sense of reality. This movie about the Spiderverse is straight off the colorful pages of the comics. The one true Peter Parker Spider-man, from Earth 616, does not appear in the movie. Instead, the main character is the Miles Morales Spider-Man from Marvel's Ultimate Universe, an alternate dimension that exists as part of the greater Marvel Comics universe. The 616 Spider-Man was created by the late GREATS Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, who both passed away this year. Miles was created by the man who had written the majority of all Marvel comics over the past 20 years, Brian Michael Bendis. For someone who has read comics for most of his life, I am happy to report this is the first theatrically-released superhero movie that is a faithful adaptation of the comics. Thank you Mr. Lee, Mr. Ditko, and Mr. Bendis for creating this AMAZING universe and thank you Columbia Pictures for visualizing THEIR original creations on the big screen. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Excelsior!

A confusing mess,"Most of the characters are unoriginal, and are plagiarized from previous work. For instance, the villain Octavius is copied from the 2004 stunner Spider-Man 2. Also, there is a girl character from Japanese cartoon. The motivation of the movie is confusing, too. It is really unnecessary to make such a movie. Perhaps it is politically correct to think : why does the spider-man have to be a white? It could also be a black. OK, why does Jesus Christ have to be a white? He could also be a black. Well, cash grab should be another motivation, as Sony does not have much IP. Besides, the premise, or setting, of the film is unconvincing.

For some reason not many animated movies have catched my interests as much as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse did.They definitely took some big risks with the type of humour used in this movie, but knowing how well the Deadpool movies played out, this was a risk worth taking.The movie also gave some kind of sin city feeling which I really liked.If they managed to give us more screentime and backstory on the rather interesting villains in the movie, it might have been a 10/10.

The Best Spider-Man Film,"I had very high hopes for Into The Spider-Verse. After seeing it, it surpassed my expectations. The best part of the film is easily the animation. It has so much personality and style. I hope more animated films in the future use this style. There is also some deep and dark elements to the story as well. The film isn't scared to dig into some dark material instead of only trying to appeal to children, and I can commend it for that. Another great thing about this movie is the characters. Some of the side characters like Spider-Ham don't build that much as characters but they never seemed like lazy characters. They all have their own personality and add a lot to the film. The more fleshed out characters like Miles, Peter, and Gwen are one of the biggest surprises of this film. Most super hero films don't try to flesh out their characters and mostly just try to make them cool. This movie takes time in developing those characters to make them more likeable. Especially the process Miles went through in this film was really impactful. There are a few issues I have with this film though. For some reason, they blur out of the backgrounds for some of the shots which bothered me because since the animation was so amazing I wanted to watch the environment and take in the art. Although, it may have just been the theater screen I watched the film on. Another thing is that the film gets a little cheesy near the end, but nowhere near annoyingly cheesy. So, I would highly recommend seeing this film. It's my favorite super hero movie of the past years and my favorite Spider-Man movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Arguably the best Spiderman,"I first saw the trailer for this film, popcorn in hand, in the entrance of my local cinema waiting for my screening of 'Avengers: Infinity War'. At first I was scared for the investors of this film, thinking, 'Woah, an animated spiderman film? Surely this will be a flop.' I didn't change my thoughts on the film throughout the several months leading up to watching it. That is until five minutes into the opening scene. The rich, vibrant animation was an enigma to me at first. Swirling, spinning web-slinging (excuse the pun) spectacles and characters took a second to wrap my head around, but once the film had fully immersed me, I had been 'thwipped' to my seat.Whenever I see a trailer for a film and I find it genuinely funny and not just in a, 'haha, hey, we should go see that' kind of way, I become worried. To me, a funny trailer indicates that all the best scenes have been used up in this promo, leaving a dull, bland shell of a movie that could have been funny. Add this to the fact that Sony Animations (creators of the dreadful 'Emoji' Movie) had produced 'Into the Spider-Verse' and you had a recipe, it seemed to me, for disaster. This was, however, in no way the case. The film had both Parody and Slapstick style comedy with a hint of Satire. Not to mention the hilarious references to various Spiderman Films and Comics.You could really get behind all of the characters. Each were strong in their own field and presented a new style both in their characteristics and literally their true colours (Spiderman Noir's lack-of for example). This applied to the multiple villains as well. The new takes on Kingpin, Dr. Octopus, and Green Goblin were some of my personal favourites, plus the first time depiction of Prowler voiced by no less than the brilliant 'Mahershala Ali'. Obviously not his first Marvel Villain rodeo! If you are a fan of mid-film twists, 'Into the Spider-Verse' has got that fresh to order. I don't do spoilers, but I can tell you it will be a surprise to you.Overall, I believe this film is one for the marvel history books. And hearing there is an sequel based around the female characters, I can say for certain that i will be rushing into theatres to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"7.5/10 - A Very Solid, Aesthetically Unique Film","The first Marvel movie I review, I think! Let's go!Anyway, Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animated Spider-Man film that follows Miles Morales, a high-schooler from Brooklyn, as he gets bitten by a Spider and receives some weird super powers...yeah, you know how it is. While trying to master his new powers he has to stop Kingpin from destroying the entire city, with the help of some other Spider-people that were sucked from their universe (""dimension"") to this one.The most noticeable and unique aspect of this film, which is a big part of how and why it works, is the animation. The animation is awesome. It gives this movie a comic-book-esque vibe, and it flows so well with the kind of story that it tries to tell. The general aesthetic, the narration, the bubbles, it all just feels just like a comic book and I love it.The relationship between Miles to...let's call him the ""thicker"" Peter Parker is quite well-written, and I like the way that they influence each other with their own respective issues/mental barriers throughout the film. Spider-Verse has a really solid amount of emotion generally, and I think that at least Miles, Aaron, Peter and Miles' dad are all well written and well used on the emotional level.And my last compliment (but definitely not the least) towards this film is its pacing and flow. This film flows so well from scene to scene, gives itself a rythm through the soundtrack and the editing, and you get a fast paced (but not too fast paced) movie that leads you from one scene to another with a great flow, for most of its runtime.I don't have tons of issues with this film, but I'll name three that come to mind when I think of what bothers me here.First, the way that most of the spider-people are quite underused and/or underdeveloped. Especially Gwen, which was supposed to be one of the more important characters here but ended up kinda flat imo.Second is the awkward jokes that are scattered all across this movie. Now, they do work at certain contexts, but I do feel cringe at certain moments, and it could've been used in more of a tasteful way.And finally, the soundtrack. It ain't terrible, but there are some points in which the soundtrack was a real mood breaker for me - to name one scene, the ""What's Up Danger"" scene was really good but the song really threw me off.So that's it, I guess. Overall, this film is fun, solid and entertaining, and you may even connect emotionally to some aspects of it. It is a flawed film, but not anything that completely destroys the watching experience.

I find it can lead to some seriously lazy writing as inter-dimensional characterisations can write, then re-write their own pasts and futures in a fashion that can become dull and repetitive quickly. This is not one of those. It centres around ""Miles"", a young lad who likes to hang out with his wayward uncle ""Aaron"" and who has a penchant for street art. It's whilst they are decorating an underground wall that he gets bitten by a spider and soon afterwards starts to feel the effects of his spidery-transformation. Meantime, the real ""Spider-Man"" aka ""Peter Parker"" falls foul of the evil ""Kingpin"" who has created a collider that will enable him to enter parallel realities in the hope of reuniting with his family, tragically lost to him years earlier. The more he messes with the timeline, though, the more chaotic the effects and the more our new, trainee, ""Spider-Man"" meets his equivalents from those different dimensions. It isn't long before they conclude that only as a team can they hope to thwart the megalomaniac and young ""Miles"" must find new inner strength to take charge of this mission to ensure all his colleagues get safely home. It's a good, characterful, story this - the youngster finding his feet and learning to use his new-found skills is entertaining to watch. The dialogue is frequently quite amusing, and the action scenes hold the attention rather than recycle themselves endlessly. As I watched it, I wondered if it might have made for a good exercise for 3D cinema. As it is, though, it's quickly paced with plenty of action, a little food-for-thought and it might just be the most ""human"" of the Spidey iterations I've yet seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Ever since I saw the first U.S. dubbed Akira VHS bootleg...,"Somewhere around 1990 I got my first U.S. dubbed bootleg copy of Akira on VHS. Terrible quality (copied from NTSC to Pal) and horrible dub. Must have watched it 20 times and still did not get the story line, not until I finally got the U.K. deluxe box set including the original Japanese version with English subtitles...So why am I bringing up a totally unrelated animated film from about 30 years ago? Firstly and foremost, due to it changing my view of what animation could be... forever! It's doubtful if 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' would have existed without it... or is that going too far perhaps? It changed (for the international market) adult animation in any case. Animation wasn't just for kids any longer.Secondly, for me, it changed how I viewed the Japanese movie market. Despite minor hits, I still thought 'Godzilla' before 'Akira'. And to me Sony is still Japanese, and no they are, as far as productions are concerned, not strictly Japanese. But they do release a lot of (computer) animation such as 'Resident 'Evil.' Besides having a Disney-challenging animation department.So... I like animation... I like adult animation... I like Japanese animation/ anime/ manga... I'm not adverse to super-hero stuff, DC, Marvel, otherwise...So... why am I not loving this? Well, perhaps this got presented as ""something you've never seen before, pure innovation."" It's NOT! This may be technically impressive an innovative. But 'Men in Black 3' was not better than 'The Empire Strikes Back' due to more modern effects.I like this. I gave it a 6 out of 10. The story seems aimed at younger viewers, that fine. This may be the most impressive animated feature this year.I however, am still waiting, after 30 years, to see something animated that has more EMOTIONAL impact on me than Akira did...

The movie constantly keeps you engaged, and is surprisingly funny thanks to the great writing and stellar cast of voice actors. I would highly recommend seeing this.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""The film to surpass Spider-Man 2""","This entire film is a love letter, not only for the fans, but for all of Spider-Man. 2018 was the year for the Web-Slinger himself, but this isn't another Parker story, this is the story of Miles Morales. The themes of Self Identity and where we can differentiate Him with the other Spider-Men is heart of the film as it establishes this Miles as his own self, rather than another Peter clone in the Ultimate/Prime Universe(Of the Comics). The Comedic Relief didn't feel far off Noir portrayed by Nic Cage is a highlight, Peter Porker is a cartoon character what you'd expect and Peni Parker with Sp//dr (i prefer the Evangalion design of the original.) The Animation superb, The score and Soundtrack ultimately fitting (although some complain about the use of Scared in the Dark and yes it did feel off, but it didn't bother me that much. And one of note who disliked the soundtrack overall and preferred the score to be kept thought.), I have no complaints, i say this is the film to surpass Raimi's Spider-Man 2 from 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - Cinema with CJ Review,"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse makes you aware pretty early on you're in for something special. The curious project long in development unsure of where it sits in Spider-Man canon makes it known that it is the Spider-Man canon.It's a love letter to every single piece of Spider-Man you know and love and even the stuff you might not. The movies, the cartoons, the comics, the character, the icon. If you want a definitive Spider-Man, I think you're looking at it.Into The Spider-Verse oozes so much style from it you can't help but be sucked into its universe. The animation is slick and gorgeous and perfectly on form here, translating Spider-Man to the big screen like you've never seen before. It's beautiful and it's technically impressive, playing with all sorts of styles (helped by the diverse supporting characters) but never losing sight of its spirit.There's never been a more true comic adaptation. Watchmen is so far back in the mind alongside every other comic book movie here, Spider-Verse uses so many techniques in it you just feel everything you expect Spider-Man to actually be. It's like if Deadpool had those yellow boxes, or if Fantastic Four had a good movie.You feel so much love for Spider-Man in the making of this film, full of everything for the hardcore fan to the most casual movie-goer. Whatever your working knowledge of Spider-Man, you're going to be impressed.The actual story and characters haven't even been touched in this review so far and that's because Into The Spider-Verse gets the groundwork just so right of course everything falls into place. It subverts expectations, it gives you the exact payoffs you want, it has such smart humour and touching emotion. It's everything great about every Spider-Man piece of fiction and almost none of the flaws.Into The Spider-Verse surpasses even the likes of Spider-Man 2 here. It's not hammy (beyond Spider-Ham), it's not cheesy, it's not full of bad CG, it's not got soap-Opera antics that don't land, it's not set outside New York, it's none of those things.Spider-Man is reinvented alongside all the references of his reinvention. It gives us an origin story that doesn't suck, because it knows you know all of that. Several times over. It knows how smart the audience is. It knows we know the stories. The beats. So instead it gives us a show. It gives everything slightly different to what you know and expect, but leaves you happy with how familiar things are.The entire cast and crew have truly made something special. The writing, the directing, the animating, the acting, the soundtrack, everything. It shows the work that has gone into it. It stands apart from most of the other animated movies of recent years. It makes yet another good case for animation needing more of that mainstream blockbuster highlight. This is better than pretty much most of the superhero movies that have been made to date.Life has been breathed into Spider-Man yet again. And it's not necessarily gone bigger and better. It's human. It's funny. It's down to earth. It takes us on the journey Miles Morales is being taken on. Things get weird. Things get fun. An all star voice cast's praises can't be sung more. None of the people involved can't be celebrated more.There's great power given when you get the reins of Spider-Man. And with it comes great responsibility. Or however the saying goes. I'm just glad that I'm in the Spider-Verse were it all goes perfectly with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An Honest Review,"I'll be upfront, I'm giving this 1 star because of the treatment of Peter Parker.They didn't do the Andrew Garfield thing and turn him into a bully.

Parker is a dork, he's got a smart mouth...but he's really smart, a genius, totally heroic, and well, the call him ""The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" for a reason. He cares, specifically he cares about the average working schulb.This kind of just took Peter Parker and almost mocked him and, honestly, I can't get behind that. i couldn't get behind it when they turned him into a bully in the Garfield movies, and I don't care for it when they mock him here.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best Comic-Book Film Of The Decade.,"A jaw-dropping feat of originality, imagination & top-tier storytelling that easily goes down as arguably the finest film of 2018, undoubtedly the best Spider-Man film since Spider-Man 2, and indubitably the greatest comic-book film of the entire decade. And that's no mere feat considering that 2010s is filled to the brim with superhero flicks. Also, animation is the best medium to explore the world of superheroes and Into the Spider-Verse proves why. A flawless masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Animation
Spider-Man done right.,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse's biggest strength is knowing exactly what it is. There's no deep meanings or important messages to be found here other than the usual superhero morals and that leaves a lot of room for action, comedy and heart.The animation really sells this movie; I can't say I've seen a similar style before. Whilst it can make some action sequences a little hard to follow, it is absolutely beautiful and never gets old. The writing is pretty great; the story is cohesive and different and many of the jokes hit well (clearly some Deadpool inspired humour to be found here). Miles Morales is a fantastic spider-man and alternative Peter Parker is nicely fleshed out. The other spider-men, women and pig are lacking in character but provide good comic relief and keep the film fresh. The mish-mash of villains is an interesting choice. Whilst Kingpin is definitely made the main antagonist, there are a number of villains in the movie but none are given any backstory or reasoning behind their actions other than Kingpin. This ins't necessarily a weakness however, since the film is never bogged down by trying to justify their villains and instead focuses on the fun-factor of having enough enemies for the number of spider-people in the movie. It's also worth mentioning that the soundtrack and score for the movie is pretty damn good.It ain't gonna blow you away and it's not a must-see but it definitely is a fun ride the whole way through.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The best thing about the movie is that it has a heart. There are quite a lot of characters appearing, but you get an insight and understanding of all of them. You can understand the motivations behind the action which makes it much more of an enjoyable watch. This is certainly very watchable movie for an adult audience as well as the kids.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Yikes,"This movie is definitely not as good as everyone is making it out to be.The movie starts off simply enough. Miles is your average Hollywood teen, who is the son of the only police officer in New York City. And if you want to see yet another person get bitten by a radioactive spider, then you're in luck.75% of the film is Miles trying and failing to be Spiderman. He's incapable of controlling any of his powers, and does little more than get in the way and utter cliche lines such as ""I have to do this. I promised."" It's rather frustrating to watch. But conveniently, he figures everything out in the last half hour and becomes a better hero than all the other Spidermen who've been in the business for years.Speaking of everyone else, as the story progresses, the audience is introduced to more and more Spiderman variations (and more unusual villains). With so much content, they barely get any more than just a few minutes of screen time. Spiderman Noir was interesting, for the five lines he had. I'm pretty sure there was some kind of Penny Porker character, but I may be mistaken. There's also a Scorpion villain who shows up out of nowhere, then mostly disappears.As a whole, the movie was filmed assuming that the audience's attention span is a about 1 second. Most jokes are cringe worthy, especially after you've seen them in the trailer. There's also way too much flash going on, and the movie's final scene is about as visually complex as a Jackson Pollock spatter painting.Spiderverse doesn't do anything that hasn't been done time and again.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly a love letter to Spider-Man,"There's so much to be said about this movie. From the animation to the story to the voice acting and writing, but if there's one thing I find isn't stated enough it's that just how much time and effort and genuine care was put into this movie. One thing I find with some movies, especially of the superhero genre is that they're often made for money and lack quality. However with Spider-Verse it felt like the directors really put care into making this movie great. You can tell they really took what Spider-Man stands for and really conveyed that message. That message being that anyone can wear the mask. This movie really knocks that message out of the ball park and really made me feel as though (assuming he was real) that I could be Spider-Man. When I feel like I need some motivation to do whatever it is I need to do in life, I'll often go back and watch this movie, it's really that great.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
*A Revolutionary Animated Masterpiece*,"I must say, this movie is best ever animated movie i ever watched and probably best ever spider man movie. Before this film Spider Man 2 was my favourite spider man movie but this movie completely replaced it. I regret that i didn't watch this movie in theatre.This American computer-animated superhero film has most solid animations which aren't made by Disney or Pixar in a long, long time and this film deserves all the accolades it has received.The film's animation is nothing short of astonishing. Every frame is a burst of vibrant colors, dynamic compositions, and innovative techniques that perfectly capture the essence of comic books. The filmmakers have masterfully blended traditional animation, CG, and even hand-drawn elements to create a visually stunning and immersive world. Each Spider-Person has a unique and distinctive visual style, reflecting their personality and origin. The attention to detail in character design is remarkable.While the visuals are breathtaking, the film's heart lies in its compelling story. Miles Morales, a young, Afro-Latino teenager, discovers his own Spider-Man powers and is thrown into a multiverse adventure. His journey of self-discovery, coupled with the supporting cast of quirky and lovable Spider-People, creates a deeply emotional and relatable narrative.The voice acting is on point. In this film, shout out to Jake Johnson, who's portrayal as an old and experienced Peter Parker who hasn't just been through life as Spider-Man but also just the toils of life in general is so entertaining and also interesting. It's a new look on an iconic character which we've never seen before, yet love all the same.To an extent, the unique aesthetics themselves allow for a few laughs here and there. But there is so much comedy in this fairly emotional rollercoaster of a film that it's hard to even describe. From personal gags between characters to jokes based on the lives of New York citizens, every funny moment got at least a giggle out of me.The film's audio design is equally impressive, with a pulsating soundtrack that complements the frenetic energy of the visuals. You can see that many of the songs relate to Miles' struggle. Each song somehow carefully reflects a key aspect of the film, whether blatantly obvious or a little harder to realise. Also, the genres the songs fall into reflect Miles' urban upbringing and culture which is really something for an animated film.In the end,Nothing I could say could do this film justice. This film is treat for comic book lover and whose favourite super-hero is Spider-man. This film homage to the legacy of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko by capturing the spirit of their creation. The film's vibrant animation and complex characters are a testament to the enduring impact of their work.10/10🔥 #greatest ever animated movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Yet I didn't expect to be overwhelmed with just how enjoyable, actually funny and heartwarming the film was in the end surpassing what I wanted from the trailers being a good action spectacle film and thatd be it but instead getting a *Fantastic* action spectacle film with great heart and actual character to it which just happened to have phenomenal animation on top of it .Every single character was wonderful, Miles alone was a fantastic lead character with a great arc throughout his story, with all their chemistry being extremely snappy and well written with each of them bouncing off the other naturally and with great humor, a self aware tone not often captured by the other movies at least not to as effective a degree, between them making every scene a delight just to watch along with the stellar direction of each of them. Which is the same throughout the movie especially with flawless fight scenes with perfect choreography and cinematography with not a single fight less then spectacular all the while the art style making each fight feel unique and distinct from one another.The ST was extremely different and actually memorable for a Marvel movie actually complementing the film well with many tracks fitting extremely well to make each scene impact feel much more weighty.Importantly though this film captured everything that I wanted from Spider-Man as a character and concept with flawless execution from the music to the visuals to the characters overall just being a fantastic film being the best Marvel film I've ever seen and just a fantastic and fun film all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best Spider-Man movie.,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an excellent movie, debatably the best Spider-Man movie (although I haven't re-watched Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 in a while) and so far the best movie I've seen all year.The story is fairly standard for a Spider-Man movie, social outcast teenager (except this time Miles Morales instead of Peter Parker) has a bad relationship with his father, struggles to fit in at school, through a sequence of events becomes bitten by a radioactive spider, and uses his new-found powers to fight crime. However what this movie does to stay fresh is introduce the idea of multi-verses, which leads to all these different versions of Spider-Man (most notably aging Peter Parker and Spider-Woman) working together, and what that amounts to is a really great tribute to Spider-Man and all of his different comic book interpretations. I don't even read comics and I was really impressed with what was on screen, they even pay tribute/make fun of scenes in previous Spider-Man movies, like the notorious dancing segment in Spider-Man 3 (reminds me of The LEGO Batman Movie, another animated superhero film I really enjoyed).This movie also has some of, if not the best 3D animation I have ever seen, putting even the most recent Pixar movies to shame. It's not surprising that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, (who made Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and The LEGO Movie) worked on this movie, considering those are some of the most creative CG animated movies in recent memory. The movie is literally like watching a comic book read in front of you, there's text that appears in the corners of the screen exactly like a comic, lines that characters say follow them as they're walking around and even something as little as someone throwing a bagel at someone else have these cute sight gags which I honestly don't even want to spoil. I could talk about how great the stylization is in this movie for hours so I'll just leave it at that it's worth seeing the movie for this aspect alone.The story didn't exactly reinvent the superhero movie formula but for this movie it worked and there were tons of things about the script that played out in a really interesting way. Some of which I've already mentioned (like the tribute to the different versions of Spider-Man) but also the character of Miles Morales and the chemistry between him and Peter Parker. Miles needs a teacher to help him hone his powers, but Peter Parker is lazy and doesn't want to teach him, so that creates this interesting conflict where you wonder if he's even going to understand his powers by the end of the film. The movie also focused on the morality of Spider-Man, and whether or not vigilantes have a place in society, which felt like an idea that was left pretty much untapped in the prior Spider-Man movies, so despite the fact that this is a family movie it raises more mature ideas and themes than even the more adult entries in the Spider-Man series.As well as all of the above, the humour felt smart; there were tons of funny quips and character exchanges which I really appreciated, the film has a great soundtrack (a lot of hip-hop music that gives the movie a more urban vibe that the other movies didn't have) and the voice acting is really strong, my favourite performance being Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir. Really the only problem I had with the movie was Kingpin, I thought his character's backstory was sympathetic but when it came to his motivation it didn't feel fully fleshed out.Really though this is one of the best comic book movies of the past ten years. It's beautifully animated, funny, and has a really strong story that in some areas is more adult than any of the other Spider-Man films. It has a true understanding of the character of Spider-Man and after leaving the cinema I was reminded of why I love movies. I honestly wasn't even expecting that much and I can't sing its praises enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
New to comic based films,"Having watched all the MCU and new to comic based films it was pleasure to enjoy for 2 hours. Good visuals, plot line and story and great comedy.

"No, it's not over-hyped, it is that good.","Wow. That's the only word that I was able to articulate after being blown away by Spider-Verse. Normally I write my reviews as soon after seeing the movie as possible, however this time, I needed to give myself a few days to make sure I wasn't just riding the high that the movie leaves you on, and that it actually was as well-made as I thought. A few days later and my thoughts haven't changed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only the best animated movie of the year, it's also the best superhero movie of the year (and this is coming from someone who loved both Black Panther and Infinity War), and simply one of the best movies of the year period (not to mention the best Spider Man movie of all time). This film succeeds in every conceivable way: it's got well-written, compelling characters that are brought to life by superlative acting; the visuals are stunning and create the most immersive theater experience of the year; the action is thrilling and never gets repetitive; the story manages to be both completely groundbreaking while also paying homage to the Spider Man story we know and love; and best of all, the comedy is absolutely spot on, every single joke lands without feeling cheap or getting old. As good as this movie is across the board, I suspect it all stemmed from an impressively written screenplay. Not surprisingly, Phil Lord (and an uncredited Chris Miller), truly understands what people enjoy and relate to in the Spider Man story and brings that to the screen beautifully. What's accessible about the character of Spider Man is that he (or she) is just a normal kid who gets these extraordinary powers and learns to become a superhero. As great a character as Iron Man is, it's pretty hard for a child to relate to the hard-drinking billionaire who happens to fight crime. Spider Man is relatable because he is a superhero every person can see themselves becoming in those circumstances. And that is the thesis of this film. Anyone can be Spider Man. The introduction of the Spider-Verse actually serves this message and enhances the story, which is what made the movie so enjoyable. At no point did the multi-verse concept feel like a device for selling toys (ahem... Porgs), but instead was a natural way to set up Miles Morales. There are only two things I could think of that could get criticized in Spider-Verse, the first is its inaccessibility to people who don't like Spider Man or superheroes, and the second is its visual style might not work for everyone. To address the first issue, I suspect there will be people who think this movie is only entertaining for people who already enjoy Spider Man properties, but I strongly disagree. Taking the Spider Man aspect out of this film, there's still a lot of great storytelling at work. Within this movie is a coming of age story about a black-hispanic kid trying to fit into his almost all-white high school, a story about a father trying to relate to his son, a story about a man who has given up on life who needs someone younger and more hopeful to show him the way, and a damn good science fiction story about a multi-verse. All of these narratives work without the superhero aspect, and I think make this film completely accessible to someone who has never seen a Spider Man movie before. The second issue about the visual style I understand a bit more, as initially the visuals didn't work for me. The style is shaky and imperfect and I felt like I was watching a 3-D movie without glasses. However, I realized they meant for the look to be imperfect and rough around the edges, just like worn out comic book come to life. I think part of the problem is that in recent years, with Pixar and Illumination movies, animation has gotten so refined and smooth, that is was at first off putting to see something break out of that mold. But after about 30 minutes, my eyes adjusted and I was able to get absorbed into the world they created. In summary, Spider-Verse is a mesmerizing movie that is firing on all cylinders and absolutely succeeds. It's funny, smart, heartfelt, with a message that makes me feel as hopeful and optimistic as I did when I was a kid seeing Toby Maguire become Spider Man for the first time. If you love Spider Man, you will 100% eat this movie up, and if you don't already love the wall-crawling hero, you will by the end of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

It ain't all that.,"Seriously?! I can't get all the 10 reviews at all. I really wanted to like this. Indeed, I thought I would. Truly. But it just didn't deliver on so many levels. I felt deflated by the end of it. Having been impressed by the Easter egg at the end of the last Marvel movie I was expecting a lot I have to admit. But the reviews told me my predictions of an incredible movie would be seen out and then some, but it just wasn't. The story, interesting? Yes. But beyond expectations? No. The look of the movie? Again, no complaints. My problems with this? Hmmmm... well, I guess I would have to start with there just being too many characters, the creators just seem to be trying too hard to touch ALL the bases. In that respect I guess they simply bit off more than they could chew.As I asked my gf having watched it, 'What scenes really surprised you? Answer, none. Were there any outstanding scenes? Once more, a none came forth. To be honest, it was the same for me as well. Really moving and emotional scenes? Nope. Not a one. Comedy? Truly laugh out loud scenes, yet again, a negatori. This movie has been lauded as a game-changer, and yet I fail to see why. Could someone explain why that's so? For now, I remain in the dark.Bottom line, this is NOT. A bad movie but any stretch of the imagination and yet it left me feeling non-plussed, that may well be to do with the fact that in the morning I saw the utterly brilliant Green Book. Anyway, go to see and judge for yourselves but for me it was well-short of the mark, sadly.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Cool, but deserved a better villain!","A lot of things will please even an old time spiderfan like me. The freshness, the concept of the multiverse and the variations on the carachter are all very cool, but I have to say they missed the mark on the badguy department. And I say this not only about this movie but I also say almost everytime some Marvel production uses Wilson Fisk (except for Daredevil, offcourse) as the main villain. Kingpin is only a human, and even been a big and strong one, is unacceptable that he, or anyone like him, can face spiderman in a fist fight.

The Best Spiderman Movie Ever,"Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is Sony's latest attempt to cash in on their license to Marvel's Spider-man franchise (like Venom), is one of the best non-MCU affiliated endeavors Sony has ever produced. While Venom was a refreshing update to the character's origin story, after the disastrous outing in Spider-man 3, it still lacked the presence of his most crucial adversary-Spider-man. With the infectiously fun Tom Holland's take on the web crawler side-lined till 2019, Sony needed to keep their only superhero franchise in the public sphere. However, this time, they took the bold step of animating the Spider-man franchise with a story centered around his multiverse doppelganger-Miles Morales.For those who are unfamiliar with Miles, he's an Afro-Latino character introduced in the comics world in 2011 as Marvel experimented with shedding their homogenous base and reached out to attract readers of all cultures. In Spiderman-Homecoming, he's briefly mentioned by Donald Glover's modest take on The Prowler. He even appears in Sony's newest PS4 Spider-man game, so the ground was tilled in advance of his arrival. Moreover, his appearance is nothing short of spectacular.Miles is a charming teenager with loving parents who are willing to send him away to ensure he receives a world-class education and the best chance at success in a dangerous world. He is the by-product of Gen-X age parents who were reared the same way. When he discovers his powers after the all-to-familiar radioactive spider bite, he has a chance encounter with the real Spider-man and soon has his entire world torn apart (literally) when an experiment by King Pin sucks multiple versions of Spider-man, into Miles reality. These multiverse Spider-people include two female versions of the acclaimed hero, two additional male versions, and a Looney Toons inspired pig version. It sounds like a recipe for disaster narratively. Surprisingly, the story works amazingly well. Moreover, that's not the only thing that works well in this film.
Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse blends the beauty of 3-D animation with the stylized look of ink to paper art. The union creates a fascinating phantasmagoria of lucid animation that will leave you in awe of its quality for the first half of the movie. When you're done being mesmerized by that, there's still room on your plate for a heartfelt story about friendship, discovering one's purpose and the love of family - all the things you've come to expect from this franchise. There's enough heart in this movie to make you care about the stakes in this film-which are felt early on and repeated later in the movie to remind you that this isn't a rated-G film.Now, it would be irresponsible to ignore Stan Lee's overriding message that the diversity of the Spiderverse (or Marvel in general) is a good thing in an era of diversity resistance. Miles parrots this, and so do all the other versions of Spider-man. Moreover, it's true. There's enough room in this world for multiple versions of this superhuman and we should all welcome updated take on the character when they're done this well.This film is a dazzling display of style and story. The tongue in cheek narration finds a way to celebrate the ups and downs of the Toby McGuire & Andrew Garfield Spiderman eras. Also, it's as much of a nod to the past as it is a celebration of the future of this franchise. Now, if Sony can find a way to make its villains as intense as they were in this movie-in their live-action films-they will be able to milk the franchise for all it's worth.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Into The Spider Verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie that nobody asked for - it's one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, period.","THE LOW-DOWN: Does the world really need another Spider-Man movie? In just over 15 years, we've already had three different Peter Parkers, each one with the same basic origin story. It's a reliable formula that's been run into the ground... hasn't it? And yet, Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse will have you clamouring for more. This fresh, funny, fantastic film proves that there's entire universes of mileage left in all things Spider-Man - introducing us to brand-new hero Miles Morales, while also dissecting (and reinforcing) our love for good ol' Peter Parker.THE STORY: Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a high-school kid just trying to figure out his purpose in life - which sharpens somewhat terrifyingly into focus when he's bitten by a radioactive spider and finds himself literally climbing the walls. Suddenly, he's forced to assume the mantle of Spider-Man, battling to save the world from the heartbroken insanity of Wilson Fisk (Liev Schreiber). It's a tall order for a half African-American, half Puerto-Rican kid from Brooklyn but, fortunately, Miles soon discovers that he isn't alone in the universe...THE GOOD: Where to even begin? Into The Spider Verse is a delight in practically every way. First and foremost, it's remarkably refreshing to see a character like Miles - a young man of mixed-race descent - get his own superhero origin story. It helps enormously that the screenplay, credited to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, is equal parts sweet, sharp and snarky. Some superhero movies (*cough*DC*cough*) can take themselves too seriously, but Into The Spider Verse skewers Spider-Man's cinematic history with a cheeky charm that's impossible to resist. Miles also leads a cast of enormously appealing characters, including clever twists on fan favourites like Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), Aunt May (Lily Tomlin), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and Doctor Octopus (REDACTED).THE NOT-SO-GOOD: There's almost too much going on, all the time. Into The Spider Verse is stuffed to the brim with multiple characters, multiple universes and multiple plot-lines - so much so that the emotional weight of Miles' fraught relationships with his dad (Brian Tyree Henry) and uncle (Mahershala Ali), which should tear audiences apart, comes close to getting lost amongst the shift and shuffle of the plot. It's hardly a deal-breaker, though: the narrative beats are all there, ready to be savoured and rediscovered on a rewatch.THE GLORIOUSLY GEEKY: Comic-book fans, rejoice - this one's for you. There's a soul-deep love for Spider-Man lore threaded through every gorgeous frame of this movie. Naturally, it's right there in the plot, as alternate universes collide and truly cult characters tumble into Miles' life. But it's the medium of animation that makes the real difference here. It's why Into The Spider Verse can embrace its comic-book roots in a way that live-action movies can't. In some of the film's most visually arresting sequences, Miles leaps and soars in and out of frame, trailing sound effects and narration in his wake. This living, breathing comic-book effect is the crowning achievement of Sony's animation arm - not only is it fluid and stunning, it's ridiculously inventive, mixing and matching animation styles to further plot and develop character.WATCH OUT FOR: Easter eggs galore! Spider-Man and Marvel aficonados should keep their eyes peeled for references peppered throughout the film. The late Stan Lee's cameo will break and warm your heart in equal measure. Meanwhile, Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, who co-created Miles Morales, are name-checked, as are concepts and terms well-known to fans of the comics (Earth-616 and all). Stay through the credits for a series of of wonderful, silly rewards, including a song off Spider-Man's novelty Christmas album and some intriguing scenes that hint at where this new animated franchise might go. (A sequel and spin-offs have already been greenlit! 🙌) ALSO, this film features possibly the best use of Nicolas Cage in a movie since National Treasure!*RECOMMENDED? YES. Into The Spider Verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie that nobody asked for - it's one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, period. It's also a top contender for best animated film of the year.*Okay, fine, having Cage voice Superman in this year's Teen Titans Go! To The Movies was genius too - a nod to his life-long goal to play Superman. Maybe Cage should stick to voiceover work... 🤔",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Probably the best Spiderman movie,"I am notre a huge fan of any of the Spiderman movies from the last decade. Raimi's trilogy, the Amazing films, and homecoming though good had a lot of major flaws. This time they focus on a different Spiderman and the overall message of the movie is that basically anyone could be Spiderman. This idea allows the spectator to easily relate to the main character which works perfectly. You feel everything the lead is going through, from his excitement to his fears. I'm not usually a big fan of origin stories, but this one I really loved. I guess the movie might be a little bit difficult to follow if you're going blind into the movie (if you don't know anything about Spiderman before watching this one). But aside from that it's an extremely creative movie, with compelling characters and amazing pop-style animation (very stylized so it might not appeal to everyone but it definitely worked for me). The comedy works, the drama is also effective, I just don't see any major flaw especially comparer to other Spiderman films. It's just a great movie that almost redeems Sony animation for making the emoji movie. I really hope it does well in theaters and that we can get a sequel because this spiderverse has a lot of potential if it's treated this way.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Wow! Just, Wow!","This movie is not only going to redefine what an animated movie should look like, it's going to raise the expectation level of what any superhero movie should feel like. The creators combined traditional animation with pixar-style animation and then went even further and developed a new way of blending colors, text, dialogue and music so the audience feels like they are living inside a comic book. I actually tried to find a scene or moment where the animators maybe cheaped out or half-assed something and I couldn't. Every scene, every sequence . . . hell, every frame was stunning.The protagonist is Miles Morales, an accidental spiderman set in our world and the writers do a great job of really developing him well in a very short time. An alternate universe Peter Parker also enters our world and his character harkens back to the Sam Raimi films and genuflects to Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2 and justifiably jibes Spiderman 3. There's also Spiderwoman, Film Noir Spiderman, Anime Spidergirl and Spiderpig. If I had any complaint, it's that these last three characters seem tacked on in anticipation of sequels or extended universe planning.Also, this movie had hands-down the best Stan Lee cameo ever. You may think it's more sentimental because of his passing just recently and that may be a factor but I assure you that's not why it's great. It's like they finally figured out the best way to portray the great creator in a way fitting to his legacy.Also, Definitely stick around until the very end of the credits.

Anyways. Apart from the politics and history I had hoped the story had more guts and less of the cliches. Too many loose ends in my opinion. As this is not a spoiler I will not get into them.

Yes the story matters and yes the quality of production also matters, but to me the music throughout a film is really important. If you don't have the right music/sound, but everything else is perfect, it kills the mood. The music sets the tone throughout the movie and that's exactly what they did with this movie.I will definitely be buying this when it comes out on dvd and blue ray and would definitely pay to see it a second time.

"7.4 - Now listen up, because I have watched a LOT of animated movies.","This movie started off fine. What I noticed was that the humour was probably intended for people under the age of 16, because I just ignored the unfunny with this movie. I liked the animation style (which is pretty much the same style throughout the movie, with extra junk added in), but I found the story cheesy. There was a basic theme about trusting yourself throughout. Isn't that what you get from Disney Junior?I liked the movie. But by the end of it I was becoming a bit tired of the story and characters (and it's not just because it was long for an animated movie). Great movies don't do that.I'm a DC fan. Regardless, I have enjoyed some of the recent Marvel movies. But this movie... I'd heard it was good and it is currently rated 8.6/10 here; the 21st best movie in the world, according to imdb. I mean how is it possibly beating Interstellar?Whatever.It's good, but not great. In conclusion, I think that this movie was intended for children. Maybe you are thinking ""Well, duh"", but all of my 18-year-old friends loved it, so I guess that's what's leaving me confused. If you want good cartoon movies, see Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, or Under the Red Hood.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I was a skeptic,"I have to admit that I only went to see this movie because I'm a good big brother. That said, I was proved WRONG. The art style was incredible, but I could tell that from the trailers. What had me wondering was the batsh** crazy plot conflict.
I will readily admit that comic books are often a bit sillier than most forms of entertainment, but Into the Spider-Verse actually managed to sell it. The comedy was genuine, the soundtrack was amazing, the character designs were on point, and the whole thing came together in an amazing way.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

My favorite Spider-Man movie of all time,"Out of every Spider-Man movie I've seen, this movie is the most satisfying Spider-Man film I've ever watched. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse not only tells the story about Miles Morales becoming Spider-Man, but a machine that has the ability to open the multiverse that holds many Spider-People such as Spider-Gwen, Noir Spider-Man, Spider-Pig, etc.While the story is both great and fun, the film also has heart added to the film which is great because you really get attach to the character especially Miles who I really feel for throughout the movie. The animation is really like a comic book is coming to life, not only does the animation helps the action sequence looks so awesome, but each Spider-Character has their own animation style that looks good.With Sony co-owning the Spider-Man rights, along with the MCU, I can see the possibility of this movie having a sequel, they don't need to retell the same story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man many times, they can open up the world that is full of Spider-People such as Spider-Man 2099, Scarlet Spider-Man, Cosmic Spider-Man, Spider Carnage, and more.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the most creative and original movies I've seen,"This is one of those rare instances where all the creators, the directors, writers, animators, actors, musicians, everyone, are able to put together a film that is both a homage to the rich history of a long established franchise without being subservient to it and also takes it into mind blowing, eye popping, emotion wrenching new directions.

"It's the best Spidey film and dare I say it, the best MCU film of the year! Go see it!","Where do I begin with this film? I'll keep it brief:
Hopefully zero spoilers!
Let's start with the visuals - Sony have taken the game forward with this animation! It's breathtaking, beautiful and really is like you're watching a living comic book. It's visually stunning and defines the quality of this film from outset. Even the dots on the screen to represent the comic book style - amazing!The story is so good and does justice to bring the Miles Morales story to the fore. Mixing the characters from the multiverse is done so well - all lovable given the right amount of screen time respectively.It's genuinely funny - if no one laughs when you watch it then it's probably the zombie apocalypse - the jokes are heartfelt and honest. That's not to say that this film doesn't have the feels - it does - but used in the right way.Finally - the music. We all know Post Malone is a genius and this soundtrack is epic - better than Kendrick Lamar's Black Panther - and used so well throughout the film.This ia a wonderful film that will make you fall in love with or reaffirm your love for Spiderman while at the same time introducing Miles Morales as the future of the Spider-verse.Stay for both post-credit scenes - worth it. Also look out for Stan Lee's cameo in the film - emotional.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Incredible romp-- but just a tad over the top,"I really enjoyed this movie, not because of all the animation and special effects, but because of the character portrayals. Six Spider-people, all vastly different, even drawn / portrayed in different manner (some 3-D CGI some hand-drawn). The combination was a delight to watch and made the movie.Peter Parker B was a little too stupid and goofy to be believable as Spiderman. Sure, he's been through a lot, and it's conceivable he'd be burned out. But they were just a bit too over the edge with the ""washed out Spideran"" routine.On the other hand, SpiderGwen (Spider Woman? Wasn't that a different character?) was the exact opposite, and a delight. Proficient, smart, the exact opposite of the original Parker, they absolutely nailed that character.Peter Porker was hilarious as expected. SpiderNoir was different and interesting. The anime SpiderGirl was VERY different and a joy to see thrown into the mix. Was enjoyable watching her working expertly at the control panel of her robot while munching down on snacks. Aunt May rocked.The main character was realistic, flawed, confused, and the most human of the bunch. Very well done.The reason I give this 8 stars instead of 10 is because the film would have sent an epileptic into grand mal seizures. Especially near the end of the film, the fight scene in the collider room was just excessively busy and confusing... almost to the point it became difficult to follow and unenjoyable. Turning the dial down about 5 notches might have made for a better, more plausible ending and allowed the audience to focus on what was going on rather than trying to figure out what was going on.That was it's primary negative: just too busy. In any work of art, ""too busy"" is a major flaw. They needed to tone it down a bit in those final scenes. I'm sure it appealed greatly to the adrenaline junkies or young kids who have been brought up playing super-frenetic video games. For others though, that was like being force-fed a gourmet meal; too much and too fast to enjoy it.Aside from that... there was some sort of quasi-red/blue 3D effect going on that wasn't really 3D effect (I tried viewing with my 3D glasses just to see. No dice.) I don't know what all that was about... but just added to the confusing nature of the animation and was totally unnecessary to the style.Aside from that the movie was very well done. Good characters, good relationships between characters, stories to tell and well-told. Top of the bar when it comes to animated flicks; one of the best I've seen. If they'd have been a little less jump-the-shark at the end, would have been a near-perfect movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Over-Hyped,"The most over-hyped movie of the year. Now, I'm not a comic book fan, nor an MCU fan although I've enjoyed a few, especially ""Spider-Man Homecoming,"" which I loved as I'm a sucker for those teenage, coming of age tales. The animation style was lovely in this movie but, the plot was humdrum and there was little character development and none of the witty repartee that is such a hallmark of the best animated films that appeal to both children and adults. This should have focused on Miles Morales getting a disillusioned Peter Parker to train him and get his mojo back. THe other iterations of Spider-Man were unnecessary. This was truly little more than a mediocre kids' animated movie. The small audience in my Friday morning theater was exclusively adult and there was little reaction from the audience throughout. Sitting in the Dolby theater, with the recliner in use, I actually thought about taking a snooze at least a couple of times during the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

However, Spiderman breaks the mold in every way, being one of the most beautiful and innovative pieces of animation that has ever been created. It is in the top 5 pieces of animation ever created in my opinion. It's relatable, and shows us that it doesn't matter what we look like or where we come from, anyone can wear the mask. Not to mention, it is the ONLY comic book movie that has been created to date in my opinion. The dotted and comicbook-driven aesthetic is unbelievable, and captures your attention every moment of the film. An absolutely wonderful movie that has deserved every award it has already won, and every award it is up for in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Excellent, light-hearted fun and a nice animation showcase","--The direction and writing took ques from comic book conventions and took jabs at them, which was well done and amusing. Miles and the rest of the cast are affable peeps with just enough character to make the movie a fun watch. Despite running the risk of having too many characters in one movie, they do a decent job of introducing the important ones. That said, the stuff they touch on could have prolly been better served by a show. This would give the story room to unfold and do character development properly instead of one and done scenes which were about 10 seconds each. The short format and pacing of the movie also meant some plot contrivances pop up and overall the script was pretty thin.--The soundtrack mixed modern hip-hop with classic movie style music. The intention was likely to capture the cultural feel of youth today, which will make the soundtrack pretty short-lived. Although it adds good flair to the movie at times, I personally did not enjoy this choice. Overall, the soundtrack is serviceable and competently done.--There were some shots which felt like I had a copy of the movie which was intended for viewing with 3D glasses. (this was not the case) This was very distracting, but ultimately didn't hurt the movie too much.--This movie is kid friendly and can be a good family watch. Hope you'll also have fun with this one if you give it a go. Cheers.****Animation tech rant which you can skip:--The animation included a stutter which imitated the limitations of doing 2D animation at 24 frames per second, aka traditional animation. I believe this choice is superior to the unnervingly smooth quality of most 3D animation done on film so far. I've seen other animated movies which tried to incorporate that stutter, but mostly failing to do so. It felt obvious that standard 3D animation was done, and then someone ran a script over it which introduced the stuttering. To be fair, this movie must have been done the same way. But whoever programmed the script which introduced the stutter did a much better job. Instead of being an obvious imitation of the 2D animation stutter, it felt almost organic. Still doesn't feel it's quite where it should be, but it's pretty good.--Speaking of animation tech, I love the combo of physics-based animation. I'm certain it was done here as well, and it worked very well. It's allowing animators to risk doing much more complex scenes, without the time constraints of animating them bloating to such insane proportions that it shuts down production of the movie.--2D animation has had some incredible artistic work done in its realm, and it's about time 3D animation showed up. While this movie is decidedly not art, the animation done in it is a huge step in the right direction and I look forward to seeing where this animation road takes us.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A love letter for the legend, Stan Lee and to fans of Spider-Man as a whole.","Best animated superhero movie out there. It almost makes me want to trust Sony again... almost, since the Emoji Movie, Ghostbusters '16 and the other endless trash they've put out recently like those horrid Adam Sandler junk are still out there and it severely dampens my view on them.BUT if they still want to make another Spider-Man-esque film franchise again that doesn't feel like a forced, half-assed, desperate cash grab *cough* TASM *cough* Venom, then this is a really solid start and I would love to see more of it, as long as it's good of course. Like seriously, this film is what a Spider-Man movie should be AND more! it just oozes with uniqueness, mainly due to the animation style and its colorful band of characters.The only flaws I had with this film was the slight misuse of the soundtrack since there were a scene or two where it didn't fit in with the moment shown. The story was also quite clichéd for the most part, but there are some decent twists here and there. Overall I don't think the flaws I listed out won't bother the average movie-goer that much and this film is still a blast even if you don't have much prior knowledge about Spider-Man in the comics or films, though they would help in understanding the plethora of Spider-references this movie has.Props to the crew and cast who worked on this fantastic film, they truly deserve the praise. 2018 truly was the best year for us Spider-Man fans in a long time. Stan Lee would be at peace knowing his greatest creation has flourished from the humble beginnings on paper, to the grandiose state of stardom in the fictional world and pop culture.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Absolutely everything one would want from an animated Spider-Man movie,"This one is a complete home run. I'm pretty sure that the praise for this movie will be positively one-sided and for very good reason.Quickly touching on the negative . Like there's only two things I didn't like about this movie. The first is the narrative cliche's found in every super hero movie ever so its not a big fault but it happens and it annoys me but only ever so slightly. The second is when a character learns a particular skill set just by deciding he wants to be good at it, its an unconvincing way to further the story and a pretty lazy one.But all that is only about 5% of the whole movie. The rest is an absolute overload of the senses in a very very good way.I don't want to mention the characters in this movie because some of them might surprise you so all of them worked and all of them were fantastic.The movie is crazy funny, and its funny in a way that is actually refreshing in modern blockbusters. Its funny without being political. CONGRATULATIONS you didn't make any politically charged jokes that are one sided in a big budget Sony movie. I hope this new trend continues where jokes aren't politicized in movies.The voice acting is spot on from everyone, don't want to mention names as some might be a surprise.I find the story to be almost on par with everyones favorite Spider-Man stories (Rami) in terms of quality, mainly because all the central themes and character morality are there in the story. Power, responsibility and all that jazz. It isn't empty like in the Amazing Spider-Man .The thing that surprised me most about this movie (aside from how genuinely funny it is) is how much emotion there is at it's core. Family, friends and sacrifice are a huge undertone of the movies core message.The main thing I took away from the film is the visuals. Holy every god ever this movie is gorgeous as hell. The most gorgeous in recent memory, and certainly my personal favorite visuals in an animated movie ever.9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"An Overrated flick, but not a bad one.","Note: I say it's overrated, but I still think it deserved the Oscar. Now To the review!
When I heard this film had a 97 percent on RT, I was shocked. A Spider-Man movie with a 97% and everyone including some random dude chanting in a Apex Legends lobby screaming INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE RULES!? My friend (who is a freaking legend) gave me a copy of Into the Spider-Verse and when I went home, I instantly watched it. I then proceeded to say ""Wow"" and thought it was the best Spider-Man. Several months later and rewatching it several times, Yeah, This isn't the best Spider-Man (not even close). This film has several flaws that kinda hurts it for me. 1. Dr. Ock sucks. I disliked Dr. Ock in this film, I question her motive and I questioned even more about how did she end up like this? 2. A pig Spider-Man? Really? Okay, I'm kidding about that, that isn't a flaw, Although, I still question out of all the Spider-Mans, Why this one? 3. Aunt May feels out of place. 4. Several origin stories feel somewhat rushed. 5. The self-awareness just doesn't work. 6. Most of the Jokes feel out of place.

Spider-Man meets The Lego Movie,"Man I'm shocked to like this movie as much as I did. I never would have guessed it would have been one of my favourites of 2018. I expected the usual standard Superhero CGI Animated movie, but looking at the credits now and noticing people behind The Lego Movie wrote and produced it, it all started to make sense.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse could very well be the best Spider-Man movie ever! The animation was very stylish with mix of CGI and Comic-Book style art. This is a movie that did not take itself seriously at all, and with many different universes of Spider-Men it just went crazy and gave us a real packed 2 hours of entertainment. The use of music was decent, there was alot of heart to it, surprises, good gags, and it all felt fresh and interesting to the series.Overall, a real standout for Sony Pictures Animation and a very high bar set for Animated Superhero movies, giving other Animated movies a run for their money.8.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This in combination with good action gets the movie op to a 7. To get higher I want to care more. I didn't care much about the characters. Maybe because it's animated and I am not used to it.

Arachnophobia,"A technical marvel, with lush animation that is unlike anything put on the screen previously - Spider-verse is an overwhelming stew of excess that throws so much at the screen it's sometimes hard to tell what sticks - and which part of it to look at. There are so many characters, so much emotion and so many quick fire gags both in the script and on the screen that a re-watch is surely a must to help put things into perspective. At first glance however not enough time was spent on any one plot line or device in order to give it the weight that the emotional stakes needed them to have - for example the primary villain's motivation, Jake Johnson's ageing Spiderman's love life, and particularly Miles Morales complex family problems, control of his powers, and acceptance of his role in the larger world. Slyly aware of its place within the diversifying superhero market, Spider-verse is reverent to the history of the character, both on-screen and off. Ultimately the fact that no one character stands out may be by design, they are all just cyphers to carry the film's true message - that anyone can be a superhero, or maybe that anyone can take something away from a superhero movie if it has this much in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A masterpeice,"From the animation to the humour I adore this movie. The animation is mind blowing, it's beyond words. The comic style animation works great with this film and it was quite a risky move but it paid off. Everything in this film was polished to it's best. The jokes are just hilarious not one time did I not laugh with them when they wanted me to, I think I speak for everyone in the screening. One negative was that some moments really shouldn't of had rap music over them as it just killed the mood. At moments this film really touched me on a personal level and I'm just so confused about how this film does everything amazingly.

My Least favourite Spider-Man movie. Definitely NOT what the critics led me to believe.,"99% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is the Highest rated DC and Marvel movie EVER! And an 8.6 IMDB rating...so i had high hopes going in, plus i love the previous Spider-Man movies but boy was this one average, below average actually hence my 4/10. I feel duped by the critics AGAIN. The critics scores for this movie are WAY too suspicious for this.Let's get the animation out of the way first since they seem to be raving about it so much. Through watching many many animations we all know that nice visuals don't make for an entertaining film, especially if the other components of storytelling don't add up. The animation was as good as any good ones out there already, so i would say that it's not a good reason to go and spend loads on money at the cinema for that reason alone. This definitely can be watched at home. At random times throughout the film they do this kind of 3D visuals animation which give your eyes and head a funny turn tbh. If you've watched a 3D movie without glasses then you'll know what i mean.The film was so haphazard editing and story wise that it really took you out of the flow of the story, so it made it difficult to stay connected to the characters and story. This made it feel like it was aimed at young children to stop them from losing interest. It almost just felt like constant random scenes which didn't flow smoothly story wise.The other thing that made the film tiresome when trying to connect to the characters/story was the use of jokes/one-liners, they were relentless and was full of them. I love comedy in superhero films, the MCU do a great job of that and the previous Spider-Man movies too but this was like a kids animation style of non-stop but with adult humour, that i'm afraid i didn't laugh at once...and i usually laugh at nearly everything. Besides myself, there was only an adult and 2 children in the screen and i didn't hear them laugh either tbh.The story was pretty standard, exactly what the trailer tells you but i did get restless and bored when there was no action.Its my least favourite Spider-Man movie and as animations go its not good either, especially when you've got Pixar, Illuniation, Manga, etc delivering such epic and fun movies already.Nicolas Cage was my favourite Spider-Man in this, even though he wasn't one of the central characters and didn't get much screen time. It would be great if they made a film just centered around his character sometime.There were 2 or 3 short emotional scenes in this that i liked, i'm a sucker for that stuff lol.There is a post-credits scene so stay til the very end.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"This movie had no right to be THIS good, this movie DOES compete for the title of best Spider-Man movie to date","I'm usually against hyperbolic reviews and reactions to movies but this movie seriously deserves the accolades it has been getting lately. First off let me get something straight... You are not in the wrong room, nor did the theater forget to give you 3D glasses if you are watching this movie in 2D. The movie goes for a stylistic choice in which they color backgrounds like how old comics misprinted colors on paper (they go ""outside the line""), the animation isn't ""choppy"", characters are animated at times in 12 fps while some backgrounds seem to be 24 fps. This all sound weird huh? I did feel weird at first until I realized it is a stylistic choice. Now that we get that clear... the movie is VISUALLY STUNNING.This is the first movie I can really say that seems like a comic brought to another medium without losing anything. A perfect translation of what a comic can be in movie form. No video game, no Pixar movie, no Dreamworks movie no other piece of entertainment has the same style this movie has and that's a giant plus. I did rewatch the movie in 3D and I have to say it's one of the finest movie experiences I've had in years. When was the last time you came out of the theater feeling like you watched something absolutely *fresh*? I was not expecting this from a Comic Book Movie, I was not expecting this from YET ANOTHER Spider-Man movie but here I am, leaving a review for a film I enjoyed so much that I watched twice. I can see the style of this movie being replicated for years to come. As far as storyline goes the story is good and packs punches where you might not necessarily expect them. If you're a comic book fan of old or a Spider-Man fan you owe it to yourself to watch this movie as it is literally filled with fan-service throughout. If you're a fan of the cinema medium and you want something stylistically fresh then you ALSO owe it to yourself to watch this movie.This really is an excellent movie for both young audiences and adults of any age, more than a coming of age movie this is a visual spectacle and a feat in itself to achieve what I consider the most fresh movie to come out of this whole ocean of comic book phenomenon. There are 2 after-credit scenes, not going to spoil them. Have I talked about the soundtrack yet? You can listen to it on Youtube or Spotify, it is a testament to how true to character and risky this movie went for. I was not expecting SONY of all studios to actually make a movie of this quality and simultaneously set-up the possibility of other movies in this style (not necessarily Spider-Man). Have I mentioned the people involved in this movie yet? Great people all around who have been involved in some of the most unique movies in the last few years.Seriously, give the movie a shot. I picked this movie as an accident because I arrived too late for another one and ended up loving this movie immensely. This movie DOES compete for the title of best Spider-Man movie to date.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Surprising and Entraining,"Bottom Line Up Front...If you like comic book based films, you are likely to enjoy this one. Plot is different, not cookie cutter. Voices are well chosen and the pace of the films is about right after an initial slow start.I usually don't like films that use this type of animation but in this case, it works. The plot is different which helps tremendously and the occasional use of ""pure comic book"" animation brings some nostalgia to the film. At times I felt I was watching the old Adam West Batman show but with A LOT less ""cheese"".The use of a different villain was also nice for this installment of Spider man. The diversity of the spider""people"" was also well balanced and was the use of each spider""person's"" special ability.This film surprised me.

"Puts the ""Amazing"" back into ""Spider-Man""","I didn't quite expect this level of good when going to the cinema - Into The Spider-Verse ended up delivering on pretty much everything.The jokes are actually funny - no underage cringy garbage shoehorned by Disney into their movies. Special thanks to Nicholas ""Noir"" Cage. The visual style is astonishing, pays close homage to the comics, but still looks distinct and aesthetically pleasing. The drama here surprisingly works, and some moments in this movie are very far from being childish. Of course the Spider-Verse also has a ton of references to everything from the Raimi trilogy to the recent PS4 game, and they're also great, make sure to stay for the after-credits scene. Even the protagonist Morales also works, as opposed to the aforementioned PS4 game, where he was kind of dull.So yeah, miles (no pun intended) ahead of the MCU and of Sony's own previous live-action attempts, Into The Spider-Verse is a great animated movie, totally looking forward to the announced spin-off and sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Spiderman Venture in Years,"If there's one notable superhero with a very hit or miss track record when it comes to their film adaptations, it has to be Marvel's iconic Spider-Man. Whether they be the right blend of goofiness and emotional drama with Sam Raimi's trilogy, or the embarrassingly lackluster Amazing Spider-Man series, the web slinging hero has been through as many duds as successes. However, there has never really been an animated feature with this hero or any incarnations....until now. Ever since the first trailer dropped last year, the buzz for this particular film blew up, mainly due to it focusing on a new Spider-Man, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales. After finally seeing it, I can officially confirm that the wait was beyond worth it.The main storyline revolves around Miles Morales becoming the next Spiderman after getting bitten by a radioactive spider. However, the evil Kingpin creates a portal to other universes that goes haywire and ends up pulling distinct versions of Spider-Man into Miles' world. Upon meeting Peter Parker, Miles now has to take Kingpin down and bring those incarnations back. With all that said, the film rests on Miles' shoulders to lead, and he is one hell of a protagonist. Alongside being very likable, the film does a great job of establishing his relationships, personality and even emotions. I also like how he only grows accustomed to his powers after many trials and tribulations with all the craziness going around. Even his interactions with Peter Parker feel like that of an apprentice learning from a master, they're so much fun to watch.In addition, the film happens to be a great blend of self referential humor and emotional drama. Screenwriters Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman cram in plenty of in-jokes for hardcore Spider-Man fans in a subtle manner without losing newcomers, making them feel connected within the narrative. As for the emotional weight, it stems from Miles' different bonds between his father and uncle Aaron, and both are well woven into the plot. There are even scenes with the two around Miles that one would never expect from a film like this. For a film with several villains, they all have just enough screen time to be memorable, especially Kingpin, mainly because his reasons behind making the portal are more elaborate than first assumed. Never has a superhero film managed to squeeze in the right amount of humor and pathos to work well as a part comedy and part drama since The Incredibles and The Lego Batman Movie.As for the other characters, Peter Parker is established as the pessimistic hero turned failure, yet his relation with Miles gains him more confidence to get back into the swing of things (no pun intended). Throughout the film, we really feel for the guy and want him to succeed as much as Miles, making him come off as a sympathetic albeit charismatic mentor. Gwen Stacy is also appropriately placed within the film's narrative, as rather than being a Mary Sue, she plays as a voice of reason to Miles and hopes the best for him, like a real partner should do. As for the multiple dimensions featured, there's the 1930s serious dramatic Spider-Noir, the goofy and comical Spider-Ham, and the bubbly anime girl Peni Parker. While not given as much attention as Miles and Peter, they still end up stealing the show with their distinct quirks and charm, and their voice actors, especially Nic Cage, bring them to life as much as the script and animators do. It's rare when a film is able to squeeze in so many characters yet still manages to give them enough presence to leave an impact.Lastly, the animation is incredibly versatile, vivid, colorful and even grim, really emulating the feel of a graphic comic book. The characters are all uniquely designed based on their appearance and personality, especially the Spider-Man incarnations looking distinct based on their physical appearance. Spider-Noir is black & white with shadows all around, Spider-Ham is very cartoony and bouncy, and Peni Parker is every anime girl ever made cranked up to 11. Not to mention, the action scenes are fantastically well directed, as the stakes really rise up with a lot of well choreographed fighting moves and a briskly paced flow. It's also worth praising how the film conveys its emotions through the color scheme depending on the scene, saying way more than any amount of dialogue ever could. My only issue with the animation is that it can look a little blurry at times, but that's more of a nitpick as it's intentionally built that way.Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has got to be my absolute favorite addition in the Spiderman film franchise. It also might be the most imaginative and innovative comic book film on screen in years thanks to its wonderful stylistic choices, humorous antics, well woven drama, and characters you will never forget. If you are yet to see this, please give this film as much support as you can, it's definitely a blast to sit through. We rarely get superhero films like this nowadays, so giving it the attention it deserves will mean more sequels and huge cult status for years to come. Sony Pictures Animation has only scratched the surface with what Miles Morales can do, so here's to more great adventures with the new up and coming Spider-Man in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The movie just seemed to do everything right for me and I can't think of any flaws or really anything I have wrong with it, it's practically a flawless Spider-Man movie and the best comic book film of the year alongside Infinity War and also the best animated movie of the year and one of the best of the decade.All the characters were very refreshing and a much needed change from previous comic book films and the humour and storytelling in it was just so fresh and entertaining. It was fun, creative, original and also very funny. I thought it was groundbreaking and is my favourite film of the year",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Easily my favorite of the animated superhero movies I've seen,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the latest movies from Sony Picture Animation and is about the coming of age of Miles Morales, the next Spiderman. After getting bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains the powers of Spiderman and after a run-in with Kingpin, he meets Spiderman variations from different universes and needs to work together to stop him from ending the universe.2018 has been a large year for superhero films and I gotta admit I was excited for this one, mostly because of the animation style. When that's taken out, I really enjoyed this movie. The animation's style looks like a 3D version of a literal superhero comic book, and the pacing makes it feel like one too. The action is fast-paced, crisp and it really made me wonder what was going to happen next. That alone makes this film stand out from any other mainstream animated movie, which feels really refreshing.Aside from that, I enjoyed the company of every protagonist. Every Spiderman variation has a different charm to them that makes each one memorable. Take the main character Miles, who has to come to terms with accepting his father's wishes in being a better person by not looking up to his uncle instead. I think that arc was handled really well. I could go deeper into come of the other characters, but that would spoil parts of the movie.If I were to name a couple small issues with the movie, I do think it contains a weakness that most good Marvel movies share and that's a good villain. Kingpin for the most part felt pretty generic and didn't seem to have much character going for him. Aside from that, I do wish they could've gone more in-depth with Miles' relationship with his father. I have no problem with the execution of it, but I would've like to have seen more.Despite this, I highly recommend seeing this for superhero movie fans, comic book fans and animation fans. It's got amazing animation, great characters, an engaging story and lots of heart.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated,"Now by the title you must be thinking that I'm one of those people who just for the sake of being a idiot calling a really great film not so great cuz I want to standout, well NO! I really and Genuinely feel like into the spider verse is quite overrated, now do not confuse overrated with bad, at the end of the film I actually found myself really enjoying this one, I watched it with my lil brother who's a massive Spiderman fan we really had a great time, the characters were enjoyable, the humour was good, The animation was jaw dropping it was spectacular, the story was good, the villains could have been better but the director gave the main villain a backstory which I would say for the most part is convincing but not anything we haven't seen in tons of other comic book movie but he wasn't a hindrance so not a big issue for me... Cuz this film really focuse on the journey of miles Morales which I was never really interested in, but this movie did the character a justice and he served his purpose well so what went wrong?
THE FAN BASE I watched this movie pretty late, I waited for this movie to come on OT platform and it did and I watched it, basically every reviews I read about this movie everyone was praising how brilliant this movie is.. what an amazing time people had in the theatres.. hailing this movie as not only one of the best comic book films of the year but one of the best movies of the year.. some of the latest reviews that I've seen people count into the spider verse as one of the best films of the DECADE! and I was like OHK. fine I'll watch it then. Now I didn't watch this movie with sky high expectations.. whenever I watch a film I try to watch it with as minimum expectations as possible and into the spider verse was no exception in that way I can enjoy a good movie to its full potential and to watch really bad movie by not getting too frustrated
And after the film I was entertained but I was thinking what was in this film which made people really appreciate it's quality talking so many great things about it which made this film won an OSCAR for a featured animated film where some other movies like A Silent Voice, Your Name, Wolfchildren, The Wind Rises, When Marnie Was There and Grave Of The Fireflies. were not even considered for Nominations and into the spider verse was. Although I've already lost my faith in OSCAR but I thought people really had a better understanding of what should be great and what not should be
Look I'm not a hater of this movie and I'm not being a harsh critch either. I like this movie I would rather was 100s of into the spider verse than one Homecoming or Far From Home but I wouldn't exaggerate by counting it as one of the greatest.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Into the Spider-Verse: Take a Leap of Faith,"""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is astounding stylized state-of-art animation with the look and feel of 3-D Japanese Anime. The animation is visually shadowed and soulful with vibrant pastels. Not just mesmerizing eye-candy, team of Directors - Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman craft a fresh rites of passage narrative of immerging Spider-Man, half-African American Miles Morales, voiced by spirited and smart Shameik Moore. Although in Phil Lord (""The Lego Movie"" and ""22 Jump Street"") and Rodney Rothman's screenplay, Miles is one of several 'Spider-Men' and 'Spider-Women' intersecting in this Marvel superhero, sci-fi, family mashup.Turns out that villain ""Kingpin"", voiced by malevolent Live Schreiber, the blockish hulking bald cartoon figure used his invention - the Super Collider to collapse the multiverse. To what ends? Honestly, I don't think even Phil and Rodney know. That might be beside the point. Because, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is just raucous fun with a warped sense of humor and a big heart.Directors Bob, Peter and Rodney introduce the Spider-Man in New York that we all know and love: Peter Parker, voiced by whimsical Chris Pine. He's the guy, who was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave him his amazing strength, agility and 'spidey sense' as in sixth sense. After an extended Superhero career of 22 years including his failed marriage to the love of his life Mary Jane, voice by Zoe Kravitz, Spider-Man dies as a Hero, doing what he loves to do: Saving others.Miles is a teen attending a college prep school on scholarship: The brilliant computer geek, who chills to Post Malone. His Dad Jefferson Davis, voiced by stalwart funny Brian Tyree Henry, is a police officer, who not a big fan of Spider-Man and his ""along with great power comes great responsibility"" dogma. Somewhat self-absorbed, he unconditionally loves Miles. Jefferson even coerces Miles to say, ""I love you, Dad."" - in front of his entire school.At school Miles is sweet on pretty smart blonde Gwen Stacy, voiced by wonderfully aloof Hailee Steinfeld. Their attraction is mutual. Miles derives security in his relationship with his Uncle Aaron, voiced with street gravitas by Mahershala Ali. Aaron and his brother Jefferson Davis are estranged, given Aaron questionable shady dealings. Yet, Aaron is the cool Uncle, who encourages Miles's distinct gift as the street tagger of amazing urban spray paint murals. While working one of his masterpieces, Miles is bitten by what looks like a radioactive spider. Consequently, Miles acquires his Spider-Man powers.At the same time Miles meets his alter-dimensional persona in older paunchy Peter B. Parker, voiced by funny, mildly cynical Jake Johnson, who teaches Miles the ropes of Spider-Man's web-slinging. While escaping from Kingpin's facility and swinging through the snowy forests, Peter and Miles encounter sleek white suited Spider-Gwen - Gwen Stacy (Hailee). Turns out too, that Gwen is the Spider-Woman from yet another dimension. Like Peter, she also needs to return to her home dimension.So it's up to Miles, who must wrestle control of Kingpin's Super Collider, to forge the dimensional pathway back to their respective dimensions. Meanwhile, Miles meets Spider-Men from other dimensions. Black and white Spider-Man Noir, voiced by off-the-wall Nicolas Cage, is from a past dimensional era. There's Warner Brothers-like cartoon Spider-Ham, voiced by hysterical John Mulaney. Life-size Japanese Anime Peni Parker, voiced by quirky Kimiko Glenn, is from the 31st Century sporting her advanced robotic Spider-Man. As Peter says, ""This could literally not get weirder."" Balancing this phase-glitched universe are versions of Spider-Man's villains: Green Goblin, Scorpion, and a few others that I don't recognize.There is a whole lot of nonsense running amok in ""Into the Spider-Verse"", yet the directors resonate in asking, ""What makes a Hero?"" With surprising poignancy, cartoon Spider-Ham tells emerging Hero Miles, ""You can't save everyone."" Otherwise, the great responsibility and power become a curse.When Miles has doubts that he can become the Hero, Peter tells him, ""Take a leap of faith."" Believe in the hero that's within all of us. Our Heroes arise from our belief from within, and from the love those who believe in us. For Miles that's the world-weary and wise Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, and brave and compassionate Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Radiant Shameik Moore makes us believe that his Miles shall discover his own greater than self within.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is about summoning the Hero within all of us. Even more so than the amazing animation, that narrative makes ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" one of my favorite movies this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Miles is an interesting protagonist with his own demons and powers that he comes to realize, but this film brims in Magic and brings in too many Spidey's from other dimensions to offer us a blockbuster in its truest sense. I won't give away much spoilers, but this is a film, that deserves to be viewed with your entire family. Its got the bite!Phil Lord & Rodney Rothman's Screenplay is superb all through. Running high on energy while also focusing on soul and substance, this Animation film never runs out of breath. While the action is simply amazing, the emotional connect among its primary characters is what really stands out. Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman's Direction is excellent, as the animation gets enough scope to leave your eyes fun-filled. A special mention for Daniel Pemberton's Score and Robert Fisher Jr.'s Editing.The Vocal Performances are top-notch all across the board. Shameik Moore as Miles Morales / Spider-Man hits all the right notes, giving us a hero who must explore his own voice. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker / Spider-Man is absolutely fantastic. Nicolas Cage as Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir does a remarkable job and seems to be having a ball. Kathryn Hahn as Olivia ""Liv"" Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Liev Schreiber as Wilson Fisk / The Kingpin, voice the menaces to perfection.On the whole, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a winner all the way.

In which the events do not have true weight (We do not know what the truth is either) because around the corner of any particle collider any event had a different outcome, or a different cause, or the same thing happened but in different colors...The philosophical implications of such a current of thought are absurd and have the disastrous social consequences, in this film they work very well, since the dolls or Muppets, or cartoons are essentially any verse in which everything that can be drawn is worth .I love Peter Parker, that's why I had never seen or read anything about Miles Morales, but this movie is good, you can watch it and enjoy it...Actually the movie is really good, its got nice colors and is fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What I love about a film like ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is that a wide range of young kids can watch this film and see in it people who look and sound like them. It resembles the world as it actually exists rather than the worlds of most super hero movies, where white men are constantly saving the day. It also has a funky sound and look to it. The movie teems with urban flavor and the animation, purposely pixelated to recreate the look of an old-fashioned comic book, is gorgeous.But this is still, disappointingly, a super hero movie, which, if popular sentiment is any indication, is pretty much a problem only for me. That's fine, I can live with that knowledge. The movie is just so formulaic, with a draggy central story line about a kid whose insecurity prevents him from rising to his full super hero potential until....guess what?....he does. There's one (or a few) too many scenes with other characters giving him lectures about how to become his true self, etc. etc. And the story is weak, a confusing mish-mosh of villains and mega-weapons and alternate universes. True to super hero movie conventions, the filmmakers try to disguise how messy the screenplay is by burying it under an avalanche of loud, hectic action scenes that throw a lot of stuff at us and hope something sticks.So my dislike of super hero movies and everything that comes with them prevented me from fully enjoying this movie, but if I'm going to watch a super hero movie at all I want more that look and sound like this one.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing visuals. Spectacularly ponderous storytelling,"I wasn't able to make it through the first hour of this movie. First of all - it's a beautiful looking film, one of the best looking animated films I've ever seen. And I also liked most of Lord & Miller's quips. It's pretty funny.My first problem was that the movie's opening 45 minutes were a cringey diversity checklist (and this is coming from a minority). At least make the introduction of all the characters organic for god's sake. Spider Gwen's intro was one of the most obvious in the history of comic book movies.Another even larger problem was that the constant interjection of jokes and quips undermined every single bit of drama that there was to be had. I like jokes just as much as the next person but once in a while just let the drama build. Is that too hard? There doesn't have to be a joke every single minute. This was like a Marvel movie on steroids in the absolute worst way. Very disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

A MUST SEE MOVIE,"I'm an avid movie watcher and I especially enjoy the under-the-radar animated movies produced by DC and Marvel. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse takes it to a whole new level. You must start with the perfectly crafted animations, then to the plot depth, and a soundtrack that is so magnificently intertwined into the movie. This is a true masterpiece. In my opinion it rivals the live action and is up their with the likes of Infinity War. I hope I'm not overselling it because I too was skeptical because of the great reviews, but IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
