"Not a patch on the original Jurassic Park, and is an uneven film, but by far the best of the sequels","The original Jurassic Park still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. The Lost World has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and Jurassic Park 3 was even more disappointing.Jurassic World is not a patch on the first Jurassic Park and I didn't quite find it the return to form that it has been touted as, but for all its faults and uneven parts it is a massive improvements on the previous two sequels and is an entertaining film in its own right that does more right than it does wrong.First things off, Jurassic World is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indominus Rex, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when she is stalking her prey it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for Jurassic Park, which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.The film's homages are most enjoyable and give the film a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good of thrills and scares to be had. The latter half is often very exciting, the film is efficiently directed, doing nicely in maintaining the tension, and the acting is good (though one does wish that the characters were written better). Chris Pratt has a likable and warm presence, as well as a nice wit, and Bryce Dallas Howard is similarly good even with the most problematically written character. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a real effort making his somewhat one-note and underused character more interesting than he deserves to be and does bring some intensity.However, Jurassic World does contain some large problems. Not all the acting works, Judy Greer for my tastes was annoying in places and the children's acting was often too forced and their back story goes nowhere. The script and story are uneven, with the script it has its moments but it can be a bit muddled, as a result of trying to do too much at times, some of the dialogue is very weak and can induce cringes and some of the reversals are really out of place. It also could have done a much better developing the characters, because they felt very underdeveloped and clichéd, especially Claire, and any character arcs come off clumsily or aren't explored enough, particularly for the children. Owen and Claire's romance can slow the film down and does contain some forced dialogue. The story is at least never really dull, and excites more than it limps, but at the same time it does lack the wonder, consistent suspense, smartness and originality that Jurassic Park had. It does feel like a too predictable rehash at times, does feel muddled tonally, the exposition in the first half hour does go on for far too long and doesn't really say anything interesting and the ending is too silly and anti-climactic for my tastes.All in all, uneven and not on the same level as the original Jurassic Park, but a very entertaining well made film and by far the best of the sequels. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Manages to somewhat return the Jurassic Park series to it's former glory, but its still a few notches below Spielberg's first two entries in the series.","Modernized and polished entry to the Jurassic Park series picks up 22 years after the original Steven Spielberg SyFy thriller with a fully functional prehistoric amusement park that is trying to pick up their attendance numbers by splicing the DNA of their animals in order to create a new attraction to bring in more customers. With this, they manage to create a dinosaur that is much bigger that the signature T-Rex but also much more aggressive, much smarter and much more territorial as well. So of course it does not take much time for this thing to break out of it's habitat to cause death and destruction in it's wake. It's then up to park consultant Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and company to stop this mega dinosaur from killing everyone on the island.While the set up is predictable as well as it's outcome, the movie still provides a fun two hours of distraction. The problem is however is that outside of Chris Pratt, whose playing an intelligent variation of his swagger character from "" Guardians"" No one in this movie is very interesting or likable with the slight exception of Vincent D'Onofrio, who can read a phone book and make it interesting. The script is cringe worthy in a lot of places and while technology has come very far from the original, good storytelling is far and few between. ""Jurassic World"" still does manage to offer a lot of scary moments of sheer terror and does provide some comic relief, which is a huge step up from the last movie of the series(Jurassic Park 3)but does not have the genuine spectacle and heart that drove Steven Spielberg's first two movies in the series (The original Jurassic Park and The Lost World : Jurassic Park).All and all, it's a decent ride that somewhat redeems the Jurassic Park series but they need shoot higher next time other than just be a decent follow up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good but more a remake of the first two movies than a sequel to the series.,"Like it's dinosaur Frankenstein creation, Jurassic World is itself a  hybrid of sorts. A bright and vibrant opening that reminds the viewer  of the first time they saw the original Jurassic Park, with a voice  over by the late Richard Attenborough in introducing the park visitors  and the audience of the wonders of the first dinosaur amusement park.  Sort of a tribute to what the first movie was about and the realization  of it coming true. Then the mayhem begins and the viewer will remember  the words of Professor Ian Malcolm from the first sequel ""The Lost  World"": ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later  there's running and um, screaming."" That's what happens after the slow  introduction of the characters and story points of ""Jurassic World"".  What good about this film that it's a slow burn, like the first  Jurassic movie, then it kicks like a mule with the scares and adrenalin  of ""The Lost World"" when the park's new attraction starts eating the  tourist and it's fellow attractions. While having both Steven  Spielberg's original two films as inspiration is a good way to create a  Jurassic sequel, it's not original. Don't get me wrong, its very good  for what it was and Chris Pratt earns his stripes as a leading man but  takes too much from both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" and just  regurgitating scenes here and there to be taken seriously as a sequel.  Plus it goes into overdrive with the scary,intelligent predator hybrid  dinosaur, which comes across more like ""Predator"" than a Jurassic Park  movie. This dinosaur hybrid kills for sport, not hunger or necessary  and that pushes the boundaries of what the Jurassic Park series was  about. Yes, they are wild animals but this film plays them up as good  guys and bad guys then the out of its time species that did not belong  into human society. With all of that out of my system, i will admit  that i did have a good time watching ""Jurassic World"" and jumped quite  a few times during a few scenes. A few inconsistencies a side, i  enjoying it as what it was. While there are obvious links to ""Jurassic  Park"" not to mention the fact that they are back to the original place  of the first film, i just did not feel like it was sequel to the  Jurassic Park series. More a reboot/remake of the first two movies but  it could have been much worse (Jurassic Park 3 anyone?).  3 Stars. Don't expect anything original but do expect to have a good  time none the less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Smart Dinosaur, Dumb Writers","Overall, this wasn't a dull film. It was full of action and very absorbing. It just wasn't a very intelligent film. The writers took shortcuts to move the plot in the direction they wanted, and most of the characters fluctuate from utter moron to complete genius throughout the film.The acting was relatively dull, with the exception of Chris Pratt who played a character he's played over and over again. Most everyone else was uttering cringe-worthy dialogue throughout the film.The story is cliché, uninteresting, and full of moronic plot holes. The idea to turn the raptors into tamable teddy-bear creatures was a terrible decision that turned potentially horrific moments into a waste of time. Couple that with a worse deus ex machina moment than the first film, and you have a veritable mess on your hands.The most damning part of this film was the fact that the writers spent 14 years developing a story with a dinosaur written to be smarter than the writers themselves. Indominus possesses all the wit and clever thinking that could have been used to write a terrific screenplay. Next time, write a smarter story with a dumber dinosaur.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A nod to the original and even more,"As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it's hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to ""spare no expense"", which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn't want to commercialize the park too much. That's where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, ""so how about Pepsi-Saurus""? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it's meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&III. It's exciting, contains a little love story, it's got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That's probably why I'd give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could have been worse...definitely better than 3,"First, I am the biggest Michael Crichton fan. I have read nearly everything he has ever written.So, the bad comes first -1. Some of the characters (dinos included) did not fit the mold for his writing. While I found them likable, I also found them detestable as a ""Crichton snob.""2. I felt like there was too much in the way of homages. A few subtle nods would have been sufficient, imo.Other minor things like overall story development, and a few other directorial issues aren't worth dwelling on in light of a 2 hour and 10 minutes run time.The good -1. Chris Pratt was excellent. I'm quickly becoming a fan, and hope he can develop his skills a bit more for future roles. As my wife pointed out, he'd make a great fit for an indiana Jones reboot if the time comes.2. The dinos were awesome. Even the new ones, as far-fetched as they seem. In this regard, the writing was right in line with Crichton. He loved to stretch the science to the very edge of being illogical, if not impossible.3. Did I mention ALL of the homages? Many casual viewers will miss most of them. My 11 year old got a bunch but not all of them. From that standpoint, I like being able to see some of the more subtle connections, and rides down memory lane are generally enjoyable.Conclusion -Overall, I felt like it was worth the matinée admission of 7.50. I wouldn't have wanted to pay 10, but others may disagree. Solid action film....3.5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great first half, but script fell apart","What a shame. This movie could have been so much better! I was completely enthralled during the first 45 min or so, and it was as if I was visiting the Park myself. The cinematography was beautiful, the attractions were innovative and the park was filled with so many extras, that it felt like a real place. There was a lot of interesting man vs. nature debate in the script as well as tidbits on the danger of technological progress. I applauded the writers at first. There were even some pretty decent character arcs but unfortunately, they never fully developed.When the action started to pick up, things went sour really fast. If this film had maintained its serious tone, I may have scored it in the 8's or even 9's. But sadly, the director chose to include bits of cheesy comedic lines in moments of urgency, completely ruining the thrill. I cared nothing for the characters, because, it seemed as if the characters took the threats they came across a bit too lightly for my tastes, so much so, that it completely nullified Bryce Dallas Howard's excellent performance.But hey, at least the action was better than expected and so was the CGI. I was skeptical at the fact that there were so few robotics used in this film, but it didn't matter. The CGI was that realistic. I still can't say it saved this film. I yawned a lot in the end, despite the pretty cool plot twist. This film should have been a horror film like the first 2 installments, but it chose to be a movie aimed at teens. What else is new these days with blockbuster films right?6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Clumsy money grabber is saved only by the great special effects,"This is a film for families, like all Jurassic movies so far, so they have to use a pseudo-family unit as the main character. They also have to tell you how to feel at every moment with blunt soundtrack bits that leave nothing to the imagination. The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose . God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla. Say what you will about Spielberg, the man knew subtlety.Points for not killing the black person first. They went with the Asian.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Should have stayed extinct !,"I really really wanted to like it being a huge fan of the original story and film Jurassic Park but it was missing that Spielberg magic. Some really cool effects but overall disappointing attempt to restart the franchise. Never understand why they can't try something original but have to resort to borrowing from the previous films. Even Spielberg had trouble with his sequels, with the third film in the franchise being particularly bad. Would have liked to have seen some improvements in the actual dinosaurs to reflect current thinking but they decided to stick with the same versions from 17 year ago. I think that this one Jurassic World will end being seen as better than the third film but inferior to one and even two. Direction story and acting were below par with way too many inconsistencies gets a pass from me for at least trying...probably better to save your pennies for the next summer blockbuster or you could always go and watch Max be Mad again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't let people mislead you with sentimentalism, it holds it self by its own as an excellent movie","Is a solid movie and it holds itself as a trilling experience for everyone. Yes, people from the original cast are not there, however there is actually not a logical reason in the time line to make them go back. Taking out this little detail, the acting is amazing and Chris Pratt holds amazingly as a main character again . Animations are better than ever and the story line even if a little prematurely developed is exciting and looks to reward the new audience as well as the hard on fans. Overall is a great movie which promise enjoyment. I loved it and I will recommend it for everyone that is a fan and for the ones that just want to see a movie that will print a smile at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic World is decent popcorn entertainment but ultimately feels like wasted potential,"Upon leaving the theater, my reaction to Jurassic World was ""eh it was good enough"". A few days later as I think back to the movie, I remember the action packed finale and some of the great visuals but ultimately there was something lacking from the film, a soul, an identity.Newcomer director Colin Trevorrow proves that he has the ability to to shoot involving action scenes, despite having just one small indie film on his resume. Despite this, sometimes his direction can feel flat, especially in dialogue heavy scenes where he struggles to create dynamism in the interactions of his characters. This leaves the audience uninvested in the intricacies of the story (which is highly straightforward) and simply eager to get to the next dino' showdown.The dinosaur scenes in this film are overall fantastic, and elevate the movie to new heights. I felt like there could have been a greater variety of dinosaurs on offer here, but the ones that are in the film (especially the Mosasaur and I-Rex) deliver the goods.Unlike the original Jurassic Park and to a certain extent The Lost World, Jurassic World presents shallow characters and tries to flesh them out in a cliché manner. For example, the divorce subplot involving the two boys that is brought up once early on in the film, and then never resolved or mentioned following that scene. Another example is the main female character Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is portrayed in a negative and highly stereotypical manner for 3/4 of the movie.Some people have criticized Irfan Khan's character but I thought his small character arc was brilliant. However the military subplot was both unneeded and implausible and should have been scrapped. Chris Pratt was decent as always but wasn't given much to work with here.Ultimately, the movie somewhat succeeds in creating a plausible and believable world, however it would have benefited from some more confident direction and a greater focus on story and characterization over visuals. I don't really have a pressing desire to delve back into the world of the film because it ultimately felt too soulless, especially in comparison to Spielberg's original.The movie has been marketed as an action/thriller film and it achieves this at the expense of the more subtle tension present in previous installments in the series.That said, if you are looking for thrilling popcorn entertainment you will have a good time with this one, just don't expect a classic.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bleah,"A dull monster movie without ideas, with all the imaginable problems: recycled soundtrack from the previous three film, poor visual effects (the '93 film was indeed better even under this aspect, and that says it all), horrible ""dinosaurs"" that look more Godzilla than ""true"" animals (and yes, it's a very serious problem that these animals don't look or/and act as real animals, at least as they're conceived to be in XXI century and not in '40s), badly-written dialogs (with a sort of ""love story"" that is embarrassing), characters (dull not to say stupid) and plot.

Some really obvious instances of sexism too like where one woman tells another it's ""when not if"" she will have kids and where two boys are more impressed with a man reversing a jeep than a woman taking out a dinosaur. They could have made it way better by just having the point be that the woman realizes the importance of family like they did for the two brothers.

What a world...what a world,"Seeing Dinosaurs on a large screen do things...any things is fun and entertaining. In this case...Its the actors and the story that distracts and takes away. The movie starts out and at some point builds an interest and even a tension. Why? You cant wait to see the Dinosaurs! Then, what will they do and when starts to present itself. Then, and I wont say when, the ability to critique this movie presents itself. I wonder what people in the business are thinking when they have a successful formula and don't bother anymore to make it special. Why? What so hard about making something so good that you want to see it many times and buy the DVD too. How hard is it to write a decent two hour story? To see this movie once, on the big screen is worth the ticket price but no memories after that. Once is enough. There are still a few people out there in that enjoy a good story.

Welcome to the Park,"It's been awhile I think that I have labeled a film ""a thrill ride"" but seriously though this film was a real thrill ride. It takes place about twenty years after the events of the first film. There is now a functioning theme park on the original island. They get thousands of guest and they have tons of money making attractions. But then the people who run the park get a little greedy wanting to make more money and bring in more people so they create a new attraction, one that is more dangerous and scarier then the T-Rex. This film was fantastic. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard lead this film very well almost as a good as Sam Neill and Laura Dern did in the first film. The kids as well Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins did a good job. Colin Trevorrow also was a great choice to helm this film and he did a fantastic job directing. Now yes this film was a sequel and a great one at that. It's been a long time since I have felt that a sequel is just as good as its original. This film to me is really good and just as good as the first film. The special effects were great and one of the best parts was the music. I have been a Jurassic Park fan since I was a little kid and this is actually the first of franchise that I have seen in theaters as well. So this was definitely an amazing experience for me and hearing that original score in this film literally gave me goosebumps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
6/10,"Despite not being the biggest Jurassic Park fan I was still looking forward to this film. I wanted to have a ride, the buzz was positive and I really wanted to see how the park opened looked like. My expectations were't sky high, I really just wanted to have that thrilling ride that the first one offered. The movie doesn't manage to meet that standard, but still has enough going on for it not to be defined a faliure.The premise of having the park open definitely delivers some great moments, of which truthfully I would have liked to see more. The ride it takes you through has its stumbles, but overall I was never out of it and it had enough good, and just a couple of amazing, set pieces to keep the pace going. I cannot deny that despite the many times I got phased out by what happened on screen, there were as many times were I got genuinely excited and thrilled. I have to give a shout out to the sound design and mixing of the film because it is definitely the part that is resonating the most with me whilst writing this review. Much more than CGI, which I will get into later, it added a real layer to the film and astonishingly helped getting me engaged. It is great to hear the original theme back and I just might think it wasn't used enough. To sum up the positives in the best way possible: the parts that worked, really worked.The rest was all just: ""Well OK, I am sure I will forget this the second I exit the film"". The premise of the film isn't neither original or interesting nor grounded enough for it ever to be truly relevant. It's just another dinosaur and that would be OK if it wasn't inserted in this plot that a couple too many and convenient times strayed away from credibility. Moreover the themes it is trying to explore are frustratingly and repeatedly put aside. The CGI is just forgettable unfortunately. There are maybe a couple of shiny moments, but other than being somewhat underwhelming it really is just too poorly used for it to provoke any sense of wonder or amazement in 2015, I am really sorry, CGI has to be used as a gift not as a gadget and it is what this film did. And on the final negative note, you are given a group of way too generic characters, they seemed to have been pre-fabricated in the factory of generic blockbusters. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who really gives her character a beat and a presence on screen making her likable, all of the characters I really couldn't care that much and it made for repeatedly poor stakes.I unfortunately can't say I really had that much fun. I was never bored and really enjoyed quite a few moments, but truthfully I was far from having any sense of wonder or amazement and I think the positive reaction the film is having is due more to the fact that we all desperately want ""Jurassic Park"" to be good again more than the actual quality of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Dino-Mayhem-Disaster Flick Populated by Staple One-Note Characters,"Once again it's a dino-mayhem-disaster flick populated by staple one-note characters - a couple of kids from a fractured family, a ""are they going to or are they not"" couple, a shady corporate bigwig, a ""Dr Evil"" type and so on. Thank goodness one of them is Chris Pratt who is the epitome of cool. Love the way he calmly plays his character, dripping with killer machismo and testosterone. Think Steve McQueen. Chris Pratt is the new old. Who cares about the other characters anyway?It took quite a while to get going but once the mayhem started it is actually quite a rollicking good time. The story pays homage to Spielberg's Jurassic Park and I find it a bit laborious and self-conscious in that some of the homages roar in my face. The theme of corporate greed is again highlighted in rainbow colors and underlined in bold strokes, and there is just so much one can milk it. Why the heck people don't seem to learn? But I am getting ahead of myself. After all these are people in the movie world. The problem is that the narrative feels too familiar and it very soon became repetitive, but still it is really a logical extension from the idea posed in Jurassic Park, a ""what if"" brought to full fruition - a full-fledged dinosaur theme park.Colin Trevorrow's storytelling is uneven and the tone feels a little unsettled. It feels like he was hovering around ""shall I give my due respect to Spielberg"" or ""shall I do my thing"", but it couldn't quite figure out what it wants to do. The tone can also feel preachy (especially the long exposition in the beginning) and goofy, and it doesn't feel like it was comfortable blazing its own path. Thankfully Pratt's character smooths out the ragged edges for me. The poster of him on a bike with the raptors made no sense, but after the movie it made perfect awesome sense.Jurassic World didn't re-invent the dino-disaster wheel. I doubt that is its aim. IMHO it is a greatest hits album packaged with a few remixes of old tracks. Like a theme park ride, you would easily push the lousy parts like the long wait to the back of your mind, and only remember the thrills and spills.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Graceful, popcorn filled thrilling and tense, taught and energetic. This trilogy gets much better as it goes on.","Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and so was the plot line.

I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens.

A true sequel to a classic film,"OK, I read the 2 novels before the original movies came out, and was hooked back in 1991/92 when the original movie came out. Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable.Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A bit meh,"My first thoughts were, where are the dinosaurs? There's very little of them in this movie. It's nearly half an hour before we see one and it doesn't get better from there.The storyline is very limp. The character of Claire misfired on a number of levels. The movie didn't make me really care what happened to any of the characters except Owen and Larry and the four raptors. This is the main problem with the film, it doesn't really matter what happens.There's no emotional punch like there was with the first film or with jaws. There's also a distinct lack of tension. This should have been a thrill ride, but it was all very predictable.The best acting in the film was by Blue the 'beta' raptor. The relationship between Blue and Owen was about the only emotional factor in the film.The dinosaurs when on the screen looked good enough, but there was no tension in this film.The score and sound effects were also a bit of a let down for me.It wasn't bad, just a bit meh. I saw it in 3d. There's no need to pay extra. No real 3d effects to speak of.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How to tame your raptor,"I just recently watched the movie Jurassic World and needless to say, it was EXCELLENT...From the beginning to the end, there was enough action, and surprisingly, a lot of humor to find in between the action scenes. There is some gore to be found in the movie (It is a horror genre with Dino's, after all...) but there wasn't all too much graphic scenes. You could easily take your children to the movie without having to worry about blood or other gruesome things for your kids to see (WARNING: You will see some people got eaten, but as I just mentioned, NO BLOOD)The story takes place on isla Nublar, in Costa Rica. None of the previous characters are involved in this film seeing as how John Hammond has passed away and the previous characters have nothing to do with this movie. However, the new introductions bring a few fresh faces to the genre and the story divides screen time evenly between the main characters so the movie isn't focused on 1 specific character.If you are a fan from Jurassic Park or any Dino-themed movie, this is definitely for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just another dump monster movie,"This movie has a lot of dinosaurs, both old and new species. There's nothing to complain about the visual and CGI. Expect a good visual treat and a fun viewing.

Why these human acts like they have no brain and failed at containing a dinosaur even though they raised it since birth ?!? It's just dump. Bad acting also plays an important part in sinking this movie to mediocrity. Most characters are one-sided and behave either totally predictable or unbearable.Summary: good CGI; lots of dinosaurs; stupid plot; bad acting --> 6/10.

"Yes, This was a great movie for this day and age, and you WILL enjoy it. DO NOT READ REVIEWS BEFORE YOU SEE A MOVIE.","OK movie lovers, this is the review you need to see.Personally, I loved it. The Action is intense, and the storyline is great. The orchestration by Michael Giacchino was VERY well done as opposed to John Williams, and the actors and actresses fit their roles very well too.Now, I constantly go to Movie's, and in MY opinion, this was one of the best I have seen in the last 5 years, due to the storyline and the incredibly well done CGI. If you love Dinosaurs, you're going to enjoy this movie, regardless of what you think about the rest of the movie. Trust me. If you love action, this one is pretty action packed, so you'll have a great time too.HOWEVER, if you read the rest of the reviews, you'll most likely see title's following the words, ""This Movie Sucked"" or ""I'm gonna go on a rant here"".DO NOT READ THEMLook, everyone has their own opinions, likes and dislikes. My opinion is 10 out of 10 across the board easily. Yours might be different, but before you judge this movie because of all the reviews you've just read, I strongly suggest seeing it first. You're not going to regret it, even if you don't like the entire thing, because this movie is full of likable scenes.My rating is 10 out of 10, and I hope to see people take my advice and see it themselves before they decide what they're going to think about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Essentially unnecessary eye-candy...,"I only got around to watch the fourth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise about a year after it was released upon the world. Why? Well, after a steadily sloping series of movies, then I wasn't in any particular hurry to get around to watch the most recent of the movies, it being ""Jurassic World"".And now having seen it, I must admit that this was visually a beautiful movie. As was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie back in 1993 when it was first released. And it did offer some adequate entertainment, for sure. But everything here had essentially been presented to the audience throughout the course of the three previous movies. Sure there was the thing with the Indominus Rex creation that stood out. But wasn't it just a twist on the gene manipulation and reproduction that essentially sparked the first dinosaur in the first movie?The acting in the movie was good, although you should not expect any great thespian or Shakespearian moments throughout the course of the movie. People did adequate jobs with what they had to work with from a fairly limiting script and storyline.The CGI is what carried this movie, as it has been with the entire series since the first movie. And the dinosaurs are quite life-like and realistic to look at - taking into consideration that we only got fossils to compare appearances with.The movie does bear some sarcastic permeation of American consumerism, in terms of everything has to be bigger and better. And look how it turned out in the first, second and third movie. So it makes you wonder why they still haven't learned their lesson and continued on with a new dinosaur amusement park.While ""Jurassic World"" is certainly an entertaining movie and a visual treat for the eyes, then it is hardly a revolutionary movie, nor is it a movie that really were particularly necessary to the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I absolutely love this movie as it keeps the entertainment flowing and delivers a sense of engaging and exciting realism due to the well thought out storyline.

So full of clichés, you exactly know, who is going to die or who will live just a few minutes after knowing the character. So many absurd decisions, so many stupid but predictable actions. So much staring on danger in spite of running out. So many substantive errors for anyone who has primary science knowledge. And last but not least running many hours in the jungle on heels without absolutely any problems.

Almost the same to the original and very predictable,"They cloned dinosaurs and tried to make them a theme park attraction, it went wrong, research teams tried to examine the remains, it went wrong. Now they've remade the park, with more dangerous creatures lurking around, what could possible go wrong? THIS!! Instead of moving on from the idea of a dinosaur petting zoo, the managers of the park believe it can still work with no loose dinosaurs. However, the idiot scientist think it will be no danger to breed their own dinosaur with a mixture of different creature DNA. So eventually a highly intelligent blood thirsty dinosaur becomes loose around Jurassic World.The film is completely fuelled with intense, pulse racing action that Jurassic Park delivered only bigger and louder. Although it is new I did believe that the film is almost the exact same feature to the original, with the exceptions of a slightly different narrative and several annoying characters.The film does present though an interesting narrative, and brilliant visual effects. There is also a small emotional theme to the story of the relationship between the dinosaurs and humans, which I think Chris Pratt executes brilliantly.Sadly the film becomes very predictable with other themes presented throughout the story, and becomes infested in plot wholes. Throughout watching it I could not help but think WHY? To the characters as they perform stupid actions and not even do the sensible thing. There are also moments of intense gory images and disturbing scenes, which make men question the certificate of the film but also nearly made me believe I was watching a horror movie.Overall to me the film was just exhausting, familiar, and annoying. However the film provides what it promises and I'm sure will entertain fans of the previous films. I give it 5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The day after Trevorrow,"In preparation for ""Dominion"" I went back and rewatched the first ""Jurassic World"" film again. This first film in the reboot trilogy certainly has its moments, but to me has always felt much less plausible than the initial films, particularly at the films conclusion.Years after the fall of the first ""Jurassic Park"" Ingen have successfully salvaged the island, and created a destination resort complex. It has been in operation for a few years now though and attendance figures are dropping, the solution is to create a new hybrid dinosaur, the Idominus Rex. Bred to be bigger and scarier than all that have come before, the beast shows unparalleled intelligence and aggression and when it escapes the owners discover they have repeated John Hammonds errors, but on a much bigger scale.I was surprised about how more violent and bloody this film was over the previous three. I suppose this is reflected in the 12 certificate rather than the PG one, but still it was surprising. I liked Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, even if their will they /won't they love pairing is a bit played out. I did hate the kids though, especially the older one, who just stares at girls all the time in a way that quickly gets beyond flirting and into stalking. The rest of the cast is strong though, and there are number of recognisable actors in smaller roles, such s Omar Sy and Lauren Lapkus.The action scenes are generally pretty thrilling though as I said above, I do think that the ""tag team"" work at the end of the film threatens the credibility of the film quite a bit. I do think that the idea of the Raptor hunt is also lacking a bit in logic, both in terms of what they wanted to happen when the Raptors located the Rex and how the bikes and cars negotiated the tree trunks and debris the Raptors were jumping over.I wish it was a little cleverer and a little more inventive, but it's got more than enough moments for me to feel positive about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dinos return to glory days,"JURASSIC WORLD I do so love when a movie series returns to its creative roots. JURASSIC PARK was an epic film, and then Spielberg and company found a way to destroy its flavor with two banal sequels. After a lengthy hiatus that included much soul-searching, and dumping Jack Horner, JURASSIC WORLD brings the franchise back to the wonderfulness of the original.I try to not watch trailers before I see a movie. Often, they are misleading. At best, the reveal too many key plot elements or scenes. Unfortunately, the trailers for JURASSIC WORLD permeated media in a major advertising campaign blitz. What I saw in the trailers alarmed me. Did I actually see Velociraptors work along side the film's protagonist Chris Pratt, as a unified force? It reminded me of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR, where viewers were force-fed the notion a petite black woman was the only human representative capable of defeating a horde of aliens by teaming with the creatures who hunt humans for sport. Please. The concept was idiotic, and though they tried to salvage the movie series with a follow-up, the initial theme essentially destroyed the franchise in the world of celluloid.The raptors, in the same frame with Pratt, are not friendly creatures. Luckily, there are no ""we are family"" moments between species. I'll test your memory here, but think back to the second film in the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON series; THE REVENGE OF THE CREATURE. In the film, John Agar, experimenting on the intelligence of the gill-man, uses an electric prod to teach the word ""stop"" to the Creature. Through Pavlovian testing, the Creature hesitates at the sound. It establishes a necessary reaction for the climatic scene. The raptors work much the same manner in JURASSIC WORLD. It is done well.Now, consider Jack Horner. After JURASSIC PARK, Horner attempted to garner his fifteen minutes of Andy Warhol fame and used rather sketchy paleontology findings to discredit the Tyrannosaurus Rex. He claimed the King of Dinosaurs was nothing but a mooching scavenger. Somehow, he convinced Spielberg to shift attention away from Rex. It was a bad move that culminated in a horrendous JURASSIC PARK 3, where a Spinosaurus, which in reality measured only 20 feet compared to T-rex's 50 feet, fights and defeats Rex. Horner's new Rex theories were dismantled by his peers and colleagues within a year. He is now in the café of scientific oblivion, sipping coffee with the two researchers who tried to convince us of global warming with a fabricated hockey stick graph model. Rex is back in full glory in JURASSIC WORLD. In fact, he received cheers and applause from the preview audience when he appeared on screen. They were louder than any reaction to superheroes.JURASSIC WORLD makes many references to the original, and basically ignores everything from the sequels. It is twenty years past John Hammond's disastrous attempt to bring dinosaurs to a theme park. In that time, technology has improved, enabling Hammond's dream to become reality. Thousands of people visit JURASSIC WORLD on a regular basis, but as with all things, dinosaurs become mundane with the public and the park must find new and exciting ways to keep ticket sales booming. Enter Indominus Rex, a genetically built dinosaur hybrid, meant to add an element of fear and terror to park visitors. BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, and is the culprit behind creation of the new Rex. He is reminiscent of Dr. Susan McCallister, played by Saffron Burrows, in DEEP BLUE SEA, who created superior sharks, but opted not to tell anyone about the enhances features.In keeping with the Spielberg tradition of constantly putting children in danger, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson star as Gray and Zach, who are visiting the park while their parents attempt to end their marital bliss. There can never be happy families anymore in films. It doesn't fit the template of a dysfunctional society, so loved by liberal Hollywood ideology. Entrusted to the care of their aunt, the boys naturally find a way to immerse themselves in park havoc, while they discover the bond that exists between brothers. Meanwhile, Auntie Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, while chasing the All American Woman Executive Dream, has the hots for Owen (Pratt), who is in this story what Robert Muldoon should have been in the first. All these subplots are secondary and just provide hurdles for a tale about a genetic freak, and the dinosaurs who hate him.Critics were able to see JURASSIC WORLD in 3D. It is worth it. The dinos, especially the raptor attacks, are superb. The dinos look great, thanks to Ed Verreaux's production design. Cinematography by John Schwartzman is excellent and provides several iconic moments sure to appear on posters and memes. Music, though featuring additional tunes by Michael Giacchino is basically variations on John Williams memorable score.All in all, JURASSIC WORLD brings the series back to where it belongs. You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It's worth repeated views and deserves a spot on your home video shelf. As such, it exemplifies excellence in film entertainment and captures the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2015. You'll like this one; it's a keeper.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrible Movie! Overrated Garbage!,"This has to be one of the worst blockbusters I ever seen. I remember I left the theater on opening night feeling so empty and unsatisfied. Like Force Awakens just Jurassic World was just a bad remake of the first film in the franchise.The characters were awful. They were bland, forgettable, and unlikable. I wanted all of them to die, because they all make the dumbest decisions. Example, older brother (lets run away from our babysitter, takes little brother into restricted area, yells at his brother to stop crying). We're supposed to like this character and root for him to live???? Nobody remember any of their names and that's a big problem. When people talk about the characters they refer to them as red head lady, two annoying kids, British nanny, black guy, Indian guy, lady in the control room. Zero character development and no growth.Too much ripping off the first film. There's a difference between homages and straight up copying. Two kids get attacked in a vehicle. Gee... because we didn't see that in the first movie. This nostalgia garbage has to stop. The scene at the old visitors center was just there for nostalgia jerk off festival. Hey remember the Tim's googles, the old dinosaur painting mural, the original Jurassic Park banner, the original jeep cars.The tone was all wrong. Way too comedic and meta. Couldn't take anything seriously. This movie wasn't scary and had zero tension or suspense. The truck chase scene and the gyrospchere attack should of had me on the edge of my seat, but it didn't. And characters unrealistic reactions don't help either. The little brother is laughing and joking ""I can't wait to tell mom"" after bug zapping a raptor. In the gyrospchere scene the old brother has a blank face while it's been flung around violently. No reaction. During the pterodactyl scene everybody is running around screaming being attacked and killed, the two kids are blankly watching Chris Pratt and Bryce's characters causally kissing. So stupid.The acting was so horrible. Chris Pratt was so wooden and stoic. Bryce Dallas Howard was so awful with her out of breath ""acting"". Vincent Dinofrio was miscast as the villain. Didn't buy him in the role. The two kids were horrible. Nick Robinson was so wooden and had no reaction anything happening him, just blank stares. No emotion. The younger kid could have been better. Ariana Richards/Joseph Mazello were excellent in the original film and were believable. They knew how to play scared very well. I never believed the two kids in Jurassic World were scared at any point. Jake Johnson was obnoxious and not funny. Lauren Lapkus was awful and her crying scene was embarrassing. Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard have zero chemistry.The movie looked fake, too clean and shiny. Unlike the original three films, this felt like a movie taking place on a green screen. The teal and orange color grading made the film look ugly. Terrible cgi, how do the dinosaurs look better in 1993 than 2015. No animatronics except for one. The Indominous Rex was lame version of the T-Rex and changed to fit whatever plot device the movie wanted.People trash the Lost World and Part 3, but I rather watch those over World. At least those felt like Jurassic Park movies. World felt like a terrible Syfy channel film with a huge budget. Jurassic World was a soulless cash grab that has zero re-watch value.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Disappointing: Much like the Dinosaurs this Film Represents, the Jurassic Park Franchise ought to Remain Extinct","Don't get me wrong - there is plenty of entertainment to be had when viewing Jurassic World: the special effects are absolutely outstanding, and we are able to cherish these when viewing the creatures right up in our faces. Unlike many films where monsters are hidden by the darkness, in this film, they are beautifully presented in direct visibility. Not only this, many of the action scenes are truly breathtaking in their execution, the climatic moments being especially fantastic, however, these are often marred by predictability, the final sequence being a combination of several fight scenes from the original feature, and Jurassic Park 3. Regrettably, in other instances, including a scene involving pterosaurs, and another involving raptors, the script's directionality offers nothing new, as we watch what can only be described as tweaked footage from previous installments, regardless of how good they look. This is unfortunately furthered by the fact that those who have viewed the trailers, will already have a strong inkling of what is going to happen in almost every major scene.Although In-Gen still have a role to play in the feature, their priorities appear to be strictly military, a tactic which is strongly led by Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who efficaciously portrays his greedy, self-centered character. Although the notion of using dinosaurs, particularly raptors, during military operations is interesting, and seeing this executed on screen is probably the most uniquely entertaining experience the film is able to muster, this grand scheme seems outlandishly ridiculous. Furthermore, at times, it seems difficult to fathom who is actually in control - Hoskins, or park owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who is introduced as one of the world's richest men, and though he is hailed as a man with 'humility', the moment everything goes terribly wrong, money and reputation, rather than safety, are his top priorities. Despite a number of superb scenes, for the most part, his character recites juvenile dialogue, and it left this writer wondering if Mr. Khan was sadly, racially chosen because of his accent.This is not helped by the script, which, despite the seriousness of the operation, doesn't always retain the professionalization one would expect. Characters like Scott (Andy Buckley), who is provided far too much screen time, spends the entirety of his scenes vocalizing what can only be described as pointless dialogue, while characters like Dr. Henry Wu (B D Wong), who terrifically shows the passion he has for his work, are rarely glimpsed. Even Owen, although exceptionally portrayed by the dashingly handsome Chris Pratt, whose character is a reliably effective protagonist, is initially provided some rather sexist material, conveyed in the scene where he communicates with former girlfriend and operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who, despite been an effective marketer, spends more than half the film being interpreted as an emotionless zealot.This impression is only furthered by her inability to be an aunt to her sister's two children vacationing at the park, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson). More often than not, these children appear to steal the show, much of the plot, from the film's opening to its close, orbiting around them, and though this allows us to see the park from their eyes, their behavior, and recklessness, quickly loses its appeal. The addendum that Zach, no offense, is a sleaze bag, doesn't help: the opening of the feature sees him saying goodbye to his girlfriend, and for half the movie, he has the gall to attempt fraternization with every adolescent girl he sees.Moving on, the primary antagonist, the Indominus Rex, the creature scientifically engineered by splicing together classified dinosaur genetics, which predictably escapes, is able to masterfully command the screen with its presence, though at the same time, its unique capabilities appear to be randomly used. On many an occasion it appears the creature is capable of doing what was convenient for the scene; almost as though the monster itself is unsure of its capabilities and learns overtime from practice. Despite its massive build, more could have been done to make this creature more terrifying, and the fact it too closely resembles a Tyrannosaurs, renders it less effective on screen as it would have, if it looked vastly different.The sub-plot, about humans forming a bond with dinosaurs is a nice addition to the narrative, and helps establish the ancient reptiles as more than just killing machines, but as potentially loyal animals, however, the fact the Indominus steals the show, severely limits the effectiveness of this story arch. Additionally, the accompanying musical score occasionally adds to the environment, however, the original John Williams theme appears to be recklessly handled, and is inserted in what seems to be the most inappropriate of locations.In conclusion, our return to the park feels less than impressive, and more stereotypically cliché, and despite the term 'world' appearing in its title, the staggering number of Caucasians, makes it seem the 'world' is barely represented at all. The fact the film is left wide open for yet another sequel, a little too obviously demonstrates Universal's opinion they have tapped a lucrative oil well, however, any further forays into the park are only likely to end in disaster. If you are thoroughly impressed by Mr. Pratt's work, I would recommend you watch this film; if you really enjoy Mr. Khan's on screen presence, I would recommend you avoid this feature, and for fans of the franchise still reeling after the abysmal third movie, I would recommend you stick to the original two films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite movies of all time.,"I was coming into the movie with very high expectations and came out with the movie exceeding my expectations! Jurassic World is now one of my favorite movies of all time. The action sequences are intense and plentiful. The special effects are top notch. The music is wonderful(and not just John William's famous themes; Michael Giacchino's score is excellent as well.) And while the characters may not be as developed as in the original Jurassic Park, they are interesting in their own right. Chris Pratt does a great job as Owen, the raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard does excellent as Claire, the head of the park. One of my favorite ""characters"" though is the underwater dinosaur Mosasaur. (Every time it jumps out of the pool it's freaking awesome!) Even though a lot of people have called this movie predictable, it had a lot of twists and turns that were surprising, especially the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending sequence is one of the most epic endings that I can remember in any movie.

Works Best With Jawdropping Visuals,"Once the obstreperous mayhem roars across Isla Nublar, there's no telling whether a chance for you to escape is going to gape into view, or you just run away from the pursuing carnage. These harrowing dangers, and imminently omnipresent threats in JURASSIC WORLD scream in deafening volumes, enough to keep the awe- inspired spectators glued on screen for more than two hours.The movie picks up two decades after the infamous Jurassic park shut down, in the wake of a horrendously bloody catastrophe that swept through the island. A new company has taken over ownership of the park which has been fully operational and open for tourists, only it's been seeing a steady decline in audience attendance. At the request of park's geneticists, a new hybrid, called Indominus Rex, which actually resembles a T.Rex, is created.Frankly, there's is not much to dig in the movie's proved-tested but overly familiar set-up. Cliché and predictabilities scream along the ever impending terror, but that terror itself holds enough charm to cover such narrative defect. The jawdropping cinematography employed to capture the screaming raptorial outrage is unmissable. Once the hybrid escapes, terrific camera-work follows its rampage and delivers an avalanche of eye-popping bloody visual spectacles. There are plenty of riproaring sequences, that include deadly chases and battles for flesh, enough to pull your attention away from fully gauging the depth of human emotions, that the film barely relays to its audience. This isn't to say there is really nothing to expect from that department, because as its emotional core, lead actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard, charm their way through their thinly-structured (mostly two- dimensional) roles. Chris Pratt, being the central hero here, has the striking charm and sarcastic demeanor he needs, to pull off his character, while the rest of the supports engage with either nothing or no more than forgettable acts.JURASSIC WORLD works best once its CGI dinosaurs begin raging on screen. It's a visual bloodfest, teeming with sense- cracking fight setpieces that get more intense toward the movie's roaring final sequences. I'm not really a religious fan of this franchise, and I'm not claiming to be a credible source of comparison between this installment and the past entries of the franchise. But based on what I've seen here, and in so many similar creature movies in the past, I'd say JURASSIC WORLD, is a solid addition. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A 3 is generous. Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid","Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me.

"8/10 and an entertaining movie, especially after the trailer","Honestly you all saw the trailer. The trailer summarizes all the bad parts of the movie, which results in the movie actually being a pleasing experience. Unlike most movies, where the trailer displays all the best parts (Ironman 3) and the movie is a total let down, Jurassic World manages, even with a stupidly predictable plot, to create an entertaining movie. It isn't anywhere near as good as the first but it beats all the other Jurassic movies in my opinion. It is surely worth going to the movies for.The acting is credible and Chris Patt excels. The two kids are all right but not at all necessary nor contribute to the plot in any way. Their only purpose seems to be to allow their own relationship, as well as another to develop.The CGI, despite my impression from the trailer, is great and believable. Really the best CGI I have seen in a long time.The 3D is okay.

Hinse it is super smart and wants to kill. Why, who cares, it just does according to the movie.So of course it escapes and you have all these tourists on the island. Park director Claire gets Owen's help to capture the escaped dino.

Decent follow up that is more style than substance.,"Glossy yet shallow return to form manages to revive the series for a new generation after the disaster known as ""Jurassic Park 3"" put it on ice for almost 20 years. Unfortunately while its miles better than the awful ""Jurassic Park 3"", it still lacks what made Spielberg's groundbreaking original ""Jurassic Park"" and its worthy follow up ""The Lost World"" had, which was heart and good characterization. Most of. All, ""Jurassic World"" also lacks originality, with several of its set pieces copying a great deal of what was done with the first two Spielberg Jurassic Park movies and it lacks their tension and kinetic energy. Chris Pratt and cast are game and they are likeable but their characterization is somewhat shallow and the pet raptor angle get tiring after a while. This film unfortunately continues the trend create in ""Jurassic Park 3"" with a super dinosaur that wreaks havoc for everyone around it but fortunately in this movie, the premise works in a fun B movie way.

Stuck to the original recipe that made the first Jurassic Park movie so good, though they spiced it up with new features. E.I the Raptor's and the new park toys etc. Chris Pratt was amazing in this. Their choice of actor was perfect and it makes me very enthused to see any new movies he will be apart of. The children cast was also incredible. Vincent Denofrio, once again the creep but of course is excellent at it. His character was a little one dimensional though. All-in-all I enjoyed the jump scares and the tense atmosphere the movie held and the fun vibrant feel throughout the movie.

Pretty underrated film,I thought this film was very dumb but extremely entertaining it's basically the perfect movie that u can stick on in the background and have a really good time some scenes even captured the thrills from the original and introduces some pretty dumb but quite interesting ideas and that's why I really enjoy it,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Sequel to Jurassic Park,"I had my doubts about Jurassic World when the trailers debuted last year. But they kept getting better and better until I finally thought to myself, ""this might be a good one."" Believe it or not, I was right. The main characters of Claire and Owen, the music by Michael Giacchino, and the concept of an open Dinosaur park really drove the story to its potential as a good sequel. Every movie has their problems, and this one did have a few but not enough to say that I was mislead. The audience and critics may be all over the place with this movie but hey, Haters gonna hate. This is truly the best sequel to Jurassic Park to me and has earned its place with the best sequels along with the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. If you see the film, see it with your own mindset and not what other people say.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Predictable, but Entertaining Adventure","The new Jurassic World, owned by the corporation of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), operates in Isla Nublar, Central America, with dinosaurs genetically created by the InGen Company. The workaholic and uptight manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) receives her nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the boys. Meanwhile the dedicated Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is training four velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) believes that the animal can be trained for military use. When Owen and two other employees go to an isolated paddock to evaluate the new attraction of the park, the hybrid dinosaur Indominus Rex, the animal lures them, kills the two men and flees from the spot. Owen escapes and asks Masrani to kill the Indominus, but he believes his security team can contain and capture the animal that cost lots of money. However the team is destroyed by the Indominus and Claire orders the evacuation of the tourists from the island. But the dangerous pterosaurs escape from the aviary and the place goes havoc. Meanwhile Gray and Zach are riding a gyro-sphere in the restricted area and Claire and Owen seek them out. With the chaos in the island, Vic assumes the command and decides to use the four velociraptors to locate and destroy the Indominus. Will his plan work?""Jurassic World"" is one of those predictable movies that the viewers know what he or she is going to see. However it is an entertaining adventure due to the special effects, the good acting and the music score. The romance between Claire and Owen is totally out of context. The presumption of Masrani piloting the helicopter does not fit well for a successful entrepreneur and business man. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jurassic World: O Mundo dos Dinossauros"" (""Jurassic World: The Dinosaur World"")",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Silly scientist creates a Frankenstein's monster!,"A Universal film, the 3D version delights from the first appearance of the studio icon, right through to the end of the film.'Jurassic World' is a film about a dinosaur theme-park set on an island. The 'Jurassic Park' (1993), of two decades earlier, is hinted at in 'Jurassic World'.Film opens with an emotional and harassed mother played by Judy Greer. She is packing her boys off to go on holiday to the dinosaur theme-park. Miss Greer had a small part in the 2013 'Carrie' remake, though my favourite role of hers was in 'The Big Bang Theory' TV series.Nick Robinson (not the BBC Political Editor) plays well the role of the elder brother. He is a surly teenager, uninterested and unreliable. His younger brother is played to perfection by Ty Simpkins. He is in fact a show-business veteran who has been performing since he was a baby, and it shows! He plays a small boy, who like all small boys, has bags of energy, and this is shown well. There are also emotional scenes which are done very well. The two boys feature heavily in the film.The boys arrive at the island as the guests of their aunt (the sister of their mother). However, as she is the chief administrator on the island, and thus very busy, she places them in the care of a surly baby-sitter. Auntie Clare is played by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard. Her character is humourless and work-obsessed. She may not be the best auntie in the world, or the best boss, however her destiny is not that ridiculous dereliction of duty Dwayne Johnson acted out in the recent 'San Andreas'.It is when the boys arrive at the hotel that we see some great scenes. John Ford's 'The Searchers', has that iconic scene of John Wayne inside the door-frame, as the door shuts. Here we have the opposite, as the hotel window opens, and we fly out of the window, to take in the park scenery. What a shot!Jurassic World's Director is Colin Trevorrow. This is only the second film he has directed. The first, which I am very fond of, is a time-travel rom-com called 'Safety Not Guaranteed' (2012). It was written by Derek Connolly. The two also were producers. Here, they have collaborated with the screenplay. Also here from 'Safety,' is Jake Johnson, who is also familiar for his role in the 'New Girl' TV series. Here he plays a cynical and thoughtful technician.The film itself is also cynical. There are a couple of clumsy product-placements. However this is balanced by what can only be described as a not too subtle indictment of capitalism. The best since 'Nightcrawler' (2014). This is seen in many scenes, but 'ride-boy' encapsulates this perfectly.The theme-park wants to make money, thus to keep visitor numbers up, newer dinosaurs need to be introduced. Thus we have DB Wong, from 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' TV series, playing a scientist who is working on that. Earlier this year, Mr Wong played a manic gambler in the con-rom-com 'Focus'. Here he once again plays the role of a serious doctor.Another Law & Order veteran, is also one of my favourite actors, Vincent D'Onofrio. Knowledge of his appearance, was decisive in choosing to see this film. Unlike the small part he played in last year's 'The Judge', here he gets a bigger and more meaty role. His character has a military background. He is cold and ruthless, as well as very persuasive in his forward planning and thinking.Casting must be rated highly. I was particularly happy to see many of my acting favourites in this film.Chris Pratt plays an animal-behaviourist, who understands and empathises with the dinosaurs. This puts him into conflict with the others administering the park. Irrfan Khan, plays a boss, and Lauren Lapkus an underling. Both small parts are played well and believably.The 3D-effects and the special-effects are all done well, and are also enjoyably viewed. The dinosaur scenes are exciting and thrilling. There is a fight sequence reminiscent of 'King Kong'.Much of the film is shot from the POV of the two brothers, who feature heavily in this film, just as much as the adult stars, thus this film will appeal to boys. However UK rating is 12A. Parents should be aware that the eating habits of the dinosaurs may be upsetting for young children. Though boys aged 12+ will lap it up.This film is a concrete lesson on the dangers of putting the pound (£) before principles, or the dollar ($) for that matter too. Scientists play god at their peril, and ours too. As they reverse history and plunge us back into the Jurassic World, we can only once again shout out the old battle-cry of 70 million years ago;""Death to the dinosaurs!, long live the mammals!""Film has a much better ending than 'San Andreas'.An enjoyable and exciting film. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
bad comedy but fun dinosaur action,Karen Mitchell sends her sons Gray and Zach to Jurassic World in Isla Nublar which is run by her sister Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is a velociraptor trainer. Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) wants to turn them into military weapons. The park is creating genetic amalgamations. The latest is the most dangerous of them all. Then it escapes and chaos ensues.It's funny that Claire's heels became such a big complaint. The movie obviously knows it's a joke so pointing it out is a little beside the point. The biggest problem is that Claire isn't funny and I don't blame it all on BDH. The character is written badly and so is Owen. Almost every attempt at comedy ends with me groaning at its clumsiness. Claire and Owen have almost no chemistry. I hated them kissing in the middle of pterosaurs attack. It's just ridiculous. It's one of those cliché moves that needs to be outlawed. Stop kissing and shoot some pterosaurs. The movie still works because it has giant dinosaurs and it's a fun adventure.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Basically a technically accomplished rehash of the original film,"The characters in ""Jurassic World"" - which should be titled ""Will Humans Never Learn?"" - keep telling one another that the paying public needs ever more elaborate sensations to keep them coming back for more. Yet, it's hard at times to tell whether they're talking about the audiences at the park or the audiences for the movie.This little bit of self-reflective self-awareness on the part of the filmmakers is one of the few interesting things about this fourth entry in a tetralogy that began with the groundbreaking ""Jurassic Park"" in 1993. The problem is that it's hard to break ground more than once in the same soil, and ""Jurassic World"" finds no real way to bring anything new to the project.The movie just keeps playing different variations on the same theme. Thus, instead of ""mere"" (and, now, apparently passé) full-sized dinosaurs being regenerated out of ancient samples of preserved DNA, we've graduated to ""super dinosaurs"" being genetically-engineered out of a mixture of all sorts of dino types. All this gene- and species-tampering is taking place at a decade-old amusement park, an improvement, we are told, over the ill-fated one that never quite got off the ground in the 1990s. But humans are humans and playing God, especially for sensation and profit, never ends very well in these sorts of scenarios, so we're primed to buckle our seats and hang on for the ride. We aren't disappointed.Once we get past that one slight deviation, the plot of ""Jurassic World"" pretty much replicates the 1993 original, right down to the ""unlikely"" (though, actually, quite predictable) system malfunction and two lost and imperiled kids having to be saved from becoming Dino-food by an intrepid adult at the park (Chris Pratt plays the role of trainer and dinosaur- whisperer here). In fact, virtually every scene in ""Jurassic World"" has a corresponding counterpart in ""Jurassic Park,"" only what was once innovative and fresh has now become derivative and stale (apparently, none of the characters here ever seen the original ""Jurassic Park"" or they wouldn't keep making the exact same mistakes as the previous group).Pratt has an easygoing, good-ole-boy charm that serves him well in his role as makeshift hero, but Bryce Dallas Howard is given the thankless task of playing a rather insultingly sexist caricature as the manager of the park who's in way over her head when it comes to running the joint, not to mention coping with a crisis of this magnitude (think Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") and is, thus, in constant need of rescuing by the stalwart Pratt.Under the directorial aegis of Colin Trevorrow, the action scenes and special effects are predictably eye-popping and state-of-the-art - helping to generate the ""wow factor"" one minimally expects from this series - but the overall air of deja vu that permeates the film keeps this latest dino-blockbuster from being much more than an afterthought in the Jurassic universe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved It,"People really are too serious these days, Jurrasic World is a fun exciting thrilling film and a I really enjoyed it a I feel like I've waited almost all my life for another Jurrasic Park type film to be realised and I'm so happy they did! All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions. This is what I want when I go to see a movie I want to feel the emotions I want to be excited. I mean I literally haven't stopped talking about this film since I saw it.

"The most action-packed entry in the series, but far less intelligent.","OK, this movie is in the right for calling itself Jurassic world and not Jurassic park, as its tone is very different. Unlike the quiet, thoughtful, and suspense filled park series, Jurassic world is a break-neck paced action film, and the sense of wonder is also glossed over.The emotional scenes are forced, there is a rushed romance, and a shoe-horned in divorce for the mandatory children in the move.(this movie didn't really need kids in it.) It is an amazing spectacle, that has a few thrown in, rushed through 'clever' moments, and exposition, but once that's out of the way, it plunges into insane, almost cartoon-like action, with poorly rendered dinosaurs doing over-the-top-things. The effects are weird, the cgi looking real in some shots and fake in others, and the dinosaur character models look odd, as all the dinosaurs have big feet, big heads, and just look like 3-d cartoons, especially in the case of the tyrannosaurs. The only time they look real is when the brontosaurus dies as they used a robotic dinosaur. In its credit, there are some cool concepts in this movie, such as dinosaurs imprinting on people, and the new attraction, a genetically engineered hybrid created to boost popularity, has an interesting back-story, although once it breaks loose it just behaves like a generic movie monster and attacks everything in sight. It is also a nerdy nit-pick of mine, but the dinosaurs, from a scientific point of view are all hideous, deformed monstrosities, especially in the case of the small meat-eating dinosaurs which we now know possessed feathers, and had inward facing palms, not loose zombie hands.But in this movies credit, it does state the cloned dinosaurs are mixed with other animals DNA making them look different, but it would have been cooler if the park cloned purer dinosaurs resembling the real deal.But all in all, this movie is good fun, the dinosaurs have a lot of personality, are still sweet and likable, Chris Pratt is affable, Claire is basically bones from bones. The climax, which i won't give away, is amazingly over-the-top.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I was with the Navy. Not the Navajo.,"As an Avid Jurassic Park fan except for JP3. This film hit me a well thought after movie. There were some draw backs that you read in the comments pages like how could Claire out run a T-Rex in hill and another which i do agree with is that the kids should have been eaten because they were to whiny. It hard to replace performances from the original cast who played lex and tim. As for the CG and Graphics I'm always blown away on how it keeps changing and the dinosaurs always look better. as well as adding a hybrid well, let me tell great choice of adding a raptor rex mix. As the film progressed I was hoping for more dinos in the scene such a the mosasaurus. Other than that I give this film a big thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extremely Enjoyable Addition To The Jurrasic Park Series,"When I first heard another Jurassic film was being done, I did wonder what direction it would be taken, and how they could improve the series. I mean let's face it...more people lost on an island again wouldn't have been very original. I didn't dislike them, but thankfully massive improvements was made from The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.I loved Jurassic Park. I thought the second film was decent enough, and the third was enjoyable even if it was very thin story-wise. Jurassic World, though, wipes the floor with the previous two films, and for me was almost just as enjoyable as the first. I enjoyed a lot of the homages to the previous films as well and they were nice touches.The film took a wee while to get going for me, and there were moments where I thought it was going to be a bit cheesy and full of cliché's, but thankfully this wasn't the case. Yes, there are cliché's scattered throughout the movie, but what film doesn't? It started off a bit ""ho-hum"" but it most definitely got better as it went on. Was the majority of it predictable? Pretty much, but it didn't make it any less entertaining.I think the biggest cliché's were some of the characters, mainly that of Owen (Chris Pratt). Him being a rough, buff macho man who's an ex-Navy SEAL is as cliché as you can get, along with the 'love/hate' relationship between him & Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). I'm surprised they never had him shirtless at some point. Thankfully it didn't become a romantic cheese-fest...apart from them stopping right in the middle of things to lip-smack that is.The CGI, as we have come to expect, is amazing and if I'm honest the first film's effects were just as good. It's just that this time there was much more and all on a larger scale. People will probably moan about it being a ""CGI-fest"", but at least this wasn't like Pacific Rim...all CGI and nothing else.Ignore the hate as this is definitely a must-see movie, especially if you loved the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling and rousing  sequel in which  a genetically engineered  hybrid Tiranosaurus goes berserk and carries out  a killing spree,"New chapter subsequently to the famous trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . The Dinosaurs , Tiranosaurus and Velociraptors are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp adapted by screen-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver ; in addition , the story idea for this film was created by Steven Spielberg and Mark Protosevich to confer the notion of doing another installment in the Jurassic Park franchise . The picture starts on Isla Nublar , a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers , and security guards watch the creature within unseen . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . It happens 22 years after the original Jurassic Park failed , the new park also known as Jurassic World where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed and it is opened for amusement and business . After years of studying genetics the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur has been created , being a new hybrid ""attraction"" . During the process , the animal tries to escape , an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . Meanwhile , the workaholic and stiff-upper-lip manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard , Ron Howard's daughter) has two unexpected visitors , her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the children . And the dedicated worker Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) , helped by Barry (Omar Sy) , is training four Velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins , a greedy man with mean purports (Vincent D'Onofrio) , thinks of these wild animals can be trained for military use . The park attraction in property the Indian magnate Masrani (Irrfan Khan) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various genetic experts (B.D. Wong) and other scientific people to practice embryos and other weird experiments . Later on , during an inspection , a security agent disables the security system so that he can make his surveillance , this enables a huge dinosaur to escape the enclosure . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur : ¨Indominus Rex"" , it means ""Fierce/Untamed King"" in Latin , after the hybrid dinosaur's erratically destructive and murderous nature that exhibits to run amok against the tourists . Then , the two kiddies escape through the park in a Gyrosphere featured in the resort tour , being pursued by the carnivorous animal and things go awry .This is an agreeable entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . Interesting and enjoyable premise about DNA of a prehistoric dinosaur taken from an ancient insect and subsequent scientist experiments leading a extremely lethal creature is wonderfully developed . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Pterodactilos , Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses , Gallimimus stampede , although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Along with a Mosasaurus that shows up soaking a lot of extras in the bleacher section and eating a shark but suggested that when the animal grabs the shark that the whole bleacher section submerge underwater using a hydraulic system so that the audience will be able to see the Mosasaurus feeding underwater . In fact , the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're also some stirring and exciting scenes where the actors give vigorous physical performances . Magnificent FX totally convincing are for combination of models and computer animation from Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas , as well as Phil Tippett effects returning to crew duties as Dinosaur Supervisor, reprising his role from the original film. . As always spectacular music by Michael Giacchino , replacing John Williams , and music in the trailer is a rendition of 'John Williams' original theme , this marks the first ""Jurassic"" film for Michael Giacchino ; and excellent and colorful cinematography by John Schwartzman . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Colin Trevorrow . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . Other entries of this fantastic saga are the followings : ¨Jurassik park¨ by Steven Spileberg followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and ¨Jurassik Park III¨ by Joe Johnston . After Jurassic World became the fourth highest grossing film of all time, Jurassic World 2 was announced for 2018 , being directed by J.A. Bayona . The film will appeal to teenagers and grown-up , but no for small kids by violent , realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not worth it,"I really enjoyed the first 2 Jurassic park movies! I always give movies a chance which are continuations, remakes, sequels or prequels, however this movie did NOT deliver the viewing goods. It was all very cheesy and predictable. It didn't have me in awe or keep me interested. The story was silly and the characters I didn't really care about. It all seemed a bit weak, it's difficult to go into more detail about why I don't like it without seeming like giving spoilers, so in conclusion, some good scenes here and there but very weak and not worth it. I don't recommend you spend time or money to see this, wait until you can see it at home.

Bryce Dallas Howard was also good, her character at first can be annoying but she develops through the movie, and you can stand her more and feel for her more.The dinosaurs looked good, and I could tell when they used practical effects.

I was very wrong... this film held a great amount of action and surprises, I could not even blink during this film in case I missed something, it has to be the most exciting and thrilling film I have ever seen and people will disagree with me when I say I think it is better than Jurassic Park, it felt like we really saw the sights of the island in much more detail and the story was absolutely brilliant. I do think they should end it there for the Jurassic Series as this film makes an excellent end to an excellent series. Well Done to Colin Trevorrow for directing such an excellent film.

Jurassic World Review,"22 years after the events of the first Jurassic Park attempt, John Hammonds vision has come to life in the form of Jurassic World. In a marketing scheme to create buzz about the park, scientists create what is known as the Indominus Rex, but what they have created is worse then they could have ever imagined.I remember watching this once, shortly after it was released on dvd but I couldn't remember specifics until I started watching it. Watching it again I found that my initial reaction was that this is a great film. But upon further reflection, I found that I do consider this movie to be good but not great.The reason my opinion changed is because of how fun this film is. Once you get the initial character introductions done the film is very thrilling, but that is a very big distraction to some poor writing.Chris Pratt is incredible as Owen Grady and is easily the best character in this film. His connection to the raptors is handled very well and whenever their on screen you feel the sense of fear but also mesmerization. Bryce Dallas Howard is also very good as Claire Dearing and I throughly enjoyed her characters arc. The two kids on the other hand played by Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are both very underdeveloped. They are given some interesting back story's but once the dinosaur mayhem begins they don't touch on it at all.Their are a good amount of subplots that are all as well underdeveloped. The subplots involving Vincent D'Onofrio and BD Wongs characters are touched on but not visited enough for them to be intriguing.Although their are underdeveloped characters and plots the core of what makes Jurassic movies so fun is there. The movie is constantly thrilling and in my opinion the visuals are across the board great. The use of the new dinosaur is great and as I mentioned I really enjoyed the use of the raptor training.Overall this is a good film with a couple of great characters and a thrilling plot, but the underdevelopment of certain characters and sub plots taint the overall quality of the film.7.5/10

Colin Trevorrow Could Be The Next George Lucas/Steven Spielberg.,"For the sheer spectacular special effects, background music and photography I give 10/10. The cast is also 10/10.But now comes the most important question, would I want to see this film again? The answer is a solid ""no"". Even if someone gave me a free ticket I would just give it back to him. The reason is this: predictable ending. The good-guys always make it without a scratch.Now why on earth would we go to see a film where we already know the outcome? Because we are born suckers. We spend all of our money on such filthy, depraved, generic trash films instead of doing something good with it such as buying a homeless person a meal or visiting and comforting someone who is terminally ill.Do not show any of your kids movies unless they are of an educative purpose or documentary, where they learn something. Take your kids to the park, camping or seaside rather then these films. Limit and monitor their internet use as well. Teach them to do simple household chores in your spare time. And make sure they are doing their homework.Back to the film: Twenty-two years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a new park, Jurassic World, has become a successful resort. The Masrani Global Corporation – owner of the genetics company InGen that creates the dinosaurs – has been operating the park on the same island for the past ten years. Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World to see their aunt Claire, the park's operations manager. Claire, a busy workaholic, assigns her assistant to be their guide, but the boys evade her and explore the resort on their own.Verdict: pure 100% grade CGI effects churned by modern computers. Vincent D'Onofrio is the pick of the bunch followed by both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. The direction was so professionally handled, that I thought maybe Spielberg or Lucas was directing the film. Well it turns out that Colin T.

You know already at some point some dinosaurs are going to escape. You can tell which nobodies are going to be eaten. You can guess how Indominus is going to die in the end.But to see people screaming and running, how the hero proves the cooperate wrong, Chris Pratt riding with the 'raptors...It's fun!!I don't care about the thin plot.

Not terrible (at all) but not Spielberg,"This is a fun enough movie, but as the fourth movie in the series, it has descended into following the formula much too closely. Chris Pratt is just okay as the lead here. I thought he was much better in ""Zero Dark Thirty"". The child characters were annoying and not really necessary, except as part of the formula. I did sort of like Bryce Dallas Howard, though. Also Katie McGrath. I realize that it is not intended to be super-realistic movie. But a couple of the numerous plot holes bugged me immensely. One is kids(!) being able to start and drive a jeep that had been abandoned for 22 years. Wow. Another was Ms. Howards ""ridiculous"" shoes. She runs full speed on pavement and through jungle (!) wearing high heeled pumps, and never breaks a heel or loses a shoe. Anyway it is not terrible (at all) but it isn't really Spielberg.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lack of story but still enjoyable,"This was undoubtedly one of the funniest movies of 2015 begin Kingsman the secret service for me. Sadly were as Kingsman had strong and amazing characters with a lot of layers Jurassic World instead goes for a more cheesy and over the top approach that I really don't like at all. For this reason it lost a lot of its greatness when the idea of going back to see it again came into my mind.It is a film that I like overall, but has so notable issues. The characters aren't well defined. The children are just annoying little brats as well.Yet the film still manages to succeed on other fronts such as its CGI is great and soo much fun to look at in 3D or IMAX. The overall experience is really gripping and interesting as well making for an overall pretty fun final product.In the end while a flawed film it still worth the watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Plot Devices, I mean Characters, and NEW IDEAS FOR ONCE!","Jurassic World is the only worthy sequel to the original, as the other ones only serve as unneeded spin offs about random happenings in the fictional universe. This, however, realizes the story of Jurassic Park wasn't so much about the Dinosaurs as it was about their creation and the science behind it. The other movies just had people vaguely interacting with the Dinosaurs, not expanding upon this cloning science. This movie smartly serves as a direct sequel because it introduces the idea of splicing multiple pieces of Dinosaur DNA together to create an ideal or modified new species. It also smartly serves as a direct sequel by actually talking about the Park in question, where the sequels took place on some other island with events having no direct affect on the Park or the dinosaurs there in the end. Different people in the fictional universe unconnected to those working on the park, such as Ingen and other scientists working on something new, were plaguing the sequels but here it we know what the main players are up to after all these years.The problem I have with this movie is obviously the characterization. The story has many similar notes to the original but how those similar events are carried out in a new way make the movie watchable. The new ideas presented make it interesting but it was almost difficult on the first viewing because I genuinely did not care even a little bit about a single character in this, other than the Ingen Scientist from the original film. The characters were just there to fill the roles they were needed for, but that was it. They didn't add a new personality to go with it, they just had them carry out their roles and nothing more.Furthermore, the constant shoving down our throats that we shouldn't care about the park as Dinosaurs are old news and don't matter makes me bored because it makes the viewers think the dinosaurs are boring, making us care less about the main events. It's very difficult to ignore which would make caring about the positive part of this movie, the story, easier.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Jurassic Park Ever Made and Best 2015 Blockbuster Hands Down!!,I'm so angry Extremely angry at those comments which undermined that great movie to the extent that after reading the reviews here I felt so much this movie will turn up to be a let down and was about to skip it!! The only reason I went to see it after reading those reviews which all pointed that its not all that also said not bad yet not great was that I had nothing else better to do that evening!! and Boy was I so wrong!!!! Seriously at least 70% of the comments out here are so damn faithful to Jurassic 1&2 to the extent they became blinded to anything that could actually be better!! And to be fair to those who dissed this movie they all pointed out that it is better than the 3rd installment which to me meant nothing much because Part 3 was a total waste of time and anything compared to it will be better!! Therefor I seriously considered waiting for it to come on DVD instead of wasting valuable time driving down to me local IMAX to watch it!! Well I went with almost zero expectations which is not good in my case because it makes me see the worst in a movie instead of being optimistic and boy that movie rocked me side way upwards downwards you name it and the strength ultimately came from the amazing extra ordinary story line and the effects combined with some amazing direction and camera work that blow me away!! I immediately went down to memory lane to remind myself how good really Jurassic Park 1&2 actually were?!!However I could not help myself thinking this story line and movie all together is actually better way better than the original Jurassic Park and the reason for this is that this movie is more serious you may say and darker than the first two with a solid captivating story line that I would expect would catch the attention of almost anyone serious about movies. I consider myself one of the world's best movie watchers and if there was an award I would surely run for it because I have seen almost every decent movie that has come out from 1965 till now with a few exceptional ones beyond those dates!! That doesn't mean that my taste in movies would appeal to everyone nor it means I know better than the rest of you may be just a little bit!!!! This movie is world class and by far the best Blockbuster of 2015 Hands both Down!! Go watch it folks and be fair when you rate a movie,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not Thrilling or Ground Breaking, Yet Still Fun","If you expect the thrill of the first movie, you'll be disappointed. If you expect ground-breaking CGI, look elsewhere. As has been repeatedly stated, some of the special effects felt low-budget. There were some recycled scenes that paid homage to the other movies in the series, but since they have been done before they lacked the original suspense that caused so many of us to grip our seats in fear and anticipation. Most of the deaths were so outrageous that they were laughable. A lot of the subplots were dropped halfway through or in the middle of the movie. Characters who started off playing a somewhat central role seemed to disappear without us knowing if they survived or not.Overall, the acting wasn't awful. Chris Pratt does a surprisingly excellent job of breaking away from his usual comedic roll into an action star. Bryce Dallas Howard and Infan Khan also play their roles quite well. Everyone else is Meh. But that seems to fit with the sometimes good and sometimes meh script and special effects.So why 7 stars?Because despite how implausible and cheap some of it was, overall it was still a FUN movie that everyone should see once in the theaters. Don't see it expecting to be wowed, see it expecting to be entertained. Then, and only then, you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Much better than the average blockbuster, truly a masterpiece!","Before watching Jurassic World, I expected good things about it, but I didn't feel like it was going to be something close to the original. I kinda felt like the trailer showed a lot from the movie itself, mainly the big bad dino. Well, I was wrong. I don't like to judge a movie by the trailer, but when I watched the actual movie, I was clearly surprised.The movie starts off with very-well done character development, and you get to know what Jurassic World theme park is all about. The way it works, the main attractions, the overall park functionality are actually believable. The characters stand out for they personality and it's quite impressive the way they connect through-out the movie run- time.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is able to think like the dinos, and he raised 4 Velociraptors to obey his instructions. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of the park functionality. Zach and Gray are Claire's nephews. They get into serious trouble by running away from the park.And then, there's Indominus Rex, the genetically modified hybrid, that is able to think, hunt and make chaos like no other dinosaur. It's huge, and it's the most vicious creature ever seen in a Jurassic Park film yet. The Indominus like every other dino in the movie looks absolutely astonishing, it's wonderful to see how much the CGI advanced since the first movie.There's tons of detail in the dinos expressions and CG landscapes. But it's not all CG, like the original they also used special effects with real life props of dinos in some scenes.It's predictable in some parts, but I can assure you that it won't cease to amaze. A movie like this, is the perfect example of what a well-done sequel is, even though the movie ignores the existence of The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.This was, for me, the most anticipated movie this year, because I've been waiting for it for several years and it's finally here. I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Jurassic Park series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's nothing new, but still has a good sense of fun, albeit clichéd.","Jurassic World is literally history repeating itself: we see these people come into this theme park that is the most dangerous type of amusement for human beings, fictional or otherwise: having them interact with dinosaurs created from fossilized mosquito DNA.This is the fourth installment of the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, and quite possibly the stupidest one of the lot: you have Vincent D'Onofrio portraying a villain that's basically every single evil military-minded bad guy from films of the 90s. Oh, and not to get confused with the Marvel connotations at all, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (Guardians of the Galaxy and Spiderman actors respectively) star in this brain-fart of a blockbuster side by side, and have no emotional chemistry most of the time they're on screen.Despite the script being pretty dumb even for blockbuster standards, Colin Trevorrow does a good job at directing an otherwise maniacal story unfold on the screen. It's an entertaining film, but for a movie that broke so many records, it's surprisingly forgettable and disposable compared to other more substantial blockbusters in recent years: The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, and Mad Max: Fury Road just to name a few more substantial films, at least for my taste in movies.Entertaining, but not the kind of blockbuster that will be remembered for generations to come; it's more of a come-and-go kind of film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Predictable and boring story with boring actors. Nevertheless the dinos are great.,"I'm giving Jurassic World a seven star rating purely based on the special effects that I really liked. The dinosaurs looked very real and that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this movie. For the rest the storyline is very lame and predictable. From the beginning I had an allergic reaction to that little kid Gray (played by Ty Simpkins). You wish the whole time he will die in the most atrocious way possible. But you know it will never happen. I hope that one day he will play in Game Of Thrones because there all the main characters die eventually and that's what makes it so much better then those predictable movies. That kid is one of the main reasons I will never have kids. What an annoying kid he was. Another guy that I don't really like is Chris Pratt. In Parks and Recreation he was the only character that really bothered me. And since I know he is an avid hunter and Jesus worshiper I can stand him even lesser. I was also hoping he would die, but you know it won't happen. Bad acting doesn't make you die when you are the so called hero in those movies. All in all you will like the movie for the dinos but don't expect anything from the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"When Dinosaurs Ruled and They Still Rule: Nostalgia, Bigger, Not the Biggest, Brighter,Not the brightest, The Best Sequel to the 1993 film","Jurassic World doesn't come closer to the first film but Spielberg's JP will definitely look at Jurassic World with pride. It is indeed the most fitting sequel. It's clear that the corporate sector and humans in general haven't learned from their mistakes. They have created a new hybrid to increase the visitor count to the park. In the process, they have compromised human safety and thoughts of how devastating the consequences would be. That's what JW uses as the primal theme revealing the consequences of the violation of the natural order. The Indominius Rex, a product of human intelligence and progress turns back on it's creators and anything that crosses it's path. Now, it's up to Owen Grady and Claire to contain and restrain the 'killing machine'.Acting: Chris Pratt fits into the skin of Owen Grady. He gives a serious and intense performance. He doesn't make the scenes involving him training the Velociraptors cheesy.Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress. She prove it in ""The Help"" and she has done it again. She is convincing as the serious corporate woman struggling to keep her foot firmly on the floor and her evolution into an action heroine is entertaining.Though Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are fine but Tim and Lex were far better. The latter two had the best scene in the franchise involving the raptors in the kitchen.Direction: Trevorrow goes close to Spielberg in his direction of the film. He took up a linear plot and gave it a fine execution. Hats off to him for providing Jurassic Park with the most fitting sequel.Story: Though the story was far better in the first film, yet the script in JW shines and entertains. It rests firmly on the screenplay that succeeds in entertaining the audiences. The second half was epic and the climax was grand and applause worthy (best in the franchise). Definitely worth the wait, the hype and the money spent.Technical Aspects: The background score is effective as always and carries a feeling of nostalgia with it. The CGI and the animatronics have been well blended. The editing was tight. The only complaint the running time could have been at least 15 minutes longer.Acting: 6.5/10 Direction: 7/10 Story and Screenplay: 6/10+ 8/10= 7/10 Music: 10/10 Technique: 9.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park ... I mean World reloaded,"So they needed how many years to work on that script? But at least the effect people had more to work with, so this is the best looking Jurassic Park movie yet (does it matter if it's called World? Most people will say they watched Jurassic Park, which is just the truth). So while we get a remix version of the first movie with some enhancements (Dinosaur and people-wise), this can be fun to watch.So why ""just"" 6/10? You get Chris Pratt in this, who ""killed"" it (not literally of course), but even if he has some real ""suave"" (scenes), he can't lift this higher than it can get. Visually stunning with some very nice action scenes indeed. Of course there is sequel material to this reboot. And it's as predictable as it gets. Dinosaurs are back (again) and they never looked better (or more ""evolved"") ... a bit more brain would have been nice though",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best Jurassic Park movie by far!,"I had to make an IMDb account just so I could post this review. At first I wasn't to sure about seeing this movie as it's already been done 3 times and it's always the same storyline...but this is very different. The movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I've watched the Jurassic Park movies at least a hundred times and the first one has always been my favorite - but this one blows it out of the water. The CGI is excellent. It's got a good storyline. The acting is excellent. And it's also quite funny. Chris Pratt does an excellent job and really brings a lot of laughter, especially at times when there is suspense.

A Monster-sized adventure !,"The emergence of another 'Jurassic Park' sequel after the failure of 'Jurassic Park III' was bound to open the movie to criticism as exploring the world of dinosaurs seems to have been exhausted. However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going. Jurassic World does what a great sequel should do, which is to take what the original had and change a few things while adding on a few sub-plots. Take the family and settle down to a a couple of hours of summer movie fun!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exciting adventure with dazzling visual effects,"It's been fourteen years since the Jurassic Park franchise came to a halt after it's third installment which was critical failure, but nonetheless a box office hit. By today, very few were expecting to seethe dinosaurs to strike back again for more explosive considering the development hell of the third sequel that is was eventually thrown out. With over decades past since the series debut, many will go into this film and wonder whether or not director Colin Trevrrow and executivep producer Steven Spielberg are able to effectively capture spirit of the predecessor, if not the everlasting nostaglia. Judging by the screenplay and visual effects put to great use, this reboot of the series succeeds at doing both, if a little flawed in it's execution. So goes on this time around? Well, this takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, Jurassic Park has re-opened with dinosaurs who are now genetically modified. Working at the park is operations manager Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who is scheduled a visit with her two nephews Gray (played by Ty Simpkins) and Zach (played by Nick Robinson, and velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt). What starts off as a fine day of enormous tourism turns into utter chaos when the dinosaurs break loose and causing havoc throughout the park.When it comes to rebooting a classic franchise, it is understandable to be fearful of the spirit and novelty to be lost in a sea of failed ideas. Luckily, this film manages to capture almost same fun and excitement fans experienced 22 years ago when the dinosaurs began chomping and roaring on the silver screen. Though the absence of John Williams' classic score and the direction of Steven Spielberg can be gently felt, they both do little to take away from the endless excitement Colin Trevorrow brings the picture. The anticipated intensity begins not long after our prehistoric creatures break loose from their confined territory and launch a massive onslaught throughout the titular theme park attraction, and thousands of calm tourists are quickly triggered into panic mode running and screaming for their dear lives. These sequences are beautifully brought together in sweet CGI and surface level special effects to dazzle the eyes. But the fun doesn't quite end there. The charisma of Chris Pratt is gracefully brought to the screen often alternating between comic relief and light-hearted heroism. Pratt fits perfectly in this role, and his light-hearted personality he brings to the character is often too likable to ignored.Jurassic World is definitely one of the best films of the summer, and by man means makes for a solid, if slightly undermined return for the Jurassic Park franchise. With the wide plethora of explosive visuals and action sequences the feat the eyes hardcore movie goers everywhere, it is a film destined to see a bright sunshine at the box office.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""It's like the perfect sequel... 22 years later""","So here we are 22 years after Steven Spielberg changed for that generation and every subsequent generation since, the original Jurassic Park is an all time favourite of mine and millions of others I'd imagine. So how did the latest instalment in the franchise by Colin Trevorrow hold up against the rest? Lets start off with the story, a well paced blockbuster, with some nice turns that while aren't mind-blowing, they will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to say too much and give it away, but they also wrote in some wonderful nods to the original which the fans of the first will adore and the younger fans will love when they are told about them. There is times when the subplots do not seem to make that much sense, that could be due to longevity that the project has gone through with numerous rewrites and tweaks, notably the parents getting divorced it didn't add anything to the film and didn't change the view of the young lads. That aside the story was solid and simple but a nice ride.Another stellar cast for a Jurassic Park film, who would have thought that they could build a cast that was as enjoyable to watch as the original? I surely didn't, there was some brilliant performances some that really stood out for me were Ty Simpkins who at 13 is kick ass in the acting world, Nick Robinson, Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt who is fun in ANYTHING he does, the dude is just a joy to watch plus his and Bryce's on screen chemistry felt real. D'Onofrio serves as the human villain in the film and to be honest he really isn't as good as we are used to seeing him, it feels over the top if you will. Saying these performances stood up does not mean I found the others lacking, just not as great as these specific ones. Not the right place to say but yet again another performance from Nick Robinson that adds credence to my personal opinion that he would make a pretty good Peter Parker, thought it since I first seen him in ""Melissa & Joey"".Yet again another film in the series that had some breathtaking cinematography, which was done by the very talented Academy Award nominee John Schwartzman, some of the wide shots are beautiful. Which for the Jurassic World franchise is a big thing, I mean look at the first, it has one of the greatest all time pieces of cinematography, so this one had to have some wonderful shots too, which do not worry it does.Hard to believe this is only Colin Trevorrow's second feature film, which he did not only direct he also co-writ with his previous writing partner Derek Connolly who he worked with on ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". Which was an enjoyable film according to the people I have spoken to about it, Colin does what many directors over the past decade have worried they couldn't do, he made a film 22 years after the original and still was able to keep that wonderful charm the first had. This film is by no means better than the first, but was easily the second best in the franchise, after this I can see Colin going VERY far in the movie world.My only complaint really was the lack of practical effects, I have always been an advocate for practical effects. The use of them in the original especially when the dinosaur hatches from the egg was something that made me fall in love with the art form that is practical effects. I just feel more drawn in when it comes it practical effects, not to say the CGI was poor or anything, the film was still visually stunning, it is just a personal preference of mine to have visual effects if and when possible. If so we would still have masters like Rick Baker working in the business and not retiring. That all being said, the visuals effects were amazing to watch and I'm sure anybody would agree, they also had a wonderful use of scale on the dinosaurs to really give the audience the feeling of how big these ""monsters"" truly would be if around today.Overall this film was a thoroughly good watch, heck good it was great. I enjoyed it start to finish, it was not what I expected but it was brilliant none the less. Throughout the film there is a few misses, however the rest of the film really delivers in a big way I found. While it doesn't hit the heights of the first film it was truly a masterpiece in the blockbuster, bringing back the summer family blockbuster I really hope. Fingers crossed this gets Steven Spielberg to jump back into this world and he picks up Chris Pratt for the next Indiana Jones film. This film excelled in all categories and is a brilliant film for all to see, truly a revival of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Untamable Devil.,"One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that ""Indiana Jones 4"" received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it's a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it's very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg's deft touch.There's a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce's high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it's a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it's some sort of series disgrace. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Lot's of Fun,"I didn't expect this movie to be amazing, and as expected it fulfilled all my expectations.Jurassic World's plot was pretty basic. It was clear that it wasn't going for a deep, engaging plot. And it certainly didn't have a deep, engaging plot. It was still lot's of fun to see how everything played out though.The characters were actually a lot better done than I expected. All four main characters received relatively equal amounts of screen time, so no one ever felt more important than another. This made it difficult to figure out who the main character was. This was actually really impressive to me, considering it's typically blatantly obvious who the most important character is.The movie was very entertaining. Although some things didn't go well with the rest of the movie, they were always drowned out by the fact that dinosaurs were everywhere. But instead of being small-scale like in the first movie, this was large-scale so loads of people were constantly getting eaten and killed by dinosaurs.Overall Jurassic World is just a heck of a lot of fun. The plot isn't amazing, the characters were good and quite impressive, and there was lot's of good, clean, dinosaur fun. If this movie's goal was to simply entertain, then they achieved that multiple times over. Sure, there was one scene in particular that I felt was out of place, but once again, it was drowned out by everyone getting eaten and the dinosaurs. In the end I would recommend Jurassic World, but not for someone looking for something amazing, but for something fun and entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but disappointingly not great.","I'm loath to compare the latest Jurassic sequel with the 1993 Spielberg original, because, quite simply, the latter is a bona fide blockbuster classic that very few can compare with. Even taken on its own, more lenient popcorn-merits though, this CGI-laden dinosaur romp is a bag of liquorice all sorts. On one hand there are some rip-roaring set pieces that evoke a child-like joy, on the other a clutch of embarrassingly corny moments (hello, heroic velociraptor in slow-mo) that should have never made it past the drawing board. For every amusingly tongue-in-cheek line delivered by Chris Pratt's charismatic protagonist, there's an equally dumb plot hole – like a ludicrously stupid creature cameo in the climax – that reeks of a subpar script. The CGI is not as distracting as you might think and provides director Colin Trevorrow with the opportunity to craft a few spectacular sequences, yet there's a disappointing lack of tension and scares on display. The hit and miss output stays true for the eclectic cast. Pratt is affable, Bryce Dallas Howard is steely but likable, Jake Johnson is humorous in full-nerd mode, and Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy add gravitas in small roles; whilst Vincent D'Onofrio is depressingly one-dimensional, and child duo Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are unbearably awkward and bland. An admirable effort to rekindle the dino-magic that falls squarely into the good-but-not-great category, its spate of flaws makes it hard to recommend with confidence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good fun movie,"Well. I'm not expecting anyone to be reading this after 900 reviews at IMDb, so I'm gonna be a little loose.I remember Jurassic Park but I wasn't a big fan. I think I saw the other 2 movies but I only remember from the a somehow likable character to say to a velociraptor ""Clever girl"" just before he was brutally murdered.Anyway, even if you haven't seen JP I suggest to see JW.It is a fun, interesting movie. It has its thrilling moments, overall good visuals and good music from John Williams (yes, they kept his original theme).From casting and acting there are lots of things to be desired though. Especially the comedians Jake Johnson, in a semi-significant role and Lauren Lapkus should most definitely have to be recasted.It's the 5th most profitable movie of all time, so... it doesn't matter what the critics say.

Amazzzziiiinnnngggg!,"I watched this movie on my way home from NZ on the plane, when I first started the movie I was a half asleep, grumpy and jet-legged girl sitting on a flight for 13 hours next to a snoring middle aged man. I was just hoping this film would keep me awake, luckily within the first 15 mins of this film I was already attached to the characters and as the film carried on you could start to tell what suddenly was going to happen for the two characters Zach and Gray. At this point I was literally yelling at the screen telling the characters to either 'watch out', 'run' or 'move out of the way'. I'm pretty sure I ended up waking the guy next to me up, but I didn't really care at that point I was too busy watching this movie to really notice.

Satisfying but Same Old Same Old - just different cast,"I went into this film not expecting anything new, and my expectations were met. The film depicts the Isla Nubar 30 years or so after the original Jurassic Park fiasco. The difference is that Jurassic World is bigger, hugely popular, with many more genetically-mixed dinosaurs.The cast stars some young actors as the kids, not sure who they are - their acting extended as far as being scared. But Bryce Dallas Howard (Girl in the Water; The Village) was outstanding as Claire, the aunt who runs Jurassic World, and has thrust upon her these two nephews for whom she has no time - busy working single lady. Of course, enter Chris Pratt as Owen, semi-mysterious Dinosaur trainer with special skills to direct the Raptors (you remember them from the original). The movie was worth watching just to see these two interact with each other. They were the stars.The other major stars are the dinosaurs, or the CGI people who did a fantastic job putting all these dinosaurs into almost every scene. Tremendously life-like depictions really are the star of the show.I hope/trust you are not going to this movie for the story line. Shocker - something big gets out - things go wrong - people get stomped on and killed. Can't someone save the day?Of course, because Bryce is already signed up for a sequel. Although you know the story, and it's pretty much a repeat of the original series, the two main stars pull off a tough job and keeping you on your seat with some innovative chase scenes I have not seen before.All told, a satisfying story, kind of like putting on those well worn shoes you have, which feel so comfortable and familiar.

Brilliant film - a must see!,"I don't see why there are negative reviews on what I believe to be one of the best films made over the last 2 years. The film is cleverly made and the storyline is credible and in my opinion not to far fetched as you would expect from an American produced film. It touched on the reality aspect that mankind want to control nature and use this as a way of profit by creating a dinosaur (asset) bigger and stronger than all. The theme tune of what we all know well has been slowed down and is played at the right points in the film which adds a nice effect. I also like the scene where they find the old building from the original park which brought us back to the original film and provided a nice touch.

"Totally not bad sequel. I know it's not saying much, but it's the second best Jurassic Park movie, at least.","I set the bar for this one pretty low. My only hope was that it would be at least as good as Jurassic Park III, which, despite its reputation, is a perfectly decent sequel to the first one. Thankfully, it exceeded my expectations - at least by a bit. It is better than JP III by a nose, and a lot better than The Lost World. All I wanted was plenty of dino mayhem, and Colin Trevorrow delivers it with good humor. There are lots of dinosaurs and lots of action. Not a single setpiece as good as the big two from the first film, mind you, but the pterosaur attack is pretty awesome and the final battle is satisfying. The human characters are much less interesting than those of the first film, who aren't very interesting, either. Chris Pratt is a fine lead, though. I could really have done without Bryce Dallas Howard running around in her high heels. Even if she does get a big heroic moment, the character is just a lame stereotype for most of the film. The two teens could have easily been eaten the second they appeared and it wouldn't have bothered me. I enjoyed the presence of New Girl's Jake Johnson and Orange Is the New Black's Lauren Lapkus in the control room. There's a moment where Johnson looks at Pratt and in my mind he was asking Pratt off camera, ""You think in a couple years when my sitcom ends I could get a comic book franchise?""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A hybrid of numerous intentions,"This is one of the most divisive movies that I've seen in a while. It's one of those ""Love it or hate it"" where everybody has such intense feelings for it. I think that's because there are two main ideas of what a Jurassic Park movie should be. Is it a cerebral franchise that illustrates the hubris of humanity's attempts to control nature or is it just a fun monster movie romp with thrills and chills? I guess that's up to the audience so I won't tell you how you should judge the movie on those standards. I'm just going to judge it from your basic movie going perspective.Let me just say that all the dinosaur fights were fun, I almost always laughed at the comic relief, the story was easy to follow with generally believable character motives, and it moved at a nice pace. Some of the acting was pretty good. Chris Pratt was a fun character, and probably the best thing going for this movie. I do have complaints though: Vincent D'Onofrio's character was entirely one-dimensional, the CGI just isn't always convincing, and there are a lot of moments throughout the film that just strain your credulity. I realize it's a movie with dinosaurs come to life but it was a bit much at times. It even has a number of monster movie clichés that make the movie a bit predictable.I enjoyed my time with the movie, but it wasn't always as tense as it could have been. I guess if you judge it as a monster movie, it's fine. In all honesty, the plot felt like a Syfy original monster movie, only with a sizable budget and bankable actors - that's not entirely as bad as that sounds. If you're looking for something intellectually stimulating that forces you to think about the human condition, you might have a little meat, but you're going to be left hungry. Your enjoyment boils down to what you expect from the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
it's got dinosaurs in it,"I don't get why this film has any bad reviews really, it's a beast of a film and i can't think of any reason why someone wouldn't enjoy watching it. I went to the pictures as a kid to watch the first one, and I'm absolutely glad I was talked into going to watch this one with my fiancé all these years later, who also watched the first one at the time. Dinosaurs, although obviously not real, are still pretty cool to look at, and they look absolutely boss in this film! And that's why I don't get why people are moaning about it. I think that the idea of a bigger , angrier, smarter dinosaur wasn't the most original idea admittedly, but again, as dinosaurs ARE NOT REAL anyway, it hardly matters. This film was boss because it was quite jumpy at times, funny at times, and during loads of it I found myself thinking how cool it all was, and how I was gutted that dinosaurs actually don't exist to run riot, because it all actually looked quite good fun. Anyway, I've been telling anyone who has listened to go and watch it since last night, and this is actually the first time I ever wrote a review for anything, I just felt I should when I noticed how much the ratings had dropped since it came out , for mad reasons such as being predictable.

"""Maybe progress should lose for once.""","The fourth Jurassic Park film (and, given its success, not the last) is being hailed as the best since the original, with eyebrow-raising claims from some corners that it is as good as or even better than the original. Well that claim is patently absurd since this movie offers nothing unique of its own, but rather plays with the groundwork laid by the previous movies (particularly the first). Jurassic Park was an instant classic that had a little bit of everything. This one is just a very good movie and, yes, it's probably the best of the sequels so far. I did like the third one better than many did, however. The cast here is decent, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both likable leads. The two little kids are kind of forgettable, though, and the character played by Vincent D'Onofrio is straight out of the Big Book of Clichéd Villains. The script is good with plenty of humor and nods to the first film. Michael Giacchino's rousing score is nice but tries a little too hard at times to match John Williams (an impossible task). What everyone watches a movie like this for is the dinosaur action and this has that in spades. We get regular dinos and souped-up genetically engineered hybrid dinos, as well as the fan favorite velociraptors figuring into things in a clever way. The special effects are great and the monster fight climax is kick-ass. If you go into it with just the expectation of being entertained, you'll have fun watching it. If you go in expecting to be 'wowed' like you were with the first Jurassic Park, then you'll probably be a little underwhelmed by it.

Guys if you don't like this movie then I advise (this advice costs you for free) you not to waste your time on writing negative reviews.

Visually great but loses its way,"Jurassic World is not on a par with the original and I really don't see what the need was for a reboot, especially one with nothing new to add. It does entertain at times as long as you shut down your brain for a while and I guess that's how these films are meant to be viewed. Just plain old entertainment.It looks visually great with great landscapes and realistic dinosaurs, unfortunately the plot is weak and the script whilst having a few snappy one liners falls a bit flat. Chris Pratt does a good job as the lead but Bryce Dallas Howard's character is a disaster. I spent much of the second half of the film praying she'd be eaten. Sadly that would require a more imaginative plot and we are instead left to suffer one of the poorest performances from a lead in quite a while. The rest of the cast are OK but nothing more than the usual stereotypes.For all it's flaws there are some great scenes especially in the first half and I was intermittently entertained. This will probably appeal more to younger audiences than older ones who have seen all this before.Jurassic World just about scrapes a 7 for me but I won't rush to watch it again for some time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pratt+Blackwater+Dinosaurs= A Masterpiece,"OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it.

Do not go in expecting it to be like the original 3,"(MINOR SPOILERS)So I'll start by saying that I should have taken some advice and should have gone in with lower expectations because when I walked out I was disappointed, but that is only because I was trying to compare it to the original 3 movies which I should have known better because I knew going in it wouldn't be anything alike. Usually I tell myself to wait till the next day to rate it because normally it is higher when I sleep on it.The movie was very predictable I knew what was going to happen before it happened, although a plus would be that I loved all the references they had from the previous movies, but again I was never ""wowed"". Till the first half of the movie my rating barely hit 5/10, it had a dull start; also there were many other flaws that could have been fixed but again it's a movie. Things that got on my nerves: (spoiler alert) - how can that 8 year old kid get that original Jurassic Park jeep working after sitting idle for 22 years? Also, the raptors being trained (though shown in the trailer). Meh. I prefer it to be dinosaurs vs humans not dinosaurs and humans vs dinosaurs. Also those kids had a hundred chances to run instead they just stare at the big dinosaurs. And what was the deal with the older brother? Why was he so grumpy the entire time?The action however was superb and because of that the movie got a passing grade, otherwise it would have hovered at the 5-6/10 mark. The acting was average at best, some did above average and some below average. Overall, it was exciting (second half) action packed movie.

Pretty much all the characters give decent performances for an action flick but almost all the characters have been taken from other films. The plot kind of resembles How To Train Your Dragon 2 near the end though I'm not complaining that much because it does add that ""animal food chain/social dominance"" theme created by the big dino asset.

And then there's the gender issues. And the stupidity of all the characters. All of this is very much out in the open.What is more interesting, is to see all the effort the filmmakers put into acknowledging the expectations of the audience, and responding to the expected reactions they would have to the plot.One of the first scenes acknowledges the feathers-or-no-feathers-situation, and they make passing mentions to it later on in the movie as well. The same goes with the over the top plot of the movie, which it acknowledges and comments on. But it all falls kind of flat,a s it only acknowledges the choices they have made, but do not really comment on them. For instance, it makes fun of naming dinosaurs after products, but still features product placement heavily. It mentions how the audience always expect more and more, and the only way to make them happy is to give them more. Which is what this movie does just after.Basically: It acknowledges the challenges of making Jurassic Park 4, but rather than provide a solution, the movie gives up and blames the audience for wanting what it gives us.That said: It's a fun movie.

Though ""Jurassic World"" may not have the same effect, it still provides a very entertaining and thrilling experience. The dinosaurs are as real as ever, and their brutality is well portrayed.

Another watchable instalment,"17 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jurassic World. Let's just say I'm a BIG fan of these movies, right from the minute we saw Sir Richard Attenborough clutching that cane with the amber head, I was hooked. I don't care that it's fiction and highly improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise. To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten.

A refreshing sequel to Jurassic Park 1,"No movie should ever get a 10 but I gave it a 10 because it delivered the best Jurassic sequel possible. Don't read the negative reviews by some who argue that the main characters do stupid, illogical things, that the story is predictable, blah blah. Walking into the theater, 22 years after I saw the first Jurassic Park in 1993 as a teenager, I had the following expectations: a full working Jurassic Park with lots of visitors and exciting attractions built on the foundations laid out by Jurassic Park 1, kids getting into trouble, a male (or female) lead who do ballsy things and cool dinosaurs whose realism should surpass the previous 3 Jurassic movies. And that is exactly what Colin Trevorrow delivered. The dinosaurs look bad ass ; the hybrid dinosaur is believable and the velociraptors rule the movie. The pace is fast, the actors well cast and lots of people die. I won't spoil it any further so you just have to know that you can feel throughout the movie that it was directed by a new generation of directors who understand better than the old masters (Spielberg) how to combine humour, cgi, action and a tight direction. Humour you say ? Yes, Trevorrow manages to put in lots of funny bits even at tense moments and watch very closely to the dozens of winks to the first Jurassic Park movie he put in. The movie's score is somewhat in the background and makes full use of the original score by John Williams which was a smart move by composer Michael Giacchino, he knew not to try and do better than Williams. At certain scenes it was so quiet in the theater you could hear a pin drop so a bombastic score would simply have ruined it.

"Lacked the magic of Jurassic Park, but was still fantastic","Im just your average movie goer, so i don't like to nit-pick, so here we go.This movie takes place after the original series, so in the same time-line, about 20 years after Jurassic Park 3. The movie starts off with two brothers leaving the city to visit Jurassic World, a theme park with real live dinosaurs. As the audience gets introduced to this park, with all kinds of different attractions and animals, we learn that the park has problems keeping a constant flow of guests. Dinosaurs are now mainstream and the attractions are mainly for children. To combat this, the park creates a new type of dinosaur ever couple years to boost attendance. However, things go bad when they bread the perfect predator, who of course gets loose and starts killing for fun.The brothers are out in the park when the dino gets out, and Chris Pratt must rescue them, while at the same time avoiding this new dino. He must also battle other people, as Igen, a government agency, is planning on using dinosaurs for future wars and they have a special interest in this new dino.The movie itself was really good. They skipped on making the dinos new a magically and took a different route. They introduced a theme park where the average people could pet, feed, and even ride dinosaurs. I loved this idea, of actually having a park created. The story line was not too complicated and easy to follow. Sometimes too easy and too predictable, but there were other moments which, at least myself, was surprised. The acting was pretty good, Chris Pratt was of course the best actor. The female lead, Bryce Dallas Howard, did a good job in her role, despite being in high heels in the entire movie(not likely). There has been criticism for the lack of a strong female lead, but she wasn't suppose to be the tough one, she was a business women and when everyone life was on the line, had the idea that saved everyone.So overall, i recommend this movie, it was really fun, lots of action, the best dinosaur fights I've ever seen, and some comedy thrown in that was, for the most part, not forced in. The raptors were not as domesticated as the trailer and appear, and I've heard criticism again about taking away the raptors as the sneaky deadly dinos, but they were amazing. The CGI was very well done, and made the movie a joy to watch......I gave it a 8/10 because it did have flaws, the women were always crying while the men were the strong ones, the comedy felt forced once or twice, it had predictable moments, but overall, it was very fun, very funny and worth the crazy expensive ticket price...Go see it, and sit back for a good time.....and people need to stop being so nit-picky",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Surprisingly not bad!,"**Very mild spoilers**Just when you think Hollywood are going to butcher another franchise with some unnecessary reboot or sequel, the execution of ""Jurassic World"" actually works well enough for it be watchable and possibly exceed expectations for those who had their doubts (I certainly had mine before entering the theatre). This can mainly be pinned down to the cast, starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, whose characters are all (eventually) likable enough to want to follow their journey, especially Pratt, who was initially criticised for appearing too 'wooden' with his role when the first trailer made its way online. ""Jurassic World"" thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously either, with a nice handful of jokes and light-hearted moments scattered throughout, mainly in the latter acts of the movie.The film is dazzling, its vibrancy making it visually appealing to large audiences and also contributing to the fact that the film is not meant to be incredibly 'serious' (by alternatively employing a dark and washed out colour palette; a trope popular with 'rebooted' movies to imply a somber, grittier re-telling of a popular story). The CGI, which is definitely something of concern when involving the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, can look incredible at times (the Mosasaurus being my favourite example) but is undeniably overdone, especially when the previous trilogy evinced that animatronics are a plausible alternative in the appropriate shots. The illusion of dinosaurs being real and tangible in this movie universe is sadly broken by the overwhelming use of CGI.As a result, one of the major aspects missing from the film is the 'wow' factor that the previous movies instilled; dinosaur reveals just aren't exciting enough, especially when ""Jurassic World"" takes too long to even reveal the dinosaurs in the first place. Also disappointing is the fact that one of the first times we hear the grand and well-recognised ""Jurassic Park"" theme, composed by John Williams, is not for the dinosaur reveals but for a shot to establish the 'updated', modern theme park, glistening with standardisation and uniformity as it looks no different to any other immaculate holiday resort that we might expect, making the audience feel more 'amazed' by this 'modernised' park than the dinosaurs themselves.However, this all ties in to the themes and comments made on society's present consumerist ways, the fact that we want 'bigger' and 'better', the whole reason for creating the hybrid dinosaurs in the first place; we have been so used to seeing the various dinosaurs in ""Park""'s trilogy that the novelty has now worn off, hence the introduction of hybrid dinosaurs, a means to reel in a bigger audience and generate more excitement (and revenue).The Indominus Rex, the result of hybrid experimentation, is an interesting concept to begin with but soon loses its novelty as the film progresses. This terrible lizard can be easily replaceable with a 'Spinosaurus' or any other large, intimidating carnivore, and subsequently produce no change in the latter half of the movie whatsoever.""Jurassic World"" makes it tempting to dose off in the first half of the film as it takes its time to introduce its attractions and dinosaurs, most of which were spoiled and revealed in the trailer anyway. After most of the plot devices and characters have been established, however, the movie finally grabs your attention and launches into the action, although more of an effort could have been made to create more suspense and tension as the stakes just never feel high enough, especially with the main characters, who hardly feel as if they're in danger.Cutting right to the bone, ""Jurassic World"" is a solid film. While it isn't the most innovative out of the whole franchise and is sadly missing the 'wow' factor from its predecessors, it is entertaining enough and not too somber to appeal to and reel in wide audiences everywhere. Fans of the original ""Jurassic Park"" will also appreciate the many nods and easter eggs found throughout. I wouldn't particularly recommend ""Jurassic World"" but at the same time, I have no reason for deterring anyone to watch it at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Felt like a lost opportunity, still good.","I think the best though that the writers had is, MORE BAD MORE EVIL. The movie was good in a way that most movies gets good when they are so invested in. I wasn't disappointed in that aspect. It wasn't wasted money but being a sequel to a classic I really didn't enjoy what it became. It was too similar the old one, theme parks, forests, trapped in cars. Honestly I got abit excited to the end but that was it. Nonetheless, the movie is watchable and I would recommend it but don't expect something way better then the ones before. Its just a good movie with a huge budget.

"Howard, Pratt and Simpkins make Jurassic World...","One of the best, if not the best, of the series. I really enjoy the ones directed by Spielberg. But the only really memorable characters in them were Jeff Goldblum and Sir Richard Attenborough. In Jurassic World we have a beautiful and talented Bryce Dallas Howard, I didn't knew her before, but now I want to be the next Ron Howard's son-in-law. Chris Pratt has so much charisma and the guy is so likable, that he reminds me some Erroll Flynn attributes. In San Andreas, the British kids did a terrific job, so as Ty Simpkins did it in Jurassic World, you buy every emotion that he delivers, the kid is a great actor. Howard, Pratt and Simpkins performances enhance the movie. The film is very well paced and entertaining.

"""Hold onto your butts"" Jurassic Park is back","The hideous roar of a Tyrannosaurus rex and is stand over its prey is back.The dreams of a fully functioning dinosaur park finally come true in 2015's Jurassic World or does it? 20 years ago when the idea was first tried out, things didn't go so well. Alright, more like a total meltdown disaster. But, InGen corporation has figured out how to smooth out the bumps of the earlier park. John would have defiantly been proud of what it has become or would he? Did we learn to keep these dangerous animal in or do we once again get to hear the roaring screeches of these magnificent animals as we run for our lives in the opposite direction.Not only has InGen cloned and made extinct creatures, they have been able to fully incorporate this place into an incredible petting zoo with 5 star hotel and for the ladies shopping area's. The park is running so smoothly that they decided to up their game. The investors wanted something bigger,faster and scarier to add to the attractions and bring more people to the park. So the lab whipped up a genetically super beast made up of a T.Rex and a bunch of other top-secret animals that are being kept on the down low. They call it Indominus Rex. A new enormous attraction .Which gives the park administrator, Claire a lot more work on her plate. Who is frantically putting things together to get ready to show to the public. A hectic job yes, but she knows what she's doing and knows the business very well.She is a no nonsense kind of person, that's why when she has to work with Owen, and ex navy seal. Who was brought in to care for the raptors and learn how to control them. Owen was difficult to convince about the Indominus Rex, he had questions about safety, and how smart it was to genetically cross species to create a monster we know nothing about. Claire thinking he was just a silly boy who knew nothing about the business aspects of making the Indominus Rex. But, then disaster hit, again. As the Indominus starts doing things no one could have predicted it could do. Claire does have a little bit more to worry about however.Her nephews Zach and Gray were sent to the resort over Christmas break while their mother and father work through some marital problems at home. They are more of a problem for Claire because she had not connected with her family in a while she only had one thing on her mind, becoming the best business women she could be.Even though with the dinosaur on the loose, this becomes a good thing for the boys as the band together and bond like never have. Both Claire and Own risk their lives and save each other numerous of time while look for these lost nephews and try to capture the Indominus Rex.There is no sexual content inappropriate for children, the violence however is a little bit of a different story. There are a few moments of animals getting torn apart, things that is dripping with blood or it spattered on the wall and a few flesh ripping scenes from the dinosaurs. A lot of raptor attacks where a raptor does rip off a human's arms. Raptors attack and rip soldiers apart in a forest. Pterodactyls swooping in on large groups of people using their large scary talons to throw people around like a rag doll. A woman is grabbed and pulled back and forth back and forth by two dinosaurs flying in the air then reach up and grabbed then swallowed whole. Many gun scenes with bullets blazing. And the worst of all Owen punches Hoskins in the face. Okay, that not true.Not too much crude or profane language. Only a few drug and alcohol content where we see a guy picking up two margaritas at the resort, and only one joke about the craziness of a diet that does not include tequila but, nothing your child will pick up on.We see that a park for dinosaurs is just not a great idea it didn't work 20 years ago why would it work now? Those investors have got to stop investing in these things. You enjoy the great acting put on by the entire cast you will feel a few cheesy parts, but what movie doesn't have little cheese? You'll witness a scary, thrilling, exhilarating ride through these giant reptilian CGI that captures the dinosaur in a very lifelike way. You'll not be disappointed. You will be on the edge of your seat grasping at the hand of the person next to you, even if you don't know them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now This is a Summer Blockbuster Done Right,"I went to see Jurassic World today with my friend. We did not see the 3D nor the IMAX. We went into the normal 2D and expected to enjoy this movie, nothing really more. Having now seen it, I can now confidently say that this movie is the best Jurassic Park sequel and a great time in the theater. I went into this knowing that no sequel will ever match the awe and wonder of the original, so I just expected to see some great Dino mayhem, and this movie delivers extremely well.The story follows some interesting characters working on the Jurassic World resort. In this day of age, people are no longer impressed with regular dinosaurs. Because of this, InGen, the corporation in charge of running the park, called on the laboratory scientists working on the park to make a new hybrid dinosaur to be scarier, bigger, and better than all the other dinosaurs in the park. Enter the Indominus Rex, Jurassic World's answer to the unimpressed customers coming to the resort. However, as expected, not everything goes according to plan. Thus ensues a movie that is as chaotic as the trailers have promised.As for the characters themselves, Chris Pratt confirms once again that he is able to lead an action movie and is sure to see more movies like this in the future. Bryce Dallas Howard is fine as the stern corporation employee who only sees the dinosaurs as ""assets."" The rest of the characters and actors fit well into the story and add more to the tension. (And the body count)Viewing the movie from a technical standpoint, there are various flaws, but none to take away from the enjoyment of the film overall. The script is a little uneven in places and there are a few characters whose arcs could have been explored more.Overall though, Jurassic World excels in its wonderful visuals and tense action scenes. Colin Trevorrow crafted this film amazingly and has shown himself to be an up and coming director to look out for. Lastly, a compliment must be given to Michael Giacchino's wonderful score that manages to recapture the wonder from the first movie and also add to the tone of this sequel. Jurassic World is everything you can ask for from a summer blockbuster bearing the ""Jurassic"" title.""Monster is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Cheesosaurus,"I can't believe I sat in the cinema and watched the first film in the series TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO. Hell's teethAnyway, taking the wise decision to ignore the second and third films of the series, this was a fun, well-made action romp with plenty of clever - but not smug - nods to the original (including themes from John Williams' score). Scary bits, funny bits, somewhat gruesome bits and the CGI held up to scrutiny in a way it so disappointingly doesn't these days!My only problems with the film were the occasional OTT Hollywood moments (esp. towards the end, but then again you can't really complain about a Hollywood blockbuster having Hollywood blockbuster moments in it!), and the fact that the female characters were either Cold, Childless Monsters, or spent most of their screen time crying. Because everybody knows, your life cannot possibly be complete if you don't have children. I know this because Hollywood told me so.Also, Ty Simpkins is a cracking little actor - it'll be interesting to see if he carries this on into adulthood.

Predictable,"I watched this on an airline flight. After 30 minutes I fell asleep. On the return flight I forced myself to watch the rest. Within 40 minutes of the start of the film I knew who was going to die and who wasn't, how the story was going to resolve (if you can call it that) and the fact that I didn't care about ANY of the characters. I also couldn't name a single one of them. There was more character development in the Flintstones. People did the same stupid things that NO ONE would actually do in real life (yelling when there's a big killer dinosaur looking for them, standing up on high ground etc.) The story was so thin it was probably written on a cocktail napkin. Special effects guys did the usual amazing job, and Pratt tried REALLY hard, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I was grateful when the turbulence hit my plane and the pilot interrupted it. I cannot believe that this utter pile of garbage took in a billion dollars.

A world of predators and we are the prey,"A fourth installment of the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise has long been in the works, and if nothing else, its assembly at least gives this new generation something to warmly embrace that doesn't find itself cloaked in candy colors and Marvel branding. On my way to the theater, I kept trying to think of what I exactly wanted ""Jurassic World"" to accomplish as a film, and it didn't take long to realize that I was over-analyzing a lot of my expectations. The only thing I wanted was the element of wonder and danger that was missing in the third installment, but heavily present in the first and underrated second film.On that note, ""Jurassic World"" delivers quite a bit of suspense and exhilaration. I would even say it goes far beyond the thrill and intensity factor of the original film with what it chooses to show. There's much more blood and violence than in any of the previous films, and the special effects are some of the strongest the series has ever seen. Aside from occasionally appearing to be a Samsung sponsored commodity with the heavy emphasis on product placement, in addition to elements that almost seem like self-parody for a summer blockbuster, this is only one of the many summer blockbusters we've been spoiled to so early in the season.Our setting is Jurassic World, a monstrous theme park housing real-life dinosaurs, some of which genetically modified, that provides the thrills and excitements of living with dinosaurs. We immediately focus on Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), two young boys who venture out to Jurassic World to visit their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the park. Claire, however, is busy trying to attract financiers to see the park's new ""Indominus Rex,"" one of the genetically modified dinosaurs that combines eight different species of animal to, in turn, create a humongous dinosaur.The park's main dinosaur trainer is Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), an ex-Navy member, who immediately works to help after a catastrophic turn of events has Indominus Rex leaving his concubine, wreaking havoc on the park. Numerous failed attempts to cage and detain the beast eventually result in several other dinosaurs being let out of their cages, causing for a complete meltdown of the entire facility. Despite lacking in proper artillery and being responsible for hundreds of thousands of lives, Owen and Claire work together to try and stop the beasts from terrorizing the park.The original ""Jurassic Park"" worked so well because of its emphasis on peril. The film put you into a barrage of situations that felt like you were at the mercy of the same large, hulking beasts the characters on-screen were running from. ""Jurassic World"" restores that element, constantly trapping the viewer in an awkward or frightening position, with Colin Trevorrow commanding controlled but large-scale direction at all times. This is the essence of why ""Jurassic World"" is such a thrill; it plunges us into many different scenarios and gives us a variety of evocative landscapes and dinosaurs to feast our eyes on at all times.Through starring roles in some of Hollywood's loftiest and most expensive productions, Pratt has finally asserted his ability to command a presence. If ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" didn't convince you that he wasn't on top of his game, ""Jurassic World"" will be that deciding factor. He has the subtle, suave goofiness that doesn't make him bumbling and incompetent and the right amount of intelligence as a character actor to be taken seriously, and he rises to the occasion with this picture at every turn. His character is actually so interesting that it makes focusing on the two young boys feel like a burdened change in direction, mainly because Robinson's character is such a moody, unlikable teenager.In itself, ""Jurassic World""'s burdens come in the form of excessive product placement, to the point where if Starbucks or Samsung isn't being shoved down our face, it's Coca-Cola or Beats by Dre. Some don't pick up on product placement as easily as others, but when we're immersed in a theme park setting like this, which is predominately wilderness as is, these sorts of things are much easier to spot, especially when it seems that Trevorrow is trying to make sure that said product is always at eye-level with the audience when it's in frame. Furthermore, there's the obvious element of events occurring to the characters' advantage just in the nick of time, which, while common for the summer blockbuster genre, is nonetheless cloying and overly obvious. We've already been asked to suspend our disbelief for dinosaurs, so scenes like a dead Pterodactyl's beak coming dangerously close to one of the young boys' faces before slowing to a halt feels like a cheap shot at suspense and convenience.These burdens, however, do not discourage the fun ""Jurassic World"" brings. Few franchises from yesteryear that are revisited in the modern day have the ability to excite, but just hearing the name ""Jurassic Park"" brings to mind a multitude of different visuals that capture the imagination. ""Jurassic World"" is a testament to the imagination and proves, yet again, that even franchises that have laid dormant for several years can still get off the ground and morph into something worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great Potential for a New Franchise, but has a lot to Improve upon,","Jurassic World is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's a very enjoyable fourth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, the effects are amazing and there are some great intense scenes that will keep you at the edge of your seat, the two leads, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, are very likable and the chemistry between them is superb, if the studio orders sequels, which I'm sure they will, they need to return. I enjoyed the movie but it certainly had a lot of flaws, I think it's better than the Lost World and Jurassic Park III, but it was certainly the most predictable in the franchise, you could easily tell what characters were going to die and which would survive, and there are a few ""twists and turns"" that were very expected, the film seemed afraid to take any risks and do something that would differentiate itself from the previous movies, which is never a good thing for a sequel to do, it should have wanted to stand out more. The story tends to drag as well, running for over two hours, it really should have only been 100 minutes, no longer than that, there is way too much build up for the main story to finally happen that it leaves you bored at times, I think Jurassic World has some great potential to be a terrific new franchise, but they have many things they need to improve upon before they can move forward, and if they could get Spielberg back on the directors chair, even better. It has many imperfections and fans of the original Jurassic Park won't be thrilled, but Jurassic World is still a fun ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure or action film.The original dinosaur theme park that was envisioned by John Hammond is now a reality, however, a new attraction designed to bring back people's interest begins to backfire horribly.Best Performance: Bryce Dallas Howard Worst Performance: Katie McGrath",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you don't take it seriously, you will have a good time.","If you look at it from an objective point of view, technically, this movie is average at best. But if you manage to leave your brain turned on, given that you have one, you will have a lot of fun watching this one. Not that this film is so bad that it's good, but if you just walk into the theater expecting a fun monster movie you won't be disappointed.The fact that this movie is ironically ripping of Godzilla, might annoy a few people, but the movie is well aware of this. Things like the leader of a group of soldiers, who are basically the Tokyo military, being an Asian, that some people are wearing bullet proof wests while hunting a dinosaur or a dinosaur running in slow-motion, just to name a few, leave the impression that you are not supposed to take this seriously. Also, there are a lot of hilariously clichéd moments like the human villain and the forced family drama of our main characters which are supporting this impression even more. The downside of this though, is that the ""emotional"" scenes are almost painful to sit through because of our main characters.The Characters itself weren't that bad, but sometimes during my view i got the feeling, that the writers didn't know how to write teenagers. I mean, i know that wanting to go home to his girlfriend is the only character trait that Zach has but no one, no matter the age, would be bored watching dinosaurs. But in the middle of the film he instantly switches mood with his little brother and is ready to pick up other girls. Grays trades are also only serving as a plot point and Chris Pratts character basically never changes throughout the whole film which means that the only somewhat believable character we have is Claire who at least has something that could be called development. I know that i said that you shouldn't take this seriously, but that doesn't mean that you cant have good characters. However, i have to say that the acting is really good, even the kids are not that bad. There where only two scenes where i burst out laughing because a character spontaneously decided to cry in an instant with no reason other to have an emotional scene but it was just hilarious to me. However, i was glad that all of them are somewhat connected to each other and not some random strangers who just happen to run into each other.The action is pretty good and makes for some really cool fight scenes and the fact that you can predict everything that is going to happen doesn't make it less fun.The directing and overall cinematography wasn't anything special but it was descent enough. The only thing that i really didn't like was the the use of the score. First of all, it's not really a good soundtrack. Not bad, but also not something that i haven't heard before. My problem is that the soundtrack was way overused. Ther are a lot of scenes where the movie tries to build tension without knowing that some of them would be way more intense without any background music whatsoever. If a director doesn't allow the imagery on the screen to speak for itself and puts in a soundtrack that tells the audience that they should be afraid or something, than it kinda ruins it for the people paying attention. Not that i demand no background music at all but it could be at least a little bit more subtle because there was basically no scene where the score didn't try to tell you how you should feel. There where also a few other things like no explanation why the Park suddenly works, why they need dinosaur holograms other than to function as another cheap plot point even though there are real dinosaurs in this world or a forced death scene of some random dinosaur but those are only minor issues and didn't bother me that much during my view.Overall, i'm really glad that this film doesn't really try to be a successor to the original, but rather just having fun with the idea of dinosaurs running amok. I'm happy to say that with this one we got another good monster movie the third year in a row and i had a lot of fun watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very enjoyable yet a little predictable...,"Jurassic World is definitely the 2nd best movie in the franchise so far, right behind the first Jurassic Park. J.W.'s mix of humor, action, adventure, horror, and suspense makes it a great movie for anyone to enjoy. The movie is about Jurassic World, a theme park dedicated to dinosaur-themed attractions. Every time a new attraction is released, attendance spikes. One of the park's high officials, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), talks about a genetically modified hybrid, something no one has ever seen before, to be the next big attraction. It is known as the Indominus Rex. The movie features Chris Pratt as Owen, a man who has a lot of experience dealing with dinosaurs and proves to be very useful. As you've probably already predicted, things go awfully wrong in this movie. Some of these things are very unrealistic and would never happen in real life. At that point in the movie, I wanted to give it an 8 or 7. As I advanced further, the witty remarks, brilliant acting, and stunning visual effects made me forget the minor plot holes and such and made me truly love this movie. The movie is mostly rated PG-13 for its bloody scenes, which there are a few of, and its frightening jump scares, which are relatively frequent. All in all, Jurassic World is a great movie for the family, although younger viewers might get scared at some parts. If its story wasn't predictable at times, it would easily be the best Jurassic Park movie ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Close the Gate,"While I cannot say I disliked Jurassic World, there were many inept elements and a feeling of been there, done that. The children in distress, dinosaurs on the loose, greedy industrialists, the sensible man no one listened to, where have I seen that in this series of films? It doesn't help that while most of the dialogue is decent, we get the occasional scene of inept writing. Add to that things like, ""I'm the Alpha Raptor,"" a poorly thought out plan for the villain, and an oddly knowledgeable Superdino, and things can get dumb real fast. This isn't to say Jurassic World has nothing to offer. The film is good diversionary entertainment with solid directing. It clips along at a good pace and engages with enough fun and thrills to maintain our interest.The film picks up twenty two years after the first film. Isla Nublar is now a fully fledged amusement park that continues to see increasingly more patrons and money every year. Despite the exponential success, park supervisor Claire FEELS that the park is in financial hardship and wants to expand the ""wow factor."" A new hybrid dinosaur(the Indominus Rex) has been engineered to accommodate this desire. As a matter of course, dino chaos ensues shortly thereafter. Claire along with Raptor trainer Owen strive to save her visiting nephews and stay alive in the process.I would be remiss if I did not mention the dinosaurs. They look very good, befitting the money and time spent on the project. As always with the Jurassic Park series, the dino action is nice and a solid appeal. I would say that the herbivores got a much nicer showing here than in the previous two entries(which I appreciated.)

Jurassic Wold - Viewer's Perspective,"Jurassic World is by far one of the best movies I have seen since 1993...when Jurassic Park was released! Yes, that's right...1993 Jurassic Park! This movie holds true to the movie's legacy, the original movie's legacy (not those other failed attempts at continuing Jurassic...).It has been a long time since I have sat in a theater and listened to the audience shriek, yell, boast opinions (yelling out like they were watching the show from their home TV), cheer, and finally clap at the end of the movie! The movie was well composed, with a strong plot containing a spectacular balance between predictability and complete blind-siding moments. I doubt anyone will say that this movie was poorly directed. The movie has a gripping ability to elicit emotions from the viewers, drawing strong bonding moments that will have you expressing your emotions either to yourself or out loud (as most did during the movie).Casting for the movie was well selected; with familiar faces most everyone who watches standard TV shows or other great movies would recognize. And, must I include the original himself...BD Wong! Yes, that's the same actor from the original movie (some may know him from Special Victims Law and Order). What a contribution to the original movie than to have members from the original casting appear nearly 20 years later to pick up where they left off! The last show I can recall doing that was the movie Tron staring Jeff Bridges. That just add a certain heart felt compassion for the movie to us who were lucky enough to view the original Jurassic Park upon it's release.Take notes directors, this is how a movie should be directed; with the audience in mind and promising to take them on a ride during your entire film. If I had more than two thumbs, I'd certainly hold more up. This is a must go see movie. Hell, I may go see it again.

Second Best In Series,"We all knew Jurassic World wouldn't compare to the very first and very best Jurassic Park, but that doesn't take away the fact that this installment is amazing.Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World is a re-imagined version of the original resort.The visitor rates are declining, and the only option to increase them is to design their own dinosaur; the Indominus Rex, a decision that the InGen team would soon regret. The side-plot is fairly suitable to the movie, as a worker at the resort secretly hatches a plot to turn the inhabitants into living bio-weapons, but takes away a sense of realism.The movie itself takes a seemingly long time for the main plot line to develop, but when it does, you are in for a roller-coaster ride of action. I will not go into further detail as it will reveal the events, but for a movie this fantastic, it was very hard not to.CGI however is relied on heavily when it comes to the dinosaurs. When you compare them to the original, they all look much more realistic due to the use of mechanical devices. However, there are moments when you forget the Dino's are computer animated, and they truly do look realistic.One last note to the people wishing to see this movie, please take into account that there are some moments that younger children may find disturbing, as there are plenty of bloody moments.To conclude, Jurassic World is perhaps one of the films of the year, but I wouldn't expect it to win many academy awards, however I would truly recommend this to fans of the original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Geeky Randy's summary,"Back on the island of Isla Nublar, the dinosaur theme park is now fully functioning and still showcasing cloned dinosaurs.

One of the few films that are worth seeing in 3-D, but like most action flicks, it forgets that roller-coasters go both up and down. Chris Pratt makes for a very interesting and likable leading man, but Bryce Dallas Howard is just way too sexualized.

Great firs timer movie,"Gone to the movie with huge expectations and watched it i 3D but not imax. Some of the scenes I felt like these are cartoon or toy scenes. later realized I have gone with huge expectations.Funny concept, trying to see to make Dinosaur to become a pet animal. Added idea is to use them for military purpose.Tried to recollect the scene which has lasting impacts but not able to so my brain is still in expectations of some miracle.Good movie for the first timers.Took the feed back from friends who came and one of them was first timer, her experience is very good, exactly same like when I saw the first movie in this series.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic World promises an entertainment high and it delivers with a monstrous bite.,"Some films are critic proof. Sometimes even the most verbose film critics will find themselves in gleeful abandon, for no other reason than pure cinematic indulgence. I know I did. Likewise, Jurassic World will do that to you in the most eye-popping, heart-racing way a tent pole summer movie can.Right off the bat I'll say that after the disastrous Jurassic Park III (2001), this fourth installment has no reason to exist. In fact, Jurassic World is filled with so many inconsistencies, calling it flawed would be an act of kindness. Comprising of uneventful drama about corporate excess and consumer supply and demand, pacing is a major issue during the first half of the film. Symbolic to the film's subtle theme on humanity's greed for bigger and better material possessions, this part of the film is nothing more than a talky filler leading up to the non-stop action saved for the second half. However, the pay-off is extremely gratifying and worth the wait, and it only gets better with each passing minute.Set 22 years after the events of the first film, we are taken back to the Eastern Pacific island of Isla Nublar, where the titular theme park has reopened and is once again a major tourist attraction. In the tradition of preceding films, the story revolves around a female protagonist, this time park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who believes in enticing tourists with newer attractions. Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is replaced by Bollywood thespian Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, the new owner of Jurassic World. Masrani is uneasy about Dearing's new attraction – a bigger and meaner hybrid creation called Indominus Rex. For the cinema audience, this aptly relates to a bigger, louder and scarier prehistoric monster. Wish granted! Even before Indominus is released as an 'attraction', expert Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) discovers something abnormal about this new creature. And so it begins like it always does – an accident is shrugged off as a near-miss incident. It should have been a warning. When the second accident occurs, it's already too late.Running, screaming and utter pandemonium forms the rest of the film, punctuated with the occasional yet distinctive sound of a predatory 'chomp'. This is when the film lifts off with blistering pace thanks to well executed action, suspense driven terror and technical achievements that include fluid animatronics, and fantastic visual and sound design. Production design is also massive in keeping with original author Michael Crichton's intricately detailed world in the Jurassic Park novel. In only his second foray as director, it's safe to say that Colin Trevorrow has done his homework, especially with special effects bigwig Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as executive producer. Look out for two new ferocious creatures and an old favorite brought back for an amazing finale. And just to appease fans of monster movies, Trevorrow also interjects the action with several references to the first film, along with memorable scenes from King Kong (2005) and even James Cameron's Aliens (1986). Although this doesn't say much about originality, it still works as solid aid to the entertainment factor. On the downside, and if there is a weak link in human characterization, it would have to be Howard's stereotypical damsel in distress. Only here, her character is written off as a pushy corporate executive who can outrun ravenous dinosaurs with high heels! On the other hand, Pratt anchors the film with an Indiana Jones getup and is genuinely engaging throughout. Cocky yet equally charismatic, this is an actor highly capable of becoming the next Tom Cruise.That said, Jurassic World and its older siblings have never been about an actor's depth. It's all about the dinosaurs and their fight for supremacy in the food chain. After all, these were creatures of calamity but also creatures that dominated the planet long before we did. Bringing them back to full celluloid life is where this film excels and by the looks of it, no expense was spared. In other words, if there's one film that gives you your money's worth this summer, this is it and does so in Jurassic proportions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Been there done that (and better too),"I was interested in seeing ""Jurassic World"" (2015) because (1.) I love dinosaurs, (2.) I love island adventure and (3.) it's the third top-grossing film in cinematic history, as of this writing. I thought that it would be at least be as good as the first movie (1993), which – contrary to popular opinion -- I never felt was great because the story and characters were never that compelling. Yes, the dinosaurs were great and the t-rex and velociraptor sequences are exceptional, but most of the rest of the movie was average at best, even forgettable, although Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Richards were effective. Despite my criticisms, I gave the film a solid grade of ""B"" or 7/10 Stars.The second film (1997) and the third film (2001) were serviceable, but forgettable and somehow a letdown, which brings us to this fourth film in the series, a whopping fourteen years after the previous sequel. So how does it stack up?While ""Jurassic World"" is better than the two previous movies it's not as good as the first one. In fact, the plot's pretty much a retread with marginal changes. The big difference here is that it's 22 years later and the original Park is now a Disneyworld-like tourist attraction called Jurassic World owned by Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and ran by an all-business woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Chris Pratt plays the male protagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio the bad guy, Omar Sy the token black dude and BD Wong the token Asian scientist. Katie McGrath is on hand as the boy's hired quasi-nanny at the park, Zara, but she's not fleshed-out as a character; flesh-eaten maybe, but not fleshed out.Actually, that's the main problem with this movie. The characters have little depth, although Bryce shines as the preoccupied-with-work Aunt and Pratt has the gravitas for his role. Unfortunately, the two kids (brothers) are decidedly dull. My wife thought so as well, so it's not just me. The writers should've worked-in the older brother's girlfriend to spice things up or, at least, some other girl at the park.Nevertheless, there are a few effective sequences or concepts, like the Pterosaur attack on the tourists, the rousing Indominus/t-rex fight and the earlier revelation about the former.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot mainly in Hawaii, but also California and Louisiana.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sick and Tired of Critics,"I am sick and tired of people who readily tear apart movies as if this is some kind of high art that requires close study. I have read several of the reviews here and most of the negative ones express disappointment. I would like to hear what they think would make Jurassic World the kind of movie they would love. There are only so many ways to peel a grape. I waited until the movie came out on video; Had I paid the high price of a movie ticket, that would have raised expectations beyond what the movie should be, namely entertainment. That's all movies like this are-- entertainment--and to poke at the plot and the characters as if they are calling on their best Siskel & Ebert is a joke. Some of the highest grossing movies got mediocre reviews. No wonder, because their job is to view movies as art. Having said all this, I enjoyed Jurassic World for what it was. Two hours of escapist entertainment. If you go in expecting something otherwise, you likely won't enjoy anything.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent Hollywood entertainment,"The last movie review I made I started off by saying it was a movie you mostly watched for the special effects. Well this one is pretty much the same. The plot is pretty much predictable. The characters are fairly mediocre. The bad guy is a standard Hollywood villain which means that he is utterly despicable but boringly predictable and serves little more purpose than instilling bad feeling, which of course he does pretty well.The movie starts 22 years after the original theme part met its premature demise. The ""you should not play good"" prophets can say what they want, I think the idea of reviving the Dinosaurs (without the reckless gene manipulation stuff) is a quite cool one and I would certainly endorse the idea of they could make it work. I really do not care much for the nonsensical stories of these movies where there is always some thoroughly stupid Hollywood villain that screws things up with some ludicrous evil scheme but, unfortunately a lot of people seems to buy into that stuff and think it is ""what could happen"".Anyway, having said that, the story is not bad for this kind of movie. It generally holds together although the stupid plot of the main villain really did (censored) me off. It was the usual dumb-ass stuff where you could see where things were going from the moment the dumb-ass in question opened his mouth.I did like the hero although I was pretty much a stereotype one. I did not really like the equally stereotype woman lead character and I certainly felt that the silly nonsense about a couple in the process of divorcing sending their kids for a vacation with their aunt who obviously is not interested in the well being of the kids. Typical soap opera material.This is a special effects movie and the special effects where not bad. I would not say that they where wow impressive but then that might be due to special effects overload. Today you are so used to wonderful special effects that it takes a lot to impress you. At the time when the original Jurassic movie was released one would have gone all wow over the effects in this movie but today they are just ""just"" what one would expect. Still good though.If you are looking for a good plot, well then you are going to be disappointed. It is pretty much standard, brain-dead, Hollywood fare in that department. I really fail to understand why they constantly fail to provide anything remotely intelligent in terms of plot. Are the average audience really that stupid? Well, having offloaded that bit of frustration, and parked my brain in the closet, I did indeed enjoy the movie. It was pretty much what I expected nothing more, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A fun movie, but has a few downfalls","Jurassic World is the newest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise (4th movie). To be honest, I have not seen any of the previous installments of the Jurassic Park franchise because I was never interested in dinosaurs (not even as a kid). I went and saw this movie primarily because I thought it looked more like a modern action movie and less of a dinosaur movie. That was certainly a wrong assumption on my behalf because it is wholeheartedly a dinosaur flick. I still had fun with it but not as much as I had hoped.The action is absolutely my favorite part of this movie. It's not that kind of exhilarating and intense action that one would find in Kingman: The Secret Service; rather, it is fun, dumb action that one would just enjoy while munching on some buttery popcorn. I found the action very entertaining especially in the second act. There isn't much action in the first act and I had some problems with the third act. The third act mostly focuses on the dinosaurs and there is a lot of action with just the dinosaurs. No big spoilers but at the end there is literally a dinosaur fist fight between these two huge dinosaurs. It was even choreographed like a human fist fight so it looked really odd when dinosaurs were doing it. I disliked the third act because it focused a lot on the dinosaurs combat and seeing that I'm not interested in dinosaurs, that got almost boring for me. The second act had some awesome action though which I enjoyed immensely.The story/plot in Jurassic World is decent. For the most part, it's easy to understand and there aren't too many plot holes. Yet some of the plot points are a little muggy and not fleshed out well enough. The pacing in this movie was absolutely fine and character development was generally good as well. Speaking of characters, these characters were so darn clichéd that it was laughable. Bryce Dallas Howard played the usual uptight business woman, Chris Pratt played the scruffy, stubborn adventure type guy, and Vincent D'Onofrio played the stupid military dude who wants to use everything as a weapon (like dinosaurs). All these characters were extremely clichéd which was kind of off-putting to me. Also, probably the biggest issue this film has is the dialogue. Holy moly it is cheesy! Almost every other spoken line is a one-liner cheese-fest! The cheesy-ness is cringeworthy that's how bad it is. The writers could have tried a little harder right?Finally, the acting in this movie is really good given the amount of cheesy dialogue and everyones characters being clichéd. Chris Pratt is one fine actor and he did well in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard was good in her role especially at the end. The rest of the cast was just as good and really surprised me.In the end, Jurassic World had fun action and great acting. On the downside, it had a relatively weak story/plot, unbelievably clichéd characters, and laughably bad dialogue. I had fun with this movie but many things could have been improved. Like I said before, I'm not much of a dinosaur fan but I still gave this movie a chance thinking it was not heavily oriented towards dinosaurs. I was wrong which slightly disappointed me but I still had good fun with Jurassic World.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"I loved it. It was incredible, at first I was like thinking it was way to hyped up but honestly worth watching. by the way, not talking about the movie at all, I just came from Chris Pratt.No, but still, I'm not a fan of movies like thess but it was really good. It was a thriller the whole ride, personally didn't think it was boring at any point, the plot was consistent, I love the emotional bond between blue and Owen as well, I thought it made the movie better on a whole another level.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Jurassic WorldThe great thing about Jurassic World is that the vegetarian dinosaurs have all been transferred to Euro Jurassic World.In fact, the carnivorous reptilians populating this sci-fi adventure are designed to be even more ravenous.With attendance waning, scientists at a living dinosaur destination use DNA from predatory dinosaurs to conceive a genetically altered apex predator to bring the crowds back to the remote island resort.But when the hungry hybrid escapes its confines, the park's operations manager (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her visiting nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must rely on the resident Velociraptor wrangler (Chris Pratt) to outwit their astute stalker.A return to form for the dormant DNA tampering franchise, what Jurassic World lacks in plot, character development and plausibility, it makes up for in rapid pacing, salient visual effects and nonstop thrills.Incidentally, Jurassic World's main competition will always be that genetically modified Creationist theme park.Green Light",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Highly Entertaining Summer Movie,"Jurassic World (2015)*** (out of 4)Two decades after the events from the previous film, we're introduced to a new part, which appears to be a lot safer and allows people to get up close and personal with all their dinosaur wishes. A high official work-a-holic (Bryce Dallas Howard) invites her nephews to the part for some fun and sure enough when the dinosaurs break free they are lost somewhere in the forest. With the help of Owen (Chris Pratt) the two try to locate the kids as well as to prevent more attacks.I think a strong argument could be made that JURASSIC WORLD is the best of the four films in the series. I've found all of them to be good three-star movies but this one here is a few notches above the rest of the series thanks to an incredibly fun and tense ending, which I'll discuss more in a bit. The film offers up some terrific effects, a wonderful score, some nice characters and there's no question that the battles towards the end are exciting and there's no doubt that the recent remake of GODZILLA should have been more like this film.I'll get the flaws out of the way right now. For me, the entire ""must save the kids"" was a rather tired element that we saw in previous movies and I must admit that it really wasn't all that thrilling here. I saw that people the finale of the movie has the dinosaurs attacking the people inside the park and this is where the real fun happens. I'm not going to spoil anything that happens but it's quite the treat when these dinosaurs end up making contact with visitors to the park and it leads to some really intense scenes. It's really too bad that there wasn't more of this because it works perfectly to give you the popcorn, summer entertainment that people look for.The special effects are certainly a major plus here as the dinosaurs are certainly the stars of the picture. As with the previous entries, there are several scenes where we get up close and personal with them and the effects are so great that you really do feel as if real dinosaurs are right there in front of you. There are some terrific battles between the creatures that happen towards the end and they are some of the most exciting scenes that you're ever going to witness. The human actors are also good with Pratt making for a great hero and Howard is also good in her part. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as the heavy as is Omar Sy, Judy Greer and BD Wong.JURASSIC WORLD also benefits from the actual park used. I really liked some of the vehicles that people traveled around in as it really brings a nice sci-fi element to the film. There's no question that the park itself was put together wonderfully well and it really did return a sense of wonder that the series hadn't shown since the first one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A worthy but not perfect successor.,"By now just about everyone who wanted to see Jurassic World, the fourth installment in the inconsistent Jurassic Park saga has seen it. It's a huge success financially, but was it a success in my eyes? For the most part, yes! This is an action-horror movie at it's roots, much like the original, and has some new additions to the lore of Jurassic Park. While the previous two sequels felt like retreads, for the most part Jurassic World is a step in the right direction and feels fresh. The leads do a fairly good job, (even if sometimes the writing isn't great) and the effects are solid. I was extremely excited to return to Isla Nublar once more to see a fully functioning dinosaur theme park. However, as stated previously, there are some corny lines and the characters feel underdeveloped for the most part, but the spectacle of the park and feeling of adventure and tension overcome these flaws. There is also at least one touching scene featuring an animatronic similar to those made by the late Stan Winston that is very effective. The finale is a love letter to fans of the series, and I could not contain my excitement during the film's final act. In the end Jurassic World is not a perfect follow up to one of my personal favorite movies of all time, but I never expected it to be as good as the original, so I was fully satisfied. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Jurassic World is the ultimate Hollywood popcorn movie, it's loud it's dumb and stupid but a lot of fun.""","If someone mention the name of movie they have a bond with i think one in hundred will probably say Jurassic Park and sure i mean who can denied the magic that movie has , so there's go Jurassic World another sequel trying capture that elements of magic again.The problem is it just failed pretty hard in almost every single element , one thing that they really doing fantastic is the CGI and production design it's amazing , it's stunning.But that's it everything else of Jurassic World is just falling apart in to pieces from boring cliché and stupid character that sometimes can be annoying to really force the ""Family Bond"" theme in to your mouth and that screenplay oh god... i mean it's like they borrow script from movie Dinocroc or something it's just really terrible , i mean it's okay in that B grade low-production value movie BUT not in the $150 million dollars budget movie and definitely not in ""Jurassic"" movies.Off course Jurassic World can be fun and for sure you will probably have a good time with it but because of it's ""Monsters Fight"" scene not because it's magic elements that Jurassic Park has , this is for sure a fun popcorn movie to watch but not the 'Jurassic' movie we hope it could be not even with Chris Pratt .",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I really loved this movie,"First off I was around when the first movie hit theaters and I loved it. I however absolute loved this new Jurassic adventure almost as much as the original. Jurassic Park was unique for its time by showing us the most realistic Dinosaurs we had ever seen on screen. The problems people are reporting having with the new Jurassic World are in a way ironically addressed in the movie's plot, ""people aren't impressed by typical dinosaurs anymore; they need something bigger, louder, scarier, and with a lot more teeth.""The film is no longer primarily focused on a select few quirky guest who set out to test an accident waiting to happen called Jurassic Park. This movie is more action, dinosaur oriented and that's what I love about it. While watching the original, more than a few times, I've wished there was just more to the story, more dinosaur interaction but the plot line always seems a bit short to me when talking in terms of event A making it to event B. The original villain/code monkey/douchebag was overly cartoonish and I hated him in all the wrong ways.I can see what they were trying to do with this movie. First off I'm a big fan of animatronics over CGI any day of the week but to get these animals to move at a proper realistic speed it just had to be all done with computers this time around. The CGI was well done in my opinion so I had no real complaints about the dinosaurs being done on a computer. People are complaining there are way too many product placements, well that's because the movie is trying to depict an overly commercialized theme park that really has no care about man or beast as long as the earnings at the end of the day are big enough. So ya I'm not saying it wasn't a strategic money making decision to get a bunch of sponsors but it does make sense to a degree to have all these well know products in a movie were everyone is only concerned about the newest and latest thing.Another complaint was the acting and character development was lacking, yep your right. Many times the characters bordered being too cliché or stereotypes, and more than a few times Owen looked like he was hamming up that ""I'm a bad ass who likes to get dirty in more ways than one and that's why I'm so sexy,"" walk of his, plus the brooding went a bit too far. In the end I ended up feeling for most every person in the movie. So they may not be super deep characters but they are not cardboard either, plus I really enjoyed the relationship between the raptors and Owen (Chris Pratt). Oh, as for Bryce Howard or Clair running the whole movie with high heels on, yep that was a little out there but there were more than a few long distant shots of the actress really having to run with the same high heels on and never missing a beat alongside her sensible shoe wearing costars. That was enough for me to look over that plot hole.Lets all face it this movie was made one for the money/ merchandise, two to bring the concept of Jurassic Park to a new generation (one that values visuals over plot and character development), and three to expand the Jurassic world for the fans who loved the first one and wish it were a real park. I felt like a kid while watching this movie. The way I felt during this movie is the way I would imaging feeling if this were a real park that I was visiting for the first time. It was very entertaining and for me who has seen it all that's saying a lot about this movie. I hope people can give it some slack and except that it's a different take on an old beloved movie from our childhood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Jurassic World does give some thing ""NEW"" that are great, But lacks on, at some stuff.","This new installment of the Jurassic Park franchise does deliver a lot of good things such as the story set up, the dinosaurs, and it definitely does have some great scenes that will possibly have you cheering out of excitement. but yet just like JP 1 and 2, it lacks great character development. They're pretty forgettable and they don't deliver that much in terms of feel and personality, a few times they're funny, but yet, boring. The story is predictable of course, but in an excusable way, there are other new stuff about it that is great, it was a great opportunity to use the idea of having the park functioning and have customers visiting it for the first time ever, which added the level of entertainment on it, something that the previous films missed out on, and it gives us some new dinosaurs that are pretty cool like the main villain, the D Rex, and the water dinosaur.Hope this very first review of mine was helpful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Pretty Dazzling - one small annoyance,"The Jurassic Park/World legacy is a staple of modern fiction. Michael Crichton's exploration of dinosaurs resurrected - the unveiling of man versus our most revered beast – is cinematic gold. Steven Spielberg did a masterful job with the original installment, Jurassic Park. This type of story was made for the master of adventure, wonderment, and spine tingling thrills. Steven stumbled on the sequel, hampered by a hokey script – but still delivered more creepy little foes from the prehistoric. The third lacks any compelling characters and is largely forgettable – although the unveiling of the Pterodactyl.JURASSIC WORLD is the fourth installment from Crichton's classic legacy.* JURRASIC WORLD is a homage to the original film sprinkled with a delicious dabble of current culture and technology. If you don't know the premise, the original Jurassic Park has now become a fully functional island resort run by a corporate conglomerate. Over 20 years later, it is now called Jurassic World. As opposed to the three previous stories, the island is filled with tourists and multiple attractions.Dig in. JURRASIC WORLD employs the classic plot points from Jurassic Park and a myriad of timeless horror movies – such as Aliens and The Birds. It's a tasty dish.The hero played by Chris Pratt is a young Indiana Jones – an adventurer living in the wild – adorned with the classic brown vest (although minus the hat). Bryce Dallas Howard is a high powered corporate employee that runs operations of the island. The Howard/Pratt relationship - the clichéd rugged hero matched with the high strung upper class beauty – works surprisingly well. Howard breathes life into the role of heroine. She avoids many dialogue/screenplay/character traps that could've nabbed another actress.The new director manages to hold the pressure and weight of the Jurassic universe. I give this guy props. Outside of yelling action on the set, I can't imagine the grace it would take to deal with the studio, multiple writers, and master of cinema, Spielberg himself. This newcomer has what it takes and the studio is reaping the benefits - he re-lit a giant franchise! It's the third highest grossing film of all time, I believe.SPOILERS *Any adventure movie requires suspension of disbelief. Spielberg has been aware of this since day one and carefully tows the line of fictional reality and fictional unreality.Unfortunately, The Jurassic World director screwed up an obvious detail – and it drove me crazy.Would any human being survive the rampage wearing a pair of high heels? Bryce Dallas Howard drops her fancy clothes, gets dirty, and dawns a Ripley tank top – yet does not remove her high heels throughout the movie!! This means she's sprinting from dinosaurs, explosions, and near death instances in a pair of high heels. This ridiculous problem could have been remedied easily. One scene of her working out at the park's fancy athletic facilities and keeping a pair of sneakers close by – that she throws on before joining in the rescue mission.Honestly, take one look at a woman walking to work through Manhattan in heels and then try picturing her escaping a velociraptor. This one details bothered me enough to give Jurassic World a B minus as opposed to a B plus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens meets Deep Blue Sea,"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would.

I just felt that some of the beats were maybe unearned occasionally.

Has spectacle but does rather feel like an unnecessary reboot/remake/sequel (whatever it is),"It is many years since the summer blockbuster season excited me; I don't mean that in a snobby way, it is just I no longer really want to pay out such money to sit in a noisy cinema to watch so-so movies, where really I can pay less in the Fall when they can be rented for much less money and be watched in my own home. This is not to say I still do not go, and on this occasion it was Jurassic Park that caught my fancy. I'm not sure if it is a remake or sequel or reboot, because it has elements of all of those in here – basically delivering the same story as the first film with elements from the second thrown in; theme park, dinosaurs escape, two specific children are our focal point, etc.As such it all goes where you'd expect it to, and, in keeping with the times moving forward, there are now many more dinosaurs across the film. This adds to the spectacle, and for sure the film does have plenty of money on the screen in terms of the effects shots. In terms of story though, it is not so good. In the original, chaos theory was the handy device that kept it all moving forward, whereas here we have things that make even less sense but that we are just meant to go with. Really it doesn't matter the who's and what's of it all, because we know where we are here; it is disappointing though that it doesn't have more genuine tension to it, and that the set pieces are not as strong in that way as you would want. The film is also not helped by their being very clear replacements for many of the character types from the previous films – which really only serves to highlight them for being less interesting and more generic characters. By the end, most of the people were fairly unengaging as villains or heroes or whatever.With this in mind, it is interesting that the female characters get such a rough time of it. The female lead berated for the distance between her and her extended family (I could not tell you precisely the ages of my nieces/nephews without a bit of thought), and kept fairly cold and bland throughout. Many have already mentioned the quite hideous death of another, totally incidental female character – it is so bad that I do not think there was any judgement involved, so I don't think it is sexist, but it is unfortunate that it stands out as such a statement death. Otherwise, the deaths are mostly the standard anonymous type – they will shock children, but after a while they blend together and only shock by how sterile they become (torture sequence aside).As a whole, the film did entertain in a broad way, and it has enough spectacle to it to keep it moving forward. The detail of the narrative is clunky, the characters bland, and generally the set pieces are not as great as you would want, but it is a summer blockbuster and on that level at least, it does provide distracting noise.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing story and CGI, terrible acting","I thought the story was very well thought out and made a lot of sense. It flowed nicely and the characters were perfect. I was very impressed by the CGI and the dinosaurs. It was very life like and the sizing included made a lot of sense. The CGI absolutely carried the whole movie. The knock is the acting, The acting absolutely was awful and really brings the movie down. If you just want to see awesome looking dinosaurs and follow the story, this is the movie. If you catch on to reactions of actors and what they would actually be thinking during certain scary situations be prepared to be disappointed or be able to laugh it off a little.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Empty fun,"Jurassic World has the originality of the indominus rex: it is a rehash of the first movie, with a couple of things from the sequels and a crazy idea thrown in: let's train the velociraptors. It all ends up being entertaining enough, but it is empty as they come and it loses steam along the way, ending with a lazy lazy last part.Isla Nublar is opened to tourists, but after so many years the clients and investors are asking for more and more: bigger, badder, more threatening. It seems seeing velociraptors or playing with triceratops ain't fun anymore. A couple of kids (the typical couple of kids that seem to have to be our center of attention in these movies) go visit the park, where their aunt Claire (yes, we have all talked about it, those shoes) is working. Also working, as a raptor trainer, is manly man Owen, always sweating, always being very hairy and manly, always half-step away of saying his sentences growling.We all know what is going to happen, right? The new dinosaur, a dinosaur that has some tyrannosaurus rex in his DNA (and the rest, secret secret) is going to go on a trip around the island wreaking havoc and making bad, very bad things happen. The way it gets loose is lazy as they come and kind of laughable, but OK, we will accept it. The rest of the plot, I don't need to tell you. You already know it.However, the movie is fun. The acting, even if hilarious in all the machismo the male characters seem to be suffering of, is good enough. The pace is high enough, and even if the plot and its twists make less sense than Claire's shoes, keep things chugging along. And the CGI makes us (more or less) believe in what is going on.If it had had a tighter running time, and if it had left out some risible moments, though, it would have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't listen to critics, make your own judgment!","I'm going to start this review by saying that I loved the film. I had read quite a fair share of reviews slating the film for being predictable, no character development and/or no likable characters with bad plot.Now, I get everyone is subjective and a movie one person loves someone else hates; sure the film had its flaws but come on! As a fan of the series I went in full knowing what was going to happen (park is successful, everything is dandy until disaster breaks loose and dinosaurs eat people) And that is exactly what I wanted to see. As for characters I thought each actor/actress portrayed their character well; plus its the dinosaurs I was more interested in not the people. As a summertime blockbuster it certainly delivered, It's not a film made for critical analysis, it's made for uncomplicated enjoyment. Additionally nobody seems to know what they want in movies anymore; movies made simply to take audiences out of reality for some non complicated amusement are bashed for not being smart enough. Not only that but the film was beautifully made, gorgeous cinematography, great CGI and good pacing. Overall it was truly a well made film.But this again is just my opinion, as individuals everyone is entitled to their opinion which is why I say go see it for yourself and make your own judgment. Just don't go around saying it's the worst thing ever or that it shouldn't have been made when it has actually given a lot of other people and enjoyable experience; proving it deserves to exist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good re-boot, but same old story","Oh, yeah, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming. - Dr. Ian Malcolm (The Lost World) Walking into the cinema... The original is considered a classic, but the sequels were forgettable. 22 years later, can this storyline resurrect itself or should it have remained buried?Cinematic rating: 3 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 3.5 starsSee if you have heard this story before: scientists make a new creation out of things they have unearthed from the ground. These new creations seem good at first, but begin to turn from the power of their master and turn to terrorise the local community. Most of the people run away from these monsters, but the hero must stay and either save or destroy the monsters. Familiar?Throughout literary and cinematic history, from Frankenstein to Jurassic Park, mankind has been running from his creation. Twenty-two years after the groundbreaking film, Jurassic Park (and two forgettable sequels), we stay within the monstrous tradition and are re-introduced to the dinosaurs of Jurassic World. A fully-functional dinosaur theme park that inhabits the island of Isla Nublar. The vision of John Hammond has come to fruition, but there is trouble in this Jurassic paradise. The park has been in operation for ten years and attendance is declining. The corporation who oversees the park wants to develop dinosaurs that have the 'wow' factor. In creating bigger and 'badder' dinosaurs, what could possibly go wrong?The question that has to be asked at the outset of this review is 'what does Jurassic World provide that you cannot get from the original?' The answer: Bigger villains, more teeth and Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy). Understandably, technology has also changed over the past two decades and the special effects are pretty incredible, but the value added comes down to the terror factor of the new dino-villain, Indominus Rex and the appeal of the hero, Owen. Both of these distinctions deliver something new that is worth watching. The multitude of new dinosaurs and the adapting villain provide the necessary terror. It cannot match the originality of Jurassic Park, but it delvers the necessary fear factor expected in coming to a Spielberg-inspired creation. Also, with the inclusion of heroic central character, there is now an Indiana Jones-type foe for the newly created meat eater. Pratt manages this role well and provides the cockiness and humour needed for this popcorn adventure. Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi), BD Wong (Focus) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black) provide all of the necessary characters to give the story depth and ultimately the bridge for the inevitable sequel. It will not go down as a cinematic triumph, but director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) provides enough new ingredients and includes enough nostalgia to make you want to come along for the ride. The ending is completely unbelievable, but we are dealing with a story about a Disney Dino-world, so suspend all disbelief and hold on for an entertaining visual experience.Similar to 2015's Ex-Machina, Jurassic World opens the discussion of mankind tinkering with the original creation. Striving for new scientific breakthroughs should be encouraged, but the bigger considerations could be in relationship to the original plan for this world. In a story like Jurassic World, making subtle changes to the original creation seems to lead to disastrous conclusions. The precise nature of this world seems to leave little to randomness. So, if that is the case, could there be consideration for an ultimate designer to it all? Take time to think about it and maybe even read up on it, but in the mean time, allow yourself to go have some fun at the cinemas with Jurassic World.Leaving the cinema... Jurassic World had enough 'wow' factor to justify it being re-booted. It was unbelievable, but enjoyable.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What can we know about creation? (Genesis 1-3) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. Why do we need a saviour?

"Enjoyable fun, but more of the same.","The early trailers of Jurassic World looked very promising and was generating a lot of hype similar to the first Jurassic Park (1993) which became one of the biggest movies of all time. The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) was one of the biggest movies of 1997 however there were a lot of mixed reviews. Jurassic Park III (2001) was also a box office success however the movie was critically underwhelming. Jurassic World was a welcome entry into the Jurassic Park series and it was enjoyable, although it was more of the same.22 years after the original Jurassic Park went horribly wrong, a fully functional dinosaur theme park called ""Jurassic World"" has become a reality and opened up on Isla Nublar. Originally envisioned by John Hammond, Jurassic World has proved to be a huge success over the past decade although in recent times visitor rates have started to decline. Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) are sent there to visit their aunt, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager however Claire is too preoccupied with recruiting more investors to fund bigger dinosaur attractions to maintain the park's attendance as well as being a stickler for statistics. It is evidenced throughout the movie that despite Claire's high maintenance personality and drive for success, she does not know much about her nephews and seems to be distant to them as well as her own sister and the boys' mother (Judy Greer). To revive the theme park's success, the InGen corporation genetically creates a new breed of dinosaur as a new attraction named the Indominus Rex. This experiment is spearheaded by one of the original scientists from Jurassic Park now the chief geneticist Dr Henry Wu (B.D. Wong). Things go terribly wrong when the Indominus Rex manages to escape from captivity and it wrecks havoc on the island, endangering many lives. A former Navy sailor turned Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) must also help Claire and slimy InGen Security Chief Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio)take down the Indominus Rex.Chris Pratt is always a pleasure to watch on the screen and he continues to cement his status as a down-to-earth, heroic and humorous action star, especially after the success of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). In fact Chris Pratt was the only real likable character in the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard seems unconvincing as the parks operations manager Claire Dearing. For a manager who knows all her statistics and business operations, she came across as someone with limited social skills, common sense and emotions. Vincent D'Onofrio seems like a slimy villain with no purpose only to throw his weight around with his massive power tripping ego as well as to carry out his own selfish motives to take down the Indominus Rex yet his plan fails. Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell were quite good however some of their scenes just seemed like they were thrown in to show they were just token kids of the modern age. The only original cast member to return was B.D. Wong, and at least it was good to see someone from the original movies.Director Colin Trevorrow did a good job resurrecting the franchise with Jurassic World and hopefully he will go onto bigger and better things.Jurassic World was a lot better than Jurassic Park III in my opinion. I felt that Jurassic Park III was underwhelming. The Lost World: Jurassic Park seemed to be over-hyped but still watchable. I haven't seen Jurassic Park in years however I still remember from when I was a young kid all the hype surrounding the movie, deservedly earning its spot as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1993.The action in Jurassic World was a lot more exciting and the movie was still very enjoyable however you felt like it was done three times before, thus running over old ground. Still it was good to see the Jurassic Park franchise being resurrected with Jurassic World and it was well worth seeing it at the cinema.Will we see a fifth Jurassic Park movie? Who knows given that Jurassic World has been a success at the box office.Watch Jurassic World and enjoy it for what it is.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
By-the-numbers blockbuster which delivers exactly as expected,"Well, essentially my review is the title of my review, but to be a bit more verbose: The movie delivers absolutely everything you expect it to and not one iota more. It successfully evokes a hint of the wonder we felt back in the day when ""real"" dinosaurs on screen were a decided novelty. Who can forget the first appearance of the T Rex in Jurassic Park? Spine tingling, awesome, and terrifying all at once. This is a more jaded age, and we have seen dinosaurs in many guises since then, so it's not easy to WOW us in that way. Yet, in spite of that, Jurassic World does create some awe, tension, and excitement. As with Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs are the best part--the people not so much. But, at least there is no character in this film quite as annoying as Dr. Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park, and some of the characters are actually quite likable. It's worth seeing, but not more than once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Worth a watch, I'd say.","The irksome events of Jurassic Park appear to have been quickly forgotten, as the swankier theme park 'Jurassic World' has been rolled out on the same island 30 years later. But have the organisers learned from their mistakes? Thankfully for us, of course not. Scientists have added genetically modified super-dinos to the park, in an effort to whip up media attention and increase attendances. However building a half-decent fence to keep them in must have been a lesser priority. With typical cat and mouse chase scenes, stunning imagery and cheesy one liners, this film is as much fun as the original. Hopefully this film can inspire a resurgence of palaeontologists, whilst informing and entertaining children and adults a like about science. Worth a watch, I'd say.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Exciting if implausible and ful, of plot holes.","There aren't many movies that I can honestly say I vividly remember how I felt when first seeing it. Jurassic Park was one of those movies. When the first dinosaur was shown my eyes opened as wide as Dr. Grant's and my mouth opened wide in si ple wonerment. Unfortunately, there's none of that wonder in this film. Henry Wu genetically re-engineered for Jurassic World? He was killed by veloceraptors in the first film and he should have stayed dead. And considering how many people were munched in the first film is it possible that human greed can honestly produce such monumentally foolish and ignorant people? Well, according to Hollywood: Yes. Claire and just about everyone associated with the park is obsessed with greed and blinded by tech. It's all rather disgusting and if I may say just plain dumb. The older kid is a twerp , we have a park manager in waaay over her head, an incompetent and poorly armed security staff, personnel completely untrained for emergency, a hapless owner, a head mad scientist, and an implausible mercenary angle that falls off a cliff. The movie is sorta exciting but it's so silly that it's hard to feel sorry for anything but the poor animals. I was honestly rooting for stupid humans to be trampled or eaten, and plenty of them get munched. There are 4 sympathetic humans, the rest of them should have become dino food beginning with the park manager.

Jurassic Park Returns,"Glad they didn't use my title. Jurassic World is full of interesting ideas and stays loyal to the very conclusion. The biggest issue is the retread of the storyline from the first film. This time they take they include a functioning park. I'm unsure if the filmmaker was the inspired choice and having one indie film under his belt, it felt uneventful. Spielberg should've returned. This was a little mixed for me and it felt like numerous ideas floating around at any given moment. This was a welcome return after the train-wreck of Jurassic Park 3. Jurassic World managed to bring series back with an interesting concept, one that was darker than expected.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent!  Very Close to the Original,One of my sons is a huge fan of dinosaurs and JP and has been since he was a baby. He is now 15 and has multiple copies of all the movies and collected almost every JP dinosaur toy that was ever made (plus many other dinosaurs). He has been waiting for this movie since it was originally supposed to come out in 2005. A couple of years ago when it was finally solidified as actual movie it renewed his interest. Since then he has followed every detail available with the making and release of the film. Needless to say we saw the movie last night at the first possible showing. The movie did not disappoint and delivered on being one of the best installments to the franchise since the original. We both felt in a lot of ways it was better than the original! What shocked me today was a lot of reviews posted here. Many complain about a weak story or lack of character development. Seems to me that most of them completely missed the idea behind Jurassic Park/World in the first place. The characters and story in all of these movies are the dinosaurs and not the live actors. Jurassic World was actually the first of the franchise that focused more on the story of the dinosaurs and their character development and not the actors. Make no mistake here folks the star of this movie is Indominus Rex and not Chris Pratt. In fact this movie had many less annoying human characters than the three other movies. Think of the two kids in the original -annoying. I wanted them to be eaten. The next two movies only increased the number of annoying human characters. Jurassic World gave us human characters in the right amount and none of them stole the show from the dinosaurs. My son and I thought it was a great installment to the franchise. Go see Jurassic World you won't be disappointed.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Eh,"I heard they were doing a reboot with Chris Pratt and I was all in - but unfortunately for me, in my mind, I had imagined that they were going to go back to a darker and grittier, more tense feel of the original Jurassic Park - clearly that was my own mistake. This was basically Jurassic Park inside the Marvel world; it felt like a marvel movie not a tense thriller like Spielberg delivered. So, I suppose, if you really like all the Marvel movies (which I do too) then you know what you're getting; however, if like me, you were hoping for a more tense thriller without comedy quips to break any tension that is ever brought up then will will also be disappointed with this film. Not to mention, the plot is very predicable. It is an entertaining enough movie, but it doesn't do anything to truly make it great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Interesting If Not Predictable.,"As someone who grew up watching the Jurassic Park films (and still doesn't care in the 3 one was a bit bad), I have to say I was excited when I first heard this was becoming a thing. The trailer excited me and awoke a childish nature in me I haven't felt in years. I was stoked for this film and what I was was... interesting.I will say this, the story was predictable. I liked some elements of the plot but I wish that the creators had taken a slightly different route with it all. I loved the I.Rex and how it worked, it was the first genuine smart animal that we encountered that wasn't meant to be smart. I liked some of the characters however the acting was a bit wooden at times (I don't mean to bash the actors in any way). I feel like the script writers went too 'cliché' with this film and didn't realise it until after it had released (if they realised it at all).There was still something magical about this film. It wasn't really as gritty or hard paced as the previous three but a lot of time had passed since them and we came to expect things from people who wanted to change some stuff. What you have to remember is it's been 22 years since the first Jurassic Park was released, things have to change otherwise we'll be repeating the same story over and over again, just with different technology involved.All in all, I liked it. Some parts were disappointing but I got the Jurassic Park vibe that the other films managed to beat into us. When I first watched Jurassic Park (the first film) I was one years old, nearly two and it was at Christmas. I sat on my Dad's chest and was captivated even at such a young age. Jurassic World may be cliché and the acting may be a bit off at times but I'm extremely impressed with it all. The ending has become one of my favourite sequences in film history and it probably will be for years to come.In short, take your kids to go see it. To the people who watched the originals, it's not awful but it's not the 10/10 movie we were expecting but it still stands up for itself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
excellent..........that is excellent..,"The movie was really beautiful..........the main role played by chris pratt was wonderful.......ending was really perfect.........that two brothers are really superb.........overall awesome movie...compared to beginning ,the ending scenes were more awesome........owen played a major role in this movie. Now we have part 4, which is called ""Jurassic World"" and while it's a major league improvement over the dismal ""Jurassic Park 3"", its still can't live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it's sequel ""The Lost World"".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park's mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he's pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond's flights of fancy. Too bad he's not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience's reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film.Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That's a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it's killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character's stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D""Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he's a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It's really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film's huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfectly entertaining,"I saw ""Jurassic World"" for the first time in 2021, as Cinemark theatres were showing some old favorites - having never seen this during its original theatrical run in 2015, I couldn't resist checking it out. ""Jurassic World,"" directed by Colin Trevorrow, is a perfectly entertaining thriller, serving as both a soft-reboot and sequel to the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy.From the moment the camera flies over the park, letting you bask in its sheer scale, ""Jurassic World"" has a great sense of fun and wonder. Dinosaurs perform crowd-pleasing tricks in various attractions, children ooh and aah as they feed miniature dinosaurs at a petting zoo, and crowds gather in utter disbelief at what they are witnessing; everything feels very magical, as it should - the calm before the storm, if you will. Starring Chris Pratt as Owen, ""Jurassic World"" also boasts a charismatic and badass star that's believable in his confidence around dinosaurs, and along with his chemistry alongside Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, the film has a strong sense of emotional resonance that is sure to keep you invested.One thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the slow burn approach it took before throwing you into the chaos - it let viewers feel comfortable and bask in the glory of the park before unleashing the dinosaurs on them. And if you're watching ""Jurassic World,"" you're likely wondering how the dinosaur action is - the answer is: very badass. There are multiple intense action sequences here, and the slow burn really enhances the thrill and makes the inevitable dread more effective. The CGI is genuinely impressive and immersive, and the entire film feels like a big roller-coaster, and it works. This isn't a movie that you go to for its Oscar-winning plot, but instead to kill two hours and have some fun, and it delivers.And speaking of the two hour runtime, my only complaint would be that the movie feels a touch too long. I feel like if 15 to 20 minutes were shaved off this film it would've been the perfect thriller, but the two hour length does slightly overstay its welcome. That said, I had a lot of fun in this movie, and never found myself bored, which is always a good sign. So, if you're a fan of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, check this out! You'll be sure to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Its predictable following a set formula, yet well-made and engaging in its second hour providing the expected excitement.","To tone down the expectations level first, it's admittedly impossible to relive those startling moments, excitement and thrill of witnessing the giant dinosaurs on the silver screen for the first time ever (two decades back) with Steven Spielberg's out of the world vision of Jurassic Park amazing the entire world. So moving ahead of any such comparisons, the world of dinosaurs is back after almost a decade of its last sequel, especially inviting the young viewers eager to witness the phenomenon in theatres (in 3D) for the very first time after having seen all its earlier parts on the smaller screen through their home video discs. Having said that, this fourth instalment of the series thankfully holds some novel surprises for the not so young viewers too featuring one of our own talented actors Irrfan Khan in a significant and much bigger role as the owner of the beautiful amusement park.In short, realising the pressure to deliver the content conceived in the time of much better CGI and VFX as compared to the last three parts, JURASSIC WORLD doesn't disappoint and comes up as a fairly entertaining joyride with many fresh attractions in its kitty to excite one and all.Co-written and directed by Colin Trevorrow, this time we have a much bigger and stunning theme park with the main attraction of a new genetically modified, extra ordinarily intelligent hybrid dinosaur called Indominus Rex. The killing machine gets introduced with a fine build-up along with the four terrifying raptors tamed by their brave trainer. And then we have a gigantic water beast too brought in with a terrific public show sequence providing the much expected thrills.Following a set pattern that's predictable right from the word go, the first half of the film is a visual delight establishing the new characters of two young brothers, their aunt who is the manager of the park, their ultimate savior and the owner trying to show the world some unbelievable creations of his hired scientists. Not much happens in terms of action in this first hour taking you on to the tour of this much advanced park and the tension actually begins when the dangerous Rex manages to escape from its specified secured area to kill every living being found in its way ahead.As expected its the second half that has the entire action, thrills and fights between the man and the animal also showcasing hundreds of flying creatures attacking, terrorizing and killing the visitors of the park unlike any other sequel in the past. And that indeed turns the film into a much more bloody and brutal sequel in comparison. The deadly fight between the Rex and the raptors makes the young viewers cheer and the CGI department just executes it perfectly. However, the forcibly added romance element in the script is just there to generate some lighter moments and it's the sheer predictability of the script that doesn't let you rate it as something really outstanding ending on the same repetitive note as usual.In the performances, Chris Pratt superbly plays the character of Owen with great conviction and Bryce Dallas is fine too in her given role along with the two kids. But its Irrfan Khan who gives you a pleasant surprise in probably the biggest role ever played by an Indian actor in a foreign film with such an elegant ease. Interestingly another life teaching fact about his association with the series is that, the man who once had no money in his pocket to watch the first part of JURASSIC PARK in the 90s, can presently be seen playing the owner of the park in its latest sequel of 2015 after two decades. Personally speaking, this certainly is one of the most amazing play of DESTINY I have ever seen till date.Summing up, Colin Trevorrow's JURASSIC WORLD is surely a must watch for every youngster who hasn't experienced the famous dinosaur show in the big theatre ever before (preferably in 3D). Plus it has enough in store for the grown-ups too with new inventions especially incorporated for this particular section of viewers expecting something fresh. Yet, one would have to keep the comparisons out of the mind to enjoy it in a much better way taking along the kids to this 'wonderful show of dinosaurs' invented by Spielberg, Trevorrow and their exceptionally talented team designing the incredible graphics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jurassic World: Roar-some Return,"Hold onto your park passes, movie fans, because we're about to embark on a thrilling journey back to Isla Nublar with 2015's ""Jurassic World""! This sequel to the beloved original stomps onto the scene with a roar, promising bigger, badder beasties and enough thrills to make even the bravest palaeontologist sweat.Let's start with the good stuff: The animation is top-notch, bringing these prehistoric giants to life with stunning detail and terrifying presence. From the iconic T-Rex to the razor-sharp Indominus Rex, each creature feels like a living, breathing marvel, ready to tear through the screen and into your nightmares (in the best way possible, of course).The story, while not exactly groundbreaking, is a fast-paced thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a charming animal behaviorist with a knack for taming velociraptors, finds himself facing a Jurassic-sized problem when a genetically modified dinosaur escapes its enclosure. Cue the chaos!Pratt delivers a solid performance as the reluctant hero, balancing humor and action with a surprising amount of heart. Bryce Dallas Howard is equally compelling as Claire Dearing, the park's corporate manager who must navigate both the ethical and practical implications of the dino-disaster. The supporting cast, including Jeff Goldblum reprising his iconic role as Dr. Ian Malcolm, adds some welcome humor and wisdom to the mix.But like any good Jurassic Park film, it's not all sunshine and prehistoric smiles. Some might argue that the plot leans a bit too heavily on familiar tropes, with echoes of the original film's themes and even some recycled jump scares. And while the dinosaurs are undeniably impressive, some might feel their awe overshadowed by the film's focus on action and spectacle.So, is ""Jurassic World"" a roaring success or a dino-mite dud? It depends on what you're looking for. If you crave edge-of-your-seat thrills, stunning visuals, and a healthy dose of action, then this film is sure to leave you satisfied. But if you're expecting a groundbreaking story or a deep exploration of the ethical implications of genetic engineering, you might leave feeling a bit peckish for more.Ultimately, ""Jurassic World"" is a fun, action-packed summer blockbuster that brings new life to the Jurassic Park franchise. It's not perfect, but it's a good time for audiences who are ready to scream, cheer, and maybe even shed a tear (or two) as they revisit Isla Nublar. Just remember, when the T-Rex is chasing you, don't outrun it - outrun your friends!

Good jurassic park but simple plot and predictable,The movie is pretty good and have some tense moment. The special effect of the dinosaurs was very well made and make them believable. The story is pretty classic and the characters are very cliché even the young characters. The plot have some surprise but its clarly predictable and dont have any great revelation. We just watch events happening and the movie dont keep us engage with the story or the characters or the revelation. Anyway i enjoyed the movie but was quite predictabie and the story is pretty classic and dont bring anything new.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't miss it. Highly recommended!,"Well some critics over here are really harsh on the film. It seems like being harsh is so cool for them. But I don't like them. Seriously, this movie is awesome. They say the dinosaurs don't have such connections with humans and so on....as if they were in Jurassic period. The truth is why can't?! also the movie is based on dinosaurs created by small changes in original DNA gaps filled with present day animals. So they could exhibit such connection with human being. Anyways some people are always dumb and you can never make them understand. So overall I say don't believe in those negative reports. Also the movie was wonderful with cool scenes. Its not like Godzilla where I had to see the monsters for just 20min in whole movie. The Jurassic World gave me more satisfaction. I never got too tired to wait for the monster to appear unlike the Godzilla where I saw it clearly at the end LOL! I don't like to compare but if people think Godzilla was good then this movie far better than it! Climax is super awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good,"I am so glad they decided to make new, modern thrills while keeping the original concept alive and mixing it up with nostalgia. While on my JP binge-watch, I was getting tired of the blandness that is JP 2 and 3. While it doesn't quite reach the quality of the first film, this is still a highly worthy watch for any dinosaur fans out thereThis more or less felt like a direct sequel to the original film that was released in 1993, pretty much ignoring the existence of the 2 previous sequels other than the bird cage of the third film. Instead of being a boring decade-late sequel or a soulless reboot, it actually took advantage of the decade late release by it taking place at a far later timeline so there was some new stuff like a whole new park, and completely new ideas were brought to the table as well. Chris Pratt taming raptors is something not nuanced but certainly a fresh idea instead of reusing the first film's ideas all over again. The writing was good overall but it occasionally suffered from poor dialogueAnd these new ideas lead to them making a completely new dinosaur which never has existed in the real world, aka Indominus rex. The team did a pretty good job at establishing the new star as a threatening and an intimating force that feels powerful. Not to mention that the dino's design looks sick.The action is something that is not as epic as the survival chases of the original trilogy but with the help of an improved CGI, the action is certainly more amusing to look at. Such as the final showdown between the Indominus rex and a T-rexHowever Jurassic World does have one major blemish. That being the human characters. They're fine but none of them are really fleshed out or have any particularly memorable or dark scenes. So any attempt of an emotional scene falls completely flat. Heck, even Chris Pratt's character(Owen) wasn't really interesting despite the good acting. The 2 boys failed to make me feel for them and all the other characters were just meh.But overall I highly respect Jurassic World for not becoming a soulless cash-grab it so easily could have become. Instead introducing new concepts and modern thrills while staying true to the original film's tones and themes. Also a major improvement over Jurassic Park 2& 3Rating: 7.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Super,"We go out at time of the room, which usually is not packed but tonight we wondered if we would still have the place. I was pretty skeptical when Julie asked what we go to see ""Jurassic World"" but I was pleasantly surprised, good distribution, good script and special effects impeccable ... all seen 3D show was perfect and we So we had a good time. While the story is predictable but some scenes with close-up of the beast we were startled. it made their effect.

"""Don't worry. It's gonna be just like taking a walk in the woods... 65 million years ago."" - Owen","Almost repeating the past, a new Jurassic Park is opened with the world's first genetically engineered dinosaur on display, Indominus Rex. But things goes horrifically wrong when Indominus Rex escapes and wrecks havoc across the park.I'm a huge fan of the Jurrasic Park series. The original is my favourite by far but the sequels were still enjoyable if not a little silly. I didn't have high hopes for Jurassic World but i was pleasantly surprised - thus a good solid film. It's still no Jurassic Park (1993) but it's just as fun as The Lost World (1997) if not better. The special effects and CGI are magnificent, although i personally dont think anything beats thr animatronics of the original Jurassic Park. The action scenes and dinosaur reveals are fun and scary and there's a few throwbacks to the original for nostalgia sake. Now, I'm not a huge fan of the casting. I like Chris Pratt but I didn't really buy into his ex-military, raptor training persona. Bryce Dallas Howard was believable but her character didn't really serve much purpose. Vincent D'Onofiro plays the villain but I feel his chops are wasted playing a generic character. Anyway, you come to a film like this for the dinosaurs and you get plenty of them so I was still very happy even if the actors didn't quite do it for me. The action scenes were mostly believable if not a bit far fetched, same goes for design of the Park, but Indominus Rex was a great creation! Probably my favourite carnivore of the whole series if I'm honest. The dialouge could be cheesy at times but you can look past that as it moves briskly and never lingers too long on anything boring.Final Verdict: More dinosaurs than you can shake a stick at and just a fun movie all round. The characters arn't exactly believable and certain action scenes feel a bit ""hollywood"" at times but it has the right amount of nostalgia and new plot elements to perfectly merge the old trilogy with the inevitable new trilogy.

Jurassic World,"Now then, as stories go this is an huge pile of dino-droppings - but Chris Pratt does his level best, alongside some pretty bad-assed dinosaurs to keep this action adventure exciting. When the new ""Jurassic World"" theme park is opened, it builds on the promise of it's doomed predecessor but this time, they have state of the art safety facilities to protect the visiting lunch box brigade. Or do they? Unfortunately for them, ""Indominus Rex"", wasn't at the read-through and has a mind to eat just about anything he can wrap his jaws around. What he can't devour, his eager - recently released - friends from elsewhere in the park are plenty keen on too - so we quickly find ourselves with a ""containment anomaly"" that leads to a distinct carnage scenario for our hero to avert. As ever, Pratt brings oodles of personality to his role as the velociraptor's pal, but the rest of the cast - to an human - are poor. The kids grate and ought to have been eaten very early on, and gazillionaire Irrfan Khan (""Masrani"") is way to dapper and refined to be a convincing baddie. Vincent D'Onofio tries to help out, at least his part has some meat to it, but otherwise this is just a cracking victory for Pratt and some outstanding visual effects without even a rousing score from John Williams to rely upon and some storylines that are contrived to maximise the menace and minimise the plausibility. If you can find it showing on a big screen anywhere, then it is still worth watching on a wet afternoon, but it loses much of any potency it ever had on the small screen and I'm not sure I'd bother again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"From what I saw, it was decent","We went to see Jurrassic World yesterday and pregamed a bit too hard. We drank ten 8.5 ABV beverages each and polished off a bottle of fireball leading to me passing out for most of the film. From what I did see, it was pretty cool. Some kind of swimming dinosaur ate a shark i think, some kids were attacked by a dinosaur inside a hamster wheel thing and a red head who was kinda hot are just a few things that I can recall. Chris Pratt was pretty cool too, he was some kind of raptor whisperer and a pretty wild guy too. The original Jurrassic Park is definitely the best one but this one is pretty cool.

Fresh with a touch of nostalgia,"Jurassic World is an amazing sequel to the original Jurassic Park trilogy and makes sure to keep up the legacy of this legendary franchise. With a great choice of actors that would fascinate both its adult and teenage audience such as the rising star, Chris Pratt and the amazing Bryce Dallas Howard with the addition of young actors such as Nick Robinson and Ty Simkins. The plot is very well developed and there are no plot holes or questions left unanswered. A great addition to the movie were the plethora of references to the first Jurassic Park movie that a true fan will definitely notice.

"Dear mother of god, Where is Jeff Goldblum when you really need him?","Before I get to sink my claws in what I think is very wrong with this film, I have to say upfront that it's an hell of a lot better film than ""Jurassic Park 3"" just for the glaring fact that ""Jurassic Park 3"" was that bad of a movie. So much so that poor Sam Neill can't live it down for the way the screenwriters ruined his character and the credibility of the series as a whole.Now we have part 4, which is called ""Jurassic World"" and while it's a major league improvement over the dismal ""Jurassic Park 3"", its still can't live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it's sequel ""The Lost World"".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park's mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he's pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond's flights of fancy. Too bad he's not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience's reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film.Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That's a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it's killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character's stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D""Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he's a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It's really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film's huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.As the character of Ian Malcolm said to John Hammond in ""The Lost World"".John Hammond: ""Don't worry, I'm not making the same mistakes again."" Dr.Ian Malcolm: ""No, you're making all new ones.""This pretty much sums up Jurassic World as a whole.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Welcome Back,"People who say that nothing is original in Hollywood have an argument. I mean we live in a world where Vacation, Ben Hur, Mad Max, and Jurassic Park are all getting remade, re-quels, or long overdue sequels. There aren't many studios who pull the trigger on an unknown property, so here we have Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to the previous films, but more so just a film that calls back to the original but ignores the events of the next two. Is it better than the original? No, probably not. But it's definitely not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I really enjoyed the film. I know some people will still take issue with the fact that there's no reason there even should have been more than one film. Why are people still making dinosaurs? It's a good question. But if you just look at the film as more of a monster movie and not compared to the original classic, I think you will have a good time.Set 22 years after the events of the original, Jurassic World has the island as a full time theme park, just as John Hammond had hoped. But as people are growing tired of seeing dinosaurs, scientists create a new hybrid dinosaur as a way to boost attendance. Chris Pratt stars as a Velociraptor trainer, while Bryce Dallas Howard stars as one of the heads of the theme park. There's a lot to like about the film. Pratt is a true movie star and the films action was actually better than I expected. There's also several nods and callbacks to the original film. But I think the film suffers in it's lack of unpredictability and even in the lack of animatronics. The old films used real props in close up shots and only used CGI when needed. I just feel like at times it felt like there was an abundance of CGI where there didn't need to be. And as cool as the final fight was with the new dinosaur, I would have liked to have seen more of the genetics side of the story. I feel like that side of the film was glazed over within a few minutes.But the film is beautiful. It's fascinating seeing the island as an actual theme park attraction just as Hammonds vision called for. Hearing John Williams vivacious score (now done by Michael Giacchino) as a backbone to the gorgeous scenery is an added bonus. I also love the idea that people are getting bored of seeing dinosaurs. I mean they're frickin dinosaurs! The film also gives us some great humor as well, but not as much from Chris Pratt as you would think. But Jake Johnson perhaps has the most memorable performance, playing the Samuel L. Jackson-esque character from the original. But we watch these films to be entertained. And Jurassic World definitely entertains. Maybe not as much of the immense tension that the original had, but the dino-fights are top notch and ended with a fantastic climax. Yes, the people who you think die, die. But the film is loaded high octane thrills and enough humor to keep your eyes pealed. I could have done without the clichéd romance and even the predictable kids side story. But I wasn't let down with Jurassic World.+Great finale+Pratt and Johnson's humor+Beautiful landscape & score+Fresh enough idea to feel necessary-Cliched romance-Too much CGI7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Out of this world.,"Simply loved the film. I don't know why i am so intrigued about the film. the whole Jurassic world concept mesmerized me at once. The theme park where the it shows that the future is now, can actually be real and looks like a work in progress. Chris Pratt and Byrce has amazing chemistry to be honest. Although very few scope of romance, but they still clicked it within there trilling adventure fighting for survival from the dinosaurs. the last scene was inevitable as was suggested in the movie poster, but nonetheless was breathtaking.

simultaneously cringe - worthy and entertaining. .. missing that spielberg touch.,"I was 11 when Jurassic Park came out in the theaters, and like most from my generation I was utterly amazed. This movie will not illicit the same response from today's children. Spielberg (and his team) broke new ground and painstakingly created new effects that became the standard. This movie uses techniques that already exist and while these effects do look awesome, they're not awe inspiring. The ""spielbergian"" effects aren't the only thing missing, his storytelling style is sorely missed. No time is set setting up characters, situations, or (most importantly) SUSPENSE.Not only is the script, at times, cringe worthy with terrible dialouge, and plot points, but no time is spent setting up these characters. This leads us to really not care about these characters, especially since only 1 of them is even remotely likable, the rest are incredibly ""douchey"". Making matters worse is the atrocious acting from all parties involved (all of them). Pratt is a rehashed yet wooden Star Lord, Howard is her usual C-Word role, the 2 teens are annoying, and D'Onofrio is clearly there for the paycheck. It also must be noted that none of the actors have any chemistry, watching Pratt and Howard together is difficult to say the least.But let's be honest, nobody went to see this for the acting or the plot, they go to see the effects and the dinosaurs. On that front the movie is a success, however 3-D adds very very little to the film. While it doesn't break new ground with revolutionary techniques, it's still the coolest looking dinosaur movie you'll ever see. Despite the myriad of flaws I must say I was highly entertained throughout the entire film, which is really all I can ask of from a movie about a genetically engineered dinosaur theme park.Did it illicit that same childhood wonder and excitement of Jurassic Park in me? Of course not, I'm a grown up now and there's no way the movie could. But it did remind me of a time I felt that way. Will the children of today be as blown away as we were? Probably not, they have much more sophisticated technology in movies now. What we experienced was mind blowingly original, what they experience will not be. But there's nothing wrong with that. Without Spielberg there was never a chance of this topping the original but again it doesn't have to, it just has to top The Lost World and Part 3. And it easily does so, anyone who says it doesn't is probably just holding on to the way the original made them feel. Let's keep in mind that no Jurassic sequel has ever been really good just good for a dinosaur movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An Improvement Over Part Three,"A new theme park is built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction -- a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine -- escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.This film was going through various stages of development since at least 2003, and who knows how many changes were made in the process. Keira Knightley dropped out, Chris Pratt became the lead actor (something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago) and a virtual unknown was given the director's chair.Typically, by the fourth film in a franchise, the budget is smaller and the film ends up going straight to video. Instead, someone decided to make this the big comeback, and it pays off. Maybe not as good as the original, and arguably a notch below part two, this film easily outdoes part three and made a ton of money in the process.Credit should be given for not doing a ""reboot"" or ""remake"". Although it still confounds me that anyone would try (and succeed) in building a theme park, it works in the storyline. And even though they did not have Malcolm, Grant or pretty much any other main character return, they brought back Dr. Wu (this time a bit more sinister). That was a great choice, and keeps the franchise strong. How a part five is possible, who knows, but it seems bound to happen now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An instant classic that lives up to the original and improves upon it.,"Jurassic World is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park(1993). Jurassic World is a fully functioning dinosaur theme park & has fully realized John Hammond's dream all those years back, of creating such a spectacle(John Hammond appeared in Jurassic Park, played by the wonderful Richard Attenborough). Jurassic World has been in operation for about ten years. However, the theme park's visitors have been steadily losing interest in the dinosaurs, over the years. The scientists who have created these dinosaurs come up with a plan to reignite visitors' interest in the park. On the order of the chief executives who own Jurassic World, the scientists create a new & terrifying genetically modified dinosaur to up the 'scare & wow' factor of Jurassic World & bring the park to its former glory. Unfortunately, this new 'attraction' escapes. Now, it is up to a dinosaur handler named Owen(Chris Pratt) & Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard), one of the head employees at Jurassic World, with help from the technical team of Jurassic World to find & stop the dinosaur before all hell breaks loose at the park.Jurassic World is a fantastic movie! When I first saw the trailer of the film, I was intrigued. I thought, there's no way it can match up to Steven Spielberg's 1993 cult classic. However, I was pretty sure that it would be better than the slightly disappointing sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park(1997) & Jurassic Park III(2001). With a great cast & Spielberg executive producing, I knew this movie would come darn close to being as good as the original. Then, I watched it. This movie blew my mind & roared past my monstrous expectations! Not only does it capture the magic of the original film but also, modernizes the Jurassic Park movies for a new generation of viewers. The viewers will get excited when they see the huge gates of Jurassic World open & enter this incredible park. The 3D lets us see Isla Nublar(the island where Jurassic World is located) in all its magnificence. All the dinosaur set pieces look amazing in 3D. You actually feel like the dinosaurs are chasing you, roaring at you & creeping towards you. One of my favorite set pieces in the movie is the pterodactyl set piece. This is just one set piece out of many superb set pieces involving dinosaurs. I love the fact that the chaos involving dinosaurs doesn't take place immediately. This way, there's a growing feeling of dread during the early stages of the film. This adds to the overall thrill factor of the movie. The special effects are outstanding. The dinosaurs look even more realistic than they did in the previous Jurassic Park films. I liked Jurassic World better than Jurassic Park(1993). Director Colin Trevorrow ably takes the reins from Steven Spielberg & makes a movie that both fans & newcomers will love. Another reason the movie is so great is because, all the actors give us superb renditions of their characters. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen. After delivering three back-to-back hits with The Lego Movie(2014), Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) & Jurassic World, Pratt has clearly established himself as the latest Hollywood superstar. Bryce Dallas Howard is superb as Claire. Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Hoskins. Ty Simpkins is adorable as Gray. Irrfan Khan is charismatic as Simon Masrani. Nick Robinson is great as Zach. Jake Johnson is hysterical as Lowery. Omar Sy is effective as Barry. BD Wong is impressive as Dr. Henry Wu. Judy Greer is good as Karen. Jurassic World will satisfy fans of the original film & will gain millions of new fans. A must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nostalgia wins!,"I am on my vacation in Croatia, but cannot resist the temptation to visit a local multiplex and watch this box-office record-shattering blockbuster, now has officially revitalised the JURASSIC PARK franchise, it brings back the nostalgic audience who has welcomed and impressed by the first tent-pole came out exactly 22 years ago with umpteen salutes, and competently revamps the visual spectacle to win over new audience. Director Colin Trevorrow and his team has accomplished a quite impressive job!It is basically the same old story, only the scale is proportionally swollen, now Jurassic Park is a fully operating theme park, and our antagonist here is a genetically mutated creature, Indominus Rex (not a dinosaur in the traditional sense, as its DNA carries more undisclosed samples from other species), who is smart enough to trick its human creators and runs amok, wreaks havoc on both human visitors and dinosaur habitants on the island of Isla Nublar. The park's operational manager Claire (Howard) teams up with Owen (Pratt), a veteran now is a raptor trainer on the island, to find Gray (Simpkins) and Zack (Robinson), Claire's nephews who are entrapped in the dangerous zone, and bring them back to safe places. Meanwhile, Hoskins (D'Onofrio), the head of security, thinks it is a great opportunity for a field test of the trained raptors, as he intends to use them in military uses. Under the commander of Owen, four trained raptors are released to track Indominus, but the scheme backfires as soon as they realise the latter contains the former's DNA too. The prolonged survival battle will need the old ruler of the food chain to settle the scores.Chris Pratt is presently the mascot of North American box-office, his down-to-earth persona and his respectful attitude towards dinosaurs attainably confronts Bryce Dallas Howard's high-maintenance facade and her commodity view on the genetically created behemoths, their clashes are metered out with beguiling charm to appease the lowest common denominator, as the latter can literally outrun a T-Rex in her high-heels, and generously the film grants her a trans-formative curve to be connected to the living things and her nephews. Ty Simpkins, who has stolen the thunder from Robert Downey Jr. in IRON MAN 3 (2013), again here he is utterly adorable and conspicuously heartwarming in a role doesn't expect to demand too much other than screaming and running! Irrfan Khan, as the owner of the entire enterprise, Masrani, stands out in his caricature of a man whose leisured passion eventually becomes his doom.The SFX is in its full-blown fashion as we can get a glimpse in the trailer, it aspiringly offers more leeway for the interaction between visitors and its permanent residents, like the ""gyrosphere"" experience and the mosasaurus splash. However, as Indominus is the only villain most of the time, its ubiquitous presence, does feel too contrived, which later can be also referred to the ""betrayed"" raptors, as viewers have the full knowledge of how enormous the island is. It certainly tones down the sense of ""epic-ness"" one might expect from such a ginormous project. Otherwise, JURASSIC WORLD hits all the right notes, massively enhanced by Michael Giacchino's golden accompanying score, as a studio product tries to parade its most generic appeal to lure as many as audience possible, and nothing is wrong of that, as long as viewers can identify with some respect has been thoroughly taken into considerations during the production line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Sometimes, nostalgia isn't all it's cracked up to be.","I enjoyed Jurassic Park a lot. I wasn't a massive fan or anything like that, but it was somewhat of a groundbreaking film. The sequels were pretty crappy, but I don't really remember them. My expectations for this movie were very low. I wasn't against another Jurassic Park movie by any means, but I wasn't exactly clamoring for one either. When my friend asked me to see it with him, I figured I'd give it a shot. It was technically well-done. It looked really slick. That being said, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Then it dawned on me! It lacks genuine tension. Steven Spielberg is a master at creating thrills and tension. He knows what the audience wants. Colin Trevorrow obviously did some research. In many ways, this is like a love letter to Jurassic Park. There are a lot of references to Jurassic Park. As amiable as that is, he falls short. There is plenty of action, but it felt mechanical and I wasn't all that entertained by it. I will say the Dinosaurs looked pretty cool. The performances are above average. Chris Pratt handled himself adequately. I didn't think he was great, but he did the job. I didn't fully buy him as a ""tough guy"" Bryce Dallas Howard is a cute and fared pretty well. It's too bad her character was thinly written. Robinson & Simpkins are decent as the kids. My main problem with the cast is the lack of depth. I wasn't given enough to work with.This film isn't worthy of breaking box office records. I'm still shaking my head about how this made over 200 million on opening weekend. It's never boring and there are some good moments, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. It could have been better.6.3/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It Wasn't What I Hoped;  Shallowly Entertaining,"The original JURASSIC PARK is and always will be one of my favorite movies. I even enjoyed THE LOST WORLD more than most people. I've read Michael Crichton's novels more times than I can remember. So yes, I am a fan. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of reopening the movie franchise more than a decade since the third film solidified my belief that the series had run out of steam. I was cautiously optimistic when I read that Colin Trevorrow, director of the fun SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, was brought on to helm the project and I was even more excited when Chris Pratt was cast in one of the lead roles. Trevorrow was loud and proud about his love for the original '93 film, so I began to believe he might do the series justice and somehow reinvigorate it. JURASSIC WORLD seems to ignore the previous two sequels, setting it in an operational and mega-successful park built on Isla Nublar. Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) is the operations manager, whom we meet when she's balancing a busy schedule of shuffling off her visiting nephews onto her disinterested assistant and presenting the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, to potential investors. Meanwhile, former Navy SEAL and Ingen contractor Owen (Pratt) takes a break from training a team of velociraptors to inspect the Indominus's pen for safety concerns; in what should come as a surprise to no one, the Indominus outsmarts Owen and the park crew and escapes from its pen, endangering the lives of thousands of park guests as it murders its way across the island.Trevorrow was not lying when he expounded on his love for the original film. In fact, JURASSIC WORLD is his love letter to it and it's probably the film's biggest flaw. You can't go more than a few minutes without some sort of reference to JURASSIC PARK. The visitors' center is featured in a sequence where we see the ""When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"" and skeletal remains from the climactic moment. We see a night vision headset (twice!), famous from the T-rex escape sequence. There's little nods scattered around in the background (visual and audio) and even a character in the Jurassic World control room (Lowery, played by Jake Johnson) who seems to encapsulate Trevorrow's own raging fandom. A few references would've been fine but, by the time the film was halfway over, it just made me wish I was watching the original film. I wanted JURASSIC WORLD to be its own film, reminding us why we loved the '93 film without constantly nudging us with its elbow, winking, and murmuring ""Remember that part? It was cool, wasn't it?"" Even the core plot is pretty much a slightly modified version of the original: dinosaurs get loose, rational man who knows what he's doing makes it his mission to bring two key children back to safety, big climactic moment to close it out. Except the characters in the original film always felt as if they were in constant danger. There was suspense. JURASSIC WORLD isn't all that suspenseful. Maybe it's because the dinosaurs are 99% CG now. Sure, they look pretty good but, no matter how many people the Indominus swallows whole, it's never as scary as the T-rex was in the first film. The lack of suspense could also be attributed to the hollow feeling behind the action. Most of the deaths are nameless extras, be they asset containment crew or park guests. The moment when I knew this would never live up to JURASSIC PARK: when a helicopter crashes in a fiery, gratuitous, unmotivated explosion just so it can happen with the Indominus roaring in the foreground for that perfect ""trailer shot"". It was almost offensive in how cheesy that moment felt.Speaking of cheesyhow about that final confrontation with the Indominus? I'm not going to lie. That whole sequence had me rolling my eyes. Especially at the end. Not going to spoil anything here, but you'll probably know what I'm referring to. I'm being sort of hard on JURASSIC WORLD but that's only because I wanted it to try harder. It's not a bad film. It's still pretty entertaining. It's got some great casting (Pratt, Johnson, Irrfan Khan as the park owner, Vincent D'Onofrio as a nefarious Ingen overseer) and I loved the concept of setting the film in an operational park. On the topic of D'Onofrio's character and the whole subplot of ""trained"" velociraptors: I was wary at first but I thought it was done well. If anything, I think it should've been the main plot the film or, at the very least, saved for a sequel. The sequence in the middle of the film where the raptors are given a field test (which is glimpsed in the trailer with Pratt running with the pack on a motorcycle) was probably the best part of the movie. Overall, I felt JURASSIC WORLD was a tad overrated and, while it was an entertaining couple of hours, teamed with AGE OF ULTRON to jumpstart the ""Summer of 'Meh'"" (a term I've come to use for the summer blockbuster season of 2015 where I was continuously underwhelmed). Based on the money this film raked in (all of it), a sequel was guaranteed and, just as I was for JURASSIC WORLD, I'm hopeful. This spent too much time pining over the franchise's glory days but there were some promising nuggets in there. For anyone who for some reason hasn't seen it already, it's worth a watch and you'll probably really enjoy it. Personally, I'm more interested in where the franchise goes from here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A worthy successor of the first movie. That's for sure !,"""Monster is a relative term.To a canary,a cat is a monster.We're just used to being the cat""Universal Pictures pulled out his magic box once again and gathered a horde of extinct dinosaurs,which are resurrected with the use of some scientific tricks, on the big screen.Looking at the box office (apparently almost $ 1 billion),it seems like everyone was eagerly looking forward to seeing those prehistoric mastodons rumbling around again.Although some scientists were so quick off the mark to prove that some things don't correspond to reality (not all dinosaurs lived in the Jura era,the velociraptors weren't bigger than a turkey and were covered with feathers,the mosquito from which the DNA was extracted, didn't suck blood and the mosasaur wasn't so big as it's portrayed),it's still a lot of fun.I was ready to be overwhelmed and before I knew it,I was looking at the bottom of my bag of popcorn,which is a good sign and a reliable value indicator when it comes to the entertainment content of a feature film.After the amazing and impressive Jurassic Park in 1993 (Damn,that's 22 years ago),two lousy sequels were released for the Dino-crazy public. Unlike the first film,of which I can recall large parts as if I saw it yesterday,I barely can remember anything of the two successors.And let's not mention the awful rip offs that were subsequently thrown on the market (recently I gave ""Jurassic City"" a chance and already dropped off after 10 minutes due to lousy special effects).In ""Jurassic World"" they returned to the successful formula of the well-known theme park.Only now it's not an empty amusement park,which should be approved by a select group of scientists,but a crowded park where the owners want to add a new attraction.But again the end result is less attractive and cozy.It's perfectly summed up by the words of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) in ""The Lost World"" : ""Yeah.Ooh and ah, that's how it always starts.But then later there's running and screaming"".The two teenagers Gray and Zach,the first one is a dinosaur fanatic and the second one has more interest in the opposite sex,are on their way to the amusement park of InGen,where their aunt Claire works as a operations manager.Of course,the latter doesn't have time to babysit and she leaves them in the hands of her assistant Zara.To ensure the income of the park and meet the demands of the main sponsors,the small army of geneticists fabricated a hybrid version which would be even more frightening than the existing species.They use the genes of prehistoric predators and contemporary species.The owner of the park wants Owen Grady,the Velociraptor trainer,to check the enclosure of the hybrid.And soon Owen comes to the conclusion that once again they are playing with fire.Is ""Jurassic World"" an impressive film? Yep. Did the special effects and computer animation make me drool again ? Yep. Are those fearsome dinosaurs overwhelming again ? Yep. Did it exceed the first film ? Uh, actually not quite. What makes this film memorable ? Well, the park itself for starters. A sort of Disneyland but with unparalleled attractions. The monorails, the infrastructure, the holographic displays and the overall total picture were impressive. The mosasaur was the masterpiece of this film. Superbly imaged. Both the physical appearance as his natural living space. The ""gyrospheres"" and the accompanying scenery is the first attraction I would like to try out. The action-packed part at the pterosaurs cage was breathtaking. But the rest of the used scenes showed similarities with the first film. A park where the situation turns out to be life threatening. Again a couple (who had a thing in the past most probably) need to bring two teenagers in safety while they are surrounded by dangerous prehistoric creatures. Even Claire imitated the dress of Dr. Sattler at one time: an unbuttoned shirt over a T-shirt.What I didn't get while watching ""Jurassic World"", were shivers down my spine and goosebumps moments. Emotionally, I don't think there'll ever be another movie (with prehistoric monsters) that surpasses the experience I had while watching ""Jurassic Park"". When Dr. Grant turned around,peered over the valley where different prehistoric species wandered around and said ""Look at that. It's a dinosaur."", my hair stood straight up. When the T-Rex left his cage and started chasing the jeep and you could see the gaping mouth approaching in the rear-view mirror. The raptors sneaking through the kitchen with two teenagers scared to death. These are all particular moments I've missed in ""Jurassic World"". Yes, it was terribly exciting and impressive to see. But that subtle difference was there anyway. I also missed a character like Jeff Goldblum with his dry humor and pertinent observations. And then of course the charismatic dreamer John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who saw a fantasy collapsing. In some ways it was all there, but it didn't feel the same way.But forget about my nitpicking and hurry to a cinema to watch this two-hour action packed, exciting and entertaining film. The success of ""Jurassic World"" is its link with the first movie and the overall nostalgic value. You can add the question ""How did you feel after watching Jurassic Park?"" to the long line of historical questions such as ""Where were you when Kennedy was shot ?"" And ""What were you doing when the radio broad-casted Elvis passed away ?"". ""Jurassic Park"" had a major influence on films that appeared after wards. My main conclusion is that ""Jurassic Park"" was far ahead when it's about CGI, because the creations at that time looked as lifelike as those in ""Jurassic World"". But I am quite convinced that I'll never set foot in such a park, would it ever exist in reality ...PS. Funniest moment for me : pay attention to what a visitor does during the pterosaurs attack ... Yes, he saves two cocktails ! I almost choked on my coke!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A great science fiction movie, a take off on the Frankenstein story. Total mayhem on the screen.","This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid Fun,"I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. I've only seen the original, which I thoroughly enjoy, but I had heard that the sequels were terrible. Because of that, I did not expect this one to deliver anything special in terms of plot or character. With a dinosaur movie, there's only so much you can do and, as this was intended to give the franchise new life, it is unsurprising that they would ignore plot and character in favor of really cool dinosaurs. And after seeing the movie, I was totally okay that they did. Yes, we had seen the stock characters before, but they were likable enough and didn't detract from the movie at all. In fact, I really liked Chris Pratt's Owen and his deep care for the animals he worked with and his paternal nature. I also really enjoyed the genetic modification aspect of it because it did ring true to our society where we are so easily bored and demand more without thinking about consequences. Apart from that, I liked the dinosaurs. It was a fun run away from the monster movie that delivered on the action. While there was nowhere near as much suspense as in the first movie, that did not make it unenjoyable. In particular, seeing the film in IMAX, the final showdown did not disappoint. All in all, if you're looking for an unique plot or great character development, this is not the movie to watch. However, it did succeed in being a fun summer blockbuster, which is exactly what it should have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nostalgic? Brings back your childhood? The sequel that Jurassic Park deserves? Whose press agent is writing this?,"I'm a bit baffle at some of the reviews that praise this film. Yes, it's better than Jurassic Park 3 and its really dumb fun but some of the praise seem bit robotic, like they are going through talking points given by a press agent. Nostalgic? Because this movie takes place on the same island as the first Jurassic Park? Honestly, this does not look like the same island but whatever. Bring back your childhood? Was your childhood memory of Jurassic Park filled with cardboard cut outs as human characters, sexism, bad acting and an over indulgence of CGI? Seems so. The sequel that Jurassic Park deserves? From what I remember from Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, it had smart characters dealing with a moral dilemma about messing with the natural order of things and dealing with the consequences of their actions. The only sequel in the Jurassic Park series that carried over the themes of the original Jurassic Park was Steven Spielberg's follow up, The Lost World. While The Lost World was not as good as the original Jurassic Park, it still manages to be a strong sequel that at respects and accomplishes what the original sets out to do. Jurassic World only really has dumb characters running away from a monster bend on killing everyone in a amusement park. Again, Jurassic World is for a fact a much better film than the horrendous Jurassic Park 3 but that's because it's dumb fun, not the second coming of the original Jurassic Park.Chris Pratt is playing his usual roguish frat boy self and it does gives the movie one of it's few likable characters but he can't hold this movie by himself with with bad card board cuts outs as characters, some very bad acting and out of place sexist stereotypes of women. Not to mention a script that is pretty flimsy with pretty bad dialogue. With what was once a science fiction thriller with the first two Jurassic Park films went off the rails with Jurassic Park 3 when it became a sad family film with dinosaurs. Jurassic World tries to bring back the thrills somewhat with some dumb B movie fun with a monster on the loose film but its hurt by the hint of the bad family drama and unlikable characters of Jurassic Park 3 with two boys trying to get their aunts attention. Because of that, none of it works very well off each other and while Chris Pratt is likable hero, he's not given the tools necessary thanks to the bad script and so so directing to hold back the tidal wave of cheese that was thrown on the audience once the film was done.So yes, it's better than Jurassic Park 3 but no,it's not nostalgic and its not the sequel that Jurassic Park deserves. If this bring you back to your childhood, you really do have issues you need to deal with. In reality, Its a semi decent B movie entry to the series that manages to entertain despite its many problems. If you go in believing the hype from talking points from publicist trying to sell this film to you as the second coming of the original Jurassic Park, you will be very disappointed. Go in with realistic expectations and you will be rewarded.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On Par,"This is as close to the original as humanly possible. Just enough homage equalled with a plot of it's own makes this on a par with Jurassic Park. The effects were good but more importantly the way they were used made all the difference and brought things to life. Watched this in 3D and if anyone tells you it makes no difference then they are talking through their spectacles,,it opens up the whole movie and gives you an idea how it may feel to stand in front of those creatures. One thing that I noticed was the score..sounded like Williams but had a very modern spark to it which seemed to settle me into Jurassic mode.

Too far away from the previous movies (and more),"Personally, I just hated it. Ever since the 15 first minutes. Hard to explain why, though, but to me, the atmosphere of the previous movies was left away. Let alone the fact that to my mind the director(s?) did a shitty job. In my opinion, we, as viewers, see too much of the creatures. At least, the former movies kept our breath for long minutes before actually seeing a dinosaur. Yeah, I think that's what lead me to rate that movie 1/10 on IMDb. Cause we see too much, too early i the movie, and that absolutely nothing makes sense. I remember sometime they refer to the RIP actor John Hammond. So much needed to be explained, ad CERTAINLY NOT SHOWN I THE 25 FIRST MINUTES, for that movie to reach success.

Guilty pleasure,"I wasn't sure what to think about this movie when I went to the theater to see it. I really liked the 'old' movies and since this was supposed to be right up that ally, I was excited. Also a little worried though, because if the 'old' movies, especially the first one, were so good, would Jurassic World be able to live up to those standards? The answer is yes and no. The storyline is cliché, it doesn't have the same level as innovation as Jurassic Park, the cast (in my opinion) in the original trilogy were better than the cast for Jurassic World, ... But when I saw the movie it felt like a good old dinosaur movie with lots of spectacle and providing good entertainment.

Back to the Jurassic world,"I was surprised to hear this movie was coming to the big screen considering how disappointing the last outing Jurassic Park 3 was. My recommendation is that if you haven't seen any of the original 3 movies (unlikely but possible ?) don't be tempted to now, watch this and it will be all the more enjoyable, well they say ignorance is bliss ! Of course you probably have seen the original and best film from 1993 and even the still very enjoyable JP2 of 1997 which this film compares favourably to. It is leaps and bounds better than JP3 of 2001 which was inevitable because that film was scraping the barrel for ideas. The CGI has improved quite a bit and that is where the money has been spent I guess (another £100 000 000 film !) with the added bonus of 3D which I thought was really good. OK the story is obviously predictable , we aren't expecting all the dinosaurs to stay in their pens and behave themselves are we !? The newish ideas come in the form that we have trained the dinos to be more entertaining a bit like sea-world and for that extra wow factor that is of course needed we have a new chimera of a dinosaur in Indominus-rex a real badass monster who inevitably runs amok. There are some funny and romantic moments dropped in here and there and of course the baddies in the background with their own agendas for the dinosaurs. Chris Pratt shows us again how entertaining he can be as the action hero and will obviously be doing more comedy action in future. BD Wong is again the scientist from the original 1993 film, it would have been nice to see Sam Neil but you can't have everything ,maybe JP3 scared him or should I say scarred him ? Anyway ,if you want to see an action packed entertaining big blockbuster of a movie go and see Mad Max Fury Road, if you want to see an entertaining action movie about dinosaurs , Jurassic World is a good option.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So yes, on part of the effects it's all great but nothing new and the story isn't going to put you at the edge of your seat. This is exactly what it must do, no gore, no nudity, no shocking things, just a flick you watch with your whole family. Even if they are under 10 it's all watchable. And the story, well, it's what you've seen in the original one. Things go wrong at the park, and children have to be saved. The raptors are back again and their alpha is a human, can see coming from a stone age what they will do at the end.Predictable blockbuster to make the new youngsters at home warm to go back to the original flick(s).

Appreciate it for what it is,"Jurassic world differs from all other installments of the jurassic park franchise, it feels more like a family movie compared to a thriller. In this movie, there are more comic relief moments, more content regarding family, and we also know for a fact that none of the major characters won't die. A lot of people say that this movie is predictable, that there is just one big monster and it's powerful, it does a lot of damage and then it gets defeated. But I feel that this generalization of the plot is kinda bs, because every detail of this movie is very enjoyable. You got the cool new dino, you got great chase scenes, you got dino fights, you got a sense of an apocalyptic event, you got good music, and you also got T-rex.

"One Dinosaur, Two Dinosaur, Red Dinosaur, Blue Dinosaur","Oh, will those crazy dinosaur-creating scientists never learn? As if all the people gobbled up by giant reptilians run amok over the course of three previous movies wasn't enough, a giant corporation thinks it's a grand idea to open Jurassic World, the Sea World of dinosaurs. And because dinosaurs have become de rigeur, audiences demand bigger and meaner ones if they are to continue buying tickets. Thus, a team of geneticists manufacture monsters intended to satisfy customers, until they do too good a job and create one that's a sort of super hero and has all the best traits from various other dinosaurs combined into one. When it escapes from its pen, things go predictably badly.Once I recovered from the disappointment of realizing that Bryce Dallas Howard was not going to be swallowed up or torn apart by the movie's end, I was able to settle in and enjoy this movie for what it was, which is a game if somewhat lacking attempt to recreate the roller coaster thrills of Steven Spielberg's first installment. Remember that one, that ancient relic of a movie that came out way back in 1993? Yes, it's so old I'm surprised it was even in color.

But it feels like a movie written and directed by a committee; you never appreciate Spielberg's ability to direct an action sequence until you see someone try to imitate him.Chris Pratt, once again, is not up to the nominal challenge of the role he's been given. Every time I see him in a movie, he's just missing whatever essential quality the character he's playing needs in order to work. In ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" it was a roguish scruffiness. In this, it's a macho resourcefulness. But he's never convincing as anything other than a pretty boy bro. It's like ordering Indiana Jones and getting a doofus frat boy.The most memorable sequence in the movie is one where a flock of pterodactyls swoops down on the unsuspecting visitors to the theme park and wreak all kinds of havoc.

"Tough to truly dislike, and I'm glad I took the time to track it down, but Jurassic World does not uproot trees.","Films such as ""Jurassic World"" are so often the most difficult to review; you find yourself in a strange place wherein you really want to like it, but must remember that impartiality and balance are so crucial as to forging views on anything, that to resist them means to completely waste your time in the first place. There is not, in many ways, much to remark about Jurassic World: it does not overstay its welcome; its second unit content is exciting; it a least attempts something resembling character study and manages to take a franchise into new directions without wrecking too much of the nucleus of the initial idea. Unlike, say, recent ""Die Hard"" or ""Terminator"" entries.Many of the ideas coined in the aftermath of the blow-away 1993 success ""Jurassic Park"" by critics and theorists remain; observations which were never meant derogatorily, but are either included here out of a rooted urge to stick to the source material or by way of academic homage. Thus, much of what was written twenty years ago with regards to the symmetry between a theme-park ride and a movie going experience with films such as ""Jurassic Park"" still stand. I believe it was Tom Shone who once remarked that, in a post 1977 Star Wars era, cinema/film-going experiences are becoming more like trips to an amusements park with each passing summer-blockbuster line-up.In Jurassic World, a tracking shot once we are in the park after some formalities is deliberately set up so as to resemble a standard person's height as the park is entered and a woman steps before us with the line ""Welcome to Jurassic World"" – it is the closest to a process of breaking the fourth wall that one can realistically come without cordially turning to the camera and asking the salivating multiplex audience if they are ready for what they are about to experience over the next 90 minutes. It does, in many ways, call to mind Spielberg's self-conscious references to the various items of ""Jurassic Park"" memorabilia which were actually on sale in shops anyway in 1993 by way of his otherwise needless tracking shot around a gift-shop full of theme park memorabilia towards the end of that film.Two strands set the film running, the likes of which somewhat clumsily merge towards the end. The first revolves around two minors: essentially one child and a teenager with Justin Bieber locks and an eye for the girls. They head to Central America and Jurassic World: a realisation of John Hammond's dream to one day build a theme-park where the dinosaurs are the attraction. This is doubly rewarding, because the head of the park is the aunt Claire, played by Bryce Dallas-Howard.The second strand follows an Alan Grant-knock off by the name of Owen Grady, played with a really good balance of energy and vulnerability by Chris Pratt. Grady works in a strange capacity as some sort of dinosaur trainer; a process whereby the once-feared velociraptors are now essentially pets performing tricks at a click. Occupying him on his strand is Vincent D'Onfrio's shady Vic Hoskins, who wants the raptors signed over to the military to essentially fight Al-Qaeda, but we have previous experience of this archetype by way of Paul Riser's character in James Cameron's ""Aliens"".He is present in the park to help Claire with a new hybrid dinosaur the park has created: the Indominus-Rex, which is director Colin Trevorrow's taking of the franchise to bigger places: ""The Lost World"" needed to put a Tyrannosaurus Rex in an urban environment; ""Jurassic Park 3"" needed its Spinosaurus to juice up proceedings and now the 2015 vintage technically needs something that doesn't even exist to keep people interested. With a Tyrannosaurus-Rex in place of the lab-creation, but the film exactly as it otherwise is, things just wouldn't be as much fun. The trouble is, this new creation, echoing perhaps Frankenstien's Monster, is a bloodthirsty killer which does not take to being caged up, and it is not long before things get out of hand once it cuts loose. What follows is essentially a B-movie trussed up like an A-movie, an old adage which, I believe, was once attributed to Spielberg's ""Jaws"" anyway, although not in a derogatory manner, as the kids strive to survive in the wilderness; the park tries to contain the Indominus and Vincent D'Onofrio refuses to take ""no"" for an answer.Along the way, we get plenty of dino-on-human and dino-on-dino action, but Trevorrow has a trick up his sleeve and it is the development of the Dallas-Howard character, whom is transformed from cold and robotic bureaucrat barely able to recall her nephew's name to hard-bodied supporting heroine on the front-line saving their lives. A very physical epitome of this might be the moment she physically tears away some of her clothes beside a waterfall in order to shed one 'skin' and embrace another. Various ""body"" theories have been coined about allowing the viewer to technically gauge just how far along the film has progressed by the state of a lead character's ""body"" without so much as even glancing at a watch.Alas there is not much to marvel at away from the heavy spectacle of dinosaurs doing what dinosaurs used to do to one another, not to mention what they would almost certainly do to human-beings if in close proximity to them, aside from Dallas-Howard's aforementioned arc. Colin Trevorrow should strike us as a shrewd director, in that he manages to pay homage to the 1993 original in fairly audacious ways without ever really encroaching on it. Despite this, he manages to take what now appears to be a franchise that has been re-energised and reinvigorated to new and exciting places. The film is for sure a success, but is not innocent of lacking in several areas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Chappy Watched: Jurassic World,"Why the f*ck are people still going to these parks!Also, it's always the bloody scientists, rich people and just plain idiots that are the reasons these disasters happen!If these scientists are going to play around with genetics, why not make all these dinosaurs herbivores to eliminate the risk?In these types of movies, I'm always on the side of the animals/creatures and could care less about the stupid humans, especially with most of them thinking animals aren't smart and can't learn anything, and it's exactly like this in Jurassic World.Although I didn't expect much with the story, we've seen this before, it was still enjoyable to watch but still was predictable in the other story lines aside form the dinosaurs escaping; for example the side stories of some of the main characters.The movie did have an awesome cast including of course, Chris Pratt, who I'm glad that they didn't try to overuse given his popularity since Guardians of The Galaxy. Massive kudos to Bryce Dallas Howard for all the running she did in those heels.I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of references to the first Jurassic Park; I expected at least one but there were quite a few and not ones that were thrown in your face either.I'll be interested to see the story for, the inevitable, sequel because who is going to go to another park?An enjoyable, entertaining movie that I will see again in the cinemas and will definitely be an addition to my bluray collection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hopefully a sequel will complete the half-baked elements of a greater narrative,"Admittedly a fanatic of the original JP story created by Michael Crichton and the first feature film, I held a lot of pent-up nostalgia before seeing this film and my first viewing was mostly a ""sit-back-and- take-it-all-in"" kind of experience. After digesting the story and events, and viewing the film a few more times, I think I'm getting closer to understanding why Jurassic World did enough to please the palette of JP fans who anxiously awaited the next installment of this epic franchise, but not enough to capitalize on a very promising opportunity.Several scenes in this film are executed very well and create real moments of suspense like you would hope for in the scientific survival- horror genre. Michael Giacchino's inventive score plays a big part in this, paying just enough homage to keep within the original universe while accomplishing a modern tone to create a stark and somber atmosphere as well as the more joyful and playful moments that are common with Spielberg matinée-action films. I highly recommend, if nothing else, to give a listen to the soundtrack and immerse yourself in the wonder, adventure, and genuine thrills that exist on a island where humans rank a few spots down the food chain if not secured by their propensity to control nature and the environment (as Ian Malcolm eloquently monologues)But back to the original point, many scenes are filmed and directed very well on their own, primarily the dino-scenes, but the dinos should only be a subsidiary of a greater human narrative, as was on display in Crichton's original novel and the 1993 film.The story arc seems to be on a train track that's continually shifting the rails. As a ""passenger,"" you know the destination and have a sense of what's to unfold - and in many ways the characters and events are too predictable - but upon arrival you'll be left thinking, ""that was an unusual route to get to where we wanted to go."" I sit back and think about the characters of this film and just envision so many different interactions that could've taken place in order to help the viewer absorb the universe and feel the gravity of everything at-stake rather than being relegated to a mere observer of chaos and destruction.The film had charismatic elements, for sure: - Chris Pratt delivers his character very well, even with an at-times limited and underwhelming dialogue. - Irfan Khan is a natural as the eccentric president and owner of the park (his accent can be thick, but I appreciated the sincere disposition he carried as a caring owner and leader) - The intelligence and impressive capabilities of the I-Rex and Henry Wu's engineering are fun thoughts to toss around in theory, but don't necessarily play out to their full potential on-screen - The immense level of detail put into the park is truly astounding upon close inspection - And once again, Michael GiacchinoHowever, many elements will leave many underwhelmed: - Bryce Dallas Howard, though her acting is fine - even great at times, her character just didn't command enough charisma or engaging traits to be the film's leading presence. Perhaps it's because she switches too much between a dictating administrator, panicked/less thoughtful reactor to chaotic events, and simultaneously dismissive yet empathetic family member and lover. Her character arc, while identifiable, is like the overall story and prone to confusing turns - Hoskins, the InGen leader, has valid reasoning for his motives (even if far-fetched, DNA modification through gene-splicing as a mode of creating bio-weapons deserves to play out on film, and what's more fun than using extinct animals as the base genome) but the character is treated too often as a wily cartoon-villain too busy twiddling his mustache to present a convincing case for his ideas. - The forced love component between the two leads, and ""forced"" really is the best word because, while everything seems to be positioned for a survival situation to bring two people closer together, the audience doesn't really get the opportunity to 'feel' the bond being created. We're given a backstory and both Pratt and Howard possess charm, but the on-screen relationship that unfolds feels too much like a product of movie-making and doesn't possess enough humanity. At one point, Howard's character even goes so far to dismisses her borderline negligence on a ""technical malfunction"" that nearly resulted in Pratt's death - so where exactly is the caring and affection, I ask?On the whole, I still enjoy watching this film for the cinematography and direction during action sequences, but I wish the script and story- board would have been tweaked some more. It feels like some early ideas were stubbornly implanted into a film that tried to break free and become something transcendent but ultimately settled into something more comfortable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrific world,"To be quite honest I came into this movie carrying a few negative biases. A first one against the Jurassic franchise, which I've never been a huge fan of. A second one against 4th installments in film franchises (that's right Crystal Skull, I'm looking at you). And a third one against easy, bigger-is-better blockbuster. One by one, this film destroyed these biases. The cast's performance, led by an astonishing Chris Pratt was tremendous (even though child actors will remain child actors). The new park was as immersive as one could have ever hoped for. The link made to the rest of the franchise was not only skillful but impregnated with a subtlety unknown to blockbusters. The film was overall one of the most terrific movie-going experiences I've ever had. Not only immersive, thrilling and wowing, but also quite reflective on the effects of consumerism on our society.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Solid popcorn movie, altho way too violent","I was a feeling a bit old watching this movie, which isn't very common at all. The movie does a good job tho in bringing the franchise to next generation. The transition and references work quite well. I was pleased how solid and well directed the movie in whole was. In the very beginning it felt as if it might be awkward, but once it started, it worked quite well.Acting was pretty good. I don't watch many Hollywood movies anymore, so wasn't familiar with Chris Pratt, but he makes a good Indiana Jones style lead. Bryce Dallas Howard is a bit over the top at times, but her character works in a blockbustery clichéd way. The kids were OK, altho a bit underdeveloped.What I didn't like was the violence. In my opinion the movie is way too bloody and violent, even warlike. It's been a while since I last saw the original, but I kind of remember it being more on the scary side than action violence. I personally prefer a few tense scary scenes to full throttle violence. This movie does not have the same suspense factor - in my opinion - as the original with raptors. Then there is one quite prolonged death scene, which isn't too graphic, but you have time to feel the despair.I also felt that there were a bit too many different themes thrown in. There's a very under developed divorce theme, the military theme, the profit theme, the marketing theme, love story theme etc..Seeing this movie made me both slightly worried and also intrigued of how Trevorrow will direct his Star Wars IX. He seems like a capable director, able to handle a lot of stuff including surprisingly working jokes amidst action, but also seems to create a tad violent stuff.Not showing this to my kids yet, but pretty good movie otherwise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Please take my advice and don't watch it because the movie is boring and terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but not epic and amazing,"I am going to start off by saying this movie is much better than JP 2 and 3. It has more thought and effort put into it than those other 2. I went to see this in theaters with my friend and we both agreed it was fun to watch but wasn't anything spectacular like it could've been. Once again though, this isn't a bad film.It is about these kids who go and visit their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the director of the park which is now open and functioning. She decides that the park is losing money because dinosaurs no longer mean anything, so they make a new hybrid dinosaur. Now of course there is a problem and it turns into an action adventure.The acting is actually surprisingly good from most of the actors and they do a pretty well job of reacting correctly in the scenarios they are thrown into. However, unlike the first one, I feel like there isn't as much wonder in this one. That may however be though to reinforce the idea that dinosaurs are now just a regular thing.The CGI is very detailed and intricate with the dinosaurs but honestly looks very fake and easy to tell that they aren't really there.Despite some problems it is still action packed and fun to watch. It is up to you if it is your type of movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nowhere near the first film,"This has got to be the film for which i had the most expectations. There were many rumors about the film getting stuck during the development of plot, the plot being rewritten. Patiently waited for the jurassic park experience for about 5 years. But when i came out of the theater, there was this feeling of disappointment and betrayal. The plot was ridiculous. But who cares!!! This is a summer blockbuster. Action needs to be at its finest. But what we get is dumbass action and tension factor seems to be rare in the film compared to its predecessor. Not everything is bad. Few scenes are exceptional. The background music was below par. The theme of the first film is what you can say made the whole journey memorable.I rather watch the first part again for it is a landmark film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I was wrong. Instead of the usually ,slightly sexist portrayal of a scared woman who gets in the way.This was a portrayal of a scared woman who kicks serious ass!!This movie is visually stunning and a will leave you feeling disappointed that you weren't attacked on the way home by a T-Rex.

What I really liked about this, is that it creates a lot of suspense, and personally I think that those are the best kind of movies that make you want to keep watching or reading and find out what happens in the end. The most amazing that this movie did, was that it totally changed my point of view on sci-fi and how it can really move you especially when it's something that you have an interest in. I definitely recommend it to people who are into dinosaurs, action, and adventure.

Could have a been a disaster... turned out pretty decent.,"A franchise that hit rock bottom with Jurassic Park 3, writers that don't include a Crichton, and a relatively unknown director that's decidedly not a Spielberg... this film had all the markings of a huge disaster. That said, it was actually an enjoyable summer blockbuster. The plot is poor and completely predictable, pretty much a rehashing of Jurassic Park 1 & 2 without the character development or the moralizing, but the acting and the direction were more than passable, certainly far better than the third installment. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were decent with pretty hollow characters to work with. But lets be real, this movie is about the graphics... ferocious dinosaurs on the hunt and that's where this flick makes up for it's shortcomings. Flawless CGI shows off what two decades of technology can do for you. Not that the original doesn't hold up because it does quite well, but its amazing what is possible now. I was hesitant to catch JW in 3D, but ultimately opted for IMAX and glad I did, if only for the scenes with the top down view of the Mosasauraus leaping out of the water to snag its meal. This shot is shown in the trailer but seeing it in 3D is alone worth the price of admission. If you're looking for well made cinema, this film is definitely not for you... but if you're looking for a fun monster flick with eye-popping visuals, Jurassic World will definitely do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,"It really has the passion from the previous movies and it can be even better in the next sequels. If you're a fan you will love it.

The CGI in the movie is beautiful, it gives life to dinosaurs...I don't say that animatronics aren't good, I just response to the haters of CGI. Im just a little disappointed from the species part, I mean that I was waiting to see the dinosaurs that are rendered to site. It was a good chance to expand the park.

The villain (not Vincent D'Offoro's character) is the Hybrid Dino ,Indominus Rex, is cool looking. But it isn't really different than any other Dino.

The actors know how to switch from serious to comedy without much strain and there are hardly any cringe worthy moments from the acting.The 3D effects are good - predictable but good.

Felt like two different movies,"As I say in the title I felt like I was watching two different movies as if they were directed by two different directors. Furthermore I'm not familiar with Colin Trevorrow (the film's director) as I heard this is one of his first films to direct and it shows. The film had a mixture of good and bad parts. Some that take you back to what you loved about Jurassic Park. While others just make no absolute sense. However the good things that stand out are the dinosaurs. Meaning the film did it's job of giving us what we came for - and the dinos are the reason why this film is worth the price of admission. With that I was satisfied but where there is a good side there is a bad side as well. The bad almost out ways the good. First off all the human characters with the exception of Chris Pratt's character were so damn annoying and cartoony. It's been a while since I saw a group of characters I disliked. But there are the characters I disliked more then others. Those would be the children. Oh my goodness, these kids make me want to punch them in the face. You got the generic whinny brat and the know it all jerk. I prefer the kids from Jurassic Park over these any day. But I was however blown away by the end which I won't spoil but it made me feel like a kid again watching Jurassic Park. And it made watching the movie worth while. Now to grade it.

Highly entertaining and a true sequel to the original,"Greetings from Lithuania.After my next words i do believe i will be stricken by a lightning but still here it goes - ""Jurassic World"" (2015) is THE most entertaining ""Jurassic"" movie YET. Before you starting to throw rocks at me, here is the only reason why i think this movie is the best in the series (including the original) - simply because it is superbly entertaining.The first film had a groundbreaking special effects, and the first hour or so was amazing, but when the shix hit the fan, it wasn't so exciting anymore. I always believed the human characters were weak in the first movie, although actors and acting were very solid, somehow for me second part of the movie was simply boring. Yes. Second movie was the worst Steven Spielberg's movie yet, even Steven Spielberg have admit it. The third was OK, better then 2nd by a mile.That said, ""Jurassic World"" should have been the true sequel to the original. It is bigger, louder and more entertaining - everything that a good sequel must have. Special effects in here are truly special, i don't see any movie this year who could steal the best special effects Oscar from ""Jurassic World"" - they aren't groundbreaking, but they are truly spectacular. Acting was very cool, as well as cinematography and very solid directing. Now i kinda see why this guy will helm one of the new ""Star Wars"" movies, which about i was skeptical before seeing ""Jurassic World"".Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is a highly entertaining movie. Best of all is to see it with friends on the biggest screen possible, it is a helluva entrainment, not a perfect one, but the best from this franchise yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Highly Overrated, but Still a Very Fun Dinosaur Flick","Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and is the long awaited sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy, especially after the bomb that was Jurassic Park III (2001). This movie takes place once the dinosaur theme park known as Jurassic World has been open and successful for some time now. However, people seem to be getting bored of dinosaurs recently (we'll talk about that later), so the park manager, a young woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), orders the genetic assembly of the most scary dinosaur ever seen, the Indominus Rex. Once this beast breaks loose upon the island, Claire, a raptor trainer named Owen Brady (Chris Pratt), and Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must try to defeat the dinosaur, while also trying to survive.This film is highly overrated. Coming out of the theater on June 12, the release day, I heard people saying it was ten times better than the first Jurassic Park (1993). Really? Better than one of the best movies ever made? I don't think so. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. This film is actually a very fun movie to watch. I enjoy it a bit more, in fact, each time I watch it. But it's not perfect.The best thing this film has to offer is the mix of special effects and dinosaur action. Every time a dinosaur got into a fight, whether it be with people or another dinosaur, look amazing. None of the special effects look fake at all. All shots of the Indominus Rex look very real, and never look even near bad. This even occurs towards the beginning, before any chaos is even happening . The action with dinosaurs is very abundant as well, and is directed very nicely. All action shots are very clean, and usually wide when CGI was in use.The worst thing this film has to offer is the subplots. One in particular is a certain character trying to militarize Owen Brady's raptors. Yes, there is a character wanting to make soldiers out of dinosaurs. This subplot is completely unnecessary and should've been wiped clean from the script. If this subplot didn't exist, the film would be much better. Another pretty useless subplot is background with the children. Not that the children are bad characters, but the back story with their parents and their home life could've been easily taken out of the film, and Jurassic World would've been better off.Chris Pratt. This man has truly proved himself as an amazing actor, after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and especially now after Jurassic World. There's been a lot of talk of Pratt portraying Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones 5, but I'm truly confident in him being this ever-so-loved character if that's the decision that is made. After the trailer hit, there's been a lot of talk about Bryce Dallas Howard, and whether or not she would do good in this movie. Well, she did. She was one of the highlights, equipped with a major character arc, and good on screen charisma. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson also did rather well, despite their characters not being all that interesting.This leads me into my next and final point, the characterization, especially of Zach and Gray, the two kids. Zach is the older brother of Gray, and actually has a pretty good arc within their relationship later on, but it takes a while for this to fully kick in, and that is a little frustrating. Their background, like mentioned before, is a useless subplot, and could've been removed altogether. However, both actors did pretty good, despite my expectations.Overall, Jurassic World was not perfect, and pretty overrated. However, it was very fun, thanks to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances, great visual effects, and very cool action. Jurassic World deserves a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worse than JP3,"Let me start by saying that I love dinosaurs. As a kid, I would spend hours in the library reading about them and their awesome size and power. I loved the original movie, and I thought its sequel, ""Lost World"" was even better. If you have any respect for those films, do not give up your money to see this movie.First off, it is riddled with extremely ostentatious product placement. The movie opens with a close up of beats by dre. No, seriously. There is a kid with beats on in the middle of the screen for at least 2 minutes. Later in the movie, the heroine is driving an armored truck. What is on the front of said truck? A GIANT Mercedes logo. And those are only two of the many ads in the film.The other major problem is that zero effort was put into writing. Clumsy homages and continuity errors riddle this film. Basically, it bears the name ""Jurassic Park"", but it has the writing of ""Dinoshark"".Bottom line: It's rare that a movie makes me angry, but this one did. (This is coming from a guy that has watched the entirety of ""Titanic 2""). If this film were a standalone, it might be a 4, but such poor execution on a long awaited and greatly anticipated franchise is unacceptable. This movie is thoughtless, eye candy garbage, and its success is setting up equally terrible films for the future.So do yourself a favor. When your friends tell you how great this movie is, nod politely, change the subject, go home, warm up some popcorn, gather up the family, and watch the original or sequel instead.

A pretty solid sequel in a struggling franchise,"This is the first pretty solid sequel in this franchise. Of course, it doesn't stand up to the original, because there are still some flaws with character development, pacing and visuals, but on the whole this is a really fun and exciting movie with a good script and thrilling action sequences.Let's start with one of the biggest successes of this film, its atmosphere. Whilst The Lost World and Jurassic Park III treated Isla Nublar like a haunted house, this film restores some of the wonderment and awe that you felt at the beginning of the first movie, seeing it once again as a park where dinosaurs roam, making this a much more exciting film to witness at first, and leaving its transition into disaster all the more shocking than the previous two films.One of the most interesting things about this is also the fact that it's set in the functioning theme park, Jurassic World, that we all wanted to see since the original. It makes an interesting note on scientific experimenting and capitalism, something not done since the original, whilst the fact that the island is full of helpless tourists makes the threat of the dinosaurs all the more scary.And strangely, this is quite a scary film. Of course, it's nothing to give you nightmares, but the thing that really stands out from this whole movie is the excellent action sequences that are both exciting and destructive, but also tense and patient, much like the classic sequence in the car in the original Jurassic Park.Although the story takes a little bit of a while to get going and should definitely have been cut down, once everything begins to kick off, this turns into a properly exciting film, and it's that stunningly powerful tension in pockets throughout that makes it so, leaving you squirming in your seat as you fear the terrifying Indominus Rex.Let's talk about the dinosaurs, because they are, after all, the reason you want to watch this film. The CGI is fantastic, although I still don't think it's as exciting to look at as the practical effects in the original, but still, they do a great job of giving this dinosaurs a really strong presence on screen, and that main antagonist, the Indominus Rex, is really striking to watch.Finally, the characters are the only disappointing part of this movie. Whilst Chris Pratt does a fantastic job, as well as some of his co-stars, none of the characters are particularly interesting or appealing like some of those in the original, and it's that that decreases the fear factor to some degree.Overall, though, I'm giving this a 7, because it's a properly exciting action movie with patient teasing and powerful tension throughout, and despite some character issues, it's got a strong, intriguing premise that will make for a lot of fun for the duration.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Its time to go back to the island,"Colin Trevorrow helms the newest installment of the prehistoric thrillride started with Jurassic Park in 1993 as we are introduced to a theme park fully functioning on Isla Nublar with reanimated dinosaurs, corporate sponsorship and golf courses. After the comparative disappointment of the previous sequels there may be some trepidation with Jurassic World, but the formula presented is more than effective and really propels the canon rather than pushing it towards extinction.Jurassic World has been open for a decade, the initial failure of Jurassic Park has been forgotten as a wealthy investor Simon Mansari takes over the vision of John Hammond and now has dozens of dinosaurs living in harmony with petting zoos, Sea World style aquatic displays and a very special aviary. But in the face of audience apathy, a new hybrid dinosaur is in development while we see some military interest also threatening to derail the happy harmony of the island theme park. There for the ride are some young brothers on holidays. The overworked operations manager of the island facing declining numbers and balancing ethics with excitement. And finally Owen Grady, a trainer at the park living close with the dinosaurs and concerned about the direction management is looking to take. We already know what's going to go down but ill let that unfold on the screen for you in a very satisfying way.Trevorrow with Spielberg's notes and assistance has created the film that most Jurassic Park fans always envisioned, the successful realization of the theme park that was intended in the original. The detail is incredible. From a Margaritaville and Samsung sponsorship (and product placement) to the laconic employees and administrative back alleys, the creative team have obviously spent a lot of time in theme parks and put to film a world i had to remind myself did not actually exist a few times. Further than that we get shot recreations from the first film, but this time teeming with tourists and then later in the movie some scaring imagery. Jurassic World is a visual smorgasboard and a film worth watching on the largest screen possible.The characterization of the leads in Chris Pratt's Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire are spot on, we are given enough chemistry to keep the plot rolling, their gender balance is constantly at play (with the talk surrounding Mad Max it is likely to be a talking point) as Pratt and Howard take turns supporting each other and while Pratt is held as a compassionate warrior, there is no doubt Howard can do what is required. The only gender stereotype upheld is the oft used trope of a successful business woman in her mid 30's being pressured into a traditional family role by overbearing family or societal concerns. I noticed nobody suggested Pratt needed to settle down, but i digress to a minor cinematic familiarity at this point. The supporting cast is competent, Vincent D'Onofrio is a two dimensional villain, his motives clear from his appearance alone. Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as tech heads play off each other well and BD Wong, Judy Greer and others round out the numbers as needed. The child stars of the film Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are just passable in their co lead performances. For the first two acts of the film, their wooden acting is a distraction and it is only in the third act where their interplay comes to the fore and are enjoyable. Obviously the youth is used to add tension and a wide eyed wonder to the world, but at some point kids in peril need to be able to act for me to not want them eaten at the first sight of danger.The dinosaurs are the stars of the show here as always. With the expanded theme park we are given glimpses of a wide variety of beast as well as the returning favorites in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and more. We are shown baby domesticated Apatosaurus being ridden in a petting zoo, a gargantuan Plesiosaur jumping for sharks like a dolphin at Seaworld and more which would lead us to believe domestication after a decade is the goal. Obviously this isn't the case and even Owen's attempted to coerce the Velociraptor are seen as him still at their mercy despite their bond. The Carnivores are again the villainous focus of the piece, the brutal hybrid Indominus Rex the most savage dinosaur in the franchise yet, cunning and modified to suit its surroundings. The fate of the island is largely uncertain as the movie goes on and this is due to the Indominus Rex's seeming invincibility and cunning. As more dinosaurs are introduced they run the risk of emasculating the image of some for the benefit of others, but a nice balance was played here as each dinosaurs defining skill was broadcast. It is interesting to see if potential future franchise films will be able to top this offering or will have to offer vastly new creations and settings.Jurassic World is an amazingly fun film, I was captivated for the entirely and it was able to provide fear, anticipation, laughs and jaw dropping imagery throughout. I wish Jurassic World was a real thing, as I would enjoy interacting with some Herbivores, but alas, we see the perils of caging such large beasts. Trying to recreate the park wasn't a great idea for the poor tourists who ventured there but making a movie and continuing this monster movie defining franchise was a very good idea indeed. If Godzilla left you underwhelmed and films like Sharknado are just too lowbrow, this is the perfect mid ground of story and visual spectacle that will have you churning through popcorn. A true blockbuster.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great reboot, great film","I love this one even more than I thought. I loved to see that park alive for the first time, I loved to see so many action scenes, I loved to see so many monstrous scenes with big combate scenes and I really like the main cast (yeah, don't care a bit about what Pratt does on his private life), with jokes in the right place and an almost perfect combination of serious stuff and camp scenes.It's the best JP sequel and a fantastic reboot. Missed just a bit of that directorial perfection (Spielberg can create engaging scenes and use the sets like no other) and the teenager was well annoying, but love all the horror scenes. All those people being attacked and eaten alive? Perfect!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well, It's Better Than the Other Two Sequels.","The original Jurassic Park was a technological marvel, but it's not perfect. The internet has brought the numerous plot-holes of the original film to the fore-front, but it still holds up. We can watch that movie and ignore the fact that this supposed hacker genius teenage girl isn't smart enough to not turn off a flash-light that's attracting the attention of an angry T-Rex. We can watch that movie and ignore the fact that Hammond spares no expense in everything, but hires one man to write all the code. We ignore these things because the special effects in that film, hold up to this day. The feeling of terror during the T-Rex reveal scene, still holds up. We forgive the fact that it's not a perfect film logically, because it's still a perfect film technically and emotionally.There's no way of topping the first film. Spielberg couldn't even do it himself with The Lost World, you just can't recapture that nostalgia, and to expect that much of THIS movie is pretty asinine...the best it can do is be it's own clever film that still respects the original.That being said, the film comes pretty dang close. It's probably the most entertaining Jurassic Park sequel thus far. It's not overly stupid like the third film, and not overly preachy and emotionless like the second film. Instead it's just kind of stuck in the middle. There are MANY of good things in this film, but SO MANY missed opportunities.The actors do a good job. Chris Pratt is pretty much just playing Chris Pratt. Vincent D'onfrio is a decent dumb bad-guy. The brothers get a few good scenes and prove to be somewhat capable actors. Surprisingly the best character is Bryce Dallas Howard, she's still a stereotypical character like the others. But at least she goes through some form of an emotional arc throughout the story. She's pretty much the Alan Grant of this film, the only character that changes during the movie. The other characters are pretty much just there to help that character to survive.The big missed opportunity with the film, is the special effects. They're god-awful. Apparently they used animatronics on set, but the entire film looks fake. All the dinosaurs look like CGI cartoons. I'm guessing they ""polished"" the animatronics to make it look more realistic....it didn't. It just looks like the actors are responding to air.So the film failed to be as technologically inventive as the original, but at least the film TRIED to be as emotionally effective. It's not just a bunch of disaster scenes with dinosaurs. It does actually stop and let the characters breath. The action doesn't even start till about half and hour into the film. Everything up to that point is letting the characters explore and showing off the park. Even when the action does start, there's still a rather sad scene with Claire and Owen and a Brontosaurus. But that's not to say there isn't a ton of cool scenes with the Dinosaurs. It does actually try to show-off the coolness of the dinosaurs. The scenes with the Mosasurus is cool, the Pteranodon attack is a blast, and the climatic battle is AMAZING!!! Such a thrill!!!I walked out of the film, satisfied. The special effects are garbage compared to the original. But the actors all do a good job with their stereotypical characters (The original had it's fair share of stereotypes), one of the characters does go through an emotional arc, it's about as logical as the original was, and the film does actually stop and breath and show off the real stars of the show, the dinosaurs.It's okay.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Park Is Awesome, Yet...","It was cool and fun to watch Jurassic World, yet it didn't deliver what I was expecting. I don't want to jump to hasty conclusions, the movie was good, above good, and it has some mesmerizing very well-made sequences and amazing action, but it lacked something... a spirit maybe.Yes, its very heavy on the nostalgia, and yes there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes if you are a die-hard fan, also it's full of Easter eggs, but the awe and wonder were not enough. Some said that Jurassic World is the best sequel since the original, maybe it tops ""The Lost world"" at some parts, but The Lost World has more strength points over it. If you are expecting it to be more then a generic creature film, I think then it is not the one for you.I actually don't know how to feel, and the funny thing is that all the issues I worried about, turned out to be the best stuff in the movie. The I. rex, the semi-friendly raptors, the Apatasaurus head. They even threw a line that explains the scientific inaccuracies in the dinosaurs, now everything is acceptable within the universe. On the other hand, the story had its corny parts, and It lacked depth, there wasn't any kind of scientific debate as to the first 2 movies, nothing at all.The CGI was beyond awesome, settle down all your fears, It's perfect, and works very well on the big screen. Only a couple of moments you may feel that it's a little off. The T. rex, oddly and unfortunately, she was the least impressive CGI in the movie, along with the Ankylosaurus.The animatronic shot was brilliant, I wonder why they didn't use more animatronics, as from what I've seen they seem to have improved vastly over the years. There were many close-ups here, especially for the Raptors, that animatronics would have worked perfectly for, but they didn't go with that option.It will take more than one viewing to really see everything in this imagined little world they have created. The park is open, and yes, the park is awesome, but I think it will take some consideration to fully endorse it.Maybe the long wait raised my expectations up to the sky, maybe this is why I'm a little disappointed... but the one thing I'm sure of, It's that Jurassic World doesn't get anywhere near to the level of Spielberg's original... long live Jurassic Park.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as horrible as some of the past sequels / prequels,"It's a decent Jurassic Park movie that uses a similar formula from the first Jurassic Park.The problem that this movie suffers from that the originally didn't, is that we have seen this type of movie already and not just from Dinosaurs anymore but also from Alien-Machines that turn into Cars, Mutants and let's not forget about every disaster movie that has happened since the first Jurassic Park up until the time of this Jurassic World sequel.Is it bad? No, it's not a ""bad"" movie, he has the same feel and pacing as the first and it doesn't try to be innovative at all really but as it stands people (us) are just not entertained by this genre of man vs. nature anymore and because of that the overall feel of this movie will not be as ""awe-inspiring"".It's still that franchise that can entertain the family though and does it without having to go complete Disney/Pixar. This is the type of movie that a family with kids that have outgrown the cheesy overdone Pixar stuff but a more adult type of feel to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jaw dropping thriller,"This was a great way to continue the Jurassic Park series. It took the dinosaur experience to a whole new level. Inside Jurassic World gave a much closer look to a variety of dinosaurs. It incorporated new innovative techniques such as hologram technology to provide a closer experience in the museums.The velociraptors were ferocious in their usual way. But they came with a twist. Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, was a trainer for the velociraptors. He was able to establish a disciplined relationship with the velociraptors as humans do with dogs. There were a select few commands that Grady was able to teach the velociraptors and receive the desired action. Vic Hoskins, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, wanted to capitalize on this opportunity and militarize the velociraptors. That move was totally uncalled for and took away from the Jurassic Park experience.The Indominus Rex was not anything out of the vernacular. In comparison to the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Tyrannosaurus Rex is still the superior one in the food chain.Other than the attempt to militarize the velociraptors, this movie surpassed my expectations. It is definitely recommended for all of the Jurassic Park fans out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun,"Call me crazy, but I think I've enjoyed this movie ... even more than the first one.Now don't get me wrong. There are no philosophical questions here about nature and playing with DNA. No lesson about how not to force evolution. This is a summer blockbuster and that's about it.It contains action, comedy, mystery, a few good laughs and a few ""I wonder what is going to happen next"" moments.I haven't seen the other Jurassic Park movies (except the original and the 3D release) but if you want an enjoyable movie which is not too deep nor that revolutionary, but well executed, watch it. I just wish that in the next sequel they'll move away from the formula. It would be interesting to see how dinosaurs escape on the mainland, not on the island. For better or for worse, there isn't a lot of tension knowing that they can simply bombard the entire island and get it over with.However, again, this is no Citizen Kane. It's the equivalent of Transformers or Independence Day on a quality level.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic World: Thomas Hardy Reimagined for the 23rd century.,"Let's face it, this is basically just Far From the Madding Crowd with dinosaurs instead of sheep.Think about it. A strong-willed female lead (Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire) heads of to farm in a far off land (a Costa Rican Island Colony) where she initially spurns her first love (the modern shepherd; Chris Pratt as Owen).Then it all goes totally Pete Tong when the sheep (sorry dinosaurs) get a taste for forbidden fruit (hay rigs and barns may not go on fire but everything else does) before spurned lover Owen comes back to save the day. They appear to be about to live happily ever after but their love is not consummated on screen. That Ladies and gentlemen is the story of Far From the Madding Crowd; and of Jurassic World.But it's so much more than this of course.A hilarious romp with many in jokes and nods to the original (Jurassic Park), a brilliant script from Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (and it really is a good script with lots of laugh out loud moments), more than passable central performances and a shed load of brilliant effects with a bunch of real good suspense thrown in.Frankly, it's great.Baaaa.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Massive Nostalgia Hit,"I have very vivid memories of watching the original Jurassic Park back in 1993 and for me it was a landmark film that inflamed my passion for movies. Jurassic World reminded me just how much fun films can be without taking themselves too seriously. After the good but not great Lost World, and the entertaining but muddled JP3, this fourth entry revitalizes the series while remaining true to it's roots, and for once it's a sequel, not a reboot. Are there plot holes? Sure, but who cares when the film is as entertaining as this! Chris Pratt riding a motorcycle with raptors? Oh hell yes!

"The CGI Is Great, But Jurassic Could Have Used a Better Plot","Probably a little bit of a commentary of some kind on the dangers of genetic modification, any such message is very poorly articulated in this film. Children and simple minded teens may find Jurassic World's impressive CGI dinosaurs entertaining, but anyone expecting any complexity in the story-line or beyond-cartoonish characters/acting will be disappointed. If you just want to veg out and see a few man vs dinosaur battles this may fit the bill as well. Certainly Jurassic is watchable, and as usual it explores the possible societal relationships and methods of the dinos in an interesting way. Our involvement with the characters could easily have been improved with more character development and background. Overall though it's a fun if largely mindless romp though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Back to Amber,"Jurassic Park from 1993 was a landmark film that mixed state of the art CGI into a rip roaring disaster film based on the novel by Michael Crichton where the author ripped off his earlier film, Westworld and director Steven Spielberg added some liberal helping from his monster smash, Jaws.The sequels were lukewarm, even Spielberg who directed Jurassic Park 2 struggled to deliver a worthy follow up adventure. Universal Pictures plans for a fourth instalment was on hold for many years until Jurassic World was released to record breaking box office.Here we have billionaire Industrialist Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan) running Jurassic World along the lines of John Hammond's legacy. To bring back dinosaurs to life in a safe environment and visitors to enjoy themselves. However to keep visitor numbers up the park needs to innovate bigger, newer and cooler creatures.Dr Wu (B D Wong who presumably did not get eaten in the first Jurassic Park) returns as a more sinister scientist who has mixed and cooked up new DNA to create Indominus Rex, a dinosaur who is big, cunning and has some kind of superpowers. I can only think that Dr Wu got hold of some Predator DNA from a passing Arnold Schwarzenegger. How the creature escapes from her pen is reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs in the way she fooled her keepers.Bryce Dallas Howard is workaholic executive Claire making sure the park runs efficiently and at a profit. She does not even have time to spare for her two nephews who are visiting the park and staying over with her for a few days.When the IR goes loose in the park its up to Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire armed with high heels to come to the rescue of the kids in peril and the park in general. Owen we presume is a sometimes boyfriend of Claire, A navy seal and dinosaur trainer as he seems to have trained Velociraptors like trained dogs. The same Raptors we have been told in earlier films were ruthless, cunning and effective killing creatures. Now they follow orders leading to a ludicrous side plot of having some independent defence contractor hatching a plan to train Raptors for military use in third world countries.I think Universal is confident that this film will not play in Afghanistan given a region of that country is specifically named in and where its people (already ravaged since 1979 by various wars) would be eaten by the said dinosaurs. I will take this opportunity to remind people I used to gain a dubious pleasure in watching Universal movies specifically to see how long would it be before the black guy died. In fact in the first Jurassic Park, Samuel Jackson did not last long!Now the film is an enjoyable ride, finally we have a functioning theme park with dinosaurs and those scenes look great because part of the movie was actually filmed in a disused theme park. The CGI dinosaurs look good but its noticeable some of the climactic scenes were set in the dark.Directed by relatively newbie Colin Trevorrow who has only previously made one notable indie film directs in an efficient manner but without any of the Spielberg flair (nothing like kids climbing over a fence to escape the dinosaurs but unbeknown to them, the electricity is coming back on.) Marvel Films have shown that these days almost any competent director can shoot a blockbuster action film, after all even that Shakespearean legend Kenneth Branagh has directed a blockbuster superhero film.There is a big problem with the screenplay. Its purely a functional plot lacking in any imagination. It gets to it destination in almost robotic manner. There is hardly any characterisation we know nothing about our heroes except what we can gather from a few broad strokes. Compare this with how we get to know Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough's characters in Jurassic Park, even some of the minor characters were well drawn like Wayne Knight. Here zilch, they are merely to function as heroes or dinosaur fodder.Apart from the preposterous plot about training Raptors for military purposes the whole IR going loose story is based on people entering its pen before determining from its implanted tracker device where the hell she is in the first place.I think Universal is pleased that such a slipshod script has turned out to be a monster hit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Jurassic Park for a Modern Audience,"JURASSIC WORLD is sooooooo stupid. Every situation the characters are in is due to their stupidity or the stupidity of someone else. Remember in JURASSIC PARK​ when there were smart people who found themselves in an extraordinary situation beyond their control? Nevertheless, the fact that there were many moments where I either gasped in awe or terror is a testament to how freaking awesome dinosaurs are and how much we've missed seeing them in almost 15 years. The nostalgia is strong with this one, although some callbacks to the original film feel obvious and cloying.However, the climax is pretty damn wonderful. It's the one thing I can safely say made me feel like a kid again. Additionally, Chris Pratt is great (no surprise there). He's the best actor in here, but it's too bad the supporting characters are either expendable or aren't developed enough. Oh, well.... JURASSIC WORLD ain't no JURASSIC PARK. The CGI is apparent, and there aren't a lot of practical effects (I can count only one scene). It's a film for a modern audience, and I'm not saying that to be cynical. There's literally a scene where Bryce Dallas Howard's character says that outright. Overall, it's a dumb, fun movie for the most part. Just leave your brain at the door because you won't be using it. You'll regret it if you do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Honest review by a regular moviegoer,"I actually spent a lot of my time reading through many of the reviews for this movie after I saw it yesterday. Honestly, I am not sure if some people even know what they want in a movie anymore.Look, everyone has their own taste. But if you are a fan of the genre, a fan of the first three movies, or just a dinosaur fan at all, you will absolutely love this movie. Forget about all these reviewers that thumb their nose due to a ""lack of character development"" or that they needed more ""story"". Those lines are so overused and rarely ever applied correctly. Sometimes I read reviews and I'm not sure if I actually saw the same movie.I refuse to give away any of the movie. You should stop reading about Jurassic World and just go see it. The less you know the better it is.What I can tell you is that this movie is a bit more intense, more so than any of the other three. It is leaps and bounds better than JP3, much better than JP2, and in some ways, even better than the original (better special effects, much more action).The original will always hold a special place as it introduced us to the story, the genre, and set the bar for movie special effects.

A nice surprise,"This movie was somewhat surprising in that I went in having very low expectations. Is it as good as the original? Definitely not; however, it will send you on a nostalgia trip and put a smile on your face. Full of great action sequences and a ton of dinosaurs, both new and old, I'd highly recommend this film! The one con or slight downfall, if you consider it a downfall at all, is the lack of practical effects. Being young and very reminiscent of the original I just felt it lacked something. Although I must say a lot of the computer graphics were used great and helped create this fantasy world, it seemed to lack something and just wasn't the same as having something physically in front of the camera interacting with the actors.

Another Holiday turns To Screamingday,"I went to the best cineplex-theater (multi studio theaters) in my hometown with a lot of expectations. Took me about 14 years after the 3rd (dissapointed) sequel.I though it will be no more another sequel ever since. The movie starts with a Gray & Zach go to Jurassic World,so they can spent their holiday with they auntie Claire who is a somekinda Operation Manager. This JW present some new dino, like Mosasaurus (a gigantic crocodile). And even children can ride some species of dinos.JW even ready to introduce Indominus Rex which can be about 15 metres height.But,then accident happens. And Owen must rally all his abilities to save this two brothers get out alive along with Claire.Among his efforts he neglectly joined ACU team led by Hoskins,which has his won agenda and force Owen to use his raptors to terminate the I-Rex.A)What i really like about this movie is 1. This sequel is a direct plot,straight to the point.To thrill audiens. 2. I love the idea about the hybrid new dino, Indominus Rex which is more clever,more vicious,cam climb a wall,even can change it's skin colors like a chameleon (invisible),so this dino is really lethal.B)What i don't like about this sequel? Actually 1 minor thing. How the hack can you run with your high heels on with a T-Rex behind you. That's what really annoys me.The idea that human finally can take limited control of some raptors is a bit too much,cause scientifically,it tooks minimum 4 generation of human to finally can take limited control on some beast like cheetah. But i can take that.C)The story?A cliché.A holiday turns to be screaming day.But generally,this sequel is really thrilling.When this movie ends, i still keep thinking what kinda new dino will be introduce to us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst scripts ever. Great Special effects couldn't save it.,The kids liked it. Started with an interesting premise. Not a single character was believable on any level. I expect the characters in these movies to be shallow. This was beyond that. The writers seemed to have little care or any appreciation for any of the roles. The movie came across as a series of ideas for cool special effects that were then sledgehammered into place. The plot was a series of bad out- of-character choices seemingly only made to drive this movie from one cool visual to the next. Pornos have more compelling plot lines and character development. Everyone involved in the script should never get work again. Everyone involved in performing in it was clearly doing it for the cash.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Incredibly entertaining, long-awaited sequel!","In short: Jurassic World is an incredibly entertaining, long-awaited sequel. It may not have best best script in the world, but I still had a lot of fun watching it. I don't think it's as good as Jurassic park, but it is a big improvement over Jurassic Park III. It is certainly a must watch.For the curious: Visually, this movie is a massive improvement over Jurassic Park III, in term of CGI, which looks incredible, whether it be the dinosaurs or the environments. Sure a little bit of it looks meh at best, but for most part, the computer generated imagery works well. Colin Trevorrow is also great at the direction, creating lots of tension and suspense to the incredible action sequences, which are also backed up by great set designs. I don't want to spoil the nal ght scene for those who have yet to see the movie, but it is honestly my favorite action scene of the entire series so far, not just because it looks awesome, but it is just so creative, with what they did in that scene.The story line though was completely predictable and few characters like the two brothers show a weak bond towards the main storyline of the movie. Imran Khan had his versatile contribution to the movie. This pretty much sums up the characters in the movie along with the hero and heroine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dumb but exciting and fun,"Jurassic Park is smart, funny, awe-inspiring and includes some of the most thrilling scenes in film history. It's legendary. Though it was followed by two lackluster sequels, The Lost World and Jurassic Park III, they did not take away the magic of the original film. Now, after 14 years, we have a fourth installment.Jurassic World begins by giving us something the other films never did, a fully functioning park filled with visitors from all over the world. Also, unlike the first two sequels, our expectations are brought to an all-new low within the first act thanks to concepts that threaten to spoil what made the first film so iconic. Jurassic Park did for velociraptors what Jaws did for sharks. Both are forces of nature that should never be tamed or trained. Chris Pratt plays a rugged raptor trainer. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the woman in-charge of running the park. Her two nephews, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, are two of many visitors on the day the events of the film unfold. We are also introduced to two villains, Vincent D'Onofrio, who wants to train velociraptors to be soldiers, and a hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex.A hybrid dinosaur and training raptors to be used as weapons for war - it all sounds pretty dumb and it is. As all of this ridiculousness plays out, the original theme music that would play to help build up the most wondrous parts of the first film is over-used and in all the wrong places. Even worse, after the film moves into it's second act and the action has begun, we are forced back to ride along with the boys, who the screenwriters seem desperate to make us care about with an out-of-place conversation about their parents getting a divorce. It's almost as if Jurassic World sets itself up to disappoint, putting the bar so low in it's first hour that it can only be raised in it's second. If this is the trick Colin Trevorrow is trying to pull on us, he is very successful at it.Jurassic World is a complete failure at being smart and frightening. With all the advanced technology and far-fetched concepts, it's hard to feel any sense of reality or familiarity, two essential ingredients in making us feel as if we are in the character's shoes. There are moments where the filmmakers try to startle us but these attempts at jump-scares are so obvious and poorly executed, they fail. What Jurassic World succeeds at is destroying it's own creations. It's only when the character's lives are in danger that they finally come alive and prove their worth. In the end, Bryce Dallas Howard becomes as bad ass as Chris Pratt.Everything new Jurassic World introduces us to twists back on itself and lets us know that we were right all along, they were all bad ideas. A big part of what made us love that first film so much is brought back in the most exciting of ways. The climax is what we've always wanted out of a Jurassic Park sequel. It's dumb but it's also as exciting and fun as blockbusters get these days. It has the potential to make you feel like a kid again, even if just for a few minutes. But, you have to be willing to let it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Money-Grab,"I'll keep this review short and sweet.Jurassic World differs from its respective classic in that it aims to offer the audience some (albeit relatively uninspired) visual spectacles whilst delivering a plot that is somewhat reminiscent of the original Jurassic Park film. However, it fails to execute quite a few favourable ideas that, were they tackled by a filmmaker dazzled not by visual effects or money but by story and character, may have proved Oscar-worthy. Should you see this film? I'll list some pros and cons to help further your decision:Pros: Thrills and excitement typical of the average Hollywood blockbuster. Nostalgia that most Jurassic Park fans might embrace. Satisfactory storyline with satisfactory characters to fulfill it. Visually stunning locations that introduce a sense of wonderCons: Repetitive. Recycled characters who experience recycled story lines. Laughable and/or questionable dialogue that might raise some eyebrows. Intellectual threshold exceeds the film's grasp. Some neglect of Chekhov's gun, in which the film introduces many promising variables that in the end prove to have no meaning.In the end, any film is just a product that some consumers like and some consumers hate. Likewise, the only fair way to critique a film is to see it for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expands from Park to World,"Jurassic World will not win any Oscars.Jurassic World will not be a movie you dissect among critics and marvel at it's hidden meaning.Jurassic World is, however, a fun and entertaining two hours that satisfies every need it creates.There is your typical 3 act presentation; however, the film launches immediately into the world it promises (pun intended) without insulting the viewer's intelligence by attempting to depict an origin story.It's a theme park with dinosaurs. Period. Let's go! Chris Pratt is great within his role. Again, he will not win an Oscar, but he delivers a performance that makes the audience care about the character and his intentions.Bryce Dallas Howard, BD Wong and Vincent D'Anafrio play predictable characters, but ones that are needed to make the story work and make it more entertaining.There are several meta references to the first film which makes Jurassic World feel self aware about it's place in cinematic and franchise history.While this movie is technically a sequel to Jurassic Park, it is better when viewed as a stand alone entry that focuses on the results a dinosaur theme park could have on the world, and not just a park.The movie promises to be fun and exciting while delivering action scenes featuring dinosaurs and peril.It succeeds.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Forgettable,"Although the visuals in this movie are wonderful along with the realistic looking dinosaurs,it is still a forgettable movie when you leave the theatre.The plot is so mundane and boring. The protagonists could be fighting aliens,their military enemies or even King Kong. It is all the same. I kept looking at my watch to see how much longer this movie was.Segments of the film are enjoyable,the music for the most part is moving,but the plot has much to be desired.The acting in parts is very weak aside from the younger boy whom I thought is a realistic young actor.The script was silly especially when one of the theme park tech workers is about to kiss his colleague and she says ""No,I have a boyfriend."" Everyone in the theatre laughed.It was very corny along with much of the script. But the 3D dinosaurs are awesome and fun to watch. I would wait for this film to be on DVD,rather then spend money to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Its like Godzilla but on a lighter note,"After all the anticipation, I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I was a little skeptical of how good it truly is considering Avengers somehow left me a little disappointed/or wanting more. I cant decide between the two. I also had the though the movie will just be another Godzilla movie, which was good but again not like I expected & so today I finally managed to go watch it & ill agree Jurassic World does leave to its hype & it deserves all the glory for beating Avengers in its opening week. The visuals are stunning, it has more humor & isn't as dark as Godzilla. This maybe can be because Jurassic movies tend to target a normal movie goer who doesn't want to think of the complex universe of Marvel or DC with their superheroes. This makes it easy for any one to follow up on the story with a clear mind unlike how we keep creating alternate scenes in our heads when watching something like Avengers (or its just me).

Chaos Theory,"Greetings again from the darkness. I'm guessing that most anyone who enjoys movies and is at least 30 years old, has vivid recollections of Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park from1993. The iconic theme from John Williams, that initial awe-inspiring look at the dinosaurs grazing in the valley, the reminder that ""objects are closer than they appear"" in side mirrors, and the late Sir Richard Attenborough stating that he ""spared no expense"" in creating the park  all merged to became part of an incredibly moving and huge new movie theatre experience. This latest (and fourth in the franchise) offers us ""big"", but very little ""new"", and unfortunately nothing very ""moving"" in its presentation.Set two decades after the tragic and messy park trial run of that original movie, we find Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help) managing the financially-challenged theme park owned by Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi). Chris Pratt is training Velociraptors, while BD Wong is cooking up hybrid and genetically modified monsters such as Indominus Rex – designed to excite the audiences who have become bored with an old-fashioned T-Rex.Even though this is technically a sequel, there are numerous similarities to the original film, and a fun parlor game consists of spotting all the homage's and tributes sprinkled throughout. Two of my favorites are the ""Winston's"" shop in the park, and the ViewMaster shot early on. These two are tips of the cap to Stan Winston and Ray Harryhausen  two giants in the world of special effects.In what has become the Hollywood ""go to"" for evil-doers, the secret plan to militarize the dinosaurs is being carried out by Vincent D'Onofrio. Of course, this clashes with Pratt's ideal life for ""his"" trainees. The mandatory kids-in-peril are played by Ty Simpkins (Insidious) and Nick Robinson. Much has been made of the absurdity of Ms. Howard's numerous scenes of sprinting in high heels, and I found her overall demeanor to be every bit as exaggerated and unbelievable as her actions in heels. Jake Johnson (TV's ""New Girl) and Omar Sy (so wonderful in The Intouchables) were the most ""real"" characters, though neither was given much to do.Much of what is written here is ""in comparison"" to the original. While this may not be fair, it is inescapable when dealing with such a respected and iconic film. Youngsters unfamiliar with the original film, are likely to find this one exciting – even terrifying at times – and that's an important distinction to make. The Mosasaurus alone is worth the price of admission  and good for a few nightmares! And who among us wouldn't pay up for a Baby Triceratops ride in the Petting Zoo?For the Jurassic Park stalwarts, the inconsistent (sometimes great, sometimes fake-looking) CGI will be as tough to overlook as Ms. Howard's cartoon character. And yes, composer Michael Giacchino is new to the Jurassic series, and he is wise enough to work in the terrific and familiar John Williams theme in more than one scene. However, none of the downsides will keep the true fans away, and there is an entire generation of kids who should have the chance to marvel at lifelike dinosaurs on the big screen courtesy of director Colin Trevorrow (previously known for his work on the indie gem Safety Not Guaranteed).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Bigger Better Killer,"We have reached the point where the incredible special effects are becoming mundane. We've seen these dinosaurs attack humans and other dinosaurs before. The new one, a genetically engineered killing machine that has parts of other dinosaurs, is no more remarkable than its predecessors. I didn't see it doing anything more intellectual than any other dinosaur. Once again, the cheap use of vulnerable children is at the center of things. They have been sent to be with their aunt who is a big shot in the Jurassic Park business. She is self centered and insensitive, even when her orders lead to carnage. Vincent D'Onofrio is the heavy, although there are enough of those to go around. Chris Pratt is the take charge guy who has learned to bond with velociraptors. The kids, of course, pay no attention to orders given, and get themselves into a life or death situation. Now everyone has to try to save them. Of course, there is a huge dose of intensity as things go from bad to worse. The two leads who have virtually no personality begin to bond from a caustic first encounter. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's just the same old stuff. There is nothing new here. The other thing. What about all the people who have been killed or maimed? Do our heroes really care? If you want to consider the real world, imagine the lawsuits and medical claims from gross negligence. Not to mention charges of manslaughter. And our red headed heroine would be hung out to dry. Finally, we do need a better, more creative story other than people being assaulted time after time by creatures fifty times their size and somehow managing to get away.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park > Jurassic World > The Lost World > JP3,"In my opinion this movie neither sucks or can be praised as a blockbuster. It's just there and the joy of the movie is in the eye of the beholder. Let me explain: As a monster movie (comparing to King Kong, Godzilla,...) this movie actually looks great and is well worth your time. The action's there, the chemistry between the characters is there, you got a nasty looking Frankenstein of a dinosaur, the scenery is breathtaking and Chris Pratt does more than a decent acting job.However, if you're looking for a good story that makes sense and equals the magic of the original film, them i am afraid that this movie won't float your boat. There are just too many flaws in the story plot and many ridiculous script choices, like for example turning the Velociraptor into pets. And yes it does sound as silly as ""Alien: Resurrecttion"" where they want to turn one of the most feared monsters in human history into a trained pet that obeys commands like a good dog... No matter how they explain it in the movie (with mutual respect for each other), it's still a silly plot choice in the script. Not to mention a genetically modified dinosaur that hunts for sport instead of food, Predator flash-back anyone? My advice: don't put up your expectations too high and just watch it as the first class monster movie that this is, instead of failing to find the magic of the original film in it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi and action packed movie that features dinosaurs : AWESOME,"It has been almost 14 years since the last Jurassic park movie, this movie was expected to be much greater. Now the question is was it that good?When all the previous Jurassic Park movies had almost the same theme and story line this movie gave the theme a new touch. Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (screenplay writers) succeed in intelligently surprising the audience at many scenes.I am here giving you a briefing about the plot (for the viewers who have not watched the previous movies): 22 years after failure of the first dinosaur theme park by John Hammond now the park was rebuild and is well functioning until a new attraction gets out of control and becomes a threat.Apart from the story the roles portrayed by all the cast members was appreciable. But this movie was mostly about the 3-D effects and the more than awesome animation. The story also was well connected and makes the viewer involved for the whole 124 minutes.The only disappointment that I had was it didn't create a lot of thrill that was being expected from the movie or the thrill that could be experienced in the previous movies.So if you are expecting it to be scary and lot thrilling please lower your hopes because this is action packed adventurous film that features dinosaurs.I would say this is a really enjoyable movie with a lot of surprises.

Favotire Film of 2015,"This post contains no spoilers. I'll post a more in-depth (spoilerific) review later:Overall, I love the heck out of the film. I felt that the dialogue, characters, dinos, and plot were all really cool and amazing. I had fun watching the film. I felt that it lead into a possible sequel very well and very unintentionally. The designs of everything in the film were top notch. I haven't seen a better film than this in a long while (definitely since before 2015). I think Colin did right in having the film delayed. The story was better than it could've been if it had been lie that Jonlo leak from last year. I was so amazed that I was stuck in my chair until the end of the end credits.

Jurassic Park: The Reboot,"So, let me first say that... this is NOT a bad movie! I know, most of us were somewhat skeptical about another 4th franchise movie since **ahum** Indiana Jones **ahum** which I refuse to acknowledge exists. But anyway, I also had my reservations and was not really excited for this. But I went anyway without any expectations really.The good:Chris Pratt... I mean obviously. I'd almost watch it again just for him. He's definitely on the right track with his role choices and I hope to see more of him. Great mix of fun and action. Could be the next John Mclane or Indy if he wanted to.Jurassic Park memories. The beginning of the movie, where everything is just fine, you really get thrown back into the whole hype of dinosaurs. It's not on the same level as the actual Jurassic Park era but the soundtrack helps a lot. Still one of my faves.Special effects. OMG, it just all looks so realistic. Very impressed and not too much as would be very ease to go overboard with this.The bad: Story. Bad is not really the best word for it, it's rather safe than bad. If you haven't seen the movie yet but think about what the storyline will be, 9 out of 10 you'll be right. So nothing really out of the ordinary happens, although there are a few WTF moments for sure.Open ended... You all saw this coming right... you have to leave room for sequels if this one makes some dough. And it sickens me... but hey, chewing out sequels just for money is what Transformers are all about so.So yeah, I'm glad I saw it and it's a fun, somewhat brainless, action family movie. If you're gonna see it, do it in a cinema, just to hear the deafening roars!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's actually not as silly as I thought,"OK it still was but there are some very interesting moments. This film is a mix of things, part Spielberg movie, part monster movie and part brainless summer popcorn flick.Let's start off as I usually do with the plot. Let's be honest, the first film had a lot subplots that went nowhere like the sick triceratops, the lysine contingency, the dinosaurs breeding and especially the stolen embryos. Sorry Spielberg fans.Here there is simple albeit a very cohesive plot. The park is now operational for many years but attendance is dwindling so they engineer a hybrid. The hybrid gets loose and chaos ensues. It does get silly however, especially in the third act with the velociraptors.So yeah, lets talk about the dinosaurs. From a technical standpoint, the CGI it....sucks. The first two films had such gorgeous digital dinosaurs because the animators used a lot of computing power to produce altogether 4 minutes of shots. They got the lighting and the physics right and they were only used in wide shots. In this film they are ugly, pasty, floaty and cartoonish looking things. Also they seem to behave more like movie monsters than animals. The velociraptors are supposed to be intelligent, I get that, but its supposed to be in the sense of opening doors and cornering their prey and not in the sense of communicating with Chris Pratt and what happens in the third act.Then the human characters. They are all very one dimensional. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else seems to have a story arc, again something the first film did really well. Chris Pratt is basically Muldoon but he just espouses Legolas like commentary like 'she's killing for sport' which is very insulting to the audience's intelligence. Bryce Dallas Howard is this uptight corporate person who wears high heels throughout the entire movie, even during chases scenes. Vincent D'Onofrio is this military industrial complex guy who wants to weaponize dinosaurs- yeah you read that right. BD Wong who had one scene in the first film returned for a much more expanded role here.Then we have the two kid actors who are supposed to be Lex and Tim. And oh god I hated them. This was one of the more futile attempts to make the film more Spielberg-ish and no, let Steve handle child actors from now on.Among all this silliness though there are unusual flashes of brilliance. What am I talking about? I actually saw some of the themes, motifs and imagery of Michael Crichton's original novel. The original novel went at great lengths to describe unstable systems and chaos theory which sadly the original film just glossed through. In the novel the park was said to be an unstable complex system doomed to fail by Ian Malcolm, then Nedry shuts off the power. In the film it shows Nedry being more or less responsible. In this film its actually more subtle when we hear the guy from Let's Be Cops hint at it and we see the Indominus Rex destabilize the park.Also the death scenes are very akin to Crichton's book. For a PG-13 film there is a lot of blood spatter. However there was this one death that was in very poor taste and I felt should've weighed in on the characters a bit more but no. And that's what I meant when I said this more or less is a brainless film.I still think the movie is pretty silly overall but whenever it goes away from being a Spielberg wannabe and a Michael Bay film, it actually has its moments. It will never be as good as the first film, hell even the second which I actually liked but it more than surpasses JP3 as it does manage to capture the theme of Man vs Nature again pretty well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park IV: Better Than The Third,"It's not really the nostalgia trip I was expecting, but more like a revamped, better version of the third installment of the series. It succeeds at some things that I thought it would fail at, but it also fails in area that are obvious for failure. But the good, it was more graphic and unexpected than I thought. The dino fights were ecstatic and the thrill of the film was right up there. Where it fails, is the complete stupidity of the characters. However, knowing this going in makes the film a little more tolerable and less frustrating.A good film. Not like the original, but an exciting film. Would be better as a non-Jurrasic Park film, but we have it know and should take it as it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sensationalism over sense,"Gone are the days when the Jurassic was an enchanting world of majestic creatures. These are just dumb brutes, the characters even more so. The characters are all a waste of screen time, except that the dinos need some fodder to chase and munch on. If you're a fan or have even seen the original JP1, and JP2, don't watch this. It'll leave you with remorse, regrets and a bad after taste. It is more comparable to JP3 in the lack of either a suspense thriller plot or a grip on story telling.However, if you're in it only for the action, VFX, and some beast on beast action, you may get your fill, because that's where all the money (a lot, I heard) seems to have been spent. Don't forget to switch off your common sense and self respect though, for yet another mindless action 'block buster'.

"Packed with action, but very poor performance from the two kids spoils the fun","This is a good, entertaining movie. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard play their characters very well. The dinosaurs are very scary, and not at all dumb! The action sequences are nice and keep you at the edge of your seat!But, and this is a big one. The movie also tries to be character driven one. And I have to say that the children were way sub par. They have long scenes, blank stairs, and no coherence. The movie builds up over and over again, but whenever the two kids are on screen, it falls short, and takes you out of the hole experience. Very bad acting :(. If the studio would have gone the direction of not so famous kids, that could actually act I think it could have been a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An enigma....,"Ummm, okay, ha....this review may not make sense, but I will give it my best shot...A fun filled action packed adventure for the whole family....that will most likely make you VERY angry.....This film really is an enigma and I can see why some people hate it with a passion....I may need several more viewings before coming to a final conclusion....Basically, it has great set pieces, the dialogue doesn't offend too much and the pacing seems to work....however, the constant stupidity of the characters/theme park operators, the annoying kids with no charisma (unlike the kids from the first film) & the fact that some of the effects look worse than the original done over 2 decades ago (the Pterodactyls were shocking) will have one part of your brain constantly reminding you how stupid this film is....But on the other hand, another part of your brain will get right into it on an entertainment level, especially anything to do with dinosaurs eating people....I think the best way to sum up the feelings for this is....I was rooting for the dinosaurs to win, but I don't think I was meant to, ha....does any of this make sense???? I sincerely hope it does.So, if you can shut off THAT part of your brain, you will probably enjoy it.

Rose Colored Glasses,"I just saw this movie, and upon reading these reviews I'm seeing a lot of people downplaying this movie for hypocritical reasons.First of all: let's get it out of the way that it was an enjoyable movie.I'm seeing people complaining about how repetitive and predictable the plot was, while JP1/2 were superior. Are we suffering from nostalgia here? I think you're remembering these movies in a better light than they actually were. Let's keep in mind that the Jurassic Park franchise was brand spanking new with unbelievable special effects two decades ago; lifelike special effects don't wow like they used to- they're commonplace. Moreover, in the first trilogy the forward motion of the plots/events was almost entirely predicated at every point by someone doing the most moronic thing you could think of for the given situation. That is where the suspense and drama came from in the earlier movies... COMPLETELY by the characters being morons who got themselves in to danger, where otherwise any even modestly intelligent human would not, and narrowly escaping.Jurassic World manages to move the plot without making the audience yell at the characters' for their incomprehensible stupidity.

Masterful sequel. Entertaining and visually exciting,"Remember Jurassic Park? How creepy it was? And original? Okay this doesn't totally match up to the first, but it comes very close. We're familiar with the big beasties but Jurassic World goes one step further and makes humans interact with them. Enter, the rather delectable Chris Pratt as the Raptor Whisperer who - of course - tries to save the day. Possibly more interesting than the earlier films in the series, as it's got more sensible behavioral ecology/science and quite interesting thoughts on the environment and our responsibility in it.Pratt is believable and controlling. He owns the screen. He has good chemistry with the animals (okay they're CGI so that's a bit of a stretch) and co-stars. D'onofrio and Dallas-Howard were worthy of the film and the entire cast did very well - especially the child stars. It didn't have the fear-factor and visceral tension of the first film - nothing will beat Ariana Richards' screaming - and I was a little disappointed not to see Jeff Goldblum as a cameo - but it took the franchise to a whole new level. Amazing SFX - the animals were beautiful. Really enjoyed the film, super-entertaining and a good evening out at the cinema. A big screen film for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It was enjoyable, it kept the spirit of the original, and way better than the abomination and disappointment that was Jurassic park 3.Jurassic world, the 4th installment to the series manages to return to the ways of the original Jurassic Park because it had a story about the theme park being open to the public, yet things go awry with a new dinosaur creation. The only problem I had with this was that the story felt like a modern copy of the original Jurassic Park, there are plot holes, and the first half was clichéd, but it was still fun and worth watching. But the characters weren't really amusing or worth remembering except for Owen, who is easily the best one. The other sequels, the lost world and Jurassic park 3 have barely any connection with this and they were pointless. Like if you watch the first Jurassic park and then watch this, you wouldn't miss any plot points. The special effects are great like other modern day. films by the way as well.

Great monsters. Great action. Great summer fun.,"""Something is wrong. They're communicating."" Barry (Omar Sy)In any other context, communication is the cornerstone of prosperity and progress, for humans anyway. But when the dinosaurs in Jurassic World are accused of communicating, it is a formula for mayhem. Control is the operative metaphor in that world, and as we're reminded more than once, complete control doesn't exist, most of all when you're playing in Mother Nature's backyard.And so another summer comes with blockbusters pandering to our primal fears of death, for surely this fourth iteration of Jurassic Park (22 years—a millennium of evolution in Hollywood terms) is a child of the others, about survival for humans and animals. The real enemy is not even our brutal inclinations but rather the corporate expansionism that promotes aggression leading to mayhem. As scientist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who has lost his humanity, says to a corporate financier (Irrfan Khan), ""You wanted scarier."" The actual word in his memo,we are reminded, was ""cooler."" Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) says, ""Every time we unveiled a new attraction, attendance has spiked."" Ain't that the truth for these summer scare-a-thons as well? Claire, a career park manager, in her perpetual high heels and self-absorbed ambition embodies the dangers of insensitivity driven by selfishness.Jurassic World makes fun of itself promoting even more exotic summer fare that begins with creating a fiercer tyrannosaurus to meet the excessive expectations of a growingly literate summer audience. ""Bigger, louder, more teeth"" is the corporate mandate.Even with the multiple incidences of obvious green-screen shots and hokey setups, Jurassic World remains steadfastly respectful of Steven Spielberg's—he's exec producer here—plan since Jaws: Let the monster bond the families, who together face the ultimate fate and are better for the scare. The attack of the pterodactyls on the visitors reminds us how much Spielberg adores movies like Hitchcock's Birds.The less we see of the creatures, the more suspense we get. While we see more of raptors and rexes than Spielberg's minimalism allowed decades ago, director Colin Trevorrow keeps the emphasis on the evolution of the familial and social bonding rather than raw rapaciousness.""I can't wait to tell my mom about this!"" Gray (Ty Simpkins). The boy's exclamation at seeing an enhanced T-Rex pretty much sums up my feelings about this garden variety summer blockbuster. Regardless how many CGI monsters we see, bringing back Steven Spielberg's nightmares, be they Jaws or Jurassic, appeals to the wonder of kids and the kid buried in our jaded adult hearts. Survival is still the name of the ancient game.""What do you want?"" Claire asks donors-to-be. To the response, ""We want to be thrilled,"" she says, ""Don't we all.""

"Dinosaurs Top,  the Plot is a Flop.","After a feeble opening, the movie slowly turns into a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game (the people are the mouse in this game) until it ends with a fulminate dinosaur smack-down.When you're impatiently waiting for the disaster to happen so that finally the dinosaurs can take over the park and by that drive the plot into a basic run-for-your-life theme than it's a clear sign that all the blabbering in between is just an unexciting postponement of the inevitable carnage that follows and therefore just redundant.This sequel is so uncreative that it's actually a remake spiced with more violent horror elements and the latest 3D technology.The characters are all fulfilling stereotypical roles, there is not one really funny line, the only halfway unpredictable behavior comes from the dinosaurs, nevertheless the movie relies on the sensationalism of the audience who much like the visitors of the park are seemingly satisfied with the premise: ""It's roaring, it's big so it gotta be good!""What really intrigued me were the new dinosaur villain, the sea monster and the nasty pterosaurs which caused some thrilling incidents.4/5 pts. for action and effects. 2/5 pts. for story, inventiveness and drama/fun. total rating: 6 pts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jurassic World left that unexplained, but I had two hours of good entertainment. Every scene made me eager to know what will happen next.

"Entertaining and Thrilling, even if it doesn't reach the same heights as the Original.","""Monster is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.""We finally get to go back to Isla Nublar after all these years (22 to be exact). It is a given that creating the same feel and magic of Jurassic Park is impossible. SO instead of just trying to recreate everything and doing it in a lesser way, director Colin Trevorrow went with a different approach and it actually payed off.Jurassic World takes place 22 years after the events of the original film. A new park after the events of the original film, on the same place, was opened and has been functioning for 10 years. They create a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction but everything goes to hell when it gets loose.Now, I had somewhat low expectations going into the movie and while it wasn't as good as the original, nor did it had its magic and feeling (obviously), it turned out to be a whole another entertaining ride. The movie did a good enough job of paying homage to the original. Couple of scenes had the awesome John William's original score and they just had this very nostalgic and awesome feeling to it. I just wished they used more of it, and some of it in a better way.Chris Pratt was great as the lead. This guy just has a natural charisma about him and the character he played was likable and badass. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard character as well. She seemed like a typical corporate emotionless being at first but actually developed into something likable. Another thing that was surprising was that the KIDS DID NOT ANNOY ME. Something that rarely happens in movies. Their brotherly bond stuff went fine with the movie. Other characters were either OK or a huge miss.As mentioned earlier, the director went with a different approach. The movie was more of a summer blockbuster monster film, with some of the Jurassic Park elements to it. Many fans might be disappointed by this fact but I was fine with it. Better to have a generic/typical entertaining film instead of a lame recreation attempt.The greatly teased indominous-rex, the hybrid dinosaur, was awesome. The movie did a great job of showing it as this unstoppable monster science and corporate greed created. It was smart, it was ruthless and it was what a monster should be like. The raptors, which have always had huge importance in Jurassic Park franchise, were yet again great here. The whole training them scenario was risky and I didn't know what to expect from it but the way movie handled it was really pleasing. The dinosaur scenes ranged from good to great, with the finale being OH SO SATISFYING. Seriously, my inner dinosaur/Jurassic Park fan was screaming with joy in the last 10-15 mins.The CGI was mostly great. There were some inconsistencies here and there but they weren't that distracting. The soundtrack, apart from the original's, wasn't that great or unique or memorable though.Now the movie definitely had plot issues. I mean the whole idea of creating a hybrid dinosaur because the park is losing its spark sounded really absurd. Also, there were some really stupid moments, created for the convenience of moving the film forward, where you just can't let it slide. Also, the movie had this synthetic feel to it in a lot of scenes. I guess it was because of the lighting and too much use of CGI. It didn't had that gritty and naturalistic feel of the original.All in all, the movie had its quirks but I still had a good time with it. It was entertaining and thrilling, just like how a summer blockbuster should be. Whether you're a fan of the original or just wanna have a good time, this is a must watch.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Same sweet in a shiny new wrapper.,"Visually immaculate and emotionally flawed!!!By no means is this the worst sequel of a loved franchise that I have ever watched, it does however leave me with an underwhelmed sense that we still haven't experienced a worthy tribute to the original masterpiece.Perhaps nostalgia has elevated my expectations and rendered any continuance of the series inferior. Having said this, a praiseworthy translation of a follow-up movie I believe is achievable. To date we have not witnessed characters who inspired as much empathy as the combination of the original cast and I feel that no amount of SGI can fill that void.Despite the above, the SGI is outstanding at every turn and offers some distraction from the aforementioned negatives. I would urge any curious individuals to watch this film purely to be visually astonished. However, if you're a fan of the original then I would advise lowering expectation in regards to being drawn into an emotionally journey.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Exciting, and more consistently entertaining than the original, though less subtle","Jurassic Park was a terrific movie once it got going, but people comparing it with the Jurassic World reboot seem to have forgotten the tedious, soap-operish story that dragged down the original. JP followed a pattern I always associate with The Birds; throw us into the tedious entanglements of uninteresting people until we're almost asleep, then start the mayhem.There is very little soap opera in Jurassic World, and most of that comes in brief spurts later in the movie. The film begins by establishing how incredibly cool Jurassic World actually is, with charming scenes at a dinosaur petting zoo and a dramatic giant-fish feeding that made me feel like I would really, really like to go there. One also sees where things are going to go awry, although the score never telegraphs those moments, sounding perpetually chipper even when you're thinking, that's not going to turn out well.While JW doesn't subject viewers to the degree of pure tedium that JP did, it's still a movie that doesn't really take off until things go wrong. Once they do, the movie becomes a series of big, wild dinosaur disasters that keep getting bigger as more and more people die.While this is exciting, by the end it feels as though the movie is a bit too focused on making things big. JW has a lot of excitement, but the original JP had more suspense. JP was a movie that understood waiting for the right moment; JW believes the moment is RIGHT NOW.There's also some sort of story with Chris Pratt as the guy with sense and a bunch of other people without any, including a greedy owner, a military guy whose ideas are so ridiculously poorly thought out that even a cartoon villain would say, ""maybe you should take a minute to think this through,"" and an executive who gets to run around the jungle in high heels. Her character has been called sexist, and I can see why, but I would say that this comes as much out of a lazy reliance on character clichés than anything else. But what I like about this movie over JP is that it has far less interest in its characters. It knows that all anyone cares about are the dinosaurs, and it delivers those beautifully.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Seen it before,"My Critic / Review of Jurassic World. 6/10 For following reasons: Not nearly enough ""Jump Scares"" Not nearly enough Dinosaur Action / Killing / Carnage To much politics and talking So much content taken from Earlier Movies, even though it happens in the same world just later.

A mixture of comedy and action,"It feels that the movie has been targeted for family audiences – there is nearly no graphic violence in the movie which is a bit strange considering there are hungry (and angry?) dinosaurs.'Jurassic World' reminded me of 'Martian' – episodes that should have had tense and thrill are dumbed down with jokes and humour. It feels like nobody is ever scared. There is not a single moment in the movie when you are actually afraid for any of the characters.It's a perfect, cheesy, Disney-style commercial movie. All relevant deaths can be counted using fingers of one hand, and thorough preparations (justifications for their deaths) have been included in the script. If somebody dies – you have been shown multiple times that this was a bad person. No good guy gets spared, basically.Having said all that, the cinematography is pleasant and the movie can be enjoyed once for sure.

"Good kids movie, not so good for adults","Firstly I will say that this is a good movie for kids. If you have a kid definitely let them see this movie as they will be completely enRAPTORed (sorry). I can definitely see that.As an adult you may have a different opinion. It starts like a TV movie with parents sending their kids off to the Jurrassic World errm park.One of the kids is inexplicably completely bored with the idea of seeing any dinosaurs...it's like wise up, they've only been extinct for millions of years.The CGI looks a lot better in the dark than in the light, but this is true for any current movie.The characters are all lacking the emotional depth and humour that made the first film so endearing. Chris Pratt is fine but basically just plays an obnoxious loudmouth with little likability. Bryce Dallas Howard's character is so under-developed - I swear her script probably ran for less than a page and all it said was 'Sigh' here and 'Gasp' there. The two boys are fine, if not a bit annoying.What, incredibly, is something that is completely lacking is that there are no moments of tension or anticipation AT ALL. If you think about the original when the ripples in the water gave the sense of foreboding doom and how much this added to the whole atmosphere of the film it's unbelievable there's absolutely nothing like this in this film.Some of the homages to the original are good but all in all I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nowhere Near As Bad As It Could Have Been.,"Twenty two years after Jurassic Park had opened, a new improved fun park opens, superior in every way to the previous, but it also harbours a new genetically created hybrid of a dinosaur with intelligence that breaks out and causes chaos, death and destruction. Initially I feared the worst and for the first fifteen minutes that fear was founded. The opening sequences are to put it mildly, awful. After that however the film is a big roller coaster ride, it is not a remake, it does have respectful references to the original. Yes, it's contrived, very much so at times, but it has some exciting and well done sequences. For me it was on a par with the first two films and a vast improvement over ""Jurassic Park 3"".

Why there is something to like for a ten year old that went with his mom.,"I liked this movie and why? I have a ten year old son that has been a dinosaur boy from the age of four.

I have also watched with him several times JP 123. He has been waiting (not so patiently) for this movie from the moment he heard of it because this dinosaur-thing I thought was finished awakened.... He loves this movie, there are new monsters and old fellows there, bit of blood and the good part are the four velocirapters. This is most defiantly a movie for all those ten year old dinosaur/fiction fans out there.

"Solid summer blockbuster, solid reboot of franchise, but essentially a repeat.","For those of us born at a certain time in the early 1990s, ""Jurassic Park"" was THE coolest movie of that era for kids who loved dinosaurs. Its groundbreaking visual effects and life-sized animatronics made it a very believable scare fest.Fast forward 22 years, and you've got yourself something that's good, but not quite ""Jurassic Park"" good.Our story begins at essentially the same part of the first movie about half and hour in; everyone who works at the newly built, polished, and open to the public for several years now Jurassic World park believes their system to be foolproof, the eccentric head investor wants what will wow the kids regardless of wisdom, and only one man recognizes the powder keg they are on: Star Lord.That is, Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt. An ex-Navy officer who now trains Velociraptors to respond to commands, is brought in to inspect the holding pen of a newly created genetic hybrid predator. The park staff, including the park operations manager Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, believes that the new Indominus Rex to be the next big thing.However, like Ian Malcolm in the first film predicted, ""Life will find a way.""

Solid way to reinvigorate this franchise.,"Jurassic World was a great way to reinvigorate this film franchise. The first two were incredible but the third film left a sour taste in most people's mouths so this movie had a lot on its plate. If it flopped it would've certainly been the end to this franchise for a long time until years down the road Hollywood gave it the inevitable remake treatment. However, if it succeeded in delivering a quality product that fans would enjoy, the sky was the limit. Well, lucky for us fans, it delivered a really good film. With regards to the cast, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do a great job as the male and female lead counterparts; Vincent D'Onofrio once again takes the role of the villain and he does so masterfully; Jake Johnson provides great comedic relief throughout the film (maybe too frequently to be honest); to be frank, the only weak part of the cast were the two child leads. In what has become an unfortunate cliché in this franchise, children were given too large of a role and they couldn't deliver the necessary emotions. The first film got lucky there... more often than not, banking a large portion of your film on the capabilities of child actors is a mistake. Thankfully this was not a movie entirely reliant on acting so it wasn't a grave error but trying to emulate the magic of the first definitely hurt the movie a bit. The film also failed to deliver quite the same edge-of-your-seat thriller experience that the first two did. A lot of that had to do with any sense of unknown being eliminated almost immediately. In the first movies, you rarely caught a glimpse of the ""villains"" (T-Rex or the Raptors) during the build-up of the suspense. This helped create a certain tension that really captured you. This movie doesn't manage to do that at all. Instead, Jurassic World is an action movie that has dinosaurs, humor, and solid acting. Essentially it felt like a 21st century superhero movie but instead of Iron-Man or Captain America it had Velociraptors and an Indominus Rex. The problem is, it shouldn't be that type of movie at all. Nonetheless, the action, the nods to the original film (which was probably my favorite part of the movie), and the dinosaurs devouring people makes this worth the price of entry. Just don't go in expecting it to building on the originals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just Plain Terrible - Please Pay A lot to See Garbage,"Ugh! Awful movie.

Only actors to save face were Pratt and D'Onofrio. Pratt's part was so underwritten it could have been played by pretty much any actor (at least he seems like a decent person in real life). The part called for being stoic. That's it. Not even any Bruce Willis- type ""Die Hard"" lines. Terrible, terrible dialogue - embarrassingly so. Bryce Dallas Howard's part was so poorly written and clichéd (the writer seemed to be pretty misogynistic in light of how every woman in the movie was portrayed) and she obviously was directed to ham it WAY up. I wouldn't be surprised if this killed her career (I hope not, she's done terrific work in so many other films - but, in this one, she truly was awful). Spielberg should be ashamed at producing or having any involvement with this garbage - as bad if not worse than any piece of trash I have seen from Michael Bay.

A thrilling revival of the (pre)historic franchise that's only missing that connection,"When it comes to ""Jurassic World,"" critics will be damned. To date, the film has grossed more than $1.4 billion worldwide, good for fifth most all time, so nothing anyone was going to say could influence the desire to watch this highly anticipated return to Isla Nublar and the world first created by Steven Spielberg. Why audiences were so eager, however, is in ways more intriguing than the film itself.From the trailers, nothing about ""Jurassic World"" appeared to be novel — the park was rebuilt, and now something bigger and scarier than a T-rex has gotten loose. So that suggests the film was an exercise in nostalgic thrills, the excitement of the big bad dinosaur running amok that inspired studios to produce countless '90s and 2000s monster-driven blockbusters. And to that end, ""Jurassic World"" succeeds.A long 14 years since the failed ""Jurassic Park III"" and more than 20 years since the original adventure, enough time passed to build up this franchise's novelty value, a wisely calculated move by Universal Pictures to be sure. Although ""Jurassic World"" doesn't inspire awe and wonder in the same way ""Jurassic Park"" did, it feels refreshing to return to the franchise's overall aesthetic.Entrusted with created the ""dinostalgia"" is director Colin Trevorrow of the indie sci-fi comedy ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" and screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver of the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" prequels. While Trevorrow must simply keep the thrill and pulse of the film alive and throbbing, it's Jaffa and Silver who must create a captivating story that stays true to the formula of ""Jurassic Park.""Jaffa and Silver were an ideal choice, having taken a previously bygone franchise in ""Planet of the Apes"" — not to mention one focused on animals and humans — and surpassed all expectations with the quality of storytelling. ""Jurassic World"" has plenty of compelling moments, effective suspense and a strong sense of danger — it's the character development that's lacking.Not that anyone remembers ""Jurassic Park"" for the characters, but ""Jurassic World"" can't lean on the ""wow"" factor in the way the original could. The main characters comprise an undeveloped mess of two boys, the park director and a dinosaur trainer. All the lovable charisma of Chris Pratt, who gets top billing as the man who has tamed velociraptors, can't save the two- dimensional Owen despite getting all the big reveal/epiphany lines, and as a selfish stick of a character, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire takes a long time to warm up to. Yet neither is the movie entirely about the two young brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), trying to survive. Their troubled home life and fraternal bond gets shoved into a film much more concerned with its dinosaurs.All of these flaws feel irrelevant until the story loses a grip on the suspense it so effectively builds in the first act and most of the second. In fact, there's a quiet moment amidst the chaos of pterodactyls descending upon hapless park tourists that marks the beginning of the film's unraveling. Something happens that proves the film has a poor perspective on its characters and it betrays the credibility of the story in a really unfortunate way.From that point on, ""Jurassic World"" finds a few nice plot twists, but devolves into your typical mindless blockbuster rather than an extraordinary or noteworthy one. You can sense its desire to be the biggest and most epic ""Jurassic"" film rather than holding onto the simplicity that made the original so great — that opened up a sense of wonder, fear but most importantly, curiosity. That's where the heart of Spielberg's film (and so many of his films) comes in, and ""Jurassic World"" never strikes those chords.The most obvious candidate for a sequel since ""Avatar,"" the franchise can only succeed in this way going forward the with a focus on Owen, filling in all that was missing in his back story and giving Pratt a chance to actually shine with the talents he has. That, or wiping the slate clean and giving the new faces a chance to connect more with this exciting world of ""Jurassic Park.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

"My favorite Jurrasic Movie so far. Even better than the original, IMO.","I live in Taiwan, and for some reason, movie's always open a few days before the rest of the world.My wife and I just watched this movie in the theater, and it blew us away! Granted, we weren't really expecting that much in the first place. I was thinking it'd be along the lines of Jurassic Park 3, a non-sense, BS cash grab movie. But not at all! It clearly explained, why Jurassic World exists even after all the terrible mistakes of Jurassic Park. After 22 years, the public has pretty much forgotten everything, and they just want to be shocked and awed at HUGE dinosaurs.I don't want to explain the plot, because the trailers pretty much sum everything up. But I'll address my concerns going into the movie: 1) The boys.. The parents that just tell the boys at the airport, ""If anything chases you, just run!"" sarcastically. - They weren't nearly as bad as any of the previous children's characters in Jurassic Park movies. I was worried it was going to be a whole bunch of crying and screaming and near death experiences with dinos, only to be saved by some freak accident at the last possible second... And it's not nearly as bad as that. They served a purpose in the movie, and never left me shaking my head in disbelief.2) Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's on screen chemistry. There was one trailer that shows a clip of them talking by Chris Pratt's Bungalow. And in that clip, they seemed stiff and unnatural. - For whatever reason, in the actual movie, their chemistry was great! Even that scene played out super naturally.. So I don't know.. Maybe it was weird cut in the trailer, or taken too much out of context.. But yeah, they were both great in the movie! Chris Pratt is badass the entire movie. He killed it.The 2nd half of this movie, my jaw dropped, and stayed open. Even though you probably have a pretty good idea what's going to happen from the trailer, watching the ending was still a super shocker and surprise for me.

The two sequels offered dismally diminishing returns, culminating in the shark-jumping raptor-chat of part III; so the sight of Starlord hunting with a pack of pet dinosaurs in the trailers for Jurassic World did not bode well. What did bode well was something that's been surprisingly overlooked in the series up to this point: The presence of an actual, functioning dinosaur theme park.This instalment returns us to Isla Nublar for the first time since Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking first film. Indeed, Jurassic World unashamedly uses the original movie as its template and sole predecessor. A wise move... on paper, at least. This time our Alan and Ellie are Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard; the kids are Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson); the Hammond role goes to Irrfan Khan as rich boy Masrani; and the new Nedry is Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio).The Jurassic Park incident has been buried, and Jurassic World has been operating without incident for years. But the visitors are bored and want bigger, louder, toothier. So Henry Wu (B D Wong, the only surviving cast member from the first film) creates Indominus rex, a genetically-spliced monster which basically amounts to a T-rex with less dinky arms. Suffice to say, a breakout is imminent. The kids get lost in the wild and Owen and Claire head out to save them. Meanwhile, Vic senses an opportunity to do the Weyland-Yutani thing and seize the dinosaurs for use as weapons. Good luck with that.Obviously Indominus rex embodies the idea that the entertainment industry constantly needs bigger 'n' louder products to keep the dollar signs rolling. It's a flash of satire but really it amounts to a, like, totally awesome new monster smashing stuff up. Relentlessly. Boringly. Jurassic World ruthlessly indulges what it seeks to satirise. It criticises corporate logic yet is just as disingenuous and bloated as any other Marvel-ised multiplex factory product. It smashes up its gift shops but has the depth of a plastic toy. It would leave a bad taste if it weren't so tasteless.Director Colin Tevorrow's previous credit was Safety Not Guaranteed, and Jurassic World serves as a lesson in why you don't hand the reins of a big budget behemoth to an indie guy. The direction is static and lifeless. The action is adequate but rendered tame by a staggering absence of tension-building. Visceral setpieces are connected with floss. The dialogue is as thudding and clunky as a brachiosaurus with a club foot. It took four people to write this trash – I wonder if the legal wrangling over the screenplay credits was to take their names off the poster.The characters are dull cardboard cut-outs. Pratt is stolidly sincere as the ex-Navy jock who starts and ends as a badass. Dallas Howard channels Lindsey Brigman from The Abyss as tight-ass Claire – but even Lindsey got to loosen up and take her heels off in the end. The kids... who knows? I guess they're meant to represent the indifference of youth, which as an audience experience translates as indifference as to whether they live or die. Then there's Masrani, who starts by criticising Claire for chasing the dollar and moments later gives the non-lethal order because the rampant dinosaur cost him X million bucks. Bad, bad writing.It's not just the words that sound lame. Michael Giacchino is occasionally hailed as the new John Williams, yet the only notes of distinction in his score are those of Williams himself. There's a great moment early on when young Gray swings back the balcony doors and we see the park and that music soars... But it's a false dawn, as we're subsequently lumped with scene after lumbering scene scored with indistinct music which sounds like it was 65 minutes in the making.Whether we can and whether we should were the Big Questions posed by author Michael Crichton. The reason the original story was so potent is because it took a distant scientific possibility and brought it intriguingly into a plausible reality. That's science fiction, folks, and that's why a single shot of a lagoon could produce such wonder and awe.But tantalising possibility is not drama enough anymore, it seems. Today we are at a point where anything is possible with CGI so the tendency is to throw everything at the screen. And in this new World, by the final reel, with its risible monster mash showdown, you realise everything has been thrown and nothing has stuck. As a work of storytelling it's as vaporous as dino-breath on a window. As a JP sequel it's just as bad as the others. Maybe it's time to close the doors on Hammond's glorious vision. It just isn't working out.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Chris Pratt and his raptors might be enough to save the franchise,"""You just went and made a new dinosaur? Probably not a good idea.""This review of Jurassic World is brought to you by Mercedes Benz and classy high- heel running shoes. After the success with his sci-fi indie film, Safety Not Guaranteed, Colin Trevorrow was given the reigns to direct the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. With the help of his collaborator, Derek Connolly, he co- wrote the script based on Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver's story. It was a pretty risky move considering Trevorrow hadn't worked on a big budget film before, but with all the product placement included here you can tell he was probably very restricted and controlled by the executives. But I'm not going to complain about that because if you think about it Jurassic Park also had tons of product placement and that is one of my favorite blockbuster action films of all time. Jurassic World tries to pay homage to the first film ignoring most everything that happened in the sequels and once the dinosaurs are set lose it succeeds in doing so. The set-up was probably unnecessary and by far the weakest part of the movie as most of the characters here were uninteresting and we could've done without the introduction of so many of them. Fortunately Chris Pratt shows up soon enough with his domesticated raptors and saves the movie from derailing entirely from its rather stupid plot. He's the new Indiana Jones and he can make the dumbest screenplay seem cool and entertaining. He delivers the perfect amount of comedic relief and has some great actions scenes to carry the movie. The dinosaurs are spectacular as always and there were a couple of thrilling scenes, although Michael Giacchino's score never matches the brilliance of the original (there is a cool piano cover of the original Jurassic Park theme however that delivers plenty of nostalgia to fans). Jurassic World doesn't live up to the high standards set by the original which was a masterpiece, but it's as slightly satisfying a sequel as the rest of the films in the franchise. I wouldn't go as far as saying it is better, but Chris Pratt does make it a lot easier to enjoy.So Jurassic World is set some 20 years after the events of the original film. John Hammond's vision of a dinosaur theme resort has been functioning for over a decade now in Isla Nublar. Unfortunately the attendance rates in recent years has been dropping as the enthusiasm and novelty of seeing these live beasts has died down a bit. The owner of the resort, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), has ordered his scientists to genetically engineer a bigger and meaner dinosaur knowing that this will spark more interest. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of organizing and managing the park and one of her responsibilities is making sure this new dinosaur remains contained. Simon asks her to talk to Owen (Chris Pratt), one of the on-site staff members who's in charge of conducting behavioral research on Velociraptors, and ask him to give his opinion on the safety of the creature's new home. Owen had no prior knowledge of what these scientists had been doing and is not happy about the management's decision, but before he has time to do anything the creature escapes and now they must alert the thousands of people who are at the park that a dangerous dinosaur is on the lose. Claire's nephews, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson), happen to be visiting the park and of course they don't pay attention to the warning and are left stranded near the danger zone. Claire asks Owen to help her find them and thus the thrills begin.There are several other characters in this film that aren't given much depth. It's a shame because a talented cast including Vincent D'Onofrio, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Judy Greer are entirely wasted. Johnson has some fine scenes and it's cool he got to wear a Jurassic Park vintage t-shirt, but his character didn't have much to do really. The entire plot revolving around D'Onofrio's character felt recycled from the first sequel and was quite silly. Omar Sy, I love him, but he wasn't given anything remotely interesting to do. The two kids in this film are as exciting as watching two brothers who don't get along. I've already said that Chris Pratt is the saving grace of the film along with the dinosaurs, but he also has some great scenes with Bryce Dallas Howard as well. She's perhaps the only other redeeming character in the film although at times it felt like she was trying too hard to be Jessica Chastain. It's kind of hard to feel that same level of suspense we all got from the first film when there aren't many characters to root for here. Fortunately the film doesn't take itself too seriously and it ends up being a lot of fun and the less you sit down to think about it the more fun you will have watching the dinosaurs hunt down the visitors. I think that Trevorrow knew the premise was silly and used the genetically engineered dinosaur story as an allegory as to what the audience wants from a sequel: They've already seen the dinosaurs and are getting tired of them, so why not give them a more threatening one, and so he did.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I wasn't moved.  But your 14 years old will like it,"It is well done, long and not composed.It doesn't have the suspense of the Spielberg touch. It doesn't have the pleasant and catching story of a Spielberg movie.The animation is good but somehow one notch below the last King Kong movie.It has violence and several violent sudden explicit deaths. Quite more so than previous Jurassic movies. Not for a 10 years old girl to see it.I would rather see it on DVD and skip the long and boring parts.I think it's a flop given the advertising and the expectations. I'm going to wait for Star Wars but I'm afraid I have to learn that good things in the past cannot be revived as easily as the bad ones :(",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pet the Dinosaurs,"8 of 10. Solid action/monster/horror/sci-fi film all by itself regardless of whether it's a sequel. Starts out as a sort of zoo visit where you watch cute people pet the exotic animals. All very cute. The more fitting, and maybe too misleading for the film as a whole, would be Jurassic Pets.Just when it seems everything is contained and cute, you realize you may be watching a more realistic prequel or actual Godzilla (2014) film, which was good but dependent on more science fiction stretches than this.What it adds to the Jurassic series is more realistic, as mentioned pettable/touchable, dinosaur visual FX and a more realistic follow-up to the original film, especially one taking place 20 years later. It doesn't ignore the original, but rather embraces it and integrates what happened there into the story. It also adds the missing sea/ocean dinos and some believable technology to observe and run with dinosaurs. The adult relationships are also more complex/realistic than the original (though also some unnecessary melodrama). Finally, the key aspect, genetic engineering of the dinosaurs that leads to the dangers, monsters, and action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hey man, I only work here!","'Jurassic World' is one of those movies which is a lot more enjoyable if you don't think about it too much. If you convince yourself to ignore the plot holes, the woman who sprints in high heels and the complete absence of Jeff Goldblum, it's loads of fun. It's two hours of popcorn munching spectacle, full of Dinosaurs ripping people apart and pulse pounding set pieces. It's not as good as the original, but it surpasses both 'Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III' to stand as the superior JP sequel. You'll be riveted to the screen constantly and it'll only be a day or two later that you realise how many cracks there are.Set twenty years on from the original, 'Jurassic World' sees John Hammond's dream as a reality. The park is now fully functional and incredibly successful, with attractions ranging from gyroscopic tours through fields of herbivores to the childish joy of riding a baby Triceratops.According to the people in charge however, this isn't enough and the growing public apathy towards the scientific marvel of 'de- extinction' has seen attendance figures drop. In an effort to keep the crowds flocking in, Dr Henry Wu and his boffins have created an entirely new species - the Indominus Rex. This all new reptilian monster is a mass of teeth and claws that has been bred for the specific purpose of being a total nightmare. Wonder if that'll get out? Surprise, it does!From the initial security guard-shredding breakout, 'Jurassic World' plonks an escalating series of action scenes on top of each other as the Indominus goes on the war path. In true sequel style, the fights are bigger, the body-count higher and while there's nothing to match the tension masterclass of the original's Raptors in the kitchen scene, it's still eye-popping escapism of the highest order. Thought the Rex fighting the Spinosaurus in 'Jurassic Park 3' was cool? You ain't seen nothing yet.Where it falls down though is the characters. Sure, Chris Pratt is effortlessly engaging and Irrfan Khan's upbeat billionaire is a worthy successor to John Hammond, but it's obvious that this script has been written and re-written too many times for anyone else to remain consistent. Bryce Dallas Howard has a good stab as the ice- queen turned worried aunt, but that doesn't explain why she would interrupt a frantic search for her nephews to coo over a dying Brachiosaur. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson meanwhile are likable enough as the kids in peril, but Vincent D'onofrio's military nut has blatantly had a few scenes cut to speed up the running time.It's not the fault of the actors but the numerous alterations to the story during the years in development has left them behaving irrationally, while one plot strand especially has a ""oh, just throw a Raptor at it"" feel to it. Plus, the solution to the Indominus Rex problem isn't really a solution at all and it'll be clear to anyone that spends more than ten seconds thinking it over that they've solved nothing.When it comes to pure spectacle though, 'Jurassic World' is going to be a tough one to beat in 2015. The new 'Star Wars' has a fight on its hands if it hopes to beat the Pterosaur swarm, the Mosasaurus leaping from the water and the Raptors taking on the army. In terms of pure visual appeal, this can go toe-to-toe with the likes of 'Pacific Rim' any day and despite the weak script, there's more delights to be had here than in four 'Transformers' movies.Definitely needs more Goldblum though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost,"Jurassic World starts with all the bangs and whistles. It even has a reasonable plot for most of the movie. I won't spoil anything, but I will try to give you an idea of what to expect.The story follows the visit of Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), two kids, who visit Isla Nublar where their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) works. After ten years of operation Jurassic World has relied on new attractions every couple years to keep the visitors coming back for more. This time they create a hybrid dinosaur from gene splicing.Owen (Chris Pratt) works with the velociraptors on the island and is brought over to check out the containment center where the hybrid is kept. This is where the story picks up. And for the majority of the film it keeps a good pace with an entertaining story and decent dialogue. Chris Pratt is the stand out in the film and continues to show that he can carry an action flick.The movie starts to dip toward the end and you are left with the feeling that the writers didn't know how to end it. The film did so good for almost the entire film, but what you're left with is a jumbled final act.That doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching, but tailor your expectations for a complete package. It will sure to impress and is well worth seeing, but as far as rankings go it deserves a 7 at best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Isn't as great as the original, but a close second!","So the original Jurassic is a 10/10, no question about it. But for me, this is a close second place winner. It captures the magic and excitement of the original, while updating it to our current larger than life world, that always wants something bigger and better.It really felt like an updated version of the original, and stayed true to the magic and awe of the original. However it still paid beautiful homage the original. I love how they actually revisited parts of the original park in the movie. It just felt like a very realistic modern day approach to it. I could absolutely see this park existing in our world today.I loved every minute of it. It was a great storyline and excitement from the start to finish. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overstuffed but entertaining Blockbuster,"It's fine, it has the fun Chris Pratt, but other characters are underwhelming. The script is fine, the dialogue was cheesy, I think people just want to see dinosaurs, which is fair, but overall, it was ok. I don't hate these kinds of movies, in fact, I think there was plenty of action sequences and the visuals was good at it's time. And in my opinion, it deserves a lot less hate that it's getting right now, to really be honest, the big positives in this film are the cool dinosaur action sequences and the visuals, the villainy was lame, and that led to the travesty that is called Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Anyways, if you like monster movies like Godzilla, this is your film, but if you want a movie that is smart and intelligent, This ain't your film

"This return to the land before time is great fun, if slightly unremarkable","While there's certainly a lot to enjoy about this latest dino filled popcorn adventure, any number amount of cool ideas and concepts that director Colin Trevorrow and his team have come up with cant help hide the fact that Jurassic World just doesn't have the ""wow"" factor moments that made our first journey to this universe such a blast on release in 1993 and in the ensuing years following.Jurassic World doesn't have any ripple in the water moments, the white knuckle tension of a kitchen full of velociraptors and there are no ingenious moments like poor old Newman being discovered in the safety of a toilet block, and when the star performer of your film is a dinosaur called Blue, Jurassic World pales in comparison to its beloved original but did we ever really expect that to not be the case? It could actually be argued quite strongly, that World is in fact the second best movie of the 4 film franchise.With an empathise on fun and a wealth of huge ideas, World feels relatively short and sharp compared to most other recent bloated blockbuster tent poles and while a large portion of set pieces in the film feel underwhelming and slightly undercooked the film's final 15-20 minutes will be a sure fire hit for fans of the franchise and those keen to get there dinosaur laden destruction fixes on. Colin Trevorrow and his 3 fellow screenwriters also understand the importance of recognising the work that was laid before them and there are neat homages throughout this picture to the foundation Steven Spielberg built, from a visit to a very recognisable visitor centre through to the return of BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, the legacy of Jurassic Park looms large over the picture yet thankfully never overshadows this much shinier product.Much was made about World's look when trailers started hitting the internet and many fanboys were outraged at what looked like some highly shoddy CGI work but it's with great pleasure I can say World is one of the more spectacular visual popcorn films of some time. The quintessential dinosaurs look fantastic, the Island of Isla Nublar looks splendid and overall the film looks about as polished as you could hope for. With our dinosaurs on point, it's also helpful that our main cast members work well together and while Chris Pratt has virtually transplanted his Starlord persona to a park working, ATV riding hero of the hour, his still a very easy to like presence and shares a good rapport with the always good Bryce Dallas Howard. The human big bad of the piece Hoskins played by Vincent D'Onofrio is a bit of a stumble for the film and his appearances often feel unneeded and distracting in an other wise frequently moving adventure, but luckily the monster big bad is all types of menacing if not quite up the original T-Rex's greatness.Likable and enjoyable without ever reaching grand heights, you wouldn't call Jurassic World overly memorable but it's certainly worth the price of admission for all those seeking adventure, no matter their age. With some hugely impressive visuals, a fantastically designed theme park full of prehistoric wonder and with a mostly likable cast, Jurassic World offers us a great excuse to journey back to the island that wowed us so all those many moons ago, just don't expect to be left with the same feeling received from our first trip to the land before time.3 and a half Jimmy Fallon safety videos out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Impressive CGI Can't Make Up For Movies Many Flaws,"Some impressive CGI can not make up for bad writing, poor acting, clichéd, cardboard characters and a plot that is effectively a poor rehash of the first movie.

Every time he is not on screen the movie suffers. Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins are nowhere as near as endearing as Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazello from the first movie, and are both annoying!!

A worthy sequel,"Jurassic World is the long awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. While nothing will ever be able to replicate the wonder and joy the original film brought, I can say that this one comes very close. It is a worthy sequel that makes you forget the mistakes that The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III had made.Twenty-two years after the events of the first movie, Isla Nublar has been revamped and redesigned into a properly functioning dinosaur-themed park named Jurassic World, as was originally envisioned by John Hammond. However, after 10 years in service, the park's popularity and tourism rates are declining. In an attempt to attract more tourists, the park's genetic engineers come up with a plan to introduce a new dinosaur, a hybrid Tyrannosaurus Rex known as the Indominus Rex. This idea backfires horribly when Indominus escapes its enclosure and goes on a rampage.This film gets right what its two predecessors got wrong. It manages to expand the fictional universe that Jurassic Park had started without seeming too contrived or forced. The characters were likable as well, especially Chris Pratt's character Owen Grady, a bad-ass, yet kindhearted raptor trainer. The third act alone redeems the franchise of The Lost Word: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. My only real complaint is that the CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) dinosaurs didn't always look very convincing. I guess CGI in the 80s and 90s looked better than the CGI of today.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"At times Entertaining, at times Uneven.","""Jurassic World"" is the 4th movie in the ""Jurassic Park"" Series, and the first, since ""Jurassic Park III"" in 2001, and it takes part 22 years after the first ""Jurassic Park"", which came out in 22 years ago – in 1993. Like the other films, this one is led by an ensemble cast. Basic Set-up: Brothers Zach Mitchell (HS Age), played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell played by Ty Simpkins (Appears to be Pre-Teen to early Teen-Harley Keener in Iron Man 3) go to visit their Aunt Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is the Operations Manager of ""Jurassic World"" a theme park of Real Dinosaurs on Isla Nublar in Costa Rica – first envisioned in the first movie by the character of John Hammond. Another main player is Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt (Peter Quill/Star-Lord of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and Andy Dwyer of TV's ""Parks and Recreation""), a Velociraptor expert and trainer. Like the previous movies, as you can imagine, things will go array with the Dinosaurs, and chaos ensues. Like the previous films, the Special Effects, particularly the Dinosaurs, are first rate. The cast, which is good mix of races, generally do a good job. The two young boys I thought were outstanding, not a surprised with Simpkins, who was I felt was also so in ""Iron Man 3"", 2 years back. While slow at the start, Bryce Dallas Howard improves as the movie goes goes on. Pratt, does admirably playing a character that is not at all a carbon copy of ""Star Lord/Peter Quill"" from ""Guardians of Galaxy"" which released last summer, heightened him to super stardom – And he got the role prior to ""Guardian's"" release. Overall, while at times the film is entertaining, it is also at times uneven, trying to do the dual stories of overall the Mitchell family aspect, involving the parent, and the dynamic of Howard character and her sister – the boys' mother, and the plot line of how things go array with the Dinosaurs in this installment. Both plot lines, particularly the family aspect, could have been developed more, and be executed more evenly. and there are a 1 or 2 moments which just didn't fit. With that said, it still entertains you a great deal of the time. It's an improvement over the last film the series, and overall I would rank it third behind the first one, and ""The Lost World – Jurassic Park"". 2 ¾ Stars out of 4 – 7 ½ out of 10 Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Self-referential themepark about visiting Jurassic Park,"Between the last Terminator and this I opted for the former while playing on screens this summer. Now that I see this, I see they're driven by the same strategy; plucking iconic elements of the original and transplanting them in a context that acknowledges that we can't do it the exact same, the world is different.The idea here is that we consciously enter Jurassic Park as the cinematic themepark we've known from prior visits. Now it's essentially a huge themepark / cineplex with tons of different rides, screens and dinosaur attractions for crowds of parents with their kids. But we want bigger, showier, ""more teeth"" in the attraction so producers of the show oblige, genetically creating a new rex for profitable thrills.Unleashed beast wreaks havoc, narrow escapes, chases through woods and around compounds, mercenaries who fail; much of it stays the same, with a few extra rides. The themepark is leveled, the audience scattered in hysterics; the real themepark is the film where this is the ride, the same one that spills from staged to real with the animals on the loose and us being rocketed through. Along the way we stop to see a dilapidated segment left over from the first Park, explored with something like hushed awe. In the end the old beast is unlocked from the vault of nostalgic memory and brought into the fight; this time we cheer.All told, none of these can ever be like the first time, which was first of all something we discovered new. So this is fine for what it is, what room they had was try to engineer the themepark to extend a little while reminding of the place they're renovating.

The franchise is lucky this movie didn't come out first,"I went to Jurassic World with high expectations, but was underwhelmed.I recently had the pleasure of seeing Jurassic Park again on television. Scenes such as the T-Rex in the wing mirror, the car 'chasing' the child down the tree, rapidly alternating between humour and suspense as Sam Neil leads the children over the electric fence; this was Spielberg at his very best from start to finish. Sadly, all that directorial guile has been thrown out the window in Jurassic World in favour of relentless action and great special effects, and the movie is worse for it.It's not a terrible movie, but it says something about the acting and direction that I wound up caring more about the dinosaurs than I did about the principle characters.

They Just Can't Contain the Dinosaurs,"""Jurassic World"" is the fourth of the Jurassic film series, and the only one to not be adapted from one of Crichton's novels. And although the computer-generated-imagery is better than ever, it also carries with it a certain amount of cheesiness that the others (thankfully) lacked. What was the source of this ""cheesiness""? Two brothers, Zach and Grey, visit Jurassic World to see their Aunt Claire, but she has work to do so they have to tour Jurassic World on their own. The youngest is a highly emotional but clueless young boy, and the oldest is a high-schooler who is fascinated with girls, and while endangered on the island they form a bond. That's the part that makes the movie a tad cheesy. On the other hand, there's Chris Pratt, a raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard's Aunt Claire, both of which do a remarkable job of acting.The dinosaur escapee in this one is the Indominus Rex, who can camouflage (a characteristic he inherited from his TREE FROG DNA!!!!), and also detect thermal radiation, and teleport anywhere he wants to. Kidding on that last part, but apparently he's an insanely super-powered dinosaur, even bigger than a T-Rex. ""What have they cooked up in that lab?"" as one of the character asks. The answer? A very unappetizing reptile. Anyway, using his superpowers he inherited from Odin-osaurus, his father, he tricks the supervisors into thinking he escaped his confinement, and thus, using their naiveté as his weapon, (HUGE spoiler follows) he actually does escape. It appears they're never going to learn how to contain those dinosaurs.The action scenes are quite awe-inspiring, just not as thrilling as the previous Jurassic entries. Another foothold ""Jurassic World"" has over the other Jurassic movies is more amusing humor, from both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. Although not quite as good as the first Jurassic Park, Jurassic World is a worthy entry into the spectacular series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Riddled with clichés, zero character development, and nonsensical plots, but what did you expect from a ""Summer Blockbuster""?","It's always nice to see Vincent d'Onofrio, but even his high caliber acting skills can't save what amounts to a very nonsensical plot. He plays the military liaison with a vested interest in using velociraptors in the military - you know, to carry out missions in dangerous war zones. It's hard to say it with a straight face, so we're obviously dealing with talented actors.Usually angry dinosaurs alone are sufficient when it comes to creating suspense, but this would require some decent writing, and seemingly incapable of this task, the writers decided to create a genetic hybrid monster-type dinosaur to try and elicit some emotion (although he is not a great deal scarier than the original T. Rex). I found it really challenging to care about any of the people who are trying to avoid getting eaten - despite the expressions of panic on their faces - and the frantic calls to the nanny.Some of the expressions of brotherly love between the children was well done, and, in line with the concept of ""summer blockbuster"" you certainly get your share of big bad beasties. There were also a couple of excellent comedic exchanges with the secondary characters working the control room.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bigger but not better, doesn't have the wonder to be timeless","Does Jurassic World have enough meat on its bones to survive on its own?Certainly bigger and badder, Jurassic World doesn't have the magic to make it a timeless film like Steven Spielberg's masterful 1993 original.Much has changed since John Hammond previewed his Jurassic Park twenty-three years ago. Despite its doomed exhibition, corporate still has not learned and this time has created a fully functioning theme park on the island of Isla Nublar of Costa Rica. Funded by Samsung, Verizon, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, DQ, Mercedes, Hilton and Beats by Dre, the amusement park wows and amazes with interactive petting zoos, Sea World-esque tank shows and voyeuristic tubes that put attendees right in the thick of the dinosaur jungle. What's the next step to shock patrons and remedy declining visitor rates? Why, a genetically modified dinosaur whose predatory skills are only just scratching the surface.Despite the movie world of Jurassic World coexisting in the same universe as the original Jurassic Park, humanity apparently has learned very little since the treacherous misguidance in arrogance of Hammond's park. And it is in these blundering and arrogant human behaviors that audiences will find Jurassic World most infuriating.The story of Jurassic World is more complex in comparison to the original's plot, what with it being the fourth film of the franchise. We have the story of a family on the brink of dissolution, we have a career oriented woman managing one of the most complicated theme parks in existence, we have a trainer who takes charge to save innocent bystanders when hell inevitably breaks loose, simultaneously we have the action plot of a vicious genetically modified dinosaur voraciously wreaking havoc.There are aspects of the narrative that are completely unneeded and without which would have yielded a simpler more engaging story. Components of the film are spot on, specifically Chris Pratt and the role he plays along with the slight humor the kids inject in moments of tense terror. The tone of Jurassic World ebbs and arcs, at times perfect and at other times completely interrupting the flow of the film. The kills and action scenes are not memorable and sloppily difficult to follow. And while the CGI is adequate, it is at times overly wet and fake looking, prohibiting the ability to become fully immersed and engaged and we wish more practical effects were used, despite the budgetary burden they may inflict.Those sponsors mentioned above aren't just for the fictitious amusement park's bank roll but are also undoubtedly key financial supporters of the film itself. Their inclusions are a laughable distraction and the director is so heavy handed with his token features of the brands, one can only assume he is dense or was completely against corporate sponsorship in his film.The aesthetic of the park itself is the most wondrous aspect of the film and most closely resembles the wonder Jurassic Park induced. Creatively, Jurassic World as a theme park is amazing and perfectly thought out. As a film it is uneven but satiates the dino-craving.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst films ever made!,"I'm really starting to despair for the human race, the fact millions of people around the world can go to see this film and walk away thinking that its in any way good is beyond me.This is the WORST Jurassic Park film by a long long way.Firstly there is zero character development and I mean zero. For all you morons out there who don't know what that is, it's understanding the characters back ground, beliefs and motivation. This helps you empathize with the characters and care about them making what happens to them effect you emotionally. You care about none of the characters in this film even Chris Pratt is wooden, its truly one of the most lazy pieces of writing I've ever come across.The plot is laughable there are more plot holes than nearly any film I've ever seen. Characters who do things no sentient being would ever consider let alone put into action. I wont list them as I'd be here till the insects take over.AND THE ENDING!!!! MY GOD!!! I got up and walked out the cinema shouting CR*P!!!! I honestly thought the T-REX and the Raptor where going to get it on. Then the Raptor walks away like Clint Eastwood!!!! please!!!! Seriously people please for the love of god ask yourself is this the best they could of come up with? I was eight when JP came out and knew even at that age it was a landmark film, the CGI in JP still beats this rubbish and you even care about the characters. Even Lost World and JP3 and vaguely believable story lines. This one is taking the p***!!!! Honestly if you think this film is good I feel sorry for you as I do the millions of kids who are going to see this thinking its good.It just makes me appreciate the first film so much more and realize how lucky I was to have seen such a wonderful film at that age.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie for kids?,"Overall I found this movie a bit exciting, but if I would be a kid I might even love it! It is actually made in a way so kids would love it and yeah from that point it is good, but the only thing which may disturb parents may be dinosaurs attacks.If I have to speak about music, it was epic , kind a remembered me something from Star wars, special effects were really good.The only , but one of the most important thing for me, when ever I watch a movie is story and I kind a felt that Jurassic Wold was lacking it! I found it rather flat. There were a lot of scenes which were too predictable, action parts were too predictable and of course faith for main characters were kind a known in the movie beginning, in my opinion nothing will surprise an adult, but for kid this may be really good movie!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well-Made and Entertaining But Nothing New,"Already fulfilling a world record as the highest-grossing opening weekend of all time, I suppose it doesn't matter to most people that Jurassic World doesn't cover any new ground, that it doesn't provide a very good case for yet another Jurassic Park sequel, that its thirst for money is crystal clear instead of worryingly unapparent. My complaints shouldn't suggest that it isn't an entertaining, enjoyable film; they should suggest that, despite a pining for more teeth and more thrills, you won't find yourself experiencing anything besides a popcorn ready case of déjà vu. But the action is visceral, the attitude adventuresome, the actors affectionate and enthused. Jurassic World doesn't have a lot of originality whirring around in its tiny little head, but it's just well-made and buoyant enough to provide for big-budgeted escapism worthy of one's precious time.The plot remains the same: dino-based amusement park seems sound at first glance, but goes haywire after its biggest exhibit knocks down its apparently impenetrable restrictions. This time around, the beast is not a sassy T-Rex but a selfish, genetically modified Indominus Rex, who is larger, more intelligent, and only content when killing for sport and terrorizing civilians. Our male lead is a wily Chris Pratt, his love interest a waspish Bryce Dallas Howard. I won't go into details regarding the characters — it's the same old, same old, all patrons relatable, all with baggage that does nothing besides add intrigue to the recycled plot.Movie consumer guide The Dissolve put it best when describing Jurassic World as being ""fun"" though ""ultimately more of the same in brand-new packaging"". It doesn't so much insult our intelligence as it does figure that bigger is better, that we won't notice that just because the I-Rex is larger doesn't mean some of the attack sequences won't feel vaguely familiar. Take a look at the scene, for instance, in which Howard's nephews, portrayed by Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, are trapped in a tour vehicle while the I-Rex roams the premises. Eventually (and expectedly), they are nearly killed, but escape in just the nick of time. But wasn't this exact moment caught on camera twenty-two years ago with Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as the young, would-be victims? Wasn't it just a little better, just a little bit more, I don't know, new? Whatever.Complaints abound. I could roast Jurassic World all day for making us go along with the fact that Bryce Dallas Howard spends the entire film in high heels, that Chris Pratt is able to ride a motorcycle sixty miles-per-hour through the jungle without running into any obstacles, that villain Vincent D'Onofrio somehow believes that one can actually weaponize dinosaurs to replace drones (???)(?)(????) (get out, you unnecessary side-character), that characters decide to run from hideout to hideout during a dino brawl when all they have to do is simply leave the premises. But I digress. Jurassic World provides everything a fan of the franchise could ever want — the monstrous reptiles are back (though they looked less computer animated in the '93 original) and better than ever, and the new cast is sound. By keeping in mind that nothing new will be in store, Jurassic World will make for a satisfying, well-made update.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best yet,"Although it cannot recreate or top the sense of wonder and awe created by the first movie, this was by far the best of all four. The last two were pale attempts to capture the excitement of the original. This one went beyond! Of course it is 22 or more years later than the original and the special effects only get better. The scale of the story also was expanded from one small ""Park"" to A ""World"" sort of like comparing a county carnival to a Disney site. I know I will watch this movie many times again and possibly buy the DVD or Blu-ray when released. I rarely do that; I thought it was that good. Will be recommending it to all my friends. My guess: the highest grossing film of 2015.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a Classic Jurassic,"This movie is a pure, dumb, and fun action flick that is worth watching just for the dinosaur action on screen. It is thrilling, goofy, and entertaining, but it brings nothing fresh to the table. Christ Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard bring great chemistry on screen and it is fun to watch. Christ Pratt is awesome of course, and fits into his role very well. He has a lot of funny moments with Bryce Dallas Howard, which are pretty fun to see. The plot however, is one that is flawed. Other than the dinosaurs and Christ Pratt, this movie is just another Hollywood popcorn money movie. It is fun, and you will have a good time when you see it with all the action, but it is by no means a great movie. Overall, this movie is worth a watch at the theaters for the visuals, but don't expect too much of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Do you think he saur-us?,This review is going to be completely spoiler free. Jurassic World is full of giants and what I mean by that is giant dinosaurs. Jurassic World is set 22 years after Jurassic Park and in this film they have genetically modified dinosaurs which makes them intelligent. Let me tell you what is good about this film (spoiler free).The film is very pretty and futuristic and it is filled to the brim with CGI. The film has some funny moments that just make you giggle. The dinosaurs have feelings and also you get the sense of scale in this film. The story is set well and is definitely going to take over Jurassic Park 2 and 3 which were in my opinion just over the top and poor.Bad points about this film is the bad dialogue and also some very small plot holes and very awkward moments and in my opinion is quite dark and gory especially to the fact that it is a 12A (PG-13) but overall this is a dinosaur of a film.The story is set around two brothers aged around 17 and 12 Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) who go off to an island called Jurassic World they go there on a holiday set by their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the two brothers have such a fun time then eventually it all goes wrong. Then the story goes to another character Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who was in the Navy signed up for Jurassic World to train some raptors specifically four but again it goes wrong.Zach and Gray go off on their own adventure without their Aunt Claire they basically have their own responsibilities. Eventually the park get's overrun and everything just goes wrong.Now the hybrid dinosaur not the one seen on the Jurassic World is literally colossal over fifty feet long and she is extremely intelligent and smell people from a mile away but that is enough about that.Finally this film is spectacular. 10/10. A must see.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great family film - but we want too see something thats messed up :),"I watched this when it first came out and found myself feeling a little disappointed - back when I was a kid when these films first came out they were the scariest films I'd ever seen. I had nightmares lol. But now I'm older, and I know that a dinosaur won't eat me, I still expected to watch a film that would give me a bit of a fright. And I have to say I was disappointed. The kids today of 13 are already watching the 18 rated movies - and I cannot understand why they didn't make it a film of all films - but choose to make a child's film. I really really do hope that one day they take this story and use it to its full potential - we want to see stuff we've never seen before and dinosaurs plus guts and gore - that could be something epic",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Spectacle Not To Be Missed!!,"I went into this movie hoping for a great sequel to the first Jurassic Park film. And that's exactly what I saw, a visual spectacle that reminded me of the first film. Jurassic World is pretty much a monster movie, which you can say the same for the other movies. Sure it's script isn't the best, and it is understandable (unlike what some people say). Chris Pratt is great, didn't expect anything less from him. Bryce Dallas Howard was great, I don't think I had seen her in anything before but she was a surprise. And the rest of the cast, some were good some were bad. The film itself did something different, creating a genetically spliced dinosaur. It was thrilling, visually great and payed homage to the first film in multiple ways. This movie was very nostalgic and revitalised the series. Overall I'll give it 10/10, it wasn't the best in terms of the script, but because it didn't set out to make some deep, down to earth drama, I'll let it slide. The rest is just utterly amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An action packed, nostalgic blockbuster with a bit of cheesy dialogue","If you're a nit picker and an overall negative critic, you will find plenty of things wrong with this movie, you won't recommend it, and you will remain butt hurt until the next installment.However, if you're a dedicated, optimistic and hopeful fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, you're going to enjoy this movie.I have been looking forward to this release from the moment it was announced, and not a day has gone by where I haven't tried to find out everything I can about it. So going into this I felt there was a lot of pressure in terms of my own self preservation, for this movie to be good.And it definitely was.The nostalgia theme throughout this is excellent, they do a fantastic job of tapping into your younger self and making you feel like a kid again. Confidently playing the old JP score without any apologies, and it works!The action is almost non-stop and very well paced, never feeling like there was too much nor too little. The CGI is fantastic, and of course it would've been nice to see more Anamatronics but this is a new age of movie making that we have to adapt to.They do an excellent job of portraying the I-Rex as a creepy, mastermind villain but also as an animal that you overall feel sorry for as it didn't ask to be thrown into the world like it is.The rest of the Dinosaurs have the perfect amount of screen time, and the Raptors are definitely my favourite and I found myself more connected with them than I did with most of the human characters characters.Chris Pratt plays his role fantastically. He was cool, calm, collected but not invincible. And I felt both him and BDH did the best they could with the script they were given. Cheesy dialogue is rampant throughout and very clichéd, however, if you go into this movie being prepared for that I can guarantee it won't be a deal breaker.This movie had an enormous amount of pressure on it. It has dealt with so much criticism over trailers, CGI usage, actor selection, too name a few. Yet it has delivered everything we hoped for as true JP fans and I don't see any of the cheesy dialogue and clichés ruining this movie.I ultimately would've preferred a bit more progression into a darker theme as the story went on, and honestly, although the child actors did a good job, I really didn't care about their back story. It almost seemed tacked on to provide some kind of ad-hoc character development, but was completely redundant.JW is a great movie, not a perfect movie, but delivers on so many levels that only the true harsh critics and general trolls will think its awful.I loved it and I left the cinema feeling very satisfied after months of waiting.A solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a Syfy movie with a big budget,"Ever saw those monster movies on Syfy channel? You know, the ones with the 2 dimensional characters. That have poor dialogue and horrible special effects. Well that's Jurassic World, with exception of the sfx.Jurassic World looks expensive, has some fantastic shots but unfortunately nobody seemed to care about writing interesting characters or story lines. And if the characters are so badly written it's not surprisingly that the actor's deliver poor work.Yes, the movie has a few funny moments but the entire cast is uninteresting, shallow and predictable. Basically just like the storyline.I had some expectations for this movie but I have to say that the 14 minutes of dino's in Jurassic Park had more impact on me than the 5 best minutes of Jurassic World. I expected this to be the best of the franchise after the original. But in the end it turned out to be almost as bad as JP 3",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Enjoyable, but only that","If you're looking for a fun summer block-buster to go take all your friends to, this movie is definitely for you. ""Jurassic World"" offers plenty of awesome dinosaur fights and chases, good special- effects, and a story that will entertain you in the way that summer action movies do- but that is pretty much all that you are getting here.I believe this movie is the kind of movie you watch when you're home, on the couch, maybe on your laptop or smart-phone, and you have the TV on. The movie tried to make you care and invest in characters that almost seem copy and pasted over from the first installment of the series, except it doesn't really work. I felt very uninterested in pretty much all the characters besides Chris Pratt, because he was the only one that was they took time in developing. One could argue that others were enjoyable, and I would agree if they weren't just killed off or if they took a bit more time developing their interests and motivations.Throughout the film we are exposed to beautiful scenery and landscapes that were very pleasing to the eye.The dinosaurs looked good, but are almost entirely CGI and not enough practical effects. What made the dinosaurs look so realistic in the first and second installments of the series were the life-like animotronics used in the close up scenes, which is absent for most of this film. Don't get me wrong- the dinosaurs still looked great, just not as good as they could have been.Chris Pratt's character was my favorite, and he really ground this movie. Unlike his other role in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", he plays a down to Earth, stoic raptor trainer. He's the guy who cares about the actual people in the park, his raptors, other characters, actually understands the danger of the dinosaurs, and did not wait to act. Though, I don't find it appropriate that the weight of this movie is on Pratt's character's shoulders, when it could have included other meaningful characters like park-workers and tourists that could have made this film live up to it's name. But hey, the dude trains friggin' velociraptors for a living, and you will grow to love this character.There were a lot of times that this movie rides the line of scientific accuracy, like certain dino-fights and executions, but that doesn't take away from the movie at all. In fact, when I saw the many abilities of the hybrid dinosaur in action, that were then explained in awestruck and furious dialogue and monologue, I was at the edge of my seat for the duration of the scene. The only problem I had with the hybrid dinosaur was that it wasn't as built up as it could have been to get that emotional punch or some kind of moment where I cover my face so I don't see the monster of my nightmares prowling around on screen. When it is not on screen, it almost feels as if it isn't in the movie.""Jurassic World"" was an enjoyable movie that I will turn to when it comes on cable, but my experience with this movie did not lead me to believe it was a great work of film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Badass Chris Pratt and Dinos!,"In 1993, we were all awed by the first ""Jurassic Park"" film by Steven Spielberg. We remember that moment when our jaws dropped when we saw that first Brachiosaurus appear on screen. We definitely felt the fearsome terror of the T-Rex and the Velociraptors as they went on their rampages. Everything looked and felt so real, fully deserving of all the technical awards it won.Now, 22 years later, ""Jurassic World"" brings us back to Isla Nublar where it all began. John Hammond's vision is now a very popular theme park, with interactive rides and activities with the dinosaurs. Claire Dearing is the park's uptight all-business operations manager. She is having a particularly hectic day when her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) arrive for a visit. Serious problems arise concerning the park's latest, largest and most vicious hybrid creation, the Indominus Rex. Claire calls on Owen Grady, the park's onsite Velociraptor trainer, to save the day.Despite the existence of ""sequels"" ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997) and ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001), ""Jurassic World"" is THE true sequel to the first ""Jurassic Park."" It is set in the same Costa Rican island where the first film was set. We see numerous references about the first film here as characters stumble into the ruins of the original resort in this film. We still see Dr. Henry Wu (B.D.Wong), the park's chief geneticist, the only human character from the first film in this one. And of course, there is the T-Rex.Now under the ownership of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), the dinosaurs of the park have become mere commercial assets of a big business. The initial scenes show us the shallowness of what the park has become: kids riding baby Triceratops in a petting farm, boating and safariing among the plant-eaters, watching the gigantic Mosasaurus performs like a dolphin in a pool.The stuffy Claire, in her stiff hairdo, designer outfit and stilettos, represents this cold corporate philosophy. It is this philosophy of wanting to be constantly ahead that led to the ill-advised splicing of the DNA of various dinosaurs and other species creating the ultimate high-IQ killing monster, which would later be the park's own undoing. Practically all the adult human characters in this film are unlikable: greedy, petty, heartless.Lead star Chris Pratt plays probably the only likable character in this film. His Owen is the only one we all rooted for as he badass-ly led his posse of Velociraptors on a motorbike. He basically plays his charming ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" character, but a smarter, less goofy, no- nonsense version.That her high heels get more attention than her acting does not speak too well of Bryce Dallas Howard's annoying performance as Claire. I guess her character was really supposed to be annoying so she is probably doing it right, yet she was blandly uncharismatic as a leading lady.The original timeless theme music by John Williams effectively evokes a sense of nostalgia as it gets played. The story telling by Steven Spielberg in the 1993 original though, remained superior over this one by newcomer Colin Trevorrow, riddled with some illogical close calls and questionable dinosaur psychology. The brotherly bonding between Zach and Grey was used as an emotional core, but it did get a bit too unrealistically sweet in the end (predictably so). Owen and Claire's love affair did not really seem to be necessary, yet they also put that in for some romance angle. The ethical and political issues about genetic bioengineering are touched on once again, just as the first did, with a bit less sting this time.Overall, the main highlight are still the dinosaurs. The awe we felt during the first film cannot be replicated, but the thrill is still there. Every time a giant meat-eater approaches a human character, the fearful tension created is heart-pounding, as it was before. The visual effects are first rate as ever, made even more realistic by updated technology, as are the sound effects that accompany the action. We all felt we were those kids riding that cool glass gyrosphere gazing up in wonder as the vestiges of a lost world roamed around us. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Nowhere near as great as the first, but works as a fun monster movie in its' own right","Is it as awesome as the first movie? Absolutely not. It is way better than the god awful sequels? Absolutely. I didn't fall in the love with this movie, but I can certainly say that I liked it. It's a fun popcorn monster movie that just about everyone can enjoy. Be warned though, there is a lot of really stupid stuff in this movie. First off the notion that this park would ever open is ludicrous. This takes place after the first movie, so the events that took place there still happened. I find it hard to believe anybody would come to this place after people died on the first attempt. Bryce Dallas Howard's character was wearing high heels the whole time. Keep that in mind when you're watching this movie. There's also a really stupid decision made by the kids in this movie that I can't say without having spoilers. But in the end, all those things don't ruin the movie.

Finally!  A 'Jurassic Park' movie that finally hearkens back to the original film.,"'Jurassic World' takes place 22 years after the events of 'Jurassic Park'. In this movie, we see that a fully functional and hugely popular dinosaur-themed park has replaced Hammond's failed theme park. However, since the park is suffering from a decline in visitors, the scientists at Jurassic World are tasked to create a brand new dinosaur (Indominus Rex) to help bring up numbers. Of course, things go wrong once again - and a group of employees are forced to stop the newly created dinosaur.To me, 'Jurassic World' feels like a retread of 'Jurassic Park' - only with higher stakes. That being said, there are elements in the script (from the characters, to the plot, and even certain moments and scenes) that don't feel all that fresh. Aside from Chris Pratt's character, Owen Grady, none of the other human characters were all that memorable. I also found myself caring very little about the family conflict that the two Mitchell Brothers were going through (which the movie itself paid very little attention to). If the human characters were actual people instead of reused stereotypes, then maybe I would have cared a little more about the movie.Actually, now that I think about it... the script also contains PLENTY of plot points that the movie never bothers to mention again! Maybe they'll be addressed in the sequel?Who cares! Because...DINOSAURS! ...Which don't look all that believable when compared to what Spielberg and his team accomplished 22 years ago. Seriously, I'm not saying that the visual effects are bad (they're oftentimes quite believable), but I wish that Trevorrow didn't rely solely on CGI to bring to life the beloved beasts. Even today, the animatronic/CGI dinosaurs we see in 'Jurassic Park' still hold up! I can only imagine how much better the dinosaurs would look if the same method was applied for this movie!'Jurassic World' delivers heavily on the suspense, action, and thrills one would typically expect from a 'Jurassic Park' movie. Although there are a lot more intense fight sequences this time around (and not just between dinosaur and dinosaur), I never once got exhausted by what I was seeing. The movie is well-paced and the screenwriters knew just when to deliver the movie's WOW moments.Despite its lacklustre script, 'Jurassic World' is certainly a spectacle that demands to be seen on the big screen. The story may seem predictable and even trite at times, but if you're a fan of dinosaurs, mayhem, or giant monster fights, then check out 'Jurassic World'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Jurassic World. Good performances, sloppy story","There are quite a few story elements in this film that are beyond what I believe any writer should expect their audience to overlook. I Expect some conveniences to be taken in writing, but in Jurassic World they go too far. As if you have to be unbelievable to be bigger than the last installment of the franchise.Chris Pratt proves here that he is indeed a superstar who can bring audiences out and keep them coming back. I believe he is largely responsible for the over the top financial success of this film. I am not unhappy about this because I happen to be a fan. Good to know Guardians of the Galaxy wasn't a lucky strike. If Chris can help make Jurassic world into one of the top grossing films of all time then he is going to be worth a boat load of cash starting now.The other cast members did a fine job IMO.

Heck, the raptors acted way better than the humans in the film! That pretty much ruined everything. The main actress trekked through an entire forest wearing HEELS?! Also, her hair went from STICK STRAIGHT TO PERMED towards the end of the movie! We can tell between permed and messy hair, thank you very much. Like seriously, WTF?!?! You can't make a convincing blockbuster film without getting down and dirty, and this movie focused on making the actors and actresses look good.

So let's get that out of the way first. The reputation of the first film is so positive, this film will always have had mixed reaction. However, relating to this issue, the main response from people seems to be this; it doesn't matter.People I spoke to tried to go in to a screening without having any expectations, and this is obviously the best way to treat the film. What you get is a popcorn movie with big dinosaurs, but wasn't that what the first film was? Well, let's come back to that in a bit. The main dinosaur antagonist in Jurassic World is well designed, and suitable scary and loud. The initial carnage scenes in which it makes itself known (the dinosaur) are well paced, violent, and probably some of the most gripping scenes, setting the tone for the rest of the film. However, that tone hardly changes, and when it does, it gets more ridiculous than scary or tense, something that the first film excelled at (Though, it's strange to say the Jurassic Park 'excels' at things, because, you know, Steven Spielberg and all).The action sequences are, expectedly, the film's strengths. Some of the individual sequences are very good, including the one mentioned in the previous paragraph, and one involving the main protagonist, played by Chris Pratt, zooming into the deep forest on a motorcycle, surrounded by a team of raptors (as seen on the trailer). However, others are absolutely ridiculous, in a kind of, ""this is absolutely ridiculous"" way. The finale is laughable, though still somewhat entertaining.There's not much point in speaking about the plot, as it's sort of irrelevant (and incredibly hole-y), and the characters, well, there aren't any (the best 'characters' are easily Pratt's gang of raptors, led by the more-charismatic-than-anyone-on-screen, 'Blue'). As we know, Pratt is an entertaining performer, but here, it feels that his talents have been wasted. I would have personally liked to have seen more 'cheekiness' and more one-liners from him, but he can only work with what he's given. In relation to this, some of the dialogue scenes so corny and ridiculous (there's that word again), that you just wish it was Jurassic Park....OK, so I guess it is difficult to talk about Jurassic World without frequently relating it to the first film. And it's this reason as to why I was slightly disappointed by it. It's fun, sure, it's loud, it's big, it's great to look at (most of the time), it's fast. But it's not (as) scary (as the first), and, unlike the first, it's not smart. It's dumb. Dumb fun, but dumb nonetheless. Going back to what I said about it being a popcorn movie, which was also the idea for the creation of the first film, is where the problem lies. The first film has a reputation as one of the greatest popcorn movies, but it's smart. It has a minimalist, yet classic adventure plot. It has characters; it has people you care about. I know it's difficult to come out with such gold as Spielberg and crew did, because, you know, it's Spielberg and all, but why couldn't it be smart as well as fun? Why couldn't we have a great time as well as caring about the characters? There's plenty of proof out there that films can be all these things.Yeah, I know, they shouldn't replicate any of the previous films, and they should make it their own. But simply by dumbing it down? Is that the main thing that summer blockbusters should be nowadays, as opposed to the days of the first film?But maybe I'm out of touch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but a few things that held it back from being amazing,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was still really good for many reasons. The acting was awesome, the CGI was incredible, and the action and adventure of the movie was pretty awesome too. Chris Pratt communicating with the raptors was really cool. The shark dino was amazing along with many of the other dinosaurs in the movie. The plot and the conflict of the movie was very good. And Jurassic World itself in the movie was really cool to watch and you really felt like you wanted to go there when watching all the cool stuff they thought of. But there was a few things that held it back.There was some really cheesy scenes involving romance, the side story of some of the characters, and the overall emotions of some of the characters. It just felt so bad to have that in the movie.The end ""battle scene"" did not satisfy me. I don't want to tell you what happens but it just was not amazing like it should have been and it was too short to give me that awesome feeling.So overall this was a really good adventure/action movie with a couple of things that might upset you but other than that it was a great movie that you will enjoy watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Sure, this movie has flaws, but i loved it","I'll start this review by saying that Jurassic Park is BY FAR my favourite film of all time so perhaps I am a little biased but I feel Colin Trevorrow did an outstanding job bringing back the magic I felt when I was a kid seeing Jurassic Park for the first time, especially considering he went from making a film with a budget of $750,000 to making a film with a budget upwards of $150,000,000. I don't know for a fact but that's gotta be quite the thing to get used too. For a blockbuster debut effort it was awesome, I can't help but feel like his work is only going to get better from here.I guess this film does have it's ""flaws"", the dialogue (like so many have pointed out) is fairly weak in some places but let's face it, did you really go see this movie expecting mind blowing dialogue? it's a dinosaur movie people. I found they could have used the original John Williams score at more opportune times but even that was still done quite well I felt. Some of the characters and their story lines didn't need to be in the movie at all, at some points it seemed like it was all kind of jammed in there, felt a little crowded at times. Those are all the issues I had with this movie and I can't stress enough that they DID NOT stop me from enjoying the hell out of this movie.Now for the positives folks, I'll start by saying they vastly outweigh the negatives. The new dinosaur.. wow, that thing is amazing, I was worried they were going to overdo it by making it crazy colours or covering it with spikes and horns all over the place but they didn't, they kept it simple and terrifying. The visuals in this movie were incredible, very Spielberg-esque shots and I'm not going to give anything away but if you are a massive fan of Jurassic Park such as I am there are some locations you're definitely going to recognize. This movie was made by a Jurassic Park nerd FOR the Jurassic Park nerd.If Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't convince you that Chris Pratt is a force to be reckoned with than this film will, that guy is outstanding. Bryce Dallas Howard has gone overlooked in this film for no justified reason at all, she was terrific, I've heard that some people thought the character arc was awful but to be honest I would relate it very closely to the Alan Grant character arc. I've been hearing a lot of negativity towards the two brothers in the movie and I can honestly say yeah, maybe it wasn't a great example of perfect character development but I thought both the kids did a great job, at no point did I wish they weren't in the film. Every character in this movie was portrayed very well I felt.In conclusion, I loved Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow did a fantastic job taking me back to my childhood and for that I thank him, I can't wait to see his future work. Do me a favour folks and go into this movie trying to feel like you did before you became a critic and had your childhood and imagination intact, don't over think it, get a big greasy bag of popcorn, sit down and enjoy, I think you'll be happy you did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
If you're a Jurasic fan...this is a must see,"In response to a lot of reviewers who are picking this movie apart, in my opinion this movie is as good as the first movie and it is definitely worth seeing. I saw it on 3D/IMAX and I believe I could have skipped the 3D without detriment. Yes it's predictable...does that surprise anyone? I enjoyed the experience and highly recommend the movie. Now I can't believe I have to write 10 lines to get a simple point across. Maybe that's why other reviewers delve into excessive detail of how a plot point in this movie compares to a plot point in the original movie. How the special effects compare to the original. It's all good! Go watch the movie... you'll enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Monstrous Mistakes Make JW a Complete Disaster for JP Fans,"What a shame, and a waste. If you loved Jurassic Park, you could skip Colin Trevorrow's mishmash sequel/reboot. In fact, you should skip it. What made the first Jurassic Park (even the two sequels, really) work so well is that Steven Spielberg clearly decided not to make a monster movie. Genetically engineered or not, the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park were living animals, skillfully brought to life with personality and gait, pace and vigor. They were neither heroes nor villains. Get in front of them and you're in trouble, get behind them and watch in awe. They, like all wild animals, were dangerous if you didn't respect or understand them, but they were also entirely capable of all the other things living creatures do: resting, rearing young, hunting, etc.The dinosaurs of Jurassic World? The film can't quite decide. Characters pay lip service to the idea that they are complex, living creatures, but on screen they're ultimately little more than toothy action figures, placed clumsily into scenes to bonk around gyrospheres, bite the bad guy or rumble against one another. They don't behave the way animals would behave, nothing they do confounds, intrigues or surprises. Instead, the little monsters snap and slash and are completely tamed by Trevorrow's limited vision, doing exactly what he and the scriptwriters want them to do -- exactly what the audience expects.And that might have even been okay, if only it had been a good script. It's not. Nostalgic touches intended to link the film thematically to the franchise only serve to remind us that a better film was made out of this material over two decades ago. The relationship between characters is wafer thin and, even from the start, stale. There is absolutely no chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, at least partially because Howard is forced into a prehistorically sexist role as corporate yes woman/damsel in distress. And yet, even when she transforms into an action hero and rescues Pratt from a flying reptile attack, her nephews ignore her completely, championing Pratt as a ""bad ass"" and their chosen hero of the film. The villain of the show, played by a husky Vincent D'onofrio, is even less interesting, chewing out his motives for a dino military force in a constant stream of GI Joe-meets-Halliburton chatter. His exit is absurdly staged, and serves as a marker for when the film is going downhill at full speed.I won't give away the ending. I don't need to -- everyone in the theater knew exactly what was coming. It's a wreck of CGI and pyrotechnics, insulting to the eye and ear. It clearly was meant to honor the titans of the original Jurassic Park, but it ends up being a poor kind of parody. I found myself wishing that all of the creatures involved could have just been put down, and met a more humane ending than the one they're left with: the prospect of more of this kind of franchise re-engineering to come.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Yes, it is a good monster movie, not a Jurrasic movie though!","While you hear the name Jurrasic tagged with the movie, i tend to think of the first Jurrasic Park (neglecting the dismal other two movies). So in that sense the movie fails. Apart from that this is a very entertaining movie.This movie was like a resurgence to the whole franchise and it does a pretty decent job in resurrecting the brand name, but then half way into the movie the director loses that grip and moves into a monster movie genre rather than sticking to the plan, which is annoying. The movie has got a lot of negatives, which makes it a mere one-time fun flick action movieThe cast: OMG, what a waste, its like each character is dispensable, nobody gives you that involvement and even if they die you would rather not be surprised at all. The actors should make the audiences more involved, which is not happening at all. The brother duo chemistry was horrible, the mom/son relationship was dismal, the lead actors romantic trial made them even more unlikeable. Some of situational comedy are cartoonish, like the hero catching a fly from mid air, seriously?? you might still be giggling about it while somebody is being ripped into pieces. The actors couldn't even cry and sure as hell couldn't make the audience laughThe plot: Create something evil and it will turn evil. seriously, that's it. Why have someone train a raptor? Raptor are clever and evil as they are, the first movie addressed that very clearly and it clearly stated these are monsters will hunt everything, despite this the Hero is training them like pet dogs, no movie no! If only the movie had believed the animals for what they are and constructed some plan to get them out of the mess, i would be more than happy to call it awesome, but it clearly does not understand this and tries to make a Godzilla movie when it should have been aiming for the Predator.Honestly Jurrasic Park was hit because of the thrills: The first appearance of T-rex, the Kitchen Scene, etc. Movie makers please know the genre of movies before making them The only fact this movie is rated high is because people have seen Jurrasic Park 3 and that has made this movie stand tall and look much better.So Kudos for making a crappy Jurrasic Park 3 which set the bar really low for this mediocre movie to look like a monumental success",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not better than Jurassic Park, but still a good movie","The plot is average. But yes, like the other reviewer say, it's predictable movie. Because of that, we can't feel the tension from this movie like Jurassic Park because we know where this movie going to.the animation must be using much good and expensive utilities. Still, the plot doesn't help much to make an excellent movie. This movie take a quite long time, you'd better watch it with friends because when you get bored in this 'up and down plot' ( i mean sometimes it's scary and good but sometimes it's boring) you got a friend to look at :)For me, this is still a slightly excellent movie. Excellent animation, tech, and excellent actor. Quite stressful and scary.

Great Entertainment,"Whilst the film doesn't have the strongest of plots and the acting is mostly pretty forgettable, thanks to the incredible special effects and the crescendo of action, I found this to be a very enjoyable and entertaining movie.It is of course nothing new, and if you've seen the original Jurassic Park then you'll presumably know what to expect from this. But after a fairly average beginning, the intensity and thrills gradually increase, with some fantastic effects making it all so very watchable.If you go into this film with expectations above what the film is trying to be, then you will no doubt be disappointed. It's a good old action/adventure with little in the way of sophisticated plot, but plenty of visuals to marvel at and keep you entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A nice blockbuster, but nothing new.","As I'd just recently watched Jurassic Park and heard what a huge success Jurassic World was, I thought I'd have to watch it. I went in there expecting a classic modern summer blockbuster with impressive visuals but not too much of a great story. I figured, as Steven Spielberg, the director of the original Jurassic Park, was Executive Producer on this, it couldn't be too bad (I loved Jurassic Park). But then again, Chris Pratt being lead actor made me fear I was going to see a cliché action movie. But enough of my expectations, let's get into it:Story: 22 years after John Hammond wanted to open a dinosaur theme park called Jurassic Park and failed, his dream has now become reality in the form of ""Jurassic World"" - same basic idea, just bigger. But as the audience wants to see more impressive attractions every year, a genetic hybrid has been created - based on the DNA of a T-Rex, but with lots of other elements. The problem is: The hybrid got bigger, stronger and more intelligent than expected.As I'd thought, there is nothing revolutionary in the story. I was afraid it was going to be just Jurassic Park all over again - that's partly true, but there are some new elements in there. In addition to genetic manipulation and capitalism, the movie also tries to criticize military and war through the character of Hoskins, portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio. I really liked that and it brought in something new, but it could have been done a lot better, it felt like the character was literally just there for setting the movie apart from the original a little bit.Acting: The acting was fine all in all - no outstanding performances, but no failures either. Especially Lowery, the character played by Jake Johnson, makes for a few nice humorous moments. But, as I was afraid, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard make for some terrible cliché moments. That's more of a writing than an acting problem though.Setting, Costumes, Props: Everything looks really good and seems to fit perfectly into the movie. Jurassic World looks exactly like what it's supposed to look like: a huge zoo with fantastic beasts. Only the control room seems a little cliché. And, of course, the lead actress has to get rid of more and more of her clothes and look more and more badass as the story progresses.Visuals and Action Sequences: The CGI looks very realistic, and especially at the beginning of the movie, everything seems very big and impressive. But towards the end, the hybrid looks less gigantic than I expected. On the other hand, it's a good thing that nothing is completely exaggerated. The action sequences are not as terrible as they could be, but a lot of things are pretty predictable and there is no real suspense like in Jurassic Park.Miscellaneous: Especially during the first half an hour or so, there is a lot of really annoying product placement. But it gets better. Or maybe I just didn't notice it any more. In a few nostalgic moments, the movie actually manages to revive the old spirit of the original Jurassic Park.Summary: All in all, Jurassic World is a really good-looking action movie with a few funny moments and nice references to the original, and as a 22-years-later summer blockbuster sequel, it doesn't do much wrong (at least it didn't ruin the franchise for me). But, as in most action blockbusters, there is no real suspense, no really touching emotion, and a lot of clichés.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's a dumb movie, but enjoyable nonetheless.","You'd think that after the first park went so badly that corporations would never try to mutate dinosaurs again. But we humans never seem to learn, as 22 years later and we've got a brand new park even bigger with new deadly attractions bound to cause more chaos.We spend the first 20 minutes of the film seeing the park itself. It's more modern than the tribal feel of the first park, instead going for something more like Universal Park being a fully fledged tourist attraction with modern high tech designs with things like holograms to boot. But despite the park being a success with 20,000 visitors daily, apparently it's still not enough and they need to make a new attraction to lure in new audiences. So they've had the scientists create a new dinosaur that's even bigger and more dangerous called the Indominus Rex. What could possibly go wrong?But then everything goes wrong. The Indominus Rex escapes and begins to hunt for sport, killing every dinosaur and person that it comes against. We see the new dinosaur hunt its prey in interesting ways blending into environments, clawing at thick skinned enemies or armour to find weak points and just charging dead on with brute force to chomp its enemies to bits. On top of the terror of this new dinosaur we also get plenty of cool scenes with trained velociraptors, who despite being trained like circus lions still always pose a threat to the human characters who risk being turned on at any moment. Their uncertain allegiance does lead to some pretty tense stare offs.Whilst the dinosaurs are great, the human characters are far less enjoyable. Most of the characters in the film are either idiots or just plain annoying. Just like the first Jurassic Park we get two new kids here that are visiting the park and who seem to do nothing but get in to trouble and become damsels in distress despite this being a family film and obviously never being in real peril. There's an underutilised Vincent D'Onfrio as a military type who wants to use the dinosaurs for hunting who doesn't seem to have much purpose in the film other than rubbing in the Jurassic Park message that corporations are bad. And Irrfan Khan as the park owner, who comes across as a more annoying, douchey version of Richard Branson.The only good characters are the leads Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). They're both the basic archetypes you'd expect in a blockbuster film playing the Pratt playing the typical quick witted action hero and Howard playing the park manager who goes from a busy bureaucrat to being a caring bad-ass. But they play the archetypes well by remaining likable and getting a fair number of laughs over the course of the film.At times the film does come off as being self contradictory in some of its messages. For example at one point in the film a character jokes about selling out to corporations and that they may as well just name one of the dinosaurs after them. But then the film sells itself out to corporations by naming several products they could name it and filling the film with many product placements from Starbucks to Mercedes. Then there's the way that they mock some blockbuster clichés like the woman ripping her dress up to become a bad-ass, but then indulges in others like the typical stereotypes.Other than one fight scene (which I won't spoil here) none of the fight scenes ever reach anything close to the likes of the iconic T- Rex scene in the first Jurassic Park. At times the action can even begin to feel a little dull or repetitive. And if you think about it too much then you'll be bound to find many plot holes. But there's still enough here to put it ahead of the previous Jurassic Park sequels and is still an enjoyable turn your brain off b-movie blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lot of this was so formulaic,"Making for a very predictable but somewhat, just barely, engrossing movie which relied heavily on the dinosaurs.It was so formulaic this could have been a parody with simply referring to characters, not by name, but titles like:01. Devious person (D'Onofrio) 02. Common sense person (Pratt) 03. Slow to come around person (Howard) 04. The kids (Robinson and Simpkins) 05. Egoist person (Khan) 06.

Maybe not.And you'd think after three disastrous events, they'd permanently shut down the park.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Turd,"All the bits and pieces that make up Jurassic world stink of dinosaur dung; it has plastic looking people, incompetent and rushed CGI, and silly dialogue hinging on equally silly concepts.The story kind of winks at its own over enfranchisement by depicting Jurrassic park as a failing enterprise that is doing everything it can to stay in business, including breeding new species of dinosaur. Jurassic Park in the cyberspace era includes pods, monorails and projections that are all more convincingly animated than the dinosaurs. It makes us yearn for the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston.Fronting the Cast is Chris Pratt, who is dressed like an Indiana Jones sidekick and is training raptors to respond to commands. Some may find this interesting but I found it laughable. The relationship with his domestic dinos loosely resembles a director trying to get an unwilling Russell Crowe to cooperate. Dinosaurs are far more interesting when they are in the wild.Then there is a moment where a shark is fed to a giant Marine Reptile which breaches like a whale to snatch it off a wench in front of a full audience. This kind of material is just as boring because it is condescending of its subject matter. Steven Spielberg's Jurrasic Park was a Safari in a real environment. This one is just an amusement park.Every scene in the movie (save one or two) feels like it was pulled from the script of one of the previous three films.

The film is for family,"I would like to commend the writer, director and the producer of the film as it is a new breed of Jurassic world with the enhanced graphics and thrilling action along the way. It is very appropriate for family bonding time. Very suitable for kids because the kissing scenes are less and skins showed are less. I will wait for the second part of this movie (hopefully there is) as it was ended openly. It brings us back to our childhood but the film itself was able to adapt to our contemporary trend through its action packed, mystery elements and it visual graphics. The dinosaurs really look like a real ones. The drama, comedy and importance of family has been reflected in the movie.

Visually-dazzling and undeniably entertaining thriller is relatively tame.,"Now, in no way does Jurassic World match or surpass the original, however, Chris Pratt conveys a certain element of wit and charm that was definitely missing from the third installment of the insanely-popular franchise. Flaws with the plot or the film's believability can be entirely overlooked because its intense create violence and peril never lets up. However, due to the movie's PG-13 rating, besides the extensive and slightly bloody dinosaur fight sequences, most of the violent and gruesome deaths occur off-screen. The swearing is limited to infrequent uses of ""s--t,"" and parents can expect a few suggestive remarks sprinkled throughout the movie's 124-minute runtime.

Thank you for bringing back my childhood memories,"I remember sitting in the movie in the first row watching Jurassic Park back in 1993. I was 9 years old and this movie touched my soul. Since then I'm a dinosaur and Spielberg fan. I saw that movie at least 20 times but tell you the truth the second and the third entry in the series didn't met my expectations. I only saw those 2 times.I was very happy when I heard that they started the production of Jurassic World but I had concerns as well. 22 years have passed and I grew up. When someone becomes adult it is much harder to bring his inner child to the surface and to enjoy a movie without criticizing small things and searching embarrassing goofs.I decided to go to the cinema without any expectations and try to spend the next 2 hours focusing on the fun factor.Friends, this was 2 hours well spent. I enjoyed every single second of this movie. The dinosaurs and CGI is unbelievable, the story is cool, the park is awesome and the characters are likable. The conversations are solid and there is lot of things to smile and laugh at. I almost forgot to mention the atmosphere: It's scary but also believable.

Not bad. Not great either.,"I almost turned this film off during the first 20 minutes. The formulaic cotton-candy intro was a bit too much to stomach. Instead, I walked to the kitchen and grabbed some food. By the time I got back, the movie had started to gradually get on its feet.As it turns out, this is a film that gets better as it progresses toward the ending. There are a number of warm-and-fuzzy family moments where characters try to develop through talk. This would work better if it wasn't so obvious that this was the intention of these scenes. I guess if there's a word that describes this film, it's ""overt"".No surprises here. Pretty much what you'd expect from this series.On a hair and make-up note, I see that the same pink lipstick is being used on the men. To the departments and the manual that you're consulting for color codes, please be aware that WE CAN SEE THIS COLOR ON SCREEN. It's worth updating the color so that it isn't so obvious on both the big and small screen (unless the tranny look is what you're aiming for). This is the third high-budget film I've seen with this phenomenon.So yes, go ahead and watch this film if you liked the other Jurassic films. However, beware if you're into hard-core dinosaur films -- you might find this to be a bit fluffy.I enjoyed this more than the first Jurassic film. It's much better than the second movie.

"'It's not Fellini, it's a dinosaur flick' and how I WISH I saw ANYTHING but, this...","The latest film in the 'Jurassic' franchise is here, and It's plot is creakier then the 4 previous flick - ALL pretty much copies of the 1st film.The makers of this 'film' follow the template for most Hollywood big-budget 'films' of the past few decades. In fact, everything which is wrong can be traced straight back to the first of these so-called 'blockbuster,' which was made by - who else - Spielberg.Since Spielberg showed Hollywood the 'blockbuster' way, with Jaws (A HUGER film - with a huge following prior to it's release, based on the numbers of people who had read the book), Hollywood's drastically changed - from making many films, with, perhaps, one film every year, or so, which would be called 'formulaic event,' i.e., The Towering Inferno, Earthquake, etc, to now, where most of each studios' budget's concentrated SOLELY on these 'blockbusters' - one for each season' - with massive budgets, big-named actors (where a BIG percentage of these things' budget goes), so they can (hopefully) recoup ALL the money in one, big fell swoop.Now, the following formula is followed;If you remember Jaws, it's dialogue was sparse - the film was mostly man vs. shark, and since Spielberg had to almost entirely concentrate on the action, his (in)ability to write (even decent) dialogue was irrelevant. This doesn't mean he was/is a good writer of dialogue - he isn't. He's terrible, which - in Hollywood of today, it doesn't matter, as it's all about international sales, and since dialogue doesn't translate easily, dialogue is irrelevant.But, action does, so, the makers' concentrate on it solely.Keep it simple, heavy on action, and make all major characters generic - as 'translatable' - as possible; the lead hunk hero, the (at the beginning) lead woman who's 'conflicted,' the 'Mcguffin,' as Hitchcock named it (Mcguffin is something in a film which seems to be important to the plot, but, in fact, isn't) in this film, it's the kids.Then, there's always a baddie (sorry, no spoilers),but, since that role's taken in this film by the real big (i.e; expensive) villain - the dinosaurs, the human part of the villain must be able to verbalise (at least) HIS intentions for doing what he did, or will do, etc. (it's usually ALWAYS about; money).Here, in this film, the makers get '100,' but, all this means is, it's hollow - predictable as 'which side your toasted bread will land on the floor?Before I continue, let me cite some lines from 2 opposing reviews, here;'Bad acting, bad plot, terrible acting, ham-fisted approach to storytelling, horrible acting, you name it. All of this - and more - is in this movie. It's basically a remake of Jurassic Park - it's the exact same premise, with mostly the same characters. Can Spielberg think of anything else other than child geniuses? 'Now, let me share with you someone who loved this recycled, re-heated mess; 'I loved this movie. I don't understand some of the negative ratings here. This is not a Fellini movie we're reviewing. It's dinosaurs. And plenty of the'No, it's NOT Fellini, nor does it ever pretend to be.The point this person is missing, is staring him in the face; WHY pay the (exorbitant) price to see it in a theatre, when you can rent the 1st for a fraction of the price, as it's nothing more than the same, exact film - only different character's names.It's like a movie 'Mad-Lib' - a fill-in-the-blank film; Sweet kids, one, a teen (make sure he's cute, and make sure it's 'wholesome' flirting he does), make the other kid younger, but, a genius - who'll save everyone at the last moment (the 2 aforementioned boys - one- the older - who appears to being groomed as Hollywood's latest hunk Jr.).  Male lead a cardboard copy in the Indiana Jones template macho hero (with a heart of gold), who's preoccupied by work too much to notice icy lady likes him - here played by Chris Pratt (who I really did like in the excellent, head-over-heels better than this garbage, Guardians Of The Galaxy. I would recommend THAT film over THIS dreck by far), lead woman with an icy exterior, but, inside, she's in love with male lead, and she'll have an inexplicable about- face from her initial iciness (played by the utterly charmless, interchangeable for any actress - Bryce Dallas Howard - a VEY poor man's Julianne MooreThrow in some baddies (the always t terrific Vincent D'Onofrio (I guess he needs a pay check) is here (as an antagonist)Popping up as a 'talking head role (literally - from her desk, to repeatedly exclaim things on her headphone mic), is Laura Lapkus as one of the park's controllers, who, if you watched Orange Is The New Black 1st & 2nd series episodes, was much better utilised in her role as a CO Susan Fischer, than here.The dinosaur CGI's act much better than the humans, because, they - the dinosaurs ARE the true stars of this dreck (As the 2nd quote I cited - from the person who loved this said, 'is NOT Fellini, it's dinosaurs'), and to be out-performed - appear LESS artificial THAN these CGI's, is really sad.I'm not a curmudgeon, I DO hate being pandered to, have my intelligence so mocked.This is a picture in which ANYone watching can tell what will happen next, who will live, who will die, WAY a before it happens.

"Good, BUT...","Well, i have been a fan of Jurassics for a while now and could not wait until seeing the last one. I need to tell you that the overall script and performances are rather OK. However, a lot more had to be done to make it excellent. Apart that a lot of scenes are taking part in darkness in the second part of the movie, the performance of kids is not convincing. And the hair of the madam'Rex is just terrible, to say the least. Maybe the hairdresser went straight from the Jurassic era? :D I could praise a bit scriptwriters for the rather fun dialogues, at least they were not annoying. Then, why the last scene of the movie the creature appears totally ""healthy""? Not even a drop of blood. So there are some thingies as credibility as well (apart from the sc-fi nature of the movie, of course!). The same goes for the rescue missions - where are tanks and heavy army machines? Why only men in shirts and bayonets? :))) Some bullets against the armour and size of dinos? Common.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Been there. Done that.,"Jurassic World, the popular dinosaur theme park, has a new attraction: the Indominus Rex, a genetically engineered monster created from the DNA of several different creatures. When it inevitably escapes and begins to chow down on everything in sight, dinosaur wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt) is called upon to help track it down.22 years ago my jaw dropped at the sight of CGI dinosaurs rampaging across the screen in Jurassic Park. Four years later and I wasn't anywhere near as impressed with the inevitable sequel, although that was probably more down to the lousy script than the special effects. 2001 and Jurassic Park III tried to make amends for Part 2 by going large, introducing viewers to the Spinosaurus. But while it may have been bigger, it didn't do the trick for most people—dinosaurs were so last millennium.The people behind the Jurassic Park franchise have wisely waited for a new generation of dinosaur fans before trying again. Now, fourteen years later, the park is once again open for business—and, boy, has it been doing a roaring trade, with record takings at the box office. It's spectacular, blockbuster entertainment for the masses, but the problem—for me at least—is that I've seen it all before: Jurassic World might feature a few new attractions, but it's essentially the same thing all over again. Not only was I bored by the predictability of proceedings, but I also became irritated by the excess of CGI, the lack of genuine suspense, the logic-free script, and the regular blatant product placements.The next time Isla Nublar opens for more dinosaur mayhem (given the money this film has made, I think that is a certainty), I reckon I'll save some cash and stay at home.5.5/10, generously rounded up to 6 for featuring my favourite dinosaur, the ankylosaurus.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Movie of the year!,"When I sat down in the cinema, I was expecting it to be a typically average sequel to the much-loved original. I was anticipating the odd scare and, admittedly, a lack of plot. I was very wrong. The film topped my expectations - it was a simply fantastic.Firstly, I really do not know why anyone is complaining. The only reason people are naming it ""disappointing"" is because of the first movie (which, remember, is one of the best films of all time). If Jurassic Park had never been made, there wouldn't be a single complaint.The gripping plot is full of thrills, scares, and even the odd laugh. From the very start, you fearfully anticipate what the consequences of engineering the Indominus Rex (the villainous Dino of the film) will be. In addition, although there are moments that reflect what happened in the other movies, the basic plot is original and there are a couple of surprising twists along the way.The special effects are brilliant. The dinosaurs were so convincing that I actually believed the were real, which only added to the tension I experienced from beginning to end. Although, apparently, not all the dinosaurs represent what they were actually like (the Raptors, apparently, had feathers on them - an image that would not be very scary) there is a reasonable yet non-confusing amount of science discussed in the film.The acting is also top-class. Ty Simpkins and Chris Pratt in particular give very convincing performances.During the movie, you also gain a developed understanding in the personalities of the characters, which is something most action movies lack. For people and humans alike, we get an insight into either their vicious or caring characteristics.I would highly recommend this film to anyone (although the movie may not be suitable for anyone younger than 9 or 10). And, with the greatest respect to people criticising the film, nobody should listen to them. Sadly, some people are never pleased.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Let Us Prey,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: Dinosaurs again prey on humans in this enjoyable but very predictable installment.GRADE: BChomp! The sideshow has finally arrived...once again! Thrills await! Step right up and see heroic derdoings! Gaze at the reptilian marvels on display before they are unleashed to the masses wreaking havoc on their prey. Watch damsels-in-distress flee from the monstrous hordes of wizardly lizards. (And man, can she run in high heels!). Witness scenes of spectacular state-of-the-art CGI. The media circus is here as the summer movie season descends with Jurassic World literally leading the pack for your attention and enjoyment.It has been 14 years since the last dinosaur outing of the Spielberg trilogy. This latest installment is not directed by him but he was involved in its making. Now, solidly directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World doesn't earn its rightful pedigree like its more original and innovative source, but it qualifies as delirious sloppy seconds in its earnestness to create scares and its ability to entertain.There is no sly wit, no clever banter, no memorable set pieces (like in the classic kitchen sequence with the Raptors in the original Jurassic Park). It just one chase scene after the next with no character development in sight. But the action is good and somewhat suspenseful. The dinosaurs are real and lifelike, especially compared to their human counterparts.Chris Pratt takes on his Indiana Jones role with much charm and bravado. Bryce Dallas Howard has the thankless stereotypical role of the icy career woman who will thaw out once she gets her man. Vincent D'Onofrio is all caricature, a cartoon villain and nothing more. Only Nick Robinson, Judy Greer, and Jake Johnson bring some nuance to their one-dimensional characters. Basically, the rest of the actors are just pawns to a weak script. They are there solely as appetizers for the scaly inhabitants of the island. The biggest shock is that this screenplay-by-committee was created by a quartet of writers (including the director) who were all unable to bring any depth or logic to this lamest of stories. The set-up is so formulaic from all of its other versions, even down to its incompatible couple and two children in peril.At best, the film lampoons our insatiable need for ""more"" thrills and targets our self-serving theme park mentality of instant gratification. Yet in so many scenes, product endorsements with the likes of Coca-Cola, Pandora, and Mercedes-Benz become glaringly blatant and lumber in gargantuan proportions that rival T Rex.One character in the film aptly states about the public's taste for entertainment, ""We want it bigger and louder...and with more teeth."" That may sum up our movie-going appetite as well. This upgraded fourth generation of dino-thrills may certainly possess two of the former descriptive terms, but it's in the latter category in which the film has no bite. Jurassic World, while still fun, is a bit toothless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IMDb needs a higher rating than 10/10,What to say about this film except this film was amazing. It definitely has the wow factor. Even after all this time you can't help be fascinated over the idea of a dinosaur theme park with real dinosaurs. The special effects actually look like they have brought dinosaurs back just to make this work. The film is fast paced as well as really funny in places. The little nods to the original are fantastic. Can't rate this high enough. It made me and my fiancé jump in places just like the original. Even the kids were better in this one. They actually did stuff. You have to go watch this film. Plus it shows that girls can do anything in high heels! The last main action scene was the pinnacle of the film and worth sitting through just to see the epic fight. Also who doesn't want to see Chris Pratt herding a group of Raptors??,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An awesome,thrilling entertainer but only if you like money making entertainers","JURASSIC WORLD Review- When i watched its first trailer i was stunned. Too much visuals and those horrible dinosaurs in trailer gave me jitters. Obviously its not first time we see it in Hollywood but it was something different for sure. Everyone was waiting for this horrible experience to release in theater so does me. My expectations were simple i just wanted an entertainment i wasn't expecting quality or good story from movie and after watching the film i can say i am completely satisfied with the movie. It entertained me lot,it kept me busy. I never feel bored while watching it. Makers never wanted to make it as critical acclaimed movie they wanted to entertain people so here they have made a complete money making movie. We have seen dinosaurs in movie before and enjoyed it but this time its not natural its man-made. Story is not that much good but screenplay is very tight and with short 2 hrs runtime it feels much much tight. Visual effects were damn awesome and in 3D its much lovable,it will blow you. If you will ask me what i liked the most in this film then it will be their technical work,vfx and eye catching visual effects. Direction was good. Director cared about what audience want from film and he gave it to us. Sound effects were thrilling it gave me goosebumps. Actors had nothing much to do in film cause film is centralized on dinosaurs still all actors did quite good job. Overall an awesome entertainer which you cant afford to miss. It will give you jitters,goosebumps and dinosaurs will scare you will blow you. Go for it 7 * stars by me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dinosaur Mayhem with a little Nostalgia Here and There,"Anyone who remembers seeing ""Jurassic Park"" as a kid for the first time knew they were going to see the promised dinosaur extravaganza ""Jurassic World"", no matter how good or bad it was. Luckily, I'm happy to say, the film was entertaining and it gave fans a little bit of what they always wanted to see: An opened and functional park that goes from being a dream to a nightmare! The story begins with two young boys - Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) - on their way to Jurassic World as special guests of their aunt, park curator Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). But, as you can probably guess, this isn't the best time for them to visit because soon, the park's new attraction, the genetically created Indominus Rex, will break loose and create, in the words of Dr. Malcolm, ""the essence of chaos."" With the the help of raptor whisperer Owen (Starlord himself, Chris Pratt!), does the group stand a chance?Lets start with the good. As someone who loved dinosaurs as a kid, this film delivers some of the best dinosaur action in years! The Indominus Rex is awesome looking, and as you probably know from the previews, this isn't your grandfather's T-Rex. It's highly intelligent, can camouflage, see in fared, and is something you don't what to come across (All the more reason why we should just go ahead and create it!). As the main villain of the film, the Indominus works as a constant and credible threat to the characters. Another dinosaur plus is the introduction of the sea reptile, the Mesosaurus, something that was never included in any of the previous installments. As for acting, I'd say everyone here did a good job, though the human star of the show is Chris Pratt. Channeling the cocky energy of his character from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Pratt provides some of the humor relief as well as a center of sanity in an insane situation. So much so, Pratt does a good job making you believe his character is capable of actually training raptors. Bryce Dallas Howard also gives a decent performance of the uptight Claire (Some have said her performance was forced, but I thought it was okay) as does Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoskins, a man seeking to use the raptors and Indominus as military weapons (What do you think the chances are of that succeeding!). The two kids here are okay, and at least they're not annoying enough that we want them to get eaten. It also helps that the filmmakers include a little nostalgia here and there, whether it's the cameo of Mr. DNA in the visitors' center, the casting of B.D. Wong in the role of Dr. Wu (the only actor to appear from any of the previous films) or seeing the remains of the old Jurassic Park and one of those old Jeep Wranglers.As for bad, there were some parts of the film that felt kind of forced, such as in the beginning when they were playing the theme music and trying to capture the magic from the first film but didn't quite succeed. Another issue concerns the level of CGI used. Anyone hoping for some animatronic action will be disappointed, as their is only one scene that features it. While some of the dinosaurs looked good in CGI, such as the Indominus and the raptors, on others it looks a bit cartoonish. Case in point, the T-Rex. Supposedly, this is the same T-Rex featured in the first film but you wouldn't know that by looking at it! The thing doesn't look anywhere near as cool and threatening as it did in the first one, particularly because its head looks a lot smaller and is poorly drawn. For all the money put into this film, you'd think they could have done a better job with it. Another issue is the lack of explanation as to how and why the park managed to be reopened. We know that the park has been open for about ten years but the film doesn't really give much background plot, something that I was really hoping to see. All in all, while ""Jurassic World"" is entertaining, it doesn't have quite manage to create that feeling of magic or awe that the first and even the second one were able to create, a magic you can still feel no matter how many times you watch them. Never the less, the movie is a big improvement over the third installment - which I don't think was quite as bad as some people said but no where near as good as the first two - and in the end, that's all we can ask. Either way, no matter how you feel about it, the movie's going to make a boatload of cash. If you're looking for some dinosaur fun and maybe even to capture some nostalgia of being a kid again, ""Jurassic World"" isn't a bad way to do it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh?,"Colin Terverrow's, 'Jurassic World' is a wasted opportunity. By all means the film isn't bad, just okay. The story feels like a retread of the first 3 movies, and hardly anything original is done in this flick. The acting is very good and the characters are extremely likable which Trevorrow is very good at, creating likable characters. Christ Pratt is a modern day Indiana Jones in this flick, he is very good and very fun. Bryce Dallas Howard is a lot of fun as well. The newcomer children actors are watchable until the 'divorce' subplot is introduced randomly. The music is excellent by Michael Giacchino, the new John Williams. The dinosaurs are fun for the first half when they are just being shown off, but become nonsensical in the films final battle. Far too many references to the original Jurassic Park, great acting, an annoying divorce subplot and a pointless military subplot, fun humor, nice visuals, a lackluster story. The die hard Jurassic Park fans will praise it, but the average movie goer can still have fun with this one. I do recommend this one",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
best film in the series imo,"this film is by far the most entertaining in the franchise in my opinion. Don't let the low ratings by some viewers fool you, this film is not as predictable as they say. To even say that the second film in the franchise is better than this is redundant as well. the CGI in this film is better and always will be more superior than the ones in the other movies. people expect this film to have a build up like the first film did but the first film already established what the dinosaurs were and what they had looked like. this film is not comparable to Jurassic Park 3 in any way as Jurassic park 3 had lazy writing in it. I will admit that the film had some subplots that led nowhere that were unnecessary. this film brought nostalgia to me and many others in the theater as we sat in for the first viewing of the evening. Colin trevorrow and cast did an amazing job. anyone rating this film low is not a true Jurassic Park fan as much they say they are. Jurassic Park had its major flaws as well. it's a fact that Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus were misspelled in the first film when nedry stole the embryos. if a few holes in the plot are enough to ruin the movie, that would ruin a film for me as well. this was better than the original Jurassic Park to me but to actually compare them would be a mistake. this film had its very own feeling but it did make me feel like a child again. I also refuse to acknowledge anyone's existence if they even say the CGI was bad or that the dinosaurs have a lack of feathers. this is Jurassic Park, a fictional novel turned film that uses improbable science to splice dino DNA with frog DNA. If that already doesn't throw out the book of paleontology for you, then i know nothing that will",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not As Good As The Original But Still One Of The Best.,"""Jurassic World"" was not spectacular at all but it was still good. One thing I liked about this film was the references or what I thought were references that were portrayed throughout it. This made the film a little more interesting and fun to watch. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct this film, to me it still proved to be one of the best along with the first of the series so I can only image how good it would have been if Steven Spielberg did direct it and I'm not just saying that just because Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite director/producers in the industry. I've read a few reviews saying that this film was better than the first. In my opinion it wasn't but it is good enough to stand on its own and be a good film to remember. Colin Trevorrow did do a good job in directing this film but he wasn't a Steven Spielberg. This film is loaded with action that will keep its viewer at the edge of their seat. The performances in this film were good as well. This along with the thrilling action and great visual effects made it a perfect popcorn fest. I have to admit, I wasn't too interested in seeing this film when it came out and when it got DVD but I eventually rented it, and with no regrets. Like I said before, it's nothing spectacular but it is good. You won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best Jurassic Park sequel so far,"The first Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite films. The second part had its moments but being nowhere as memorable. And the third was even more forgettable.One thing that distinguished the first one from the sequels was the island. Along with the dinosaurs and the story of adventure, also the park itself was an super interesting setting with its techno-thriller vibe. The sequels happening in some other islands just didn't create the same electrifying atmosphere.Jurassic World returns to the original island and even though the park is built brand new, there are still relics of the original park to be found which nicely ties together these movies. The story, even though quite similar to the original is still very interesting and exciting. The special effects are ok too, especially the end battle of the dinosaurs was quite cool (says me who is not a fan of cgi monsters). All of the characters are not the best possible but they do the job I guess. My biggest complaint is that the story is not explained enough to start with; John Hammond is mentioned but it is not told why is this random greedy woman leading the park and how did they get the licence from Hammond to recreate the park. And who is her sister whose kids are in the park. The reason why these characters are in the story seems random.Overall Jurassic World lacks the heartfelt atmosphere that was in the first movie but it's still worthy tribute and sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi adventure films, and quite an exciting movie in general.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tremendous Monster Movie,"Jurassic Park fans have been longing for its groundbreaking first movie to get the sequel it deserves. Jurassic World tends to skim the last two films and continues its own timeline by assuming that the Park was a success despite of the events of the first film. And the vast distinction is it manages to innovate what else behind this universe. We get to see more dinosaur species and what they're capable of, we're hooked on a particular mystery, we explore the history of the characters, and some tense moments that are perfect enough for a nerve- wracking thriller. The story is kind of strung with a lot of ideas and subplots, but surprisingly, the movie handles them well. Some of them end up being underwhelming, while some work for exceeding the action and some humanity. Overall, Jurassic World is a fun time at the movies.There are so much characters to focus on: we see the company trying to make a daring new exhibit for the park, then there's a sideline about Claire's two nephews wandering around the theme park, then it somehow centers a raptor trainer who happens to be the main hero of the entirety, and finally, we meet an oppressed security force leader who wants to use the raptors as soldiers/weapons. It's scattered around, but the movie knows how make them feel consistent. Some of them aren't too compelling enough, like the human villain who has an intriguing introduction, but ends up being a caricature. The two young brothers seem to have an interesting characterization, but they're stuck being some of the victims who run away from one disaster to another.But the real payoff here is the main villain: the Indominus Rex. Whenever the plot concerns the information and the threat of this dinosaur, it instantly becomes gripping. It also ties-in with intriguing questions about the genes spliced into this hybrid. Some of the answers may not be so mind-blowing and sometimes making the scientists behind it look even more unforgivably irresponsible. But nonetheless, it's always exciting figuring out the mysteries of this creature feature. The direction is slick and knows how to bring up tension. It may be overly CGI-ed and not as equally clever as Spielberg's direction, but the thrills are still spot-on. The camera also effectively represents the scale of this dinosaur which makes it visually terrifying. It's basically a loving tribute to classic monster movies.The characters are more interesting if you look onto their background and what they do rather than who they are. Again, not all of them are compelling, but if some of them manages to be one, then it's worth the attention. The better defined character here is obviously Owen, played by Chris Pratt, who is basically the action hero among who could have friendly connections with the dinosaurs, even if there are setbacks with their loyalty. The acting is decent, with Pratt showing everything he can do as an action star, but at the same time brings a new personality with it. Bryce Dallas Howard is supposed to carry the whole thing, and she does a well job in her role, but Pratt is the one who steals the spotlight.The clearest way to say is Jurassic World is the sequel that Jurassic Park deserves. The storyline is a little spotty, but still, it's smartly directed, full of solid suspense, and brings a satisfying degree of dinosaur craziness. It didn't surpass the quality of the original, obviously. This installment is more of a respect and inspiration to what Spielberg has done back in 1993. The update is cool, the innovative ideas keep the experience engrossing, and of course, it's a whole lot of fun. This is mostly the movie that we like to see for a Jurassic World.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jurassic World,"Everyone remembers the story where dinosaurs use to exist. Perhaps you have heard/Seen the movie ""Jurassic Park"" or the new one ""Jurassic World"". This story is about a group of scientists who made ""Jurassic World"" and they genetically created a modified Dinosaur killing intelligent machine! That manages to break free and camouflage to hide from the scientists and then eat them. So the scientist's and a boy named Grey are on a trip with his brother Zach to Jurassic World but didn't know there was a outbreak.So basically the whole start of the story isZachary ""Zach"" Mitchell is a teenage boy who was present for the incident at Jurassic World, with his younger brother, Gray.

Owen Grady is a dinosaur researcher employed by Jurassic World, and one of two main protagonists in Jurassic World, the other being Claire Dearing. He conducts a behavioral research on Velociraptors. Personally In my opinion Owen was a really good actor in Jurassic World and so Was Aunt Claire Gray did a pretty good job too it was intense in the movie and Zach was always the Hero in the movie, For example he jump started the Truck.The stuff I liked about Jurassic World was it was intense and dangerous and I felt sad and maybe I cried when the raptor part but you won't see me cry unless i'm really hurt. But the character I hated the most was Dr. Hoskins he is evil. The lesson I learned from this movie is don't mess with nature and or modify it otherwise we are all dead. I think others will learn not to trust their Aunt because Aunt Claire messed up she almost killed everyone with just a stupid modified dinosaur.The group of people I think would like this movie are adventure seekers maybe kids 8 Or 9 and adults but otherwise it's pretty intense and I would not",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid Requel to Kick Off a New Arch to the Series,"This one is a movie that I caught in the theater. I believe I would have been living on my own in Parma that first time I saw it. There was a second watch when I picked it up on DVD. I've now given it a third watch thanks to my wife, Jaime, when she randomly put it on. This isn't a horror film. I do pull it in as I look at these as almost kaiju films. We also have dinosaur mayhem as they attack people as well.Synopsis: a new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.We start at the house of a family. The mother is Karen (Judy Greer) and the father is Scott (Andy Buckley). They have two sons. The younger one loves dinosaurs and is a genius, Gray (Ty Simpkins). His older brother is Zach (Nick Robinson). He has a girlfriend that he is not too distraught to leave behind. They are going to stay with their aunt for a week as she runs the newer park from the synopsis, Jurassic World.Their aunt is Clarie Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). She is emotionless and all about the numbers. She meets with her boss, Masrani (Irrfan Khan). He is a billionaire that took the park over from Dr. Hammond. He cares about the public having a great time, but also wants the dinosaurs to be happy. This is an interesting concept. Claire takes him to see the new dinosaur they have created for the park. It is white and scary. It is a hybrid that was genetically created, named Indominus Rex. An easy part of it is the Tyrannosaur Rex. It also has a horrible attitude from being raised in captivity. It is also aggressive as it killed its sibling.We then get introduced to our star. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) has trained a pack of Velociraptors to listen to him. We also see that they are still wild animals when a new member of the staff is almost killed. Owen jumped in and saved him, in the nick of time. Owen speaks with Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) who sees a military application to having beasts like this. Pratt also works alongside Barry (Omar Sy) in their training.Gray and Zach arrive at the park. They met with an assistant to their aunt. She is Zara (Katie McGrath). She isn't great and much like her boss, is on her phone a lot. They do end up running into Claire, who tells them that she is too busy to spend time with them. They feel it and it bothers them. The two slip away from Zara and decide to have fun.Things take a turn when Owen is brought to the Indominus Rex pen. He asks questions and Claire shares what information she can. They can't find it inside of the pen though. When they go inside, they learn a terrible secret about it. It is inside with them. This new creature gets out and wreaks havoc on the park. Claire needs to find her nephews before it is too late. It also takes everything to get everyone off the island. It doesn't help when this dinosaur has lived in captivity and is now free. It doesn't seem to be killing for food but trying to find its place in the food chain.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is to say that I love this series and I felt this film was a solid 'requel'. I love that the first since it is epic to see the dinosaurs, but I love that a mere 22 years later, it is now old news. This keeps in line with how the world has moved on and this new version of the park needs bigger and scarier things to keep getting customers. That leads them to genetically modifying them to do this.I am going to stick to this idea. I'll also bring back up that this isn't a horror movie. Since I include things like Godzilla films or other kaiju stuff, that is why I'm doing this review. There are elements here though. There is a mad scientist element where we have Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) who created Indominus Rex. I like that he was a minor character in the original and has turned bad to make money. Even a commentary there on capitalism. There is a darker plot with him that I thought fit. Now we also have this new dinosaur wreaking havoc across the park. It is releasing other dinosaurs in its wake, which also attack the human guests. With the scope of the attacks and them even being quite brutal, I thought there was enough there for me cover it as horror adjacent.Next, I want to explore the 'requel' aspects. There are going to stretches here. Gray and Zach would be the two teens that come to the park. Originally, they were the grandchildren of Dr. Hammond. Here they are Claire's nephews. Masrani would be the modern Dr. Hammond. Claire almost comes off as the insurance guy. She does get a character arch though that is generic. Owen would be a variation on Dr. Grant. Moving away from these characters, the T-Rex and the Raptors were the villains originally. We need something bigger as this is a sequel. I do like that the T-Rex maintains that anti-hero status. Raptors also slide in there, as they are recognizable dinosaurs. We also get others here to ramp everything up.Sticking with elements here, I think I'll go to filmmaking. This isn't as impressive due to the original's existence. This goes CGI with the dinosaurs and it is fine. They threw a lot of money at it. You must know coming in that this is going to be a CGI-fest. The cinematography is good. There are similar shots and sequences that are homage to a requel. They also use elements of the original soundtrack while doing their own thing. This is made well enough so I won't harp too much.Other than that, let's finish out with acting. Pratt is good here. He has that look and charisma to be the hero. This isn't too far out of the realm of his role in Guardians of the Galaxy. I like Howard in his soulless role. She is given a redemption though that is fitting for a movie like this. I can appreciate how she plays this. Simpkins and Robinson are good as her nephews. I like the smaller roles from Greer and Buckley. Khan does well as this rich guy that we are supposed to like. I have my issues there. I'll also credit Jake Johnson, Sy, Lauren Lapkus and McGrath in their roles. D'Onofrio plays a great villain and I also like Wong here. The acting is fine across the board with no issues.In conclusion, this is a solid requel in my opinion. This is taking what the original did and building on. We are ramping up the tension by having the park open. We also introduce other real dinosaurs and even a genetic hybrid that is scarier than the villains of the first. The acting is solid. Their characters work in the framework of the story. I'd say this is made well enough. This is a CGI-fest, but it looks good. The rest of the filmmaking was solid as well. I think if you like the series, this one is fine. It doesn't stand out but they do similar things here, just a bit different.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
FANTASTIC sequel to a franchise that I absolutely support and LOVE!,"I was hyped out of my mind when the first teaser for Jurassic World came out in 2014 and while me being a huge fan of the franchise, I just had to go see this movie with my Mom and my sister. We went a couple weeks after the movie was released and it was possibly the greatest IMAX experience ever! I loved almost every minute and every second of Jurassic World and although it's not as good as the first Jurassic Park, I think it's equal to The Lost World which I also enjoyed. When we ere sitting in the theatre, I was already hyped when the Universal logo popped up on screen and that may tell you that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park Franchise and I love all of the movies minus Jurassic Park III which i'm not a huge fan of, but it's ok. And I had a BLAST with Jurassic World and I think the idea of adding the new hybrid The Indominus rex is genius! The story really hooked and caught my attention, the CGI was good enough, but I really think they should've added more animatronics and that would've improved the film because in this movie you will find A LOT of CGI and a very little amount of animatronics. The actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great! They're not as great as Sam Neil or Laura Dern from the first Jurassic Park, but they still are very good actors who play as very interesting characters known as Owen and Claire and their performances are really good in this film as well as the kids who are played by Nick Robinson and Ty Sympkins. Jurassic World really surprised me! In fact, it surprised everyone in my theatre. After the movie was over and the credits were rolling, the audience was clapping and I have NEVER in my life of any movie theatre experienced that kind of feeling and I felt very happy when I left the theatre. Jurassic World is a great sequel even it does not live up to the original,I respect it for what it is and I'm proud to be a fan of this franchise and i'm gonna give Jurassic World a 9.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Popcorn Fun,"A popcorn flick through and through, Jurassic World knows what it is and never tries to overstep it's boundaries, resulting in some dumb fun that's not a masterpiece like the original, or a dumpster fire like the third.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Back from extinction to make a fun theme park,"It is easy to forget the build up to this film. Jurassic Park had captured the imagination of the world, and is personally my favourite film. It was followed by two enjoyable sequels that failed to really capture that magic. 3 had failed so much that the series was put on hold for over a decade, and people genuinely thought it was killed off. Then came the trailers and posters for this, and the hype was enormous. When it finally did come out Jurassic World did what it said on the tin, and nothing more. But that isn't always a bad thing.Jurassic World has been open for years and has been successful. But (in a surprisingly meta move) marketing believes that audiences are tired of dinosaurs and that the way around the issue is to create something new, something bigger with more teeth. But when that gets out, a whole theme park full of people is in danger.Jurassic World did get some things wrong. There is a military subplot that goes nowhere and is really stupid, not to mention it wastes the talent of Vincent D'Onofrio. It over uses CGI, which doesn't always look the best. Despite the concept, there is only 1 scene where dinosaurs attack the public on mass. The rest of the film is very restricted, with four characters running through the jungle. The script feels like it was written by 2 different people or groups of people (it was), and that one of these groups was more skilled than the other (Jaffa and Silver).But Jurassic World also got a lot right. First off, it is a blast to watch! It doesn't capture Spielberg's magic, but it does thrill and awe in its own way. It is the tamest of the entire series, but it does feel a little more geared towards children than the others, which isn't a bad thing.It has some likable characters, who aren't as memorable as before, but you don't want to see them die, with a couple of exceptions. All are played by good actors. The story with the hybrid and the raptors is fun and well handled. I personally really enjoyed the kids part of the story, and could have followed them all the way through. While it doesn't reach the heights of the original, it does understand what made it special.The park being open was a wonderful treat. The one scene where crowds are attacked is great. The climax is one of my favourite action scenes of the 2010s. It's visually nice, has a wonderful sense of adventure and is simply good popcorn fun.World gets a lot of flack, especially after the release of the disappointing Fallen Kingdom and the even worse Dominion. But the fact that it had such hype and, for the most part, met it is a huge accomplishment. For my money, it is the best of the Jurassic sequels: being more creative than 3, not as confused as Lost World. It is just a bit of chaotic dino fun, which is fun for the family, even those with little kids. And in the end what more do you want.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bryce Dallas Howard,"I picked up this movie because I did like the first one at the time I was studying computers, and because I was bored a little. What I discovered is Bryce Dallas Howard.As soon as she appeared in a scene, I had a hard time concentrating on the story, that pathetically resembles the first one. Her delicate complexion, low voice, big eyes and chiseled features stole all the thunder from the elaborate, sometime downright ridiculous dinosoroid contraptions. I almost forgot about the annoying older kid and longed for her return on screen, sweaty and brave.A must if you are a refined redheads aficionado. Also if you are an unconditional of the first movie, since this is essentially a remake. Oh, I absolutely love Laura Dern, but seeing Bryce Dallas Howard in this movie was redemption to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
0/10,"The worst blockbuster and The worst performing of the year, it seems like was no director on the set. My favorite childhood franchise is ruined, thank you Howard and Trevorrow . If jurassic par 3 is 5.9 rating on IMDb, this movie must be rated 0, stupid unfunny family action, with no suspense, no thrilling, no logic, with white mutant dinosaur who symbolized - new CGI Hollywood era, who is killing old Animatronic dinosaurs ( scene with dying Diplodocus). Studios used our favorite characters for making stupid 12+ movies for big box office like the main human antagonist of this picture. No dark atmosphere, no rain, no jungle,no chase, only stupid jokes. The whole movie set in sunny day, u can't make a good movie without atmosphere, characters in JW talking that dinosaurs are no more interesting for people and specially kids, but problem in shitty performance , in woman as a lead character( this movie for teens for boys who care about redhead witch) , in shitty jokes, in cliché dialogues and good old dinosaurs and bad new dinosaurs, come on this is story about people vs nature, not about bad and good monsters. A lot of characters just disappeared with no end of their story line ( where is Omar Sy?) velociraptors are tamed by Chris Pratt, seriously!?!!? If you are shitty director- even great CGI dinosaur battle can't save ur adventure movie. The whole movie redhead witch is talking about budget of Jurassic World, wtf?

lacking in some areas but a good time overall,"More than two decades after the disastrous events that occurred on Isla Nublar, viewers are taken back to the same site now featuring a fully functioning dinosaur theme park as originally envisioned by entrepreneur John Hammond. Seeking a way to boost visitor attendance the park scientists create a new, genetically modified hybrid dinosaur known as the Indominus rex but, just like in years past, they quickly learn it's unwise to fool with Mother Nature when the creature escapes captivity and threatens the safety of everyone (both man and animal) on the island. Now the race is on as the park's head trainer (Pratt), and the park operations manager (Howard), attempt to quell the crisis before some venal corporate types can carry out their own agenda. When it comes to the innovative special effects or the sheer imagination of the original this is nowhere in the same league, and lacks some really important exposition, but as a non-stop thrill ride of action, suspense, humor, and crowd-pleasing moments, it definitely fits the bill. Lacking in the development of story, character, and science, but if you take it for what it is (a big, Jurassic action movie), then it should be great fun. **½",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but maybe a little too incoherent in story,"Although extremely unrealistic and incoherent in the actual story line, this movie achieves its purpose to thrill and entertain the audience through high-quality visual and sound effects. No one actually expects any kind of emotive story or philosophical meaning in these kinds of movies. However, even without looking at the part about how well it delivered any kind of a message to the audience, there are flaws and inconsistency in the flow of the plot. There are also happening that really were not necessary, and some parts were just way to unrealistic that it made me lose focus and cringe at it. For example, there is no way a woman in skirts and heels can faster, or as fast as a T-Rex, even if it's a fake, man-made one. But still, the movie didn't get boring in any part unless the easily predictable story line does. For me, I didn't mind the usual old story, because I had watched it for the physical experience itself of watching the magical creatures and being scared by the way-too- loud roaring and screaming of both dinosaurs and humans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dino might!,"It's been quite some time since the initial disaster on Isla Nublar, and the late John Hammonds' dream of a fully functioning dinosaur theme park has finally come to fruition. Thousands flock to an island paradise where they see the mighty lizards put on display. Naturally, since this is meant to be a thrill ride, colossal human error will dictate that our ferocious antagonists get loose and wreak havoc on park visitors and personnel. Chief among them is a genetic freak called an ""Indominus Rex"", created because at this point people supposedly consider ordinary dinosaurs passe.One has to put up with some ridiculous, insipid characters and lame dialogue in this, the most recent entry in this ongoing franchise, but if all you want is to see big lizards run about and attack and eat people, you'll get it. Director Colin Trevorrow, with the assistance of such talents as production designer Ed Verreaux, cinematographer John Schwartzman, and editor Kevin Stitt, is able to create lots of brainless thrills. And make no mistake, it is pretty brainless. There are the standard absurdities to tolerate on the way to enjoying ""Jurassic World"". The main ones would be these human characters. This viewer certainly wouldn't have minded seeing most of them, if not all of them, become dinosaur chow. Surviving with his dignity intact is studly Chris Pratt, as a guy who's actually succeeded in training raptors. Forced to play a real archetype is Vincent D'Onofrio as a schemer who believes the ""Indominus Rex"" and the raptors would make excellent military weapons.The dinos, of course, are the *real* stars of this show. The visual effects are generally pretty good, and we see menaces that also include an enormous swimming mosasaur and numerous pterodactyls. Things get a little too precious, however, when we consider the bond that Pratt has developed with his raptor friends.The finale pulls out all the stops for any lover of dinosaur cinema, so things do end on a reasonably high note.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A new entertaining movie in the franchise.,"Wow. I did not see another sequel coming. Or is it a sequel? Yes, it is.The original ""Jurassic Park"" from 1993 is a classic and the best dinosaur movie ever made. Then it got two sequels, one starring supporting actor Jeff Goldblum, and one starring lead actor Sam Neill for the second time. The sequels are pretty underrated, and they just stopped making more. Until 2015, a giant blockbuster I bet you didn't see coming. Yeah, what was once a park, is now a world. Jurassic World!This was a great way to start a new trilogy. This is is half a sequel, and half a reboot. It starts a new series while continuing another. And it works pretty well. Now we're able to see the diosaurs eat people in modern fashion.This is what a dinosaur movie should be. It doesn't surpass the original in any way, but does the most of the stuff perfectly well. There is for example a scene where Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson jump down a waterfall when they're escaping from a dinosaur. And I spend a lot of time thinking if I would do the same thing? I hate heights, but I'm not a big fan of being eaten alive by a dinosaur either. So I would certainly jump.Now, let's talk about the casting. I love the cast of this movie. In lead roles, you've got that guy from Parks And Rec and GotG, and that lady from Spider-Man 3 and Rocketman. In smaller roles, you've got Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson (Love, Simon) as the nephews of Bryce Dallas Howard. They're lovely in this movie. You've also got that guy from The Office and that girl from 13 Going On 30 as their parents. Fun fact: How likely is it that Judy Greer played the same role as a family mom who's worried for her family in Ant-Man (which also came out the same year). I even had forgot that actors like Jake Johnson, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lauren Lapkus was in this movie. I recently rewatched this movie, after 5 years.But everything in this movie is a blast and fun to watch. The only thing I don't like in this movie, is the final battle between two major dinosaurs (don't remember any dinosaur's name). It feels a little bit boring, but not, like, ""boring"" as the final battle in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (which, btw, was not boring), but boring like the whole Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. It literally has one hour total destruction with two monsters fighting each other, and guess what?? I slept through the whole thing. But in Jurassic World, it only lasts for like fifteen minutes.But besides for that, this is a very fun movie to watch, and I liked it a lot. Not as good as the first one, but good enough to entertain (cause that's the whole purpose).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic World Sets a Record???,"Summer is here. It may not be here on the calendar but it is here in Hollywood. The Avengers Age of Ultron kicked the summer movie season off in May and the big budget blockbusters have rolled in week after week. As for me, I saw Age of Ultron and I held on to my precious dollars until this highly anticipated film.Jurassic World set a single day record this weekend bringing in $511M internationally and $209M domestically. That's an insane amount of money. I never expected it to do that well. I'm old enough to have seen Jurassic Park in 1993 and that movie was a game changer, an absolute classic. Jurassic World was good, but record setting good??? I wouldn't say that.Jurassic World looked to me like a remake of Jurassic Park with more people and the assumption that you know all of the DNA stuff. Again there were two kids without their parents, a male hero somewhat knowledgeable of the animals, a fat guy looking for a chance to exploit the dinosaurs, a security system not quite up to snuff and a big toothed predator on the loose. Of course there were some storyline differences to differentiate it from the original as well as the other two sequels; and there were shades of Deep Blue Sea and Man's Best Friend.The characters were bearable enough although there was an interesting dynamic between the kids and their aunt whom they were visiting. If you don't get too caught up into the characters and the potential symbolism of each of them then you can really enjoy the movie. This is just a purely entertaining movie of man v. beast with some excellent ""oooh"" moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Riding with the raptors through the jungle - awesome,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the sci-fi action adventure flick Jurassic World (2015) the sequel or should I say, soft reboot of the Jurassic Park series. We find ourselves in a world where after twenty so years we now have an active park open for business in Isla Nublar. That's right, after the disaster of the original park, the island also known as Jurassic World, is open to the public. Won't people ever learn? So now we have dinosaurs and people, like a zoo however in the background we have scientists and greedy people who are continuously exploiting the study of genetics. Due to the executives needing to gain more market share and more money, they need more impressions which means, more teeth. The scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur, the Indominus Rex and what happens when a monster is created from the science lab escapes from its cage? It prowls around onto the park with a knack to hunt and kill...so yeh everything goes horribly wrong!This new world still touches on the original series, which can be highlighted by the control guy wearing the original Jurassic Park shirt proudly. The new flick has awesome new characters - one in particular played by the always cool Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, an ex-military who trains a group of raptors since they were hatched. He plays out the alpha to the raptors. Grady's character understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not science tests. Pratt's performance is awesome here, the motor bike scene through the jungle among the raptors on the pursuit of the Indominus Rex was savage and gangster. His training of the raptors and his bond with one in particular, Blue is cool as. The co-stars including Bryce Dallas Howard playing as Claire has her own moments from a corporate marketing slave to yeppp we stuffed up and now its to save people I love and survive. One thing I do not get is what is with the heels????? To me I feel like the writers held her back, she did have a cool bit with the T-Rex, but again the heels?? As mentioned, there are throwbacks to the original including the mad scientist Dr. Henry Wu, the DNA cartoon which you see for a second or two, the analogy of birds and dinosaurs, how flares hype up a T-Rex and Hammond's ""spare no expense"" phrase.The director does justice in this film by ensuring there is a homage to the original films while making this new flick its own. There are other great parts including the Indominus Rex having camouflage like abilities, an unlikely prehistoric duo battling the Indominus Rex, which is really impressive and a great watch of the final battle. I also like how the T-Rex went through the Spinosaurus skeleton as a nod to the third flick 😉 A few nods include the pterosaurs flying around the resort and the death of an unlucky assistant who gets devoured by the park's whale like attraction, the Mosasaurus. Unlike its original predecessor there is no animatronics, so the film is heavy on the CGI. If you like action and adventure and how man and dinosaur can fight side by side, then watch this film - overall 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

History is Bound to Repeat Itself!,"The events of Jurassic Park were nightmarishly thrilling, and are etched into many a mind along with only the best of the best cinematic moments of years gone by. The events don't, however, seem to be etched well enough into the minds of those running Jurassic World, the massive dinosaur theme park that would leave original visionary, John Hammond, beaming with delight. Set twenty-two years after those fateful events, the fully functioning theme park that now occupies Isle Nublar faces dwindling crowds, as visitors grow weary of familiar attractions. In a bid to draw back the masses, a corporate mandate oversees the creation of a new attraction in the form of a hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus rex. Happily for us, the fun merely begins here; although I am sure the island's occupants would strongly disagree.Effects well advanced for their time were what made the original films stand out, and if the effects were good then, they are phenomenal now. The dinosaurs are so realistic; every twitch on their face as they breathe draws you further into the frantic chaos that unravels. Jurassic World certainly ups the 'wow' factor, leaving you awestruck in childlike wonder. There is no comparison to experiencing the might of some of earth's most fearsome predators, with which humans could most definitely not share the planet. The narrative world grows infinitely vaster as new habitats are explored and new exhibits revealed. As Hammond would insist no expense be spared on the park, it seems no expense was spared on creating the films environments, which are truly a spectacular sight.An early released scene, featuring Chris Pratt's Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing debating the park's new addition, received a brutal assessment from Avengers helmer, Joss Whedon. The apt description is unfortunately not limited to that scene, as the ""70's era sexist"" theme seeps further into the plot than could have been intended. Apart from some dodgy dialogue and an incredibly ill timed love story, the leads pull off their roles well. Owen embodies the essence of an alpha male, quite literally when leading a pack of Velociraptors, and Claire, despite her stickler tendencies, proves that she can hold her own, even if it is in heels throughout.Jurassic World explores an interesting human condition: our tendency to bore easily. In a world where tech grows more refined by the day, and scientific leaps are becoming more regular, there is little left that truly amazes us. So when dinosaurs on display have become the norm, people will naturally want more. This in turn invites scientists to push the limits of what is possible; too far in this case. The park's geneticists experiment with an ancient, extinct species, in an attempt to create bigger and better, without full knowledge and understanding of the potential consequences.While the geneticists play 'design-osaurus', an enclosure is created that proves completely unsuited to the formidable creature it is intended to contain. Far more intelligent and subsequently more dangerous than they could possibly have imagined, the Indominus rex renders the park's resources and infrastructure largely inadequate. In an attempt to swiftly clear up a potential financial and reputational disaster, poor planning and lack of preparedness only exacerbate the situation. Jurassic World's shiny new addition is quickly figuring out where it belongs in the food chain, and what they don't want it to realise is that it holds the top spot.You would think a genetically modified dinosaur would ring instant 'bad idea' alarm bells, but failure to see the magnificent creatures for anything other than assets on a spreadsheet means that history is bound to repeat itself to an epic extent. The action certainly doesn't hold back; these creatures are built to kill and the film shows their immense power with chilling consequence. To top it all off, references to the original films, mostly due to Lowery's (Jake Johnson) fondness for collectibles, serve as delightful treats to fans. Jurassic World is not perfect, but will no doubt be a colossal crowd pleaser.https://lilmac4.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worthy successor,"A worthy successor to Jurassic Park. Fares much better than the other sequels but lacks the story and character depth of the original masterpiece as well as the its killer suspense. The performances are solid and the direction is decent but a little generic.It however makes up for it with great special effects, fantastic action sequences and an immense amount of bloody dino carnage. At times it can be a bit much but it holds together fairly well and culminates to a ferocious finale that left the audience screaming and clapping.

3.25/5,"Here we are again. In the year of studio attempts to re-vitalize dead sci-fi franchises, it's Jurassic Park's turn. We all know how most of these types of films turn out(Mad Max excluded.) It's rare when the fan base of a film embraces one of these. They've got greed, marketing, and goals to make it big overseas all over them. So it's up to the director and the writer to try and get around it, to get their vision worked into to something that is the closest thing to a manufactured product in the movie industry. With this film, director Colin Trevorrow(Safety Not Guaranteed) has tried to turn it into a ""meta"" joke. Constant references to how ""the old park was cooler"" or how ""these dinosaurs are becoming products"" are funny when they work, and a little painful when they don't. And that's basically the movie. When it works, it re-captures, if not Spielbergian wonder, at least early Michael Bay. When it doesn't, it feels more like late Michael Bay. In the film, Jurassic World is a national sensation, and they are trying to boost their sales by making a ""new dinosaur."" In the indominus Rex. The head of all this is a caricature of a working woman, who is super-organized, not married, and bad with kids(a worn out cliché we've seen a thousand times.) She's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who's fine, though she's not given much. When said dinosaur escapes, she teams up with a sexy man with huge abs that's basically good at everything. This caricature of a male hero is played by Chris Pratt. He's definitely the joy of the movie. His lines are the funniest, hit the hardest, and made me wish I was watching Guardians 2. To further complicate things, Dallas Howard's two nephews are also in the park. One is really horny and the other is sad about his parents divorce. A representative from Ingen(Vincent D'Onofrio) is trying to buy velociraptors for war in the middle east. That actually happens. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is asinine, and when Dallas Howard breaks down and cries over a dead dinosaur when she's just watch 10 humans get brutally murdered, I lost all hope for a return to form for the franchise. There's also the matter of the child performances. It's safe to say that most sitcoms get better kid actors nowadays. But, on the positive side of things, the film looks great, and the action is shot well. That in itself is a revelation. When Pterodactyls fly over a screaming crowd, when a giant sea monster eats a shark, when the indominus Rex attacks, it feels like a real blockbuster. In one scene, an assistant suffers a prolonged demise at the hands of several dinosaurs. It's easily the best scene in the film. It feels like the original, when a greedy lawyer met his end in a prolonged sequence inside a bathroom stall. Like I said, a lot of the self-referential jokes actually work, and add a bit of depth to this otherwise childishly shallow affair. Honestly, ""Jurassic World"" isn't terrible, but it's certainly not good either. It's a bit of a mess, but a mess that kind of works. It's just okay, and for a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, just okay is not good enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Originality is extinct,"Director Collin Treverrow's 'Jurassic World' certainly looks great.

I get that a movie about rampaging dinosaurs isn't exactly going to be a character study, but the original still managed to give us at least a little characterization for our human players.

Jurassic World will just make you completely forget all the movies you saw including the OK-good ones like avengers and mocking jay. This movie completely makes all the other movies look like sh*t honestly. It was the best movie I've seen since probably the last Harry Potter, Inception, or the dark knight. I just don't understand how this movie has a 7.5, I mean it doesn't deserve a 9.2 like the godfather but it should have a solid 8.7. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertainment, for people that forgot what entertainment really is","When 12 years pass by from a truly epic, genre defining film, expectations will always be at a high. This is a film that grossed hugely at the box office, regardless of anything I could possibly say.One word from me:Disappointment.The effects, in some bizarre, alternate universe, feel worse than the early ILM days of JP1. With all the cutting edge effects, teams of VFX & SFX gurus's, somehow JW just doesn't manage to muster a single set piece that incites fear, panic & sweat like the original.To watch this, is to really understand what a director like Spielberg truly commands. A single cohesive vision. I could complain about the characters, the plot, the poorly textured dinosaurs, but it would be completely fruitless. You'll all watch it anyway. The film discerning public will all leave with a taste of 'meh' in their mouths. It's fun, but fun that will almost never be re-visited.Spielberg is a genius and this film simply serves as a testament to that, and not much else.6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Predictable But Very Enjoyable,"Scientists and corporate companies never learn do they ? Surely Universal Studios cant be so short of money that they need to resurrect a franchise that finished fifteen years ago ? That said dinosaurs have an absolute fascination to humans in general and children in particular and I used to love these dinosaur movies courtesy of Ray Harryhausen and who can forget the classic DOCTOR WHO story Invasion Of The Dinosaurs where the population of London has to get evacuated due to the sudden appearance of papier mache reptiles . In short you can't go wrong with dinosaurs if you're after mass commercial appeal . Despite the dangers of flogging a dead horse Universal are probably playing things a bit safe by bringing out another franchise filmAnd play it safe they do . There's not a lot of originality on display here and much of the first half plays out as you might expect it . These greedy corporate capitalists have changed the balance of nature by opening a theme park featuring animals that died out tens of millions of years ago and worse than that they've modified the dinosaurs so that not only do you think you're watching a retread of the original JURASSIC PARK movies complete with the same musical soundtrack you're also watching a reworking of The Company from the ALIEN movies . This is also reflected in the rather one note , thin characters who populate the storyAt this point you might start worrying Universal fleeced out of the price of a cinema ticket and you're getting more of the same that you got with the first three films but the saving grace here is just how nasty things get . My problem with the second JP is once the action switches to mainland America there's not much in the way of a high body count , This is certainly not a problem here and director Colin Trevorrow knows what the audience wants and gives it to them by the bucket load as numerous faceless red shirt types suffer all sorts of spectacular deaths . It might sound a little bit mean but I was surprised as to how enjoyable the action scenes were . Spectacular deaths and dinosaurs ? What more do you want from a blockbuster ?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty Dinos; Mediocre Storytelling,"""Jurassic World"" was a letdown. The dinosaurs look as real as cinematic dinosaurs have ever looked. The storytelling is thuddingly dull. I loved the Steven Spielberg / Michael Crichton 1993 ""Jurassic Park."" During this film I kept looking at my watch. Even the music is used badly here, something you notice in the first five minutes of the film.The plot: Jurassic Park has been updated to Jurassic World. Two cute boys visit without their mother. Their aunt is Bryce Dallas Howard, spokeswoman for the park. Vincent D'onofrio wants to weaponize the velociraptors, to use them in the fight against Al Qaeda. Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer. Jurassic World has genetically modified dinosaurs into indominus rex, a larger version of a tyrannosaurus rex.Chris Pratt is hot and masterful and deserves a better movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty but lacks charisma. Vincent D'Onofrio's twitchy, creepy opportunist is the single most interesting and menacing performance in the movie, and that includes the dinos.None of this – the two cute boys, the absent mother, the aunt-nephew relationship, Pratt's animal training skills, the weaponization of velociraptors – matters worth a darn. Each subplot is given approximately five lines of dialogue and four minutes of screen time. BD Wong pops up at the last minute and he acts like a mad scientist for about ninety seconds; that subplot goes nowhere like all the rest.There are many scenes of people in a control room staring at a large video screen. Sometimes on screen action is presented in a color- bleached format, to resemble the image on a computer screen. This control-room-point-of-view device serves only to break up the action into smaller, shorter bites, because in the internet age we all have shorter attention spans and we see reality as on a computer screen, don't ya know.The opening scenes show visitors enjoying the park. Then of course something goes wrong and the I-rex escapes. The I-rex eats a bunch of people. Some escapees find a twenty-year-old Jeep from Jurassic Park days and drive it away from the I-rex. I don't know much about cars but I do know that there is a car in a local parking lot that's been there for three months and two of its tires have gone flat. I would believe that you could make dinosaurs out of amber before I could believe that a twenty-two-year-old Jeep could be driven.People outrun dinosaurs, if they are people the movie wants to survive. If they are extras or bad guys, no such luck. And why is it such a bad idea to use velociraptors to fight Al Qaeda?Bryce Dallas Howard outruns dinosaurs while wearing spike heeled shoes. Really.It's amazing that dinosaurs have one goal in life – to eat as many people as they can – given that dinosaurs and people didn't inhabit the earth at the same time. An aviary containing pterodactyls is broken. The pterodactyls swarm out of their aviary and have one goal – to eat people. All the pterodactyls immediately fly to the park full of humans and start snapping them up as if they were potato chips – you can't eat just one. This is especially ridiculous given that pterodactyls were lightweight dinosaurs who evolved to eat fish.Animals in nature kill to eat, to defend their young and their territory, and to establish dominance. Killing is hard work and animals conserve their energy. They don't burn up any more precious calories than they absolutely need to. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years annoying one of earth's largest land carnivores, Kodiak bears, before one couldn't take it any more and finally broke down and ate him. Dinosaurs in Jurassic World race through forest, swamp, and parking lots, top speed, mile after mile, passing up other potential prey, in order to eat one particular human being. No real animal has ever behaved that way.I just didn't care about this movie at all. I missed the original. Wayne Knight, the obnoxious fat guy, and Jeff Goldblum, and his priceless pronunciation of ""chaotician."" I missed Spielberg's magic touch in moments like the impact tremor in the footprint and ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nostalgic Masterpiece,"Honestly, Colin Trevorrow didn't fail Jurassic Park fans when creating the Jurassic World. He created a masterpiece, that contiunes right where it was left in Jurassic Park III in 2001. And including easter eggs from Jurassic Park like the old building, tshirt and the car? that gave me goosebumps!
This movie not only reminds you how beautiful the story is of restoring Dinosaur and put them in place where people can see them, but also how advanced science can be a messed up thing if you play with it too much and can create a deadly weapon if it got abused...
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're Jurassic Park series lover",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So dumb. So awesome.,"If I were to tell you the dubious sequence of sheer unlikely happenstance that leads to, well, the whole plot of JURASSIC WORLD, you would shake your head in abject wonder. Wonder at the downright ballsiness of the writers who decided to make coincidence their bitch throughout proceedings. Wonder at the director who pondered the laws of random chance and decided statistical anomalies happen all the damn time, not to mention consecutively and to the very same people. And then you would stop shaking your head, and simply begin to wonder: why don't I care?After which, since I am certain you have seen the first movie, along with possibly one or both of the earlier sequels (the second being the slightly lesser of two evils, but only in the same way that Kourtney is less insufferable than Kim), you would doubtless realize why it is that all the shoddy plot-devicing, lame expositioning and cynical jump-scaring does not matter a jot. Because the first JURASSIC PARK was also full of shameless flukes and incongruous twists of fate, but you, me, we all loved it anyway. Because: DINOSAURS.And here, woah are there dinosaurs. There are dinosaurs of so many shapes, sizes and varieties that they had to make up a whole new kind of one just to keep things interesting, because people apparently suck and somehow dinosaurs being ALIVE and IN ARMS REACH can get so very dull after a while. See, the folks at InGen, the company founded by the late demented, er, lamented impresario John Hammond have somehow recovered from no less than three deadly dino-rampages across a couple of decades – not to mention the pterodactyls that remained at large in San Diego at the end of III – and have built themselves a theme park the likes of which crazy old' Hammond could only have dreamed. Twenty thousand visitors a day, we are told not infrequently, now visit this exotic CGI wonderland on the ill-fated Isla Nublar in order to be dazzled by formerly extinct life- forms both docile and dangerous -- because, yeah, obviously. There are DINOSAURS there. No one is going to worry about that one time Newman from SEINFELD got killed when you can go hang with a Stegosaurus and be all like, whatever man.Overseeing all of this marvel and majesty is Claire (the preternaturally beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard), a woman who has time to painstakingly maintain a shiny blowout in South American humidity but not to take personal charge of the nephews she hasn't seen in seven years. These nephews have been sent thither because there is Trouble at Home – of which we are told but honestly DO NOT CARE and why this is even a thing we are told WE DO NOT KNOW – but Claire is far too busy getting Verizon to sponsor an exhibit (hello, one of many product placements!) and engaging in a love-hate romance with heroic raptor trainer Owen (an even-buffer-than-GUARDIANS Chris Pratt) to escort them around the park. Too busy, that is, until a convoluted and bordering on impossible string of nonsense conspires to see the boys – the older of whom is Ryder from MELISSA AND JOEY, and no, you may not mock me for knowing that – lost in the rain-forest with, and you won't even believe this, a killer dinosaur on the loose.The killer dinosaur on the loose part is actually good news for Ryder from MELISSA AND JOEY, because it is one of the few times he notices he's on an island full of dinosaurs. See, he's a disaffected teenager with Beats by Dre headphones and an eye to the cuties, so Triceratops rides and baby dino petting zoos are kids' stuff, yo. He's all about the hardcore adventuring, like recklessly taking his dinosaur-obsessed little brother deep into a restricted zone in a personal gyroscope that I hope is a real thing, and thence almost getting killed by, and you won't even believe this, a killer dinosaur on the loose.So it is up to the sparky Claire and Owen to save the boys, and also try, and you won't even believe this, to stop that killer dinosaur on the loose from killing everyone on the damn island. All the usual suspects are present and accounted for: there's a mad scientist, a mad billionaire and a mad weapons dealer (the always excellent Vincent d'Onofrio, in a very strange choice of role). There is also a somewhat mad but lovable system tech (NEW GIRL's Jake Johnson) who is the funniest thing in the film by far, since Pratt plays his action hero lead almost entirely straight—and, somehow, with a straight face. ""THAT is no dinosaur!"" he pronounces sternly at one point. Riiight.But it is actually the dinosaurs who do most of the heavy lifting in this movie, and it is for them that you really need to see it. Because you know what the other movies in this franchise were always missing? Giant dinosaur death matches! And, much like TRANSFORMERS – giant robots vs. giant robots! – and PACIFIC RIM – giant robots vs. giant monsters! – it is this spectacle that makes all the wackiness here worthwhile.There are several reasons to see this movie. Nostalgia is definitely a factor, as is the cast, as are the stunning visual effects up to and including the kick-est-ass dinosaurs you have ever seen on screen. The only real reason not to see it is that it has so many story problems it would make a daytime soap writer working on this month's seventh amnesia plot line grimace incredulously. But really, if you like dinosaurs, and if unconscionable acts of improbable concurrence aren't a deal-breaker for you, then I'm betting you'll find JURASSIC WORLD and its killer dinosaurs on the loose so much fun you won't even believe it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Started well, then got mediocre, ending was just remake","When I saw that there are 4 scenario writers I was even in dilemma about watching it at all. That's always a bad sign, and means usually inconsistent, at times messy plot and other not good things. While I'm sucker for dinosaur movies. Later prevailed, so I went to watch it. It was better than expected in first 30 minutes. Not that whole family picture and departure was even close to something original, but was decent, and idea and explanation of need for creating new, more spectacular dinos because ""classic"" ones became boring is actually pretty realistic description of today situation in entertainment industry.Idea about training raptors is a bit of extreme, but don't forget that raptors were shown in Crichton's book (where all this started) as super intelligent, fast, cooperative specie. At least in movie they gave more realistic top speed for them than in book (80 instead 100 km/h) . Talking about 2 leg ones, just to add. But here ends short list in what this could be better than book, or first two Jurassic movies. Character development is just poor, 2 main character relation development was what made me laugh couple times - kiss in first place, then wise words at end :-) a CGI was not bad, but could be better in 2015. For a World, there should be really more dino species shown.Now the bad, and very bad part(s): lot of it was just replica of first Jurassic movie, and little from second: the kids on Islar, stupid park (Island/World) control ... Ending should be some climax, but it was just lame. There was no sense in that attacking of I-Rex by raptors after what happened before. And all it was in first movie, almost same. I hope that everyone saw it, so this is not spoiler. It seems, that writers went out of ideas completely at end. Military subplot was also pretty lame, and really unrealistic - not that I think about them as some very smart people, but this was way too low.Rating is still 6 after all bad words about, because good start, some good (for pure fun) scenes, like attacking by pterodactyls.

The Jurassic Park Sequel We Deserve,"This film made be feel like a kid again. The sheer terror of the Indominus Rex, the terrifying raptors, and relatable characters who all bring their own message, whether it be innocence and wonderment with Gray, the obsession with technology with Zach, the obsession with money with Claire, or just having a good time with Owen.The park is well and truly open. The sheer number of people in danger was fantastic to see how they each individually coped with the dinosaur rampage. Excellent coordination from Colin Trevorrow, every extra knew their job and did it well.You'll have goosebumps the first time you hear the theme tune.Colin Trevorrow took the might task of reviving Jurassic Park, and he completely blew it out of the water.

How freaking AWESOME is it that they made a new JP film!?!?,"HOW FREAKING AWESOME IS IT THAT THEY MADE A NEW JP FILM!? I was actually squirming in my seat as the opening credits started to roll. (Note to self – to prevent severe anxiety in future, ditch your mates and see a highly anticipated film on opening day, instead of waiting 4 DAYS so you can see it with your Buds. The struggle was real). I mean, look, I'd seen the trailer, I knew going in that it looked a bit shady, some dodgy dialogue and hollow characters, but that didn't dampen my excitement – I mean, its Jurassic Park man!! Right?!?! Dun Daaaa, Dun Daaa, Dun Dun Daaaaa, da dun dun daaaaaaaa.So if you've been fan-girling over this film like me in the lead up to its release, here's some truths that can set your mind at ease. It's not terrible. It doesn't ruin the franchise (At least no more than #3 did – William H Macy, Tea Leoni, I'm lookin at you dudes). Chris Pratt continues to be awesome. Dinosaurs are BADASS.The script however, is not. The plot of this film (The Park is open, scientists created a crazy scary monster hybrid dinosaur, you've seen the promos) is almost irrelevant, it's simply a vehicle that gets us to our most desired destination – Seeing big-ass dinosaurs tearing s**t up. Characters are given exceptionally weak set-ups that are so uninteresting that my patience was tested – get to the dinosaurs already!! Chris Pratt rocks as a Raptor trainer (a concept not as far-fetched as the trailer will lead you to believe) however other than channeling his inner Burt Macklin, there's really not much to him. And Jessica Chastain as his co-lead is a total bore – without going too Patricia Arquette on you here, is it too much to ask to have a strong female lead it a film as huge as this? Chastains Claire is your stereotypical uptight and overworked single woman, who has it all except for a man in her life spew. I was half expecting her and Pratt to do the old 'accidently fall on top of each other and almost kiss' moment but thankfully it didn't happen.An over-riding theme of the film is the argument that this Hybrid dinosaur was an unnecessary addition to the park – Dinosaurs are cool enough. You gotta wonder then, how this concept was missed by the writers in applying the same idea to the story. This unstoppable beast of a monster makes the film seem less grounded in the reality that we are used to from the previous films, and more of a fantasy land that is less accessible. No spoilers here, but it's not until the T-Rex is brought in that I felt that old rush of excitement that I had 20 years ago – Dinosaurs are cool enough.But it's still not awful. It's lazy, for sure, and for a film that was pretty much certain to make a TONNE of moula a lot more effort could have gone into making this movie as good as the first. But man, it's still Jurassic Park, still has that feel, that excitement, that sense of fun. And no matter what the reviews, you're still gonna watch it. So go watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better effects, better movie?","It's clear to see when a film is a cash grab; big cast, big effects and an already established name always helps. It seems like the ""Jurassic"" franchise worked its way onto this bus a while back and never stepped off. It's a shame to say that even by today's movie standards ""Jurassic World"" wasn't the end of the road for the series, even today's CGI couldn't save it (Might have even been what killed it?).This film is a stellar example as to why rehashing and rebooting movies doesn't work when you don't change anything... Now actually, that's not fair really, I mean this film did change things, for starts it removed nearly all the practical effects we cherished in the original, it also featured a lot more running (Because why not), it aimed to make dinosaurs more human and more relatable (Clearly because the first movie shamed them so much) and I almost forgot (Probably because it's so insignificant) the films called ""Jurassic World"" not ""Jurassic Park"".To be honest though I knew what to expect, I think most people knew this franchise had been going nowhere since they went to the pictures in 1997. So I can't rate it really badly because that would assume that I expected this film to be great and I didn't. It was actually a great average film, nothing more nothing less, well maybe a bit less.Conclusion: What you see is what you get, you don't like it, well...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It was okay.,"The movie is engaging and has some really great special effects. However, some of it is overdone. As a huge fan of the original (Jurassic Park), I was slightly disappointed as I was waiting for the awe that never quite happened. The story line was weak, the acting nothing special but the movie was visually stunning at times.I have little doubt Jurassic World will be a great winner for those who are not familiar with the original (Jurassic Park) and I am sure that number is massive since it has been 20+ years. It is not necessary to know the original to enjoy this movie although some references might be slightly clearer.All in all - a good endeavor and, after all, it is hard to beat that scene in Jurassic Park of the first look at the dinosaurs in the plains.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
If you loved the Park you'll Love the World.,"I went into the cinema with an open mind. Could they really create the same magic from the original? I would say YES! Okay, there's nobody (apart from Henry Wu-from Jurassic Park and who has a bigger role to play) in this movie from the original films but the director did state that it wasn't about throwing the same people into the same scenario over and over again. Nostalgia wise there's plenty for you to sink your teeth into and you will find yourself saying ""I remember that"" which is both thrilling and comforting. The new characters are great and add a new freshness to the franchise. The CGI is actually quite impressive. I couldn't really fault it. There are a few situations in this movie where you feel that edge of seat terror (Gyrosphere scene) and also a couple of genuine funny moments. The dinosaurs are a spectacle to see and the park itself looks totally lush. The story ticks along nicely as your straight in there from the start. You of course know things are going to go awry but that's the fun of it. It certainly brought me back to my youth and my 7 year old nephew loved it as much as I did. Definitely give it a go and maybe you will feel that rich sensation of something so familiar yet something exciting and new which both combined make a genuinely mega sci-fi spectacular !!!!

Not a brilliant film but a lot of fun,"Went to see this last night with the missus, so here's my review.The film opens and quickly establishes the main characters. It was difficult to become endeared to the characters, although by the last 40 minutes they grow on you quite a bit. The action picks up fairly early on but peaks just after the gyroscope scene, in which the film hits a bit of a slump for about 30 minutes.After the gyroscope scene the film becomes a much more by the numbers action movie, but as previously mentioned, by this point the characters are much improved, even though the relationship between Owen and Claire reeks of misogyny.Obviously the main thing you're going to watch this for is the dinosaurs. The Indominous Rex is the star of the show, and the Raptor's are pretty damn good as well even though the sub-plot involving them and Owen is extremely cheesy. Plus there's an appearance from a familiar face who everyone will be cheering for.To summarise, whilst the film fails to emulate the standard of the first film in terms of plot and acting, there is a lot to enjoy here, and the plentiful action scenes are a lot of fun, albeit a little short in duration, but this is understandable as the film pushes the boundaries for it's 12A/PG-13 rating.Overall I would give this film a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The premise of Jurassic World is that audiences are stupid,"I feel like the entire premise of Jurassic World was to say that audiences are stupid. Of course most audiences aren't literate enough to get that they are being dissed. That said, I enjoyed the movie lots a lots *smile emoticon*#JurassicWorld was loads of fun. I enjoyed basically every moment. As long as you can ignore the fact that animals don't really behave like that and that you know the ending and who will die from the moment you see each character (as the entire movie follows the well established formula of monster movies) then you should have a grand time! And I did! Probably since I expected a pretty straightforward action/thriller I was in the right mindset to accept a pretty straightforward action/thriller.Spoilers below:In the film, the reason the business people created the mega-ultra-super dinosaur was because audiences wouldn't come unless the dinosaurs were bigger and badder. Then the movie proceeds to tromp that bigger badder dinosaur around releasing mayhem on the island until the bigger badder battles the little bads, then the little bads team up with another big bad until the biggest baddest eats the bigger badder.The movie says directly, ""audiences aren't wowed by dinosaurs,"" we need a 3-way CG dino battle ended by an even bigger CG dino to make audiences happy. So when the movie audience hears that the on screen audiences aren't wowed by regular dinosaurs, we shake our heads and think ""those dumb people need to appreciate what they have and not always want things over the top!"" Then the movie says ""YOU WANT THINGS OVER THE TOP."" And when the real audience is given over the top, we nod along and say, ""yeah, that's what I wanted!"" But we're not smart enough to draw the connections and see what we're being dissedBut who knows, maybe that was unintentional?Either way, the movie is a great time.

Engaging Without A Plot,"It was an exhilarating and heart pumping, the movie engages you so much that your eyes are peeled to the screen. There were reenactments that made it seem so familiar.

The graphics were on point, and the actors were engaged. But this movie just let its audience through, without any much of an effort for a plot twist. Everything was too expected that ""I knew it!"" were used more than woah-s and wow-s.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but really dumb,"This is action packed movie, the dinosaurs fights are good, in particular the final battle, Chris Pratt is fun and good to watch. Anything else is dumb and stereotyped. And it doesn't have the soul of the first one, which remains my favourite, but I think that was because Michael Crichton book was behind the scripts and Spielberg was directing.But if you don't care about the plot, don't get irritated by the dumbness of the characters and you like dinosaurs and actions it delivers. I would give it a 7 if the main female character wasn't so stupid and I can't tolerate anymore dumb women on screen. When Chris Pratt character criticises her attire, and in particular her shoes, as inadequate for a hike in the forest with prowling dinosaurs and she rearranges her shirt in a more casual way I remained dumbstruck: too idiotic for words.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What is happening when the previous experience doesn't teach you at all!,"""Jurassic World"" is the continuation of the greatest story of all time about dinosaurs ""Jurassic Park"". I had so much expectations regarding this movie, but unfortunately it turned out to be not so satisfactory as i expected.The plot is most stolen from the Jurassic Park. A lot of episodes resemble the first part, but without the same spirit of suspense, tension and soul. ""Jurassic Park"" is the movie of my childhood, i remember my feelings after first watching it. It was something inexplicable, i desired to become a paleontologist and to create something like Jurassic Park. While the new one is just a blockbuster, well-done for sure, but without the proper atmosphere. But, at the same time, i can't say that it is extremely bad. As a separate movie it is much fascinating, but without any meaning. I like they added a lot of funny situations, but it was needless to create the new individuum. T-rex is a perfect prehistoric murderer and to invent something between T-Rex and Raptors is the foolish thing ever. I understand they were trying to invent a bike, but it doesn't work. The scene with Chris Patt trains a Raptors is great and entertaining and maybe it would be possible to implement if the people had been lived with dinosaurs. Raptors are the most intelligent prehistoric dinosaurs, hypotetically it could be.The 3d effect, the scenery and the movie in general is well-done, but not in comparison with the first one. As an entertaining movie it is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining enough despite the limp script, lack of humor and dreadful acting","As with its predecessors, the real reason to watch a Jurassic Park movie is for the dinosaurs, in this case, Pterodactyls, a giant prehistoric whale/alligator thing, Raptors and the mega-menacing hybrid protagonist. My reoccurring question throughout this film was who told Chris Pratt he could act?? It's literally one of the most lazy, dreary performances I have yet to see in a Summer blockbuster. Bryce Dallas Howard, on the contrary, can act but she is fed dialogue from an uneven script with many awkward attempts at...well... humor?... I'm guessing? The one refreshing role in this film is the one played by Irrfan Khan, yet here again he suffers from a lame script and a one-trick pony of a running joke about him not flying a helicopter well. Despite watching these one-dimensional characters through 3-D glasses, ""Jurassic World"" is still a semi-fun flick to kick off the Summer. Hopefully it's far from the best of the 2015 Summer blockbusters, however.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Jurassic World"" is a Science Fiction Film Great!","I viewed ""Jurassic World"" at a Warren Theatre in a Grand Infinity Auditorium that featured Dolby Atmos Multidimensional Sound, America's first and only 4K Laser Projection System and comfortable, spacious seating. The theater was sold out, I was by myself, and I viewed the movie in its entirety. As a fan of the Science Fiction Genre, Dinosaurs (both science and mystery of the extinct creatures), and the ""Jurassic Park"" Franchise, I was happy to see another addition to the series. I enjoy movies in 3D and Large Format screens too. I would like to have viewed the movie in an IMAX 3D setting; although, this is a review of ""Jurassic World"" I feel it is important to me to view highly anticipated, new release films in these type of formats. I have no doubt that it is worth the extra fee and part of the modern era movie experience as these films are intended to be viewed in these formats as well. ""Jurassic World"" is mostly awe inspiring but violent. It is not grotesque it is not sickening, if gore is a motive... I do not enjoy gore. There is a lot of blood, bloody meat, flesh eating and flesh tearing. Dinosaurs do have sharp claws and teeth, they also eat other creatures. If you would like to see dinosaurs but do not like to see violence of this nature, my mother still closes her eyes when she is scared or looks away if she feels the moment is too much for her. Most Americans are de-sensitized to violence, children were present and they didn't seem fazed. The plot worked, I'm not sure how much thought was put into it but I liked it. I felt like a tourist with VIP access into the events. The actors executed the script well, I liked the characters. The effects were flawless, CGI was flawless (dinosaurs were beautiful), set and environment... flawless. ""Jurassic World"" delivered. I am a fan, I do not pretend to be an expert reviewer. I enjoy action/adventure and Sci-Fi films. Some people don't enjoy movies in which they did not write, direct, or star. Some people have qualms with violence, main-stream media, Hollywood, capitalism, all things free and fun. I viewed ""Jurassic World"" for what it was, a large group effort to deliver an updated ""Jurassic Park"" Franchise experience for young, old, fans, and new viewers.

A fun popcorn thriller!,"Jurassic world is the 4th installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. It's main plot is a new open park full with man made dinosaurs and one day the company decides to make a genetic hybrid to boost the public's attention. But that of course goes horribly wrong and soon enough the hybrid is on the loose and killing people left and right. While all of this is going on, a raptor trainer Owen and the park's owner Clair must stop this monster before a monster mash goes down. First the good. Chris Pratt plays a good role and he is easily the best human character. The action is very entertaining and very pleasing to the eye. The dinosaurs are very cool as always, and the hybrid was awesome. The suspense is one of the strongest things this movie has to offer. But now time for the bad. There are a few people you do not really care about, for example there are two kids in the movie that were completely hollow and didn't have any real purpose except for escaping the dinosaurs. And sometimes this movie can come off as silly when it tries to be cool. So in the end Jurassic World is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster that may not be as good as the original but has it memorable moments in the Jurassic Park universe. 7/10 Check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This film was thrilling and enjoyable, but couldn't let go of the past.","Jurassic World is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise and deals with what would happen if the dinosaur theme park eventually opened. I am a huge fan of the first two Jurassic Park movies (the third one was only okay) and their narratives on the relationship between man and nature so I was excited to see what this movie could add to that. There is a new narrative that I think actually adds quite a bit to the lore of Jurassic Park. The writing was quite good. There are quite a few scenes that focus on the creation of the dinosaurs in the park and humanities illusion of control over them. Unfortunately there are also a lot of small details that ignore major concepts from the first two movies, especially in the theme park ride designs. Not a single one of the rides shown in this film would last a day in the first two films, and some of the designs wouldn't even work in real life (like giving the customers control over the safari vehicles that allow them to move into the animals' territories instead of an automated path or tour guide). There are also many small plot points that were taken straight from the first film. Despite this, once everything begins to fall apart and the focus falls from the attractions, the film really picks up and keeps going till the end. This film is more of a disaster flick than a survival flick, but it manages to feel like a survival movie for most of the core scenes. Most of the characters are well done. They are simple, yet relatable. The only problem I have here is the two brothers. They had a small story arch that was way deeper than it needed to be and in the end went nowhere and did not resolve itself. The special effects were fantastic and while there were times where it was obvious that C.G.I. was involved, there were more times when I couldn't tell if I was watching an animatronic dinosaur or a C.G.I one. There were many great tense moments that really dragged me in and kept me there. If you were a fan of the first couple of films, you will probably enjoy this one. It isn't as good as the first two, but still excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Hollywood seen how people loved the movies they made JP3 which was an okay film I give it a 8/10 the story matched up with the books about the animals being on the second site, and now Jurassic World is on the concept of the back story but the writers to me could not find a way to make there story fit in with the others,they should of focused more time on better story then cool features for a more futuristic park.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome!,"So I finally saw ""Jurassic World"", and it was awesome. I was very excited for this movie as it looked like it would be fun to see and I really liked the first ""Jurassic Park"", the other two weren't the best. This movies CGI looked great and it just seemed like it was real entertainment. And I was right!! The movie was really enjoyable and it wasn't my favorite movie, mainly because it has already been done before, but it was a great time in the theater. The movie was a lot like the first mainly because you can't really do much with the story if you're making another movie with the same idea. This movie I couldn't really see being done better, because I don't really think that they should make too many more of these movies as they'll get old fast. I can relate it to the Transformers franchise, it started out fun and enjoyable, but as the years went on the more movies they were making the worse they got. The movie was everything I hoped it would be. I know it sounds like I'm really contradicting myself, because I said it was good not great, but that's what I thought it would be, and that's what it was. I think there are many movies that I've seen that are very good movies, but they aren't very enjoyable like ""Jurassic World"". ""Jurassic World"" was a movie that has a very high replay value as it is a movie that I would want to watch over and over unlike many movies that I've seen that I thought were very good. ""Jurassic World"" was a fun movie and really helped people understand why they say movies are entertainment.

"Satisfactory in what it aims to be, but still leaves you with the feeling of being a missed opportunity","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) are two siblings who have been sent away for a holiday to the Jurassic World theme park by their over-bearing mother, trying to divert their minds from the divorce that's brewing between her and their father. Meanwhile, on the island resort, Claire (Bruce Dallas Howard), the boy's aunt and senior management figure, has to present the new, genetically created super-monster to some potential investors. To oversee it's behaviour, she selects old flame Owen (Chris Pratt), whose rough, renegade style will have it's ups and downs. But the new super dinosaur has a mind of it's own, and has plans to break free from captivity and wreak havoc on the island.Anyone over the age of thirty is likely to have the original Jurassic Park moulded in to their minds in some way. Even if they never saw the film, the sheer amount of publicity and merchandise it attracted would keep it engraved in their minds. As such, Jurassic World, the spin off film of the series, is serving much the same function as The Phantom Menace did in 1999, for those for whom Star Wars was the film from their youth (and who are over the age of forty!) It's not a heartless, soulless spin off, like many that fall from the Hollywood cookie cutter machine these days, and there is spark and potential in the script, but sadly, while this is evident, it just doesn't manage to really be the sum of it's parts.The idea of Jurassic Park having become a theme park for tourists, with tacky souvenir shops and franchise establishments everywhere, and having the dinosaurs as modern day animals in a modern day zoo ('kids get bored just staring at a stegosaurus these days...' as the Claire character comments at the beginning) is an interesting one, and has the potential to serve as a really good set up. But for some reason, the story moves away from this, and has some disjointed narratives serving as the plot, flitting from Pratt and Howard trying to bring the escaped animals down, to the two boys trying to stay out of harm's way, through to Irrfan Khan and BD Wong fighting for control as the situation worsens. Pratt is the new go to man for this kind of thing, and he is strong and solid in his role here, although Simpkins and Robinson are a pretty cardboard copy of the kids from the first film.Visually, of course, the film is far from a disappointment. The dinosaur designs and effects are even more astonishing than they were twenty years ago, and are a breath-taking spectacle as we watch them battle on the island. Director Colin Trevorrow has managed to stick true to this aspect of what made the original so memorable, but has just failed to serve it with a stronger script or coherent narrative. It basically serves it's purpose, and can't really be called a let down in any way, just something that could have been a little more. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic World is better then its predecessor but not from part 1,"The plot is simple, predictable and similar to part one(as it take similar path as that of part 1""Jurassic Park"") only addition of genetically created hybrid Dino(monster), who is in loose such and go on a rampage.There are too many unnecessary character and sub-plots which takes the movie little-bit downwards.

Dull And Unimaginative Story On Purpose?,"My companion and I enjoyed ""Jurassic World"" immensely, especially with the exciting 4DX. When the mixed-bred gigantic dinosaur plays tricks and then escapes, the excitement never lets down, right to the end. I can't find (and didn't actually look for) a false note on entertainment. Exciting, engaging, grabbing, and visually breathtaking. Indeed another strong contender for Best Special Visual Effects on Oscar stage. However, the entertainment values of this film seem an alternate to, or as opposed to, those of education or edutainment. The story is made so lame, so dull, and so predictable in every inch of the way, as if filmmakers feared that the educational values would take away those of entertainment. I find this phenomenon very odd. It is given that a filmmaking of this scale should have no problem finding a good story or a good storyteller. There should be no reason for the un-imagination, except it is done on purpose, with quite a wrong notion that viewers can't take both entertainment and education altogether. Some experts on BBC already complain that this film has become a huge ""missed opportunity"". There is a period of 20 years from ""Jurassic Park"" (Part 1) to ""Jurassic World"" (Part 4). Enormous discoveries have been made in the field, and yet any of those new bodies of knowledge hardly find themselves into this film's ""new"" story. ""Jurassic World"" comes close of becoming a classic, only if human characters and social notions were explored and delicately exhibited. This is neither my call nor my wish to turn a money-making machine into a boring school. I simply say to Mr. and Ms. Hollywoods out there: it is not at all difficult, dear, to achieve both ends in one undertaking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good popcorn movie,"Just saw Jurassic World yesterday. Although some of the dialogues sound cheesy and several scenes don't make too much sense to me, but overall in terms of popcorn flick, I do agree that the movie is truly awesome packed with lots of action and cool CGI effects and visuals. Although I still think that Jurassic Park #1 is the best of the series, yet I'm ecstatic that they're (finally) showing an oceanic creature mosasaur here as opposed to the overused t-rex and raptors in the previous installments. No surprise that it made the #1 BO this weekend. But kinda surprised a bit that it beat the previous Jurassic Park movies' records - combined. I didn't think the movie would make that much.

A New World?,"""Jurassic World"" (2015) is a film that has been in the making for many years. Continuing and/or reinventing an iconic franchise is no easy task, and many franchises have failed at this (even Disney/Marvel has just started to loose it's touch with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"").""Jurassic World"" is a film I was both extremely excited and nervous about. Since ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001) was such a disappointment (and possibly one of the worst sequels in movie history), I had some low expectations for this new film. I can happily say, however, that ""Jurassic World"" has brought the franchise back to what made it good in the first place.The film opens up to John Hammond's park being fully realized. It is already thrilling to see this park actually be opened to the public and full of people wanting to see the dinosaurs (almost like a SeaWorld replica). Of course as any Jurassic Park fan knows, this peaceful park won't last long.""Jurassic World"" excels at recapturing the nostalgia of the first film by having the iconic film score return, lots of suspense, violence, and action, fun humor, and great special effects. The cast is fun to watch as well and they give good performances all around. It makes it clear that this was a very fun film to make.The film does have it's share of problems, however. Like most summer blockbusters, some characters have little development and/or have very poor motives. This can take the viewer away from the experience, while also helping them quickly realize what Hollywood tropes are being used again and again.To sum up, while ""Jurassic World"" is very entertaining and engaging, it doesn't break any new ground. It takes all of the good from the franchise and puts it into one solid film. If you are looking for one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, you should go watch this film immediately. If you want a movie that challenges your thinking or has complex characters, I suggest holding off on this one.""Jurassic World"" 3 out of 4 stars Movie Recommendations (If you like it): Jurassic Park (1993), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Star Wars (1977), Jaws (1975) Movie Recommendations (If you don't like it): Alien (1979), X-men (2000), Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Interstellar (2014)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Chris Pratt taming Velociraptors was worse than the little acrobatic black girl from the second movie. The people who run the park don't know what the new cooked hybrid is made up of and they start stupid missions without the knowledge of it. Making the carnivorous Dinosaurs look like monsters and herbivores like poor creatures was also quite stupid. Very few easter eggs, just the bad-ass car from the first movie, which is started by a 16yr old brat after 20 years, the car also breaks the door of one of the compartments inside the park, keeping us wondering how the Dinosaurs stayed inside with such weak doors.

"You would think that Chris Pratt + Dinosaurs = Awesome Movie, but don't expect the magic from 1993's Jurassic Park.","There were higher expectations for this movie, but it was disappointing. As an action movie, this movie is good. It helps you forget Jurassic Park III, but it's between Jurassic Park and The Lost World. The problem was that it tries to be sophisticated, but it fails to do so. It's a commentary on how corporations can be evil, and when mankind messes with nature, nature fights back. It's similar in themes with Jurassic Park (1993), but it feels artificial in its effort to capture Spielberg's vision in the land of the dinosaurs.The two brothers in the movie, Zach and Gray Mitchell, are a similar throwback to Timmy and Lex from the original movie. It tried to add heart to the movie with a conversation about parents who might be divorcing, but it was never brought up again. It was filler. Chris Pratt saved this movie for the most part. He was a little funny and sarcastic, but he was also a tough guy who knows how to survive and deal with the dinosaurs. However, his character was too strong, so there wasn't a lot of fear that he would fail to save the day.The cinematography of the movie was one of the better parts of the movie, since it showed majestic views of Hawaii and added CGI to parts of island. There was also blatant product placement of Mercedes Benz cars, since they looked too good and pronounced from the rest of the scenery.The movie is unevenly paced, and the first two acts are a drag to sit through. You don't care about the brothers because they don't blend in as well, since they stick out as plot devices and filler. The 3rd act is the best part of the movie because there's more action, Chris Pratt, and dinosaurs, instead of the brothers and dinosaurs. However, the Indominus Rex should be called PlotDeviceasaurus Rex. It's a genetically modified dinosaur that's the antagonist of the movie and there were mixed feelings about it. The ""natural and regular"" dinosaurs were more believable than that behemoth. The special effects of the dinosaurs blended in well with the environment and they were believable. The abilities of the Indominus Rex were inconsistent, and they didn't work that well at times to benefit the main characters. Pratt does action and comedy well, but this movie held him back. However, he was different from his Star-Lord character, since he was more serious.Jurassic World is a good and thrilling action movie, but don't expect the heart from the Jurassic Park (1993). It lacks the intelligence and sophistication of the original, but it makes it up with the action, dinosaurs, and Chris Pratt. It also tries to throwback to the original with blatant nods to it with its themes and certain scenes. In its attempt to be sophisticated, it avoids bar set by Jurassic Park III and The Lost World. It's a decent reboot, but the next installments better exceed this attempt.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fun, but the magic is missing","Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow, who also directed the great indie movie Safety Not Guaranteed, and is a sequel to the Jurassic Park movies. Now, history as proved that the Jurassic Park sequels are not that good, the second one is only half as good as the first one and the third one is plain bad. Jurassic World is the best sequel to Jurassic Park, but unfortunately, that isn't saying much.The action picks up 20 years later after the first one, and now the tourist attraction known as Jurassic Park is called Jurassic World. But dinosaurs have been around for so long that the audience starts to lose it's interest in the subject so the higher-ups come with a new attraction, Indominus Rex, a genetically modified dinosaur with elements from other animals. And of course, things go wrong. As one character quips in the movie: ""These people never learn"".This is not a bad movie, but it's also not very good. It misses the great characters, the stunning visuals, the breathtaking imagery of the first one. This becomes a generic CGI-driven monster movie. It's fun, but it has no heart. A big complaint for me is the overuse of CGI for the dinosaurs. There are a lot of scenes where it simply looks fake. And you know that is not a good thing when a movie released in 1993 has better looking dinosaurs than one in 2015.As far as the actors go, this movie is lead by Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, a former marine who now trains raptors. He does the best he can, but this tough guy, bad-ass type role doesn't really work for him in contrast with his more goofy roles from Guardians of the Galaxy or Parks and Recreation. But of course, he has some funny one-liners, and, for the most part, he delivers. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the park's manager, and I'm sorry to say, but she's not doing a very good job. Vincent D'Onofrio as the head of the security does a decent job, and the two kids, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are good also, especially Ty Simpkins, who comes from his nice role in Iron Man 3.All in all, this movie is a fun summer ride, with some nice action and suspense, but doesn't come any near the magic of the first one.

"Not the best in the series, but the best shot in the arm","I'll try to keep this as vague as possible, while still highlighting the finer points. I think of this as a great shot in the arm for the series, not entirely different from how the most recent Star Trek movies have helped that franchise.For me, the best part of this Jurassic World is that you only really need to know anything about the first movie to have a grasp on this one. So if you haven't seen the second and third installments, you're not lost. In fact, in some ways, it may even help. Let's face it, Jurassic Park 3 wasn't a great addition to the franchise, so without it you may have a more appreciative view of the series.The highlights of the movie, for me, are the constant reminders of the original park, the first movie, and the spirit of what Hammond wanted to make for the world.I'm giving the movie a pretty high overall rating, and it wouldn't add up if I decided to rank different portions of the movie separately, so I'll just explain myself with the whole 9/10 thing; it really drives home the idea of the franchise, and it has everything you'd want in a summer blockbuster.Sure there are plenty of parts that are predictable, and yeah there are some things that make you want to laugh a little, but you aren't supposed to. For example (without spoiler) there's a scene that effectively calls back to every war movie ever where an integral character gets left behind somewhere and reappears later. You kind of forget about this character until that shining moment they come running back in triumphantly. This happens, but it was almost comical for me.Despite the predictive nature of the film, despite a few things I could poke holes through in certain scenes, Jurassic World delivers what you'd expect it to. It brings back a franchise that needed a shot in the arm without remaking it completely. There's plenty of options at the end for a sequel without making it required to tie up the loose ends. There's action, blood, carnage and mayhem of the dinosaur variety. This isn't a walk through the park ... but when have any of them been?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic lite,"If you take this movie on a teen or tween level, you will enjoy it. I think it first fools you into thinking it was going to be a horror flick and kind of disappoints in the lightness it goes into during the perilous scenes. After making a death defying jump you laugh it off and say ""We actually jumped"". The fear factor was so dumbed down to make the movie acceptable for kids that it became almost boring until the twist in the end. I wish it was more dark and menacing instead of light and serial like. Still, it was the sixth highest grossing films and this story worked. My justification for the nonchalant attitude was that these creatures were a part of that world for decades and everyone was used to a beast on the lose once in a while.

Great Example of a Popcorn Flick,"It's obvious and safe to say that this movie is not as good as the Steven Spielberg film. Is it better than the second one? I'm going to have to say yes on that. What this movie is is a popcorn movie. You just have to go in and have a fun time and I did, I had a lot of fun with this movie.Yes it's more of a monster movie than an actual Jurassic Park movie, but that's all right. It did focus on the Jurassic theme overall. It was just that there was a dinosaur running around and a lot of people were running around.It may sound like the story isn't that interesting if you just read the last sentence. Overall it isn't a bad story. There was a subplot that involved the kids and it seemed pointless when the movie was trying to give us feelings for the kids but it didn't work. Other than that the story wasn't that bad. How was the acting? That's probably the weakest part of the movie.The only actor that really stood out was Chris Pratt. He's definitely got talent. He wasn't acting like Andy or Starlord in this movie. We got a new character who was serious most of the time, because of this, I'm okay with whatever Chris Pratt does in the future.Bryce Dallas Howard wasn't a bad actress in the movie, but her character wasn't that great. At first she was more of the exposition girl, telling all of the important things to the plot. Then she was just a girl who's uptight and really didn't add a whole lot to the movie. It's not her fault though, it's the writing.Jurassic World may be a ""monster movie"" but it still has elements of Jurassic Park, there are many times where it felt like a Jurassic Park movie. Especially the final act of the movie. Gosh that part of the movie was very fun, without spoiling anything.Jurassic World is a very fun movie that people will enjoy. Yes the subplot that involve the kids may not be the best part of the movie and the characters could have been better written except for Chris Pratt, but it's still better than the last two movies in my opinion. This movie has dinosaur action and well written comedic moments. I will probably go see this movie again in theater because I had so much fun with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Starts off slow but finishes strong,"My initial thoughts of the movie was meh. The kids served no greater purpose to the film other than being the subject of rescue. The beginning where the movie introduced the kids and their family problems were all very pointless and boring. The movie only became better when Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard entered the scene and became the main focal point of the movie. (Why didn't the main characters start of the film is my question).The beginning of the movie lacked direction but it gathered itself once the crisis began. Chris Pratt's character Owen is so cool. I also really like how this film has a strong female character who is smart and is equally tough. References to Jurassic Park definitely made this installment nostalgic.As a side note, the unique part of the movie promotion is that Jurassic World and Masrani have their own website as if it exists in real life. Now that's pretty cool.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Heck of a Roaring Attraction,"Seeing Jurassic World on the big screen is like taking a roller- coaster ride. In the beginning, it takes time to get ready for the action to rise up. Then in the middle, the excitement really arrives. By the end, we're totally amazed with leftover emotions of exhilaration and rapture. That what the long-awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park series delivers with a dose of a surefire thrill.Taking place twenty-two years after the events of the first film, the dinosaur park that couldn't open has finally did with attractions ranging from a dino petting zoo to an aquarium. Heading the park's operations is Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director Ron). In a way to increase attendance in the park, Claire plans to open a new exhibit featuring a hybrid dinosaur created by scientists of the late John Hammond's company, InGen. Claire brings in a dino expert and former flame, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), to check the genetic- modified animal for safety reasons.But soon, all hell breaks loose when the hybrid dino breaks out of his cage and makes a rampage through the park killing many in sight and making a mess of the facilities. The rex even tries to mess with Claire's visiting nephews, Zach and Gray (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins). So, it's up to Owen and Claire to put a stop to this madness before it gets much worse.Taking over the director's seat from Steven Spielberg (one of the film's executive producers) is indie director Colin Trevorrow. Trevorrow isn't no Spielberg, but he adds a lot of new juice into the franchise. The script (which was credited as a four-person job) works well with the usual summer blockbuster mix of action, romance and a sense of humor. The dinosaur effects are simply astonishing. Plus, Michael Giacchino's score wisely incorporates John Williams' themes from the original and uses them with fine panache.As expected, the film is faithful to the 1993 picture from which it sprung. It recreates two of the film scenes when Owen and Claire pets an ailing dinosaur and in the dino-fight-to-the-finish climax, the two of them get trapped by two raptors (joined by a third this time). The filmmakers even recreated the now abandoned Jurassic Park Visitors Center, complete with old park Jeep Wranglers. The film also makes jabs at product placement such as Verizon Wireless sponsoring the latest dino exhibit, the ""Samsung Innovation Center"" and a Starbucks cafe located in the front of the park (not to mention Comcast- NBCUniversal employee Jimmy Fallon doing a instructions video for one of the attractions).Coming off his success in Guardians of the Galaxy, Pratt scores well with leading-man charisma as Owen. Let's hope his stock goes up after this. As Claire, Howard is wonderful, even after trying to go Sigourney Weaver-like on the predators. Together, Pratt and Howard scores with a touch of great chemistry that it's not hard to think if they'll both survive this ordeal. They're both supported by a fine supporting cast with Vincent D'Onofrio (of Law & Order:CI fame) as a power-mad security boss, Irrfan Khan as the new head of InGen and New Girl's Jake Johnson as the park's computer control guy (reminiscent of both Wayne Knight's Nedry and Samuel L.Jackson's Arnold from the first film).When you mix the elements altogether, you might end up with one great thing. With that, Jurassic World roars as a great summer movie. Somewhere in heaven, both Michael Crichton and Richard Attenborough must be proud.Rating:***1/2Parent Advisory: Jurassic World is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril. Good enough for ages 15 and over but some scenes may be too intense and violent for children under age 14 at best, so I advise that it's best to go supervised by a parent, sibling or an older chaperone.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"As a film of pure spectacle, it's massively entertaining","Following the calamity of Joe Johnston's Jurassic Park III in 2001, the beloved Jurassic Park franchise was in danger of throwing away its massive potential. After 14 years of rewrites, recasts and director-swapping, the long-awaited fourth instalment arrives with anticipation and high-expectations, and the park is finally open to the public. Now sitting happily as the third highest grossing film of all time, it would seem that the world is still fascinated by dinosaurs, but Jurassic World knows its audience won't be content with the beasties that came before, and has gone for bigger and scarier. By creating its own dinosaur, the formidable (and ridiculously-named) Indominus rex, it certainly achieves this, and also serves as a commentary on corporate and consumer greed.20 years after Dr. Alan Grant gazed upon the sights of Isla Nublar for the first time, Jurassic World is the planet's biggest theme park. Brothers Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) head to the park to stay with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the operations manager. With audience demand on the increase, Claire has overlooked the development of the next big attraction, the lab- created Indominus Rex, which possesses high intelligence along with a collection of attack and defence abilities wound into its DNA from other animals. Navy veteran and velociraptor handler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) thinks its a bad idea, and upon his inspection of the indominus pen, he notices claw marks on the walls and the creature nowhere to be found.Jurassic World still very much follows the formula of what came before - characters arrive, think they're safe, and are soon fleeing and screaming from a variety of giant lizards - but at least director Colin Trevorrow has moved the story on. While throwing in a few new elements, it covers a lot of themes covered in the first movie, with a corporate bigwig (Vincent D'Onofrio) hoping to play God for his own - albeit less innocent - means, and ignoring the warnings of an expert with a better understanding of nature, while children who may just be wiser than their elders find themselves in mortal peril. Yet there is a certain charm to the film's nostalgic elements, and the set-pieces - which range from the exhilarating to the ridiculous - finally feel deserving of John Williams' iconic score.You could pull the film to pieces if you're looking for plot-holes (how would a dinosaur bred in captivity, regardless of its intelligence, know to rip a tracking device out of itself?), but the indominus, despite its McGuffin status, is a suitably nasty antagonist, casually committing genocide as it carves its bloody path towards the tourist centre. Anyone who loved Jurassic Park for its science may be disappointed, as all sense of reality goes out of the window - this is a movie where velociraptors team up with humans to fight a greater threat. But as a film of pure spectacle, it's massively entertaining. It's well aware that it is pandering to a young audience brought up on quick-fixes and everything at their fingertip, and makes a point of this by showing hordes of snot-nosed kids running around the park lacking any sense of wonder. Will humanity ever learn? Unless the plan is to set its recently- announced sequel in a world where man and dinosaur live together in harmony, I guess not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Derivative, but fun","This film loses points for being essentially a rehash of the original, excessively CGI, and having a random divorce subplot that isn't expounded upon or resolved. However, it scores point for the new twists that it added to the original formula. In the original the park wasn't open yet and only a small tour group was in danger when the dinosaurs broke out. In this film it was cool to see the park open and flourishing. And then having the dinosaurs break out and threaten the park when it was full of thousands of tourists added to the stakes and intensity. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard had great chemistry. The film had ample humor. In the end it was an overly rehashed reboot, but loads of fun in the spirit and wonder of the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park: A Fan-Fiction,"People are criticizing this movie for not being a contender for the Spielberg classic. How can it be, when even Spielberg himself couldn't make a worthwhile sequel? Colin Trevorrow, the director of 'Safety Not Guaranteed' had a Herculean task on his hand when he was slated to direct this sequel-reboot. Setting the criticizing aside, I think the guy had made some admirable effort. Jurassic World is a fairly-entertaining movie that passes as a watchable one.Sure, in no way this film could catch up with the original. The animatronics was replaced with some sloppy CGI, it lacked interesting characters, and the whole script was flawed with bad writing. But, Trevorrow treated it as a disaster movie rather than an innovation, and when we see it that way, the end product is satisfactory. Besides, he tried to bring out the nostalgia we all wanted with occasional nods to the original. From the evergreen soundtrack to the T-Rex, most of this movie proves the directors dedication to the subject. The sequences with the raptors were thrilling in the beginning. It's a shame he couldn't develop it more interestingly.As Jurassic World established itself as a box-office success, there is a certain possibility of having a string of sequels in the future. Whether Trevorrow's dedication can hold up the franchise is a question for the future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Speed Review,"Jurassic World is yet another attempt at recapturing the magic of the original Jurassic Park, and while the plot has a great many holes in it, you still have fun with this movie thanks to the likability of its cast. The park has now officially opened to the public and guess what, it all goes wrong when the Jurassic World scientists create a genetic hybrid dinosaur to try and up ticket sales. Simply put, Jurassic World is a nice afternoon at the movies, but it is lacking in the scares, memorable moments, and most importantly, heart, that made the first movie such a worldwide phenomenon (although Chris Pratt is his own phenomenon at this point).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Biggest waste of family money ever!,"I've been excited to see this movie for a few months now, so yesterday I decided to go all out. Bought tickets for my family, soda, popcorn to the first screening of the night. $70 to be exact. Should have waited for the dollar theater! There is NOTHING new to the story in this film. It's the exact same plot as the first one with sprinkles of the other two films as well. AND, a great Indiana Jones impersonation by Chris Pratt. To be honest, I'm really sick of movie directors who create products that are essentially giant boners over the fact that they get to make something that far better filmmakers began long ago.Let's just say that if they make the next Star Wars the same way they made this, I am going to be looking for revenge.My suggestion is simply this...

The first 20 minutes or so is simply bad cinema. Cartoon level characters with no depth setting up the rest of the film. Then, somehow I grew to care for those characters by the end of the movie. I believe this has more to do with great casting and really nothing to do with story. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt ooze charisma and charm. The call backs to the classic original certainly help. I wish we would have had better dinosaur fights and I really hated the horribly written bad-guy with alternative motives that have zero feasibility. Still, I went in expecting a monster movie popcorn flick and that's what they delivered for the most part.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The best yet since the original, this reboot 22 years after is a non-stop thrill ride with pleasantly surprising doses of good humor and warm nostalgia","Let's cut to the chase – for those of you who just want to know if 'Jurassic World' is as good as 'Jurassic Park', the answer is no, but it does come pretty damn close. To be fair, it was going to be a tall order to top the Steven Spielberg original, a fact which the revamped park's own management, owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and his right-hand woman Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), readily acknowledge. It isn't enough that we are seeing dinosaurs come alive before us; in order to dazzle, the animals has got to be ""bigger, louder, and more teeth"".And so in their quest to create a new attraction for the park, its chief scientist Dr Henry Wu (B.D. Wong, the only cast member from 'Jurassic Park' to reprise his role) turns to genetic modification to create varieties that never existed 65 billion years ago. That research has yielded the Indominous Rex, a hybrid whose DNA is based off a T- Rex and is spliced with the genome of other species which we slowly learn (the hard way) of its predatory functions. Bred miles away from the actual visitors' areas, it sets a trap to bait its breeders into its paddock and, during the ensuing mêlée, breaks out of the enclosure to wreck havoc not just to the humans on the Isla Nubar but also the rest of its own kind living on the island.With the Indominous Rex on the loose, ex-Navy man Owen (Chris Pratt) springs into action to try to stop the beast before it reaches the 20 thousand over blissfully unaware visitors and at the same time rescue two kids (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson), who happen to be Claire's nephews, that are in imminent danger after veering off the beaten course. Save for a little spot of complication from the corporation's head of security, Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), whose idea to employ raptors against the Indominous Rex backfires in a jaw-dropping 'oh sh*t' moment, the narrative unfolds in as linear and straightforward a manner as you can imagine.Not that we're complaining – despite crediting four writers, 'Jurassic World' is supposed to be a movie built on thrill and spectacle more than anything else, a fact that isn't lost on its director Colin Trevorrow. Despite having only one other feature- length movie to his credit, Trevorrow proves more than able to construct riveting action set-pieces that are keystone to the franchise. Among the highlights – Masrani's attempt to take down the Indominous Rex from a helicopter that comes to a fiery end and sets free the winged predators held captive in an aviary, the birds' subsequent attack on the hordes of visitors in the main theme park, and the raptors' hunt for the Indominous Rex that takes a surprising turn.Just about the last hour and a half is packed wall-to-wall with non- stop action, as the characters run, duck, hide, chase, rinse and repeat in order to save their own and prevent a bigger calamity from shutting down the park forever. Trevorrow lacks Spielberg's gift for creating and sustaining tension, but in place of iconic moments like the ripples in the glass of water on the dashboard or the velociraptors opening a kitchen door, he simply keeps the action going and going, pausing only to a) let in a kicker and/or b) pay tribute to his predecessors. That said, it is to us also the reason why this entry pales in comparison to Spielberg's original, which was a quintessential masterpiece in choreographed suspense.Rightfully, Trevorrow shows the utmost respect for the establishing blocks of the franchise. Although the theme park has undergone a major makeover with snazzy new attractions like a dinosaur petting zoo, an amphitheater featuring a monosaurus feeding show and face- to-face safari-like dino excursions in a circular self-powered vehicle called a gyro-sphere, there are constant nods to the original movie. The original Jurassic Park Visitors Centre makes a pleasantly surprising appearance midway into the film, and for that matter so does its banner and T-shirts. Most significantly, the finale pays homage to the first movie in truly cheer-worthy rah-rah fashion – and while we will agree with the cynics that it is deus ex machina, there is no denying that it closes the film on a high note.Though this is the first chapter in the series to introduce a whole new set of characters, they are well written and well played enough to compensate for any nostalgia one may have of Dr Alan Grant or Dr Ian Malcolm. Pratt's good-natured charisma rubs off amply on his character, and Howard manages to go from unlikeable to someone we care about with surprising clarity. Most delightful however is the sibling dynamic between Simpkins and Robinson, which provides much of the film's emotional anchor; indeed, it is from their perspective that we are brought into the titular resort, and whose survival we come to fear the most for.Back in the day, the Steven Spielberg original was the very definition of blockbuster entertainment, especially in how it so seamlessly fused CGI with animatronics to create awe-inspiring renditions of the beasts that once walked our earth. Like we said at the beginning, it is probably too much to ask that 'Jurassic World' has that same effect on us, but it is also the only entry thus far to come close to replicating that experience. The effects are obviously leaps and bounds over the 1993 game-changer, such that what was real feels even more so now. It is also a non-stop edge-of-your- seat thrill ride, one that hits the high gear even before the halfway mark and never lets up. You bet you'll be humming that John Williams theme song as you step out of the theater, and if you ain't awe-struck, we guarantee that it will still leave you breathless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A big dumb shiny movie, and for the most part, that's just fine.","Yeah, Jurassic World is a hot mess. In development since the third left theaters and despite a barrage of criticisms and little hope after the various trailers and clips we were shown - ranging from sexism to inadequate CGI - Spielberg's juggernaut franchise still managed to slay the box office and take over the world. It's nearing the top 30 adjusted box office ever now. That's pretty much the most Jurassic World has got going for it. It's an event movie, and that's all it feels like. The best reaction the film has gotten is calling it the best Jurassic Park sequel, which while true, isn't saying much to its quality. At the very least, it pays off something we've been waiting for 20 years. We get to see the park in operation, including many inventive ride concepts. The resemblance to Universal Studios is uncanny and wholly deliberate I'm sure, but admission for the movie feels like a discount for the theme park. Its first act of nostalgic awe is pretty wonderful, if utterly superficial but I can't call it hollow.The film may only have cheap surprises up its sleeve, but it's not short on entertainment value. Yes, it has trappings of today's action sequences of impossible camera moves that hint at how green their screens are, but it's fun to watch. Characters are indeed one- dimensional and it gives us little reason to invest in them besides the fact that if they don't act now they'll be mangled and/or eaten. It does have many contrivances to get them in or out of danger, but they're facing dinosaurs, a contrivance is the only way in or out. I wish Chris Pratt could have more opportunity to put his goofy charm on that made Guardians of the Galaxy so endearing, but here's it's more stoic badass. Among the clichés, it does get to explore a few interesting things that the first didn't have time to touch on, such as the morality of using dinosaurs as weapons. Those few moments reveal that it does have more intentions than money. Otherwise, of course Jurassic World is a big dumb shiny movie. It could be worse.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Lots of fun, some great action moments","I think reviewers are trying too hard to find a reason not to like this movie. I had high hopes for this film and they were exceeded. I went to enjoy a movie with good action sequences and lots of dinosaurs and you get that in bunches.The thing that's lacking when comparing it to the original is the sense of awe, but how are you going to recapture that? In fact, that's part of the plot: people are already bored with dinosaurs. But the dinosaur action and the sense of terror and excitement are there.Is it Oscar worthy? Of course not. But I would assume most people know what to expect when they go see a summer action blockbuster movie and this movie delivers on that. Let your brain disengage, try not to over-think it, and have some fun.My biggest criticism is not the script (okay) or the acting (good), but that all of the ""background"" dinosaurs (not the stars) are the same dull grays and browns. Would have loved to have seen a little time taken in the CGI to make the supporting cast of dinosaurs (triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, parasaurolophus, ankylosaurus) more colorful.Hoping that this film does what the original did: create a whole new generation of dinosaur scientists.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Script issues hamper the film, but not enough to keep it from being enjoyable.","More than twenty years ago, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park captivated audiences around the world, showcasing the most photorealistic depiction of dinosaurs ever realized on film, thanks to a combination of Stan Winston's animatronic creations and state- of-the-art CGI. Now, the park is open again for Jurassic World – but does this long- awaited sequel recapture the same magic?Not quite, although Universal Pictures and director Colin Trevorrow certainly make a valiant attempt. Wisely ignoring the events of the second and third films in the franchise, Jurassic World takes place approximately twenty years after the original. Isla Nublar is now home to a sprawling resort that has been operating successfully for years – something like a combination of Disneyland and an animal safari park, but with the giraffes and elephants replaced by lumbering herbivores like triceratops and stegosaurus. There's even a Sea World-esque attraction where visitors can watch a mosasaurus burst out of the water to devour its dinner before splashing down and soaking the first few rows of spectators.Jurassic World follows many of the same beats as the original film, but manages to never seem as though it's trying to replicate its predecessor. There are numerous homages to some of the most iconic scenes from Jurassic Park – some are clever winks to the die-hard fans, and some are very blatant references – but the near-constant fan service is a very welcome detail.Regrettably, the movies falls a bit short in some places, not the least of which is the truly awful dialogue. We got a few glimpses of this in some of the film's trailers and TV spots, and viewers hoping that the most cringe-worthy moments were already revealed in the marketing will be in for some disappointment. Chris Pratt – so charismatic and charming in last year's Guardians of the Galaxy – is saddled with some of the worst bits, spending most of the film as a walking exposition machine. But co-star Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't fare much better, and most exchanges between their two characters will have eyes rolling toward the ceiling.Another truly puzzling aspect of Jurassic World involves a bizarre subplot with an InGen employee (Vincent D'Onofrio) hoping to turn a velociraptor research study into a military training program, wherein the raptors could be conditioned to follow commands and be sent into war zones in place of ground troops. It's a completely ludicrous notion, and everything associated with this idea could easily have been excised from the film without losing anything important.And while I understand the theme park is modeled after real-world locations with real-world business arrangements, there is an absurd amount of product placement in this film. At one point, after Claire (Howard) shows off the facility's research lab to a group of corporate representatives hoping to sponsor an upcoming attraction, she muses about having ""Verizon Wireless presents"" on the marquee. There's also the opulent Samsung Innovation Center, towering above the resort's hub area much like Cinderella's Castle at Disneyland, not to mention a slew of retailers and eateries that would be much more at home in a shopping mall than a theme park.Aside from those admittedly large stumbling blocks, Jurassic World delivers pretty much everything fans could ask for. The number and variety of the dinosaurs has increased vastly over the original film, and the creatures are once again created through a combination of animatronics and CGI for a stunningly lifelike experience. And of course, there's the Indominus Rex, the park's first genetically engineered hybrid, which serves up most of Jurassic World's thrills and chills through a number of white-knuckle action scenes.Audiences expecting Trevorrow and Universal to redefine the genre should probably temper their expectations before purchasing a ticket. The film is hampered by some major script issues that should have been addressed long before the cameras began to roll, but they're not enough to keep the experience from being enjoyable, and fans of the original film – and even its terrible sequels – should find plenty to love about Jurassic World.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Big Cliché. Ridiculous dialogs. Worse than most B-movies,"Extremely bad movie. First of all, dialogs are poorly written. Sometimes it seems that some mentally disabled are speaking. That impression is sometimes supported by what the characters are doing according to the script. In particular, I want to mention the character played by Bryce Dallas Howard (Claire). Either she was acting very poorly or her character is so badly written and annoying that it is hard to watch her despite good look.The whole script is one big cliché. Everything is predictable. The movie is worse than most B-movies I've ever seen, because not only what happens is stupid, but is also absolutely predictable (while in many B-movies some stupid things are at least surprising, some kind of improvisation) - so it was badly, without talent planned from the start and badly, without talent implemented.

If we have Raptors...,"It was clear from the start that 'Jurassic World' was going to be all about dinosaur battle - plenty of effects and little story -, but I was irritated how openly the makers refused to pay attention to the human characters.

That's about all we get to know for the hero's 'background story' before they start running from the dinosaurs. Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) is the opponent of the current boss of the park, Masrani (Irrfan Khan), but their past is hardly explained. They are just there to have a good boss and a bad boss who don't agree on how they run the Jurassic World. In the first 'Jurassic Park', the chaos theory of Dr Malcolm really had a philosophy behind it, and he tried to convince Hammond with reasons and logic, but this kind of depth was lost during the sequels. If we have Raptors, let them out and see what happens - that's the end of the line.There is a scene when one of the boys tells his brother he is afraid their parents are going to get divorced. And when they meet their parents later - no questions asked, happy family. It seems that some background story about the family was going to be developed here in one of the probably many screenplay versions (no less than 6 writers are credited), but then dropped and forgotten at some point. Did Mum and Dad really intend a divorce, but the fear for their kids' lives brought them back together? This is the kind of thing that breathes life into cardboard characters - alas, the introduction of the possible divorce was leading nowhere, it looks like something was cut from the script here. And this is a typical example that nobody cared about the human characters, they come from nowhere and go nowhere, also in the unlikely love story that begins in a laughable scene when Claire rolls up her sleeves to impress Owen.Only the dinosaurs matter, but by the time of part 4 of the saga, the ambition to show creatures as real as possible has also been dropped. Sometimes the creatures' size is doubled to make them more impressive (Mosasaurus), or they are explained as genetic experiments right away (Indominus Rex).JW is a great roller-coaster ride, but surely not satisfactory in the story telling department. It was easy to see why they need not hire brilliant actors anymore, but spend twice as much money on effects instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better than I expected, but wouldn't hurry to see it again...","How time flies, 22 years have passed and I've returned, again to the land of the giants, to see what all the fuss is about. This time however I already had my expectations set by all the heavy advertising and merchandising and trailers and word of mouth and so on and so on! It's very difficulty for movie makers these days to surprise - its not 'always' necessary but, every film should at least entertain and, or inform. Thankfully this sequel does entertain, more so than 2 of its 3 predecessors; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised too!! Thanks mainly to the underplayed acting ability of Mr Chris Pratt, the visual beauty, and acting of Ms Bryce Dallas Howard and the brilliant, still stunning, special effects. OK, so the impact isn't as awe inspiring as it was all those years ago, I would suggest the last 20 years of cinema magic has raised the bar a smidgen! As you'd expect plot-wise there isn't much to concern yourself with, the fear factor is minimal for a 'disaster/action' movie but it does have its moments. There is far less patronising dialogue than you may have been used to over the years, for this sort of film and the action scenes do come thick and fast, eventually, and none of it could be accused of being boring! Overall, if you leave your brain at the door and just hunker down for good old fashion 'adventure', you will probably end up seeing the 'attraction'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lot of fun,"This film was a lot of fun and easily the best sequel to the original film.First, I'll get the bad points out of the way. There was way too much CGI, they really missed some opportunities to use animatronics in places. Some of the CGI did look a bit off, especially with the raptors. There were some comedy moments that really didn't fit, and threw off the pace of the film.Bad points aside, Jurassic World is an incredible joy to watch, bringing out the inner 10-year-old in me, which is exactly what Colin Trevorrow set out to do. The film starts out slow, but soon builds up to some really thrilling and exciting moments that'll make any fan of the series squeal with delight. The film is very much a love letter to the original film, with a load of throwbacks to it. The icing on the cake is the score, which faithfully captures the feel of the original.Overall, Jurassic World does what it set out to do in spectacular style. It's not without its flaws, but it does a fantastic job at capturing some of the magic the original film had.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Faithful Blast of the Past!!,"One of my most anticipated films in quite some time, Colin Trevorrow's Jurassic World is finally out in theaters for mankind to embrace and boy is it a thrill ride.Starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Vincent D'Onofrio, Jurassic World revolves around an amusement park 22 years after the incidences of the first Jurassic Park. After sales start declining, the park decides to create a hybrid dinosaur to keep attendance soaring. But catastrophe strikes once they underestimate how intelligent it is.Chriss Pratt was a great pick for the lead but I felt as though I was watching an underdeveloped super hero as opposed to a more relatable character like Dr. Alan Grant. Whether the alpha little emotions sounds appealing or not, there's no doubt he's bad***.Even with the splendid cast, the main attraction, obviously, are the dinosaurs. As ironic but somewhat predictable as it may sound, I felt that the old animatronics looked better than the special effects seen in the newest rendition. However, the vast visual spectacles exceed the original in pretty much every other aspect.Jurassic World is marvelous but not phenomenal. It successfully satisfies the brain but not quite the heart. Nevertheless, this movie purposely aims for the chaos; not the emotion behind it. It is, in short, some seriously stupid mindless fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic World,"The first movie was magical and scary. I thought Jurassic Park III was much more frightening and fun than II, and II definitely sucked after they transported big Rex and Baby Rex to San Diego (yawn), okay it sucked after Ingen came in. To much like a King Kong or any other big monster in the city movie. Jurassic World has a couple new twists, and what exactly do fans expect when you are making another movie about dinosaurs on an island with people? Jurassic world isn't a yawn fest but it should have had better writing and directing. If Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg had been involved I think it would have been better. Bottom line it is still is better than II. So let's hope there is a V and they put more thought into it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yuck!  Spoilers on spoiled dinosaur meat!,"This was absolutely pathetic movie.

No.,"The movie is not good at all, the worst of all Jurassic Park movies. The rest was all just: ""Well OK, I am sure I will forget this the second I exit the film"". The premise of the film isn't neither original or interesting nor grounded enough for it ever to be truly relevant. It's just another dinosaur and that would be OK if it wasn't inserted in this plot that a couple too many and convenient times strayed away from credibility. Moreover the themes it is trying to explore are frustratingly and repeatedly put aside. The CGI is just forgettable unfortunately. There are maybe a couple of shiny moments, but other than being somewhat underwhelming it really is just too poorly used for it to provoke any sense of wonder or amazement in 2015, I am really sorry, CGI has to be used as a gift not as a gadget and it is what this film did. And on the final negative note, you are given a group of way too generic characters, they seemed to have been pre-fabricated in the factory of generic blockbusters. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who really gives her character a beat and a presence on screen making her likable, all of the characters I really couldn't care that much and it made for repeatedly poor stakes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still the second best Jurassic movie,"It took four movies, but finally the park is open, and actual paying customers are allowed in Jurassic Park, or Jurassic World as it is apparently now called. Yet despite all this success, unfortunately currents are brewing underneath and once again something will go wrong.And that's pretty much the biggest problem I have with this film. It's the exact same story we've seen three times already. Granted, it is the most logical story when you have dinosaurs bred for amusement parks. Something will go wrong, dinosaurs will run amuck, mass hysteria, yada, yada. But come one, there must be something else you can do with this setting. Shady executives selling dinosaurs for black market businessmen, dinosaur genes used to enhance modern day animals for blood sports, some dinosaurs appearing to be way more intelligent than science would have understand. Anything but this again.We even have the exact same kid characters in need of rescuing. Okay, their names and actors are different, but they're the Jurassic Park kid characters, no changes whatsoever. This is doubly annoying because this time the adult characters are actually pretty interesting and these two brats take away much needed time from them.That being said, the actual movie is okay. Sure the dinos are obviously CGI, but aside from that, they look impressive. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard more than convince as the main adult characters. Irrfan Khan is a lot of fun as the eccentric new owner of the park and the rest of the cast is equally talented. Aside from the kids, that is. And while the main story is painfully similar to the ones before it, there are some new, refreshing touches. Like the fact that the park is actually open this time. The first third of the film flies by with no problems because of this. The ending climax is also very, very cool and almost worth the price of admission by itself.But, in the end, that means that Jurassic World is simply a slightly above average film in general. It's still the second best film in the franchise, but that's not saying much, seeing that parts two and three are not even worth mentioning in polite conversation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good,"""Jurassic World,"" released in 2015, served as a highly anticipated revival of the beloved ""Jurassic Park"" franchise. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, the film aimed to capture the wonder and terror of the original while updating the concept for a modern audience. Here's a comprehensive look at its key elements:
* The Premise and Setting:
* ""Jurassic World"" presents a scenario where John Hammond's vision has finally been realized: a fully operational dinosaur theme park. Located on Isla Nublar, the park draws massive crowds, showcasing a variety of genetically engineered dinosaurs.* However, the film explores the dangers of complacency and the relentless pursuit of novelty. To maintain visitor interest, the park's scientists create a new hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which inevitably escapes and wreaks havoc.* Themes and Narrative:
* The film delves into themes of scientific hubris, the ethical implications of genetic manipulation, and humanity's desire to control nature.* It also addresses the concept of consumerism and the ever-increasing demand for spectacle, which drives the creation of the Indominus Rex.* The narrative follows Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a raptor trainer, and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager, as they struggle to contain the Indominus Rex and save the park's visitors.* Key Features:
* The film delivers thrilling action sequences and impressive visual effects, bringing the dinosaurs to life with remarkable realism.* It incorporates elements of nostalgia, paying homage to the original ""Jurassic Park"" while forging its own identity.* The introduction of the Indominus Rex provides a formidable antagonist, pushing the boundaries of dinosaur danger.* The film also reintroduces the velociraptors, and shows a different side to their nature, by showing raptors that have a bond with Owen Grady.* Reception and Impact:
* ""Jurassic World"" was a massive box office success, proving the enduring appeal of the ""Jurassic"" franchise.* It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects and action sequences, but some criticism for its narrative and character development.* The film successfully reignited interest in the franchise, paving the way for subsequent sequels.In conclusion, ""Jurassic World"" successfully blended nostalgia with modern filmmaking techniques, delivering a thrilling and entertaining cinematic experience. It served as a strong foundation for the continuation of the ""Jurassic"" saga, while also providing a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Irrational Fear of Dinosaurs Confirmed,"OK so I haven't actually seen this movie, and probably won't due to my irrational fear of dinosaurs that I suddenly developed when I was in high school. I just look at where technology has taken these realistic robotic dinosaurs and realize, what if all of these dinosaur robots or whatever they are fell into the wrong hands and one day attacked a city or something crazy like that?!?! I just know that dinosaurs have scared me for awhile and that the original Jurassic Park movies were scary enough so I dare not see this one. But I was also reading up on the DNA with the mammoths too. Let's just hope no one's idea of an apocalypse include raising artificial dinosaurs and mammoths of the sort! I just had to comment because my fear of dinosaurs has been so weird to me over the years (because I knew they were extinct) but this last time I went to Water World (in Colorado) I knew my fear had escalated on the dinosaur ride they have there and weirdly enough, this theory of being able to see how if in the wrong hands, someone could technically do something along the lines of what I assume this movie is about. Ahhhhhhh",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A worthy sequel to Jurassic Park.,"""Jurassic Park: An adventure 65 Million Years in the Making"" and after two less than stellar sequels and 22 years they've finally managed to make a fun and worthy sequel to the first movie. So what is this film about? In short, they've officially opened the park under the name Jurassic World and the park is doing well enough. However, to increase profit/ratings etc. they've decided to create something big and scary. This monster escapes from captivity and starts causing problems for the entire park. Resulting in our protagonists, played by Chriss Pratt (from: Guardians of the Galaxy) and Bryce Howard (from: The Village), to find a way to stop it and save the island.After watching this film I have to admit that it was more enjoyable than I had expected, while it was far from perfect it was most certainly better than movie 2 and 3. Sure there were moments that really pushed my suspense of disbelieve and it even jumped the shark 1 time, however this didn't take away the fact that it was an enjoyable film to watch. The most important thing for me is that they brought back the sense of wonder and discovery something that was just glanced over in the previous sequels and totally neglected in other movies (yeah I'm talking about you ""Jupiter Ascending""). This sense of wonder is achieved by the use of practical effects and GOOD use of CGI (this is something I would love to write about in the future). However, the most contributing thing about the movie is John Williams's score. He brought back the old theme to create a sense of nostalgia for old viewers (like me  ) and truly expanded the music creating an, for the lack of a better word, Jurassic atmosphere.Three act structure: The beginning of the movie is truly the gem. This is the part that introduces/reintroduces us to the Jurassic and from a child's perspective we are shown how wonderful dinosaurs are (at least it shows us how pretty they are to look at). The movie uses references to Jurassic Park and ups the wow factor with its music and grandness that is Jurassic World with wide camera shots and overviews of the park. We are also introduced to the protagonists and antagonists and this is all done in a likable way. I do have to admit that the introduction of the movie's plot (the monster) was regrettable since this felt like something from another movie.The middle: In my personal opinion I thought this was the weakest part of the film. Maybe with a little more build up or tension it would have been better. I would call this part the CHASE or the HUNT (depending on the perspective). The good thing is that we see our protagonists handle with real props and practical effects, which contributes to the feel of the movie. However, I think they should have used this part to better develop the antagonists since they weren't well developed at the end (IMHO).The End The movie picks up the pace and combines the best of everything that happens in the movie. Sure this is the part that you'll have to suspend your sense of disbelieve to truly enjoy it, but the pace and action well make up for it. It is a great ride to the finish.The Good: - Great Music Score by John Williams - A lot of Easter eggs for movie enthusiasts - Good beginning - Likable characters - Sense of wonder and excitement - T-RexThe Bad - 3D is not worth it. I'm sick and tired of this stupid gimmick. Yes there are movies made for 3D and they do look amazing, but most movies are just 3D filtered using computer software. If possible do not watch this in 3D. - Antagonists needs to be better developed - Movie length. I think it needs at least 10 min cut to improve the pacing a little. - Pushed the suspense of disbelief to the limit and it jumped the shark 1 time. - Some movie quibblesThe dinosaurs are back looking better than ever. It's not a perfect movie but it is a good sequel to a great movie. It is a bit long with 124min but it is a ride worth taking. Plus it has baby triceratops that has to be a plus right? I liked this movie and I'm very curious about the sequel(s).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining.,"What happens when you genetically splice together a reboot and a sequel? This film. It's interesting to find a franchise that's willing to recognize the past material and build upon it, while also adding slightly new elements to it. The idea of training dinosaurs just like pets was undoubtedly the strongest element of this movie, even if the result was the same as it's ever been. Part of the problem with this reboot, however, is that the characters don't seem to click, even to the point of the relationships feeling forced.While there were plentiful nods to the first film that started off the franchise, the plot seemed almost identical to the 1993 classic, but with plenty of cliches and hokey lines to go around. I think sequels like this recognize the elements that made the original great, but almost spend too much time overanalyzing to try and recreate the magic. These films ultimately fall short, mostly due to the synergy and sheer luck that made all the elements of the first movie work in the first place.All that being said, it was an exciting thrill ride with a bunch of ridiculous dinosaur battles: essentially what you paid for anyway. I mean, the first film in this franchise worked because of the terror that goes with being trapped on an island full of dangerous dinosaurs. This film dispenses these scary moments, but in a way that just seems like a Hollywood action blockbuster (which if we're honest, it is). It was nice to see the franchise try to return to its roots, but I also think we should have let this franchise go extinct with only the original as its hallmark achievement.A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining, I give Jurassic World 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not so clever, but oh so fun","Although not nearly as clever as the 1993 original, Jurassic World brings life back to a mesmerizing idea with tons of special effects to please your every need. Seeing this in theaters when I was 11 and 12, I had one hell of a time. The film itself is super fun to watch, very entertaining, and the action scenes are done magnificently well. The special effects and dinos themselves are just stunning to look at on screen and I love the look of the set itself. Chris Pratt isn't anything great here, his character hardly has enough time to develop to be anything memorable- and really just serves his purpose to be the fearless leader type which is fine but hardly perfect. I enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard a lot, and the kids were fine- none of the acting was anything memorable or great but it served its purpose enough to carry along the films story. There is a few childish moments here and there, and some stupid ones, but thankfully the film itself manages to rise above its flaws and make for a very interesting situation that anages to be thrilling and a total blast all at once. In the end, there isn't a whole lot to say about Jurassic World. It's your typical big budget blockbuster with high octane action and some subpar moments. It's not anything oscar worthy, but it's certainly worth a watch or two simply for the fun of it.My Rating: 8.3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I wanted everyone to die.,"The overriding thing i took away from watching Jurassic World was not that the characters were utterly stupid ( they were ) or that the story was dull and predictable ( it was ) , it's that considering this film was made 22 years after the original it doesn't look any better . In fact i would say it looks worse. I was looking forward to watching Chris Pratt again after his brilliant performance in Guardians of the Galaxy but even he was dull in this. This movie was crying out for a Jeff Goldblum , Sam Neil or a Richard Attenborough but what we got was a ridiculously over the top Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio.

The best of the sequels,"While most rightfully are saying this is the best of the sequels and certainly better than the trailers made it look, some are pretty unsatisfied with Jurassic World. While flawed, JW is ultimately a strong, nostalgic and well made blockbuster that avoids the flaws of the other sequels. The Lost World descends into mediocrity and lacks an interesting plot, while Jurassic Park III is devoid of a compelling story, although it has some cool set pieces later on. This one actually has a good plot, although it's a bit mystifying as to why they went ahead and opened the park. A genetically modified dinosaur goes on the rampage, giving the plot a tight, suspenseful focus and once again having the thought provoking themes of hubris the original had. It's tense, exciting and there's actually a sense of fear as this time many members of the public are involved. The trailers looked generic but thankfully this is a pleasant surprise, and most likely soon to join the Billion Dollar Club. The biggest surprise of all is that the kids are actually semi bearable.With a good story, decent CGI and plenty of tension, this is a good blockbuster, but flaws are aplenty. The action doesn't reach the heights of prior instalments and the finale has a bit too much CGI. The characters aren't done well. Although he gets through the film with one expression mostly, Chris Pratt does a fine job as the hero, but the other characters are side-lined, while Bryce Dallas Howard, despite her best efforts, is stuck with a boring, tedious and irritating character. Somewhat unremarkable and occasionally reeking of sexism, JW lacks true punch and opts for more generic CGI set pieces. More effective are the nostalgic nods to the original film. After the 22 year wait for another good Jurassic Park film, fans of the original will undoubtedly appreciate this. Colin Trevorrow isn't Steven Spielberg, but he directs the film well and more often than not borrows intelligently from Spielberg and uses genuine suspense. There are illogical plot points here and there but you're unlikely to notice them. Good stuff overall.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The CGI looked incredible and the story included lots of different aspects of this new park along with some old references to the ones before which are nice touches for big fans of the franchise (because even I noticed them). The only problem I had was that very little was left to surprise because, as well as the trailer did at making people want to go see it, you might as well walk in in the last 20 minutes and then you'll have all the new clips you haven't seen before ! The whole hybrid creating of dinosaurs was a nice aspect revealing a whole new level of terror in the creatures of the film as you don't know what they have used to create the Idominous Rex (and are eager to find out as you see it use more and more abilities you didn't know it had) This film is a definite watch for old or new fans of the series, and definitely wasn't a let down.

It was an action packed Jurassic Park film that we would expect, along with some suspense and comedic relief. We got that serious side of Chris Pratt that I was hoping for, and a movie where i was on the edge of my seat at quite a few moments.

A true Sequel to Jurassic Park!,"Watching this very entertaining blockbuster, I kept thinking that this really should have been Jurassic Park 2. I found that the Lost World was overstuffed plot wise and that JP3 lacked any tension and did not have an interesting story to tell.Now Jurassic World brought one of the main points I loved about the original film, it really is about a theme park gone wrong just like the original but in a much larger scale. The plot resolve around teenager Zach and his little brother Gray who are sent to Jurassic World by their parents who are going through a rough patch in their relationship.Here they are supposed to spend time with their Aunt Claire who manage the park but she his too busy overseeing the park newest attraction, a genetically created new type of Dinosaur.This new breed his faster, smarter and deadlier this is why she his getting assistance from Dino expert/Ex boyfriend Owen to evaluate this new creation.Of course this being a Jurassic Park film the Pooh soon enough hit the fan, the kids get lost, the new Dino go on a rampage and well all hell break loose. Acting wise you have the main four actors that are very likable and you do end up caring for them.Chris Prat is bringing the same charisma he delivered in Gardians of Galaxy.Howard his perfect has the stuck up workaholic who gets a severe wake up call and the two kids are not annoying (No gymnastic routine thank goodness) But the Dino is really what people want to see and Dinosaurs are here at plenty.You have returning favorites and I was happy that they gave some flying Dino some time to shine. Well I had a great time and I would advise people to experience this film in Imax 3d for full immersion, you won't regret it. Overall, it is not better then the first film (Considering the first one is a cult classic that has a footprint in film history that would be impossible) but it is much,much better then both the Lost World and the horrid JP3, it feels like a true Sequel with plenty of wink to the original film throughout.I give this Franchise return to form a solid 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What the actual f@$#,"Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" was and still is one of my favorite books. I read it when I was eight, and it quickly turned me into a dinosaur nerd. I dreamed of becoming a paleontologist, I collected encyclopedias about dinosaurs and I could name even the rarest dinosaur species you would see on TV or film. For some reason I hadn't seen the book's adaptation before I was 18 and when I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed. It was just stupid. However, when I saw it for the second time, I kinda liked it. It wasn't the book, but it was a fine action/adventure movie. Of course, the visual effects were outstanding. I even liked its' sequel. I don't think I have seen 'Jurassic Park 3', and I will probably never waste my time with it.But I did see 'Jurassic World'. I expected it to be a funny movie with lots of dinosaurs... Well, it was definitely funny, although for all the wrong reasons. This has got to be the worst high budget summer movie I have ever seen. Nothing really works in it, not even the visual effects - they are just awful, sorry. Well, not exactly awful, the dinosaurs' moves are well done and the creatures blend nice with the scenery, but one can say the same thing about the dinosaurs in ""Terra Nova"" - and that is a TV show. The CGI in 'Jurassic World' lacks detail. It looks as if it was made in the 90s. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' came out ten years ago, and its' visual effects were much more detailed. Not to mention movies like 'Avatar' - when it comes to... everything, especially visuals, it blows 'Jurassic World' out of the water with ease - and it came out six years ago. There is no excuse for 'Jurassic World's poor CGI. Its' creators had the budget and the technology to make it better, but, alas, they chose to do a half-@$$ed job with it. And that is not the movie's biggest problem.This is just not a movie, it is a product, manufactured on an assembly line. There is not a single original idea in it - even its' title is made by combining the titles of the first two movies. The plot is almost identical to the plot of the first movie, but everything that made sense about it has been surgically removed. And this time the army is involved. The writing is incoherent, implausible and downright dumb. And, as I like to say, this is not an opinion, this is a fact. I won't spoil it, but parts of this product (as I said, I can't call it a movie anymore) are directly contradicting other parts. The acting is about as good as the writing. Yes, many good actors are involved here, but they aren't even trying. Chris Pratt is playing exactly the same character he played in 'Guardians of the Galaxy', but this time his character is written as if he is supposed to be an action hero like Indiana Jones. He doesn't have many comedic lines, and the dissonance between the way he is written and the way Pratt is playing him is just mind blowing - and not in a good way. Bryce Dallas Howard is a tiny bit better, but her character is just awful. Vincent D'Onofrio is an incredible actor, but he isn't given anything to work with here. I wouldn't even bother to mention the rest of them.As a whole, this thing works only as a comedy. You can laugh at its stupidity. I know I did. This is why I am so generous with the rating here. 'Jurassic World' is a 3/10 movie at best, but I am rating it higher, because it entertained me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It was good, but not near as good as the last one.","As the title says, I did like the movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as the last one. It was definitely lacking in overall excitement, at least compared to the last one. Honestly, if it wasn't a Jurassic Park movie, I would probably say wait until it comes out to streaming or dvd, but there is still enough to make it worth seeing in the theater. Hopefully if they decide to do a third movie, they will step it up some. I think this one will be similar to how the second movie was, in the original trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not as magical, but a great addition to the franchise","Jurrasic World is a perfect blend of new ideas and old ideas to the Jurrasic franchise. With some great moments made as an homage to the original, it has its light moments, its comedic moments, and its action, balanced well enough to carry an overused and predictable plot. Howard does a beautiful job as the powerful lead actress trying to control chaos and the consequent adaption required. And D'onofrio, as talented of an actor as he is, was a complete miss in character. His comically painted villainy is cheesy, cliché, and crosses the border into hilarity. It becomes so bad, it feels ironic and intentional. Jurrasic World is an enjoyable feat that does far better than its predecessors but unfortunately, it is not as magical as the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Jurassic Park IV. The T Twenty One Thousand,"A couple of kids are going to the finally functional Dinosaur Park while their parents are about to divorce. Right from the beginning, this movie isn't afraid to be somewhat different than what came before. Unlike every previous installment in the franchise, ""Jurassic World"" doesn't open with somebody getting hurt or killed by dinosaurs. That is fresh.The kids arrive and begin enjoying the park. Only this part of the movie isn't long. The movie cannot do without yet another story of dinosaurs breaking free and wreaking havoc. Those two kids could be the basis for the whole picture. One of them is clearly not enthusiastic about the park itself, he's basically there to watch over his little brother. The plot could have focused on them and how they go from one attraction to another, exploring their relationship as brothers. The young actors weren't bad at all, and the movie could have done more with them. But it does not.Dinosaurs, apparently, are no longer interesting for crowds of people, even though the park is clearly packed with visitors. But the movie states that the popularity isn't big enough. What you see and what you are told are incompatible, they contradict each other. Regardless, the scientific division has come up with a solution. They have genetically engineered a new species of dinosaur. It is bigger than the T Rex and it has several superpowers. First, it can hide its thermal signature from the tech designed to monitor it. But the creature only uses it once. Second, it can camouflage. But the creature only uses it once throughout the whole film. Regardless, the new dinosaur breaks free and trouble is imminent.Owen, an ex-military and now an animal handler, and his ex-girlfriend Claire, who is now running the park, must find a solution to this crisis. Also, the two kids from the beginning are her nephews. Also, there are people that want to use dinosaurs in wars. The third movie had a very simple plot, too simple, perhaps. The fourth one is the other way around. It has too many elements to deal with. They do not have enough time to shine. All of this material feels like it could be two movies instead of one.So, the plot does deserve criticism. What also deserves it is how the movie handles death scenes, which is worse than ""The Lost World"". The new super carnivore is interesting. And it isn't the only addition to the carnivore arena. Herbivores are also there, and they have more screen time than in the third film. The cast and the performances were good. What was bad about them is, again, how they were handled. They simply needed more space to breathe. The movie is packed. Visual effects were good, definitely better than the last time.And finally, the franchise chooses to have most of the action take place at daytime, and totally avoid rain. The visuals, in general, were very pleasant, by the way. Only the plot is highly problematic. It wants too much and it does not avoid serious mistakes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IGNORE THE HATERS!!! This flick is seriously enjoyable!,"After all of the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting to be let down. I wasn't! The special effects and 3D were spot on, the scripting was better than the last two(on par with the original), and the acting was better than some summer blockbusters. If you are capable of forgetting the last two Jurassic Park films, then this is the sequel the original deserved. The plot is plausible(for a film about dinosaurs)and I think too many people are trying to focus on the alleged social commentary instead of simply enjoying an entertaining movie. Yes, there are a couple of plot holes, but none that detracts from the caliber of the film, and the lack of believable chemistry between the two protagonists was the only real negative I can find. Go see it and be enjoyed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best movie I have seen in a while.,"In it's entirety, Jurassic World was a fantastic movie filled with action, suspense, and plenty of laughter. However, the comedic ties back to some comedy of our time and a few cheesy romance scenes could have been left out in my opinion. In the original three movies, there are no ties to the year the movies were produced, besides the technology used, which makes them timeless. This movie, although incredibly fantastic, was lacking in the timeless factor. The other three movies (especially the first one) are my favorite movies and I watch them whenever they're on TV and I own all three. Despite my dislike of the timeless factor, it was a great movie and a definite must-see! Especially the ending, that was INCREDIBLE. You won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well made, but not as good as the original.","Although incredibly well-made and entertaining in its own right, I still prefer the original from 20 years ago. Some of the suspense and emotion just feels 'forced' compared to the original where it came naturally. This modernized version just didn't do it for me. It also made me realize how incredible the visual effects of the original actually were, as they seemed more realistic. The effects in this new film are more obvious CGI than 'Jurassic Park'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a disappointment this movie was,"Though I must say I didn't expect much when I went to the cinema to watch this movie, but my fears proved right. There were at least for or five moments during the movie when I wanted to get up and leave this atrocious show. I just can't decide which aspect of the movie was worse than the other, the plot, the dinosaur design, the cast, the acting. The first Jurassic park story way back in 1993. was light years better in every aspect. It's really a terrible shame this one was such a disappointment. The only positive side of this movie was provided by damn good and realistic animal animation. To me any future Jurassic park movie sequel is a big ""No, No, No""!!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great entertainment,"If you like the Jurassic movies, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't expect too much character depth or clever story line. Yes, the characters are a bit one dimensional and the story.., well, it is what it is.The animation and special effects are very good. You believe the animals are alive, and one scene in particular may even bring out a tear or two.For the very young audiences, the movie might be a bit intense, but I don't think it would serve the movie right to tone down the creature violence. If you have a flesh-eating dinosaur running after you, you'll probably going to get eaten!Despite the clichés and the fact that it can't touch the original, my friends and I had a very good time watching Jurassic World. I felt the movie delivered a great 4th installment of the Jurassic family. So, go see it; the action will keep you thrilled throughout the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best Blockbuster movie of Summer 2015!,"I went into the theater expecting a half baked effort at yet another remake; some studio trying to rekindle the fire on an old classic. I left the theater on a high not experienced since watching Avatar. The makers of Jurassic World have done something truly inspiring by balancing the new with the old. They show us a theme park not much different than Universal Studios or Harry Potter; with this they show what the world has come to expect and give a sense of realism to the movie. They put in real life characters that show how 20 years have changed society. Smart phones, 2 second attention spans, big corporations after money and others looking to exploit science to build weapons.For the die hard fans, there's plenty of easter eggs and nods to the classic Jurassic Park. Those moments, when the theme song plays and a familiar tid bit appears on screen will make you fall in love all over again with the Jurassic Park universe. In my opinion, this is what really grounds Jurassic Park World (JPW).The plot is interesting and littered with humorous moments for the entire family to enjoy. I'm not exaggerating when I say there is not a single boring moment in JPW!A strong cast with good actors chosen for even type-cast roles made JPW's script believable and enjoyable. I felt each character was invested in his/her role. Standout performances from Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt and the young and energetic Ty Simpkins add so much energy and realism to the movie. Not to mention, Jake Johnson with his trademark wit and sense of humor delivers arguably the best lines in the movie which are nods to the classic JP and jibes at some of the evils in today's world.The ending was beautiful, chaotic and ever so enchanting. Jurassic Park World deserves to take the mantle from the original JP as THE dinosaur movie for the 21st century! I hope it inspires the same feelings of joy, humanity and humbleness in today's kids the way it did in me 20 years ago.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Light hearted, visual spectacle","Jurassic World is light hearted in tone and nature throughout. This consistency makes it enjoyable for the wider audience, and I enjoyed it myself as a spectacle. There isn't any real depth to the film - the story line is comfortingly predictable and it has the cheesy one liners to accompany it. The cheesy one liners are a bit tongue in cheek - they are are geared to have fun with the audience and it works. The cast works. Chris Pratt plays the hero effortlessly. The one person who stood out for me and gave depth to a role was Vincent D'Onofrio. He was intense and quietly sinister. The visual and special effects make the movie a real spectacle. Some of the sequences are great to watch and give it a real blockbuster quality. It doesn't offer anything deeper than that and doesn't try to. It lacks the tension and genuine quality of the original but it's still enjoyable viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Caution: Park Has Reopened!,"First off, it's hard to imagine that it's been twenty-two years since Michael Crichton's original novel Jurassic Park leapt from its fine pages and graced cinema screens under Steven Spielberg's direction to a wide array of audiences with breathtaking visuals and a plot that provided a theory on how science can be both groundbreaking and seriously flawed at the same time.In this sequel, over two decades have passed since the incident on Isla Nublar's Jurassic Park and it would seem founder John Hammond's legacy continues to live on with the reopening of the park now in full swing as ""Jurassic World"" with tourists from all over the world visiting to see real-live dinosaurs. However, the follies of human beings still loom upon introducing the first hybrid dinosaur that may as well outrank the park's once signature T-Rex.'Guardians of the Galaxy' star, Chris Pratt plays rational Velociraptor tamer Owen Grady as he must deal with the goings-on behind the scenes of the now vast expansion of the park. It's like his character basically borrows the Dino-savvy traits of Sam Neill's Dr. Alan Grant and the survival instincts of Bob Peck's Game Warden Robert Muldoon. Whereas, Bryce Dallas Howard as park operations manager Claire Dearing is a typical portrayal of a hard-working individual who hardly has a life outside of her work (like watching her own nephews venturing in the park). As both characters must work together, they must also stop corrupt individuals who secretly plot to use the dinosaurs for their own personal gain, which I found obvious the moment they spoke about these creatures' capabilities. Claire's nephews Zach and Gray - played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins respectively - loosely mirror the original siblings Lex and Tim Murphy, who are inadvertently thrown into this perilous adventure when attacked by the hybrid dinosaur.The entire plot and theme does feel very similar to its 1993 predecessor - thus tending to make some pivotal scenes predictable - in terms of the consequences in corporate greed and how our most greatest creations can also meet our darkest fears. But I'd say it works out fine by introducing this to an entirely new generation who were too young or weren't even born to witness what the film series had done years prior. With enough action, suspense, and Pratt's occasional humor, it does not distract from the movie's pacing.I was disappointed none of the human characters from the past movies ever returned to reprise their roles (save for B.D. Wong's reprisal of Dr. Henry Wu), but I understand what new director Colin Trevorrow meant by ""shoehorning them into the exact same predicament"" over and over again without a proper reason. For the casual film-goer, it's a delight to see how much has been offered whether you're nostalgic or a newcomer. I felt relieved that this movie sequel didn't stray into B-Movie territory as 2001's Jurassic Park III and instead greatly one-ups it with a better plot and depth. The visual effects certainly have advanced these days since I noticed some usage of motion-capture in a few scenes. It's impressive the film crew didn't rely too heavily on often-used CGI effects, but the subtle use of animatronics and 'suitmation' as well. Although not really groundbreaking at all as the first movie, it nevertheless had a vibrant new cast and I loved that some scenes in the movie paid tribute or an homage to Steven Spielberg's 1993 original with flying colors. I'm glad these filmmakers never forgot those roots and kept them intact to acknowledge its presence. With the accompanying music score of Michael Giacchino (standing in for original composer John Williams), it gives a nice touch to what Jurassic Park's opening theme was known well for. My thoughts, it's a sequel that stands proudly as the majestic T-Rex once did in its prehistorical era.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Personally didn't really like this,"I don't know if it's nostalgia or what, but personally I think this is worse than Jurassic park III. Okay so firstly worse or not this movie is definitely not good, the plot is completely out of whack and involves making dinosaurs part of the army and people getting bored of dinosaurs (as if people don't enjoy the zoo in present day). I will say the characters are fairly better than Jurassic park III the main villain while being paper thing and incredibly bland, is fairly enjoyable. Claire is a very basic character but she has some good moments. The kids aren't nearly developed enough (they have a subplot that I won't spoil, but it literally goes nowhere), but the kids are still mostly enjoyable. Chris Pratt is actually really good in this in my opinion, he still does somewhat play himself but his bond with the raptors is incredibly believable and honestly the best part of this entire film. So yeah, the characters are incredibly basic but they're still pretty enjoyable and do their job. I think my biggest issue is the kids kind of break up the movie a lot. The kids exist to show the whimsy of the park and while I do love the park they've made for this movie, it does feel like a real place and one you'd love to go to, it is a lot less interesting when all the other plots are focusing on dinosaurs breaking out. And due to that while this movie has some of the best scenes in the entire franchise, it's probably the least consistently enjoyable. I still think this is a great movie however, and the scenes in this are incredibly good it's definitely a movie I'd still recommend but just be warned the plot is incredibly dumb, it's a bit slow and not really scary. Oh also the final 20 are actually phenomenal, incredibly dumb. But some of the best Dino action in the entire franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dissapointing,"Jurassic World is a real amusement park now, it looks great, it looks fun, but somehow someway it less exciting, why it less exciting? Because Jurassic World fills with full of a boring people, boring story, sometimes cheesy dialogue, the Dinosaur is mostly just too CGI for me, and of course nowadays film everything there have to be a romance, let's compare Jurassic World to the first Jurassic Park, in Jurassic Park we got Alan Grant and Ellie who is already a lovely couple yet they both adventurous and it works perfectly, in Jurassic World we got Owen and Claire still try to get their relationship and it just didn't work for me at all, also we got Ian in Jurassic Park which just the best, they don't have him or at least a character like him, the kids are both just boring, compare to the kids in Jurassic Park they are somehow someway fun and as exciting and as good as the other, the CGI in Jurassic Park feel more real than Jurassic World because at the time CGI are not look too animated so it still feel real, now? Well you can see it from the movie and compare it to Jurassic Park, in the more positive way even though i'm not a big fan of all the character but i think they performance was not awful, not great too but they're all ok, the look of Jurassic World was great, the score was amazing, and the last battle scene was pretty darn cool, but still overall product i was unfortunately still have to say that for me Jurassic World is a dissapointing film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A 90's Summer Blockbuster for the Next Generation,"I feel spurred on to write this review from the barrage of hate and negativity I've read online from the keyboard warriors, I really can't see why they hate the film so much, I thought it was fantastic. Maybe this is because I've only watched one trailer and avoid all other promotional material (I always do this because I find these days just too much is given away). To me this is had the same awe and spectacle as seeing the original when I was 12, yes it's hard to live up to a classic film 20 years later, you can't instantly pin down a classic, but I believe this was a really good sequel, much better than all the other Jurassic Park sequels and many other 2nd films in franchises.It's hard to wow an audience these days but I believe that this film managed to bring back that summer blockbuster feel of the 90s. It was easy to gloss over some of the more negative elements for me, the product placement at the beginning was excessive and obvious, especially as the film was taking about the commercialisation of everything. It almost felt like a commercial for Mercedes at one point. But to get into the details without spoiling, basically Chris Pratt was great as Peter Quill Dinosaur hunter, we can gloss over that too, because he came across as totally bad-ass and believable, and Bryce Dallas Howard who had the most in the way of character development didn't feel stereotyped or forced, quite identifiable actually, and her chemistry with Pratt was superb.Yes the plot was quite obvious, but they did say this was a mix of remake and sequel, so some elements are going to be reused. For one I didn't actually find the kids irritating, even less so than the whiny brats in the original film. They actually had a point being there and were even able to show resilience, being able to look after themselves, they were not just there to be saved. The deaths seemed to hit home more, although we instantly knew who was going to get eaten, this didn't distract from the fun of watching it happen. There was enough twisting and turning of the plot to keep us on our toes and plenty of scares, I don't think I've jumped so much for years! There were loads of geeky nods to the original film which make us very happy and the supporting cast were all good and believable without being stereotyped, (which happens so often in sci-fi movies,) especially BD Wong, now that's a villain for the 21st century.I wont go further into the plot, I just think you need to go see this film. It's action packed, CGI madness, but deserves a lot higher praise, especially after the disappointment this year of Avengers 2. I can easily see this spurring on more films and with this level of quality I can't wait to see what comes next as it was a brilliant addition to the Jurassic Park world!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Dino thrills and nostalgia,"""Jurassic World,"" directed by Colin Trevorrow, brings the beloved dinosaur franchise back to life with a mix of nostalgia and modern thrills. Set years after the original Jurassic Park, the film introduces a fully functional dinosaur theme park, complete with awe-inspiring attractions and cutting-edge technology. However, the quest for bigger and more thrilling attractions leads to the creation of the genetically-engineered Indominus Rex, a dinosaur that quickly becomes a catastrophic threat.Chris Pratt shines as Owen Grady, a charismatic raptor trainer with a deep understanding of the park's creatures. His chemistry with Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager, adds a human element to the dinosaur chaos. The young actors, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, also deliver engaging performances as Claire's nephews caught in the adventure.The visual effects are spectacular, bringing dinosaurs to life in a way that is both thrilling and terrifying. The film pays homage to the original while introducing new elements that keep the story fresh and exciting.

really good,"definitely watch it; it's a rehashed version of the original Jurassic park while paying homage to the past Jurassic park films. i personally enjoyed the idea of having Zach and Grey as the main characters over the scientists (malcolm, grant, sattler) and everything ties in quite well. the indominus Rex is amazing once you get to see her. the suspense and build up for the indominus Rex (twice) are both incredible. the film may seem long (it's about 2 hours and 30 minutes) but you'll be entertained from the very beginning to the very end. this movie is a great edition to the Jurassic park series and it's definitely better than Jurassic park 2 and 3, almost as good as the original. the movie is more action packed and doesn't weight in story as much but certain attributes to the characters (spoiler: like Owen and the raptors) becomes relevant in the end. spoiler by the way, the t-Rex makes an appearance and the ending containing the t-Rex is the best thing ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better then expect it but...,"First of all, like many of you, I was largely influenced by the reviews which are very harsh. Before letting the reviews guide you through the decision whether your going to watch the movie or not, give it a try. It's way better then you might think but of course there could be some disappointment. After all, no movie is perfect.I'll go with the bright side first. The acting was really good and in no way overdramatized like many are saying. The script was well written but maybe a little predictable here end there. And the dinosaurs were just phenomenal. Now what disappointed me was sorta the development of the movie. The romance between Owen and Claire just didn't really make sense. They first tell us they once went on a date, and expect us out of the blues to understand like there was another movie before this. And if they want to add romance, they should expand it. Make it more obvious there's stuff going on between them. They spend half the movie like they don't know each other and then they kiss, seriously ?! I'll make a reference from the second Jurassic world, were the same thing happens. The other thing I didn't like was its very predictable and typical ending. There's a dinosaur chasing them and they have to kill it, and once they do everyone is happy. I hope they change that in the JW 3, cause its getting a little old.Overall, the movie was great, not amazing, but great.

As to be expected the plot wasn't very original, but take that with the grain of salt that going in you don't expect too much originality.

Derivative But OK,"16 June 2015. This movie seems to be a fusion of a monster disaster movie, typical of King Kong (2005) that has the beautiful, helpless lady sprawled on the ground with her skirt hiked up. The creation of the new dinosaur and the questions it raises might the singular most intellectually intriguing for this mostly predictable, mind-numbing and questionable logically flawed movie. There are so many scenes that just seem to be connected with so many coincidences as simply a lazy script device to keep the pacing and excitement going regardless. The visuals are decent for now and will eventually be improved upon in the future. The sound effects effective. There are number of relational and character moments of merit but mostly underdeveloped or never fully developed. Irrfan Khan's character had the most stimulating and interesting character (the new tycoon owner) that was never truly met the exciting character that he would have been developed into. I was waiting for the older boy's interest in attractive girls to be developed into more balance gender movie.I was more impressed by the subtle but stimulating mental themes of the Disney-like contrast of a thrilling futurist community of Tomorrowland (2015) or the gene splicing creation of Splice (2009) or the action thrills of Aliens (1986) or Predator (1987). In a number of ways the animated sci fi movie Wall*e (2008) possessed more mental and artistic impact than Jurassic World using silence for much of the instead of exciting, explosive action, a much more difficult directorial feat. Even classic sci fi movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) had a much more captivating and magically engrossing visual and mysterious them without all the overly graphic bombardment for the testosterone deprived audience. Without the dry wit of Jeff Goldblum's contributions in the original movies, the overall Jurassic World looses a lot of its charm in the face of so much violence and perhaps unnecessary devastation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Inheriting all the good traits of the franchise, Jurassic World is a worthy successor","I had fond memories for Jurassic Park, it is one of the first movies I watched. The sense of novelty back then was near magical, so expectation was high for this new installment. Jurassic World is basically reincarnation of the first two titles. Utilizing grand spectacle and cheeky nostalgia factor it succeeds in capturing the essence of the franchise. It may be predictable and frankly not as awe-inspiring as the first, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable film for both old and new audiences.The plot remains the same, they put dinosaurs on display and wait until human hubris ruins everything. We all know what will happen, and there's not much cerebral twist or groundbreaking narrative. Safe to say it plays to its strength without revolutionizing the genre, which is all right. It has great production value to deliver what had already worked on capturing audience's imagination.Visual takes a very familiar approach, not only on subtle details or atmosphere, you can literally see intentional throwbacks to past glory. Wardrobes such as Chris Pratt's shirt and vest or Bryce Howard's blouse and tanktop, which admittedly look good on her, are incredibly similar to previous characters' features. Nifty tidbits are reinvented with more futuristic design, in some scenes the film almost channels Jurassic Park's spirit.Acting is pretty upfront for blockbuster movie. Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard deliver the leading roles as expected. They are capable and their chemistry is adequately presentable, thanks to a few timely humors. Supporting characters like Irrfan Khan's billionaire persona and the two new kids are decent as well. The kids in particular are not exact carbon copy of Hammond's grandkids, I admit I had assumed them as such, they perform enough with material at hand to differentiate themselves.Vincent D'Onofrio, on the other hand, is not really fully utilized. After his brilliant performance in Daredevil, or his entire career for that matter, it's a bit underwhelming to see him as typical corporate role. The movie also has several questionable parts, these feel a bit forced to move things along. They consist of on-screen poor decisions and anomalies, though they are not major enough to derail the movie.Second half presents everything audience would want from a film with Jurassic in its title. The scenes are incredible, full with continuous shots of the creatures in spectacular view. It capitalizes on the momentum towards the latter half with rapid crazy sequences. If you like something from previous titles, chances are you'll find it here.Jurassic World is not the next step of cinematic evolution, it is the epitome of spiritual successor. It inherits the good attributes and presents them in fresh dramatic exhibition, and it is more than enough to entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Story Great! Acting not so Great.,"Jurassic World is a pretty decent movie, the only bad part is the acting. First thing bad about it is that Chris Pratt has no emotions what so ever. After watching the movie you would think that Chris Pratt's character would be sad at least once. Second thing is that the rest of the cast are not good. You would think that with such a great cast that the acting would be good but its not. Third there is almost no character development at all, its like they don't even care that any of what happened.

At least, it did for me, and I was watching it on the small screen.But I guess I have nothing great to say about it either? Almost none of the characters are memorable (think ""The Lost World""), which allows Chris Pratt to easily steal the movie. So if he's your thing, then settle in.

A Spectacle of Dinosaurs: Jurassic World,"Jurassic World reintroduces audiences to the thrilling world of dinosaurs, set 22 years after the events of the original Jurassic Park. This time, the park has been fully operational, showcasing a breathtaking array of genetically engineered dinosaurs as attractions for visitors. The film centers on Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager, who is tasked with maintaining the park's success while also dealing with the complexities of its ambitious attractions.As the park prepares to unveil its newest creation, the Indominus rex-an unprecedented hybrid dinosaur-tensions rise when the creature escapes, leading to chaos and danger on the island. Claire teams up with a dinosaur trainer named Owen Grady, and together, they navigate the treacherous landscape in a race against time to save the park and its visitors.While Jurassic World offers stunning visual effects, thrilling action sequences, and plenty of nostalgic nods to the original film, it doesn't quite capture the same sense of wonder and suspense that made the first Jurassic Park iconic. The plot can feel somewhat formulaic, leaning heavily on familiar tropes and character archetypes.Despite these shortcomings, Jurassic World successfully delivers an entertaining spectacle filled with excitement and adventure. It reignites the franchise for a new generation while appealing to long-time fans. While it may not reach the heights of the original, it offers a fun ride that celebrates the awe of dinosaurs in a modern context.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best since the original with some great scenes.,"Granted, it isn't that hard to top the previous two installments in this franchise, but Jurassic World is the closest thing to experiencing the cinematic thrill of the original that we're most likely ever going to get. The formula is practically summer audience fool-proof: show us a fully-functioning dinosaur theme park John Hammond envisioned in the original film, throw in a dangerous new hybrid created to be the new star attraction, set star attraction loose on unsuspecting park, and let the fun begin. Simple setup, great execution.What made the original so great to me was the sense of awe we felt at seeing dinosaurs depicted so realistically on screen coupled with the film's fantastic action set pieces. This is 2015, so clearly the park's native attractions are CGI and seeing a photo-realistic dinosaur on screen lost its ""wow"" factor some time ago, but what this film does recreate well are the fantastic set pieces reminiscent of classic scenes from the original such as the Jeep attack. You'll be whooping with delight during a certain sequence involving a gyrosphere ride, and let's just say the park's other patrons will NOT be having a good day. It all sets the scene for massive panic on a grand scale, which is something the original could never accomplish with its characters fighting for survival in a non-functioning theme park. Yes, this time around, we see many a tourist in danger (a certain scene involving pterodactyls ranks as a highlight of the movie), and there is no shortage of action once things get rolling.Those worried they'll stepping into a Michael Bay-esque action-a-thon need not fret: there's plenty of establishment of the primary characters and a slow (for this day and age) buildup to the action which really kicks in once the new hybrid decides she wants to finally see what's outside of her paddock...The characters are all likable and we have the requisite human villains to even it out some (let's just say you'll be rooting for the dinosaurs in some scenes) and the new hybrid is an imposing and credible new dinosaur villain that is worthy of taking the reigns from the T-Rex and the Raptors from previous films.What's more, the final 15 minutes are the best of any film in the franchise thus far--I was thoroughly impressed with the scope and scale of the finale and easily consider it the highlight of the movie, by far. You will be in action/adventure heaven just witnessing it.Dinosaurs attacking tourists, great action set pieces like the original, humor, characters just likable enough to root for, and a terrific finale: what more could you want from a summer blockbuster? Go see Jurassic World and enjoy yourself. Yes, it's not the answer to life as we know it, and there might not be much beneath the surface, but the movie is pure spectacle and sometimes that's all we need.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

dinosaur with such intelligence??,"The ending is pretty hard to swallow . First part of the movie was good , but depiction of dinosaur with such intelligence.Even primates would not behave like that , such a shame .I loved the first movies because they were trying to be so accurate in terms of dinosaur behaviors they felt real and original .but this movie is poor in science but as an action movie people would love it. Don't be fooled by trailers or they hype created by the marketing.

"The Jurassic film franchise is back, 30 years on....","Over 30 years since the original Jurassic Park (1993) movie and long after parts 2 and 3 put the franchise in a coma The Jurassic Park franchise returns with Jurassic World. Still located on a Costa Rican island, Isla Nubla the original Jurassic Park is now a fully functioning theme park resort with 20000 customers being entertained by various dinosaur related attractions. Jurassic World however is losing its edge and in the corporate world that makes entrepreneurs pushy.Jurassic World is owned by an entrepreneur called Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and managed by a jobsworth Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Claire seems more preoccupied with running the theme park than giving her teenage nephews her full attention when they come to visit. Dark forces see the potential for the dinasours to have military uses. Generic engineering is at the fore to design ever more scary dinasours including the latest creation an Indominus Rex.Could chaos ensue? Could a Pratt come to the rescue? That would be telling. A thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster movie that doesn't rely on its cast (I've not heard of anyone except a certain Executive Producer called Steven Spielberg).

A worthy sequel installment,"Since the last Jurassic Park sequel, there has been lots of speculation as to whether a fourth film would happen. Jurassic Park fans finally got their wish in a very big way. Yes, there's been some odd-bag remarks, but ultimately you have to decide whether it's a worthy sequel or not. Set 22 years since the incident in the original film, Jurassic World takes a slightly different turn from the other two sequels. There's enough grounded material to remind the viewer that this is a Jurassic Park film, yet takes a few new turns. Steven Spielberg may not be directing this one, but he's got his signature all over it, everything from the visual concepts to the tid-bits. Yes, it's not Jurassic Park, but it's what Jurassic Park should have been if the attraction ever got off the ground. It's a well packed action movie that hardly lets down once it starts. There are plenty of Easter Eggs to be found with references to the first three films, relying heavily on the original Jurassic Park. This is scarier and more up-front in your face, but if your kids can handle a movie like Jurassic Park to begin with, I wouldn't worry too much. (Watch for a cameo from SNLs Jimmy Fallon as the commentator in the bubble cages)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good Exciting Film,"Before watching this film's sequel I have decided to rewatch Jurassic World and here is my review for the film. The premise sees in 2015, Jurassic World has been opened on Isla Nubla, when a new genetically modified Dinoasur escapes it causes chaos.Main Character
Chris Pratt plays the lead in this film and he is good in the role. He is very charming and charismatic like you would expect from him but he actually has a pretty interesting character. You can see he feels about the dinosaurs in a different way to previous lead characters that he does care about them and doesn't just want to see them all destroyed.Supporting Characters
Bryce Dallas Howard plays a large role in the film and I thought she was fine. She has an arc here and does change throughout giving some decent emphasis here but it wasn't perfect by any means. Her chemistry with Pratt wasn't great and seeing her run through the park with high heels was laughable. Vincent D'onofrio plays a bad guy here and he is usually a great actor but I thought his character was silly here. He is very campy and over the top with an absolutley absolutley ridiculous plan that feels like a stupid part of the film. Like Jurassic Park there are two kids who need rescuing but it worked there and doesn't here, the two kids are annoying, the older one is a creep and the younger one spends most of the film crying and I didn't care about them at all during the film.Story
The best part of the story is easily seeing John Hammond's vision come to life by seeing a Jurassic theme park even though after the events of the other film it makes no sense for it to open but it is great to see. Seeing this new Dinosaur go through the park is fun to watch and enjoyable as it does feel like something new and fresh. But there are some absurd side plots mainly including D'onofrio's character's idea which is beyond believeable, plus this film does follow the trend of Jurassic Park 3 a bit with a very long chase scene taking up plenty of the plot but it doesn't go to those lengths.Script
The script has some decent dialogue, it actually has some cheesy moments that I think peppered in actually worked here. Some of the humour took away from the drama and I could have done with being a bit less, but it was nice to see a return to the nature vs nurture debate that was part of the original film.Style
The style for the film is great to be honest, yes the dinosaurs are all CGI here but they look great. In this modern era CGI is so good that it was the natural choice here and it makes the Dinosaurs feel larger and more scary then they have in previous films. As I said it is nice to see a Jurassic Park and I could have done with seeing even more of the park as it really is an interesting idea.Overall
Overall, this is a good film, it doesn't hit the iconic nature of the original film but it is a fun film that brings in a new audience and is a worthy addition to the Jurassic franchise.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Five-word Review: Wonderfully Nostalgic Fun, Entertaining Blockbuster","1993's ground-breaking Jurassic Park is a film of might and magnificence, and is one of my favourite films of all time. The two sequels were, in a word, disappointing. The Lost World had some good moments (the long grass) but was just so stupid at times (I've attempted to burn the memory of 13-year-old gymnastics vs. velociraptor out of my brain.) Jurassic Park III had fewer good moments. So, after all the rumours throughout the late-2000s of a Jurassic Park IV finally resulted in the announcement of Jurassic World in 2015, I was pretty excited if a little tentative. Then came casting announcements and trailers and I, like the rest of the contacted peoples of the world, like Chris Pratt after Parks and Recreation, The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. In addition, more great actors were cast like Bryce Dallas Howard of The Help, Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire) and Vincent d'Onofrio, so fantastic recently in Daredevil.But how was the actual film? The answer is: pretty damn great. Having grown up watching and loving Jurassic Park, I was ready to appreciate every moment of nostalgia and call-back to the original film (emphasis on the lack of plural on original film.) And there are plenty of such moments, such as the way John Williams' incredible, timeless score is heard in Michael Giacchino's well-adapted new score (the first time those first four eerie, haunting brass notes of the original theme play in this film made me grin in delight.) The triumphant theme is first heard when panning over the real Jurassic World, a decision which was met with negativity by some but for me was wholly appropriate and nostalgic enough to warrant shivers when seeing the park, now fully open and (initially) functional. The visual effects are top-notch, rendering a terrifying Indominus Rex as the monstrous hybrid antagonist, a jaw-dropping Mosasaurus devouring a whole shark like a fish finger and a pteranodon attack which is far superior to how they were utilised in Jurassic Park III.Bryce Dallas Howard is a good surprise in this film. Though the bankable, popular Pratt was at the forefront of the marketing campaign (and with good reason! http://tinyurl.com/q4e84hl) it is actually Dallas Howard who is the main character of Jurassic World, in my opinion. She holds up well, despite an insistence on wearing high heels for the film's duration. The only returning actor is BD Wong, reprising his role as Dr Henry Wu from Jurassic Park in a good role. The child actors are decent and luckily not irritating, rounding off a cast that is good, even if talented actors like Omar Sy and D'Onofrio don't have sufficient character development.The main problem with Jurassic World is probably the flat script, with dialogue lacking in any inspiration or quotability. Luckily the actors portraying the characters are likable enough and their characters generally sufficiently interesting to tie over scenes without prehistorically-induced destruction. Pratt doesn't appear until quite a while in, but it's a supremely cool introduction. The raptors are great in this film due to their relationship with Pratt's character Owen, who has developed their relationship to the point of mutual respect, but it does end up (without spoiling anything) that raptor attacks occur and the way they are done is fantastic - even better than the long grass sequence from the Lost World but not quite as spine-chilling as the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park. Overall Jurassic World is highly entertaining and will make for 2 hours of great fun which doubles as brilliant nostalgia for anyone who grew up watching Jurassic Park and its sequels. If you don't expect a cinematic masterpiece on the level of Jurassic Park and you can get over some poorly-written dialogue and character decisions, you'll have a great time. 8.1/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""That thing out there... That is no dinosaur""","22 years on and Jurassic Park is once again open for business and though it can't capture the magic and awe of the original it still makes for a solid film. On the island of Isla Nublar in Costa Rica, theme park goers enjoy their stay at the Hilton Isla Nublar hotel and enjoy all the educational activities, where we get to see Mr. DNA, dig up dinosaurs, and feed the Zuniceratops etc. Simon Masrani (Iffran Khan), the owner of JURASSIC WORLD, realises a vision of the park's success rests on inventing newer dinosaurs that are terrifying even in nightmares to parents let alone children. Scientists are working hard with the advent of genome splicing to deliver monsters that are bigger, scarier, and which reinvent the wheel in terms of gaining global admiration from theme park goers who now view dinosaurs like the T-Rex as mediocre according to data research. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) and his team of geneticists engineer a new breed of dinosaur that is more than what anyone has bargained for. Initially brought on-board to evaluate and critique the safety of this new 'Indominus Rex,' Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) reveals and informs that it is perhaps not a good idea to Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), operations manager of 'JURASSIC WORLD.' With her nephews being on the park, Claire cannot afford to have a dinosaur on the loose in terms of what even the company cannot comprehend. What ensues after the Indominus Rex escapes is a film that is filled with wonderful full on chaos, adventure, and a sense of purpose throughout the plot. But even though the plot line of 'JURASSIC WORLD' for the most part is entirely predictable, it is still a jolly good rollercoaster romp. Despite this, Jurassic World does keep a charm about it purely with its visual splendour and deep rooted concept to the original films.While 'JURASSIC WORLD' is entertaining largely due to the fantastic brilliant visual splendour on screen. The main story revolves around the separation of the two boys, an aunt that does not have a close relationship with her nephews due to her busy work schedule, a military man seeking to use dinosaurs as a weapon, a love interest between Owen and Claire that is entirely void of any detail, a teenager that cannot control his glares at other girls despite already having a devoted girlfriend in his life back home, and the bond between man and Raptors that leaves more questions than it resolves by the end of the film due to its erratic nature. At the end of it all, you get the sense that you have been through an adventure with a group of very shallow characters that did manage to reap some entertainment value in their sequences with attacking dinosaurs and chases, but despite this aspect of the film, I still found it very entertaining.'JURASSIC WORLD' ends up delivering a lot of brilliant action sequences that encompasses fights between many different dinosaurs on a large backdrop, most notably the classic T-Rex and the Indominus Rex in an effort to pay homage to the contrasted nature of the classic films vs the newer one. You get a sense that you are actually at a theme park, but a bulk of the movie feels rather underwhelming for many portions and all the characters feel hollow and underdeveloped. Chris Pratt acts totally excellent throughout the course of the movie with some light comedic moments which are more than appreciated, but it does not do the film enough justice. Colin Trevorrow, the film's debut director, takes the helm from Steven Spielberg in this latest adaptation to the dinosaur thriller and it is clear that he definitely had somewhat of a hard time trying to recreate a classic and enhancing on it further in a more meaningful way other than to really up his game in producing some awesome totally stunning CGI effects and providing a straightforward plot as a bonus.'JURASSIC WORLD' is a really memorable film in its own right, and is easily the best of the series since the original. It retains that same magic, that sense of scope and awe, that feeling of novelty and adventure, even as it's little more than that first film repurposed, jazzed up with better visual effects and a mild reworking of the core story. It also has larger-than-life spectacle and CGI razzle-dazzle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Indeed, 22 years ago, we had enough of a sense of delight and awe before the wonders of modern technologies capable of showing real dinosaurs. Alas, but it's 2015, and highly detailed CGI models of ancient lizards can no longer surprise anyone, so you'll have to surprise others.It quickly turns out that ""Jurassic World"" is just a new name for a rebuilt park, and the fourth film, in fact, is something like a free remake of the very first part, ignoring the existence of sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Lighten Up and Enjoy the Return of Cool Dinosaurs,"One of the most fascinating thematic aspects of the Jurassic Park franchise has always been its exploration of man vs. nature–about man's delusions in actually believing they can control nature for the sake of (artificial) progress. How can we turn any natural facet to our own advantage–for war, for food, for simple amusement? The latest entry in the series, Jurassic World, has finally arrived after fourteen years of dinosaur-less cinema, and I'm proud to say that it's distinct enough from its predecessors. It chooses to go even deeper into the idea of not only genetically creating dinosaurs, but also genetically modifying them to the point where we begin to see hybrids of two different species.Following the severe mishap that was Jurassic Park because of–again– man's delusions (in that case, good-intentioned but seriously mistaken John Hammond), a new theme park has been built on the same island of Isla Nublar that seems to be working just fine and accepting thousands and thousands of visitors. It's Disney World except with dinosaurs–my god, how cool would that be? Aquariums, vast dinosaur-populated plains for touring, and other fun rides make up the majority of what this magical place has to offer. Of course, with such an ambitious idea, something terrible is always bound to transpire at one point or another. Suddenly, the boundaries we thought could easily keep humans safe from those spine-chilling carnivores are somehow demolished, and in comes chaos.This time around, instead of series favorites like Sam Neill as Dr. Grant or Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, we have 2014-born-movie-star Chris Pratt in the lead role as a muscular Velociraptor expert/trainer with the return of Bryce Dallas Howard as well (seriously, what happened to her? I thought The Help and Spider-Man 3 were financially successful). The two charismatic actors are surrounded by astounding production design and dazzling visual effects. You can whine about the pervasiveness of CGI all you want, but I've revisited the first film– Jurassic Park–a few days ago. Aside from the T-Rex, let's just say that those dinosaurs haven't been exactly aging well. In this film, I thought all of them looked completely believable and impressively- conceived; so I'm not complaining for the next few years (we'll see how it looks two decades down the road), especially when you get some amazing dino-versus-dino sequences. I won't spoil anything, but I'm sure you've always dreamed of seeing your favorite dinosaur species fiercely fighting it out and ripping each other to shreds with one's strength and the other's speed and calculation.Unlike The Lost World where the first half honestly bored me to a point where I was crazily yearning for some dinosaurs to finally pop up on- screen, Jurassic World presents you with such an immaculately-designed amusement park, using its two adolescent characters {13-year-old Gray (Ty Simpkins) and 20-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson)} to navigate through the various spellbinding museums and park tours while intercutting with the scientific/corporate storyline that shows us what's really going on behind all that awe and wonder. You're entertained from the get-go, and the long build-up to the appearance of the first killer dinosaur only excites you that much more.Now, the highest points of the series have always come in those times of real suspense and fright. That's precisely why I enjoyed Jurassic Park III a lot more than everyone else; almost everything in that forest was incredibly menacing and every step the characters took in whatever direction might've been their very last. I loved that dark, horror element. Unfortunately, save for one very particular end to a character, the deaths here are hardly creative and impactful. Very little blood and gore is shown in comparison to the last two movies (which were rated PG-13 too), and there's nothing that can show the sheer danger of an approaching carnivore more than the amount of damage it inflicts on human flesh. No, the villains are killed off rather quickly, and most of the major characters with a given name make it through alive. In sum, Jurassic World is definitely one of the lightest and most humorous entries in the franchise for better or worse. It's undoubtedly a lot of fun even when the situations turn to obvious implausibility.For future reference though, please, filmmakers–just please–stop this trend of self-awareness. Your movie isn't magically better and cooler just because you make some subtle remark about how you're a sequel/remake in today's heavily corporate Hollywood. ""Get it, guys? We're on the same page!"" No, just stop Jurassic World does as much as it can to get all of those original fans back with pleasure; every moment seems to be carefully guiding itself along without upsetting and offending the viewers with unexpected, outlandish dinosaur segments like the ""Alan!"" dream in Jurassic Park III or the T-Rex's King Kong-style rampage across San Diego in The Lost World. Of course, I just know that as I say this, some hardcore nitpickers, who have no sense of what lightening up and purely enjoying blockbuster entertainment means, will be ripping this film apart as well. I guess some people will have to get used to the fact that future sequels will never capture the magic in seeing dinosaurs on the big screen for the first time like the original did. That can only be accomplished once. Duh! Anyway, I fully commend the series for constantly reinventing and keeping each entry unique from the others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dinosaurs are real again.,"Jurassic WorldRating: Must see.Let me start off by giving some perspective, Jurassic Park was the film that made me go ""I want to make movies"" that film took me to a place I never thought could be witnessed by anyone. Dinosaurs were real, flesh and blood. Tooth and jaw. It was glorious and that film is the sole reason I want to be a film maker. Skip to Jurassic Park 3, I'm sitting in the cinema not expecting much but being hopeful nonetheless because this franchise is close to my heart. The opening of that film set the tone for the film and that tone was....Excrement.Anyways lets get to Jurassic World, this film I went in with even lower expectations in fact I was almost certain I was going to hate this film because each sequel after the first film never justified themselves for being a sequel. But my opinion slowly changed. For one the film was sold out. I have never been to a sold out film ever. Not only that but the line wrapped around the inside of the Cinema towards the ticket booth. I was flabbergasted. Once me and my friends got our seats we just were completely taken away with the whole situation. I couldn't believe this many people were here wanting to see this film. Once it began all my reservations were gone. I became 6 years old again and I lost my composure.This film is the first film I can say that is worthy of being called a sequel. It goes places that are familiar but new at the same time and it respects its heritage, whereas JP3 shat on the heritage completely. I don't want to give away anything at all but I will say this. If you loved the ending sequence of Jurassic Park you're gonna love this one even more. It blows that scene out of the water...literally. Anyways go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally a great Jurassic Park movie.,"My feeling for the new Jurassic Park trilogy is the same as the Star Wars series: The first trilogy is way worst than 2nd trilogy. It's boring and it's not actually about the main thing. At least it's not what I would want to watch. The relationship problems between people make me bored. Characters are too boring but movies focus too much on the personal life of others. Clearly they are story-wise amateurish and therefore they are not worthy to be watched. Each movie is pretty much about the same stuff.But in this movie we finally watch a real deal Jurassic Park and dinosaur stuff without boring people with idiocy, too much personal life and politics. It's not so good but at least it's not so amateurish. The movie satisfying enough.Sometimes the movie killed the mood when the main guy and the woman was literally having fight around the dinosaurs about their former love life while they try to escape from dinosaurs but at least they didn't focus too much about it.I got bored while watching old Jurassic Park movies when I was a kid and before I watched this movie I could barely endure watching the old movies and I can say it was waste of time. You can actually start from this without missing anything and like this series without hating the franchise, dinosaurs and Steven Spielberg.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best it could have been,Now to start off I'm a massive fan of the Jurassic park franchise and have enjoyed all three instalments in the franchise.So obviously I have been waiting for this movie for a long time and the question is did it disappoint. Well no this movie was absolutely brilliant for what is was a monster movie. Now this one has lots of nods to the original so if your a fan of the first your gonna love those.However is the movie perfect...no that's because there are characters that felt a little too cartoonish to be real and the movie does have a slow introduction to Chris Pratt's character but once he comes in the movie gets quite interesting.The movie also feels as though it is remaking the first two films with some scenes that were clearly put in the movie because it worked great in the first two.All in all you come to this movie expecting dinosaurs wreaking havoc amongst the island and that's exactly what you get and it pays off as a great entry into the franchise and leaves you wanting more (sequel maybe).,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jurassic World,Well choreographed action set-pieces. Good effects. Dinosaurs are magnificent.Annoyingly clichéd characters. Stupid story.

Not sure if they were trying to be funny or just self-referentially depressing.Chris Pratt was good. Everyone else was pointless.No where near the first. I would even prefer to watch Jurassic Park 3 than this.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The reason theaters were made.,"I don't go to many movies in theaters, mainly because there is not many movies out there that are interesting enough to watch. I usually tend to just wait for things to come out on disc if it appeals to me at all. However, with the recent come back of Godzilla in 2014, and now Jurassic World, I've had two reasons to come to the theaters two years in a row.These kind of movies are without a doubt, the reason you go see films in an actual theater. Big dinosaurs on a big screen, loud roars and thudding footsteps from a booming sound system, action packed, thrilling scenes along with something in it for the whole family to enjoy. You literally almost can't go wrong with a movie as long as you have some ferocious dinosaurs on the screen. Specifically Jurassic World itself, along with the rest of the older installments, have always made their dinos look amazing. Scientific evidence aside, these dinos look believable and very life like.The plot for this movie is solid, and goes back to Jurassic Parks original roots. A dinosaur theme park gone wrong. A dinosaur theme park, realistically, if it were to ever happen, would be INCREDIBLE. That in itself, is a reason why this is such a great movie to bring that to life. For this installment of the series though, the theme park looked phenomenal. It really makes you want to be right down there with everyone else inside of the park, exploring all the neat new things all about dinosaurs. Simply seeing the new park they have built for this movie in itself is ALSO another great reason to watch this. (and some cool throwbacks to the older JP as well)Jurassic World is a solid entry into the Jurassic Park collection, exceeding all of it's prequels and is on par, if not better than the original Jurassic Park. The movie is not perfect, however. It has some minor flaws and cheese moments with corny attempts at humor throughout. It's almost as if they were trying to ruin the intensity of the action/thriller scenes. I didn't want any of that thrill to be watered down or be broken up with humor attempts, I wanted to be at the edge of my seat the whole time. I know Jurassic Park movies have always thrown in a few jokes here and there before the action started to go down. However, I feel the original movies placed humor into the films a bit better without breaking the intensity. I literally almost cringed when Jimmy Fallon appeared in the movie, and as soon as he was on screen, everyone in the theater laughed. He didn't even do anything yet. He simply showed on screen, and everyone instantly laughed... why? But that was more of an audience of my own experience thing, and not the films fault. I couldn't laugh at the material anyway, because I was too focused on what was going to happen.Overall though, if you liked any of the Jurassic Park movies, go see it. If you want a good movie to go see with the family, go see it! If you just like movies with great action sequences and dinosaurs running rampant with some spectacular sequences and set pieces, I highly recommend this to go see in theaters. I know I personally will be anticipating the blu-ray release, as well as more Jurassic movies!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very well done,"It wasn't perfect, but it was worth the title Jurassic Park (World...whatever)It felt like Jurassic Park 1 in character, except expanded and much bigger.Only minor complaints:product placement, but at least they knew it and had fun with it.And not nearly enough original content.It was awesome! And totally paid homage to the original.I seriously don't know which I like better, JP or JW...PS: hope you like jump scares...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Enough Dinosaurs but Hey,"Jurassic World earns a grand total of 7 bags of popcorn. But take your time with that popcorn cause it's a long movie.Growing up in the 90s, I loved dinosaurs. I even stole a little toy dinosaur from the mall as a kid and then my mom brought me back to the store when she realized what I did and I had to apologize. And I'm not the only one, people love dinosaurs so I'm sure we were all excited to see another entry into this franchise that has only delivered 10/10 movies.Chris Patt steps out of his comfort zone and delivers an unforgettable performance as dinosaur trainor guy. I've never seen him work with dinosaurs before so it was nice to see. The other cast of characters also seemed familiar, like scientist guy played by the guy from law and order and then the important guy who ended up a bad guy who is also from law and order.What didn't have law and order was this dinosaur park. Just too many dinosaurs running around being a bunch of menaces. And speaking of dinosaurs, the film really focused in on the big one killing everybody. While that was interesting to watch, I do feel like we missed those peaceful moments just watching the dinosaurs be dinosaurs. I want to see them running in the fields, sipping water from a serene pond, and soaring proudly in the sky.This is of course another instant classic. Can't believe I waited to the second to last day of 2024 to finally watch it, but I'm glad I did. I'll see you later, space cowboy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It was a proper reboot,"I liked jurassic world a lot i've been really excited about it and jumped out of my seat when Steven Speilburg announced it in 2010. It had a lot of references to the first movie and that was really funny and it not only brought me joy but the whole audience liked the vibes it brought. Great reboot for the serious although I thought they could have used animatronics more and less cgi. Being a film maker the cgi really distracted me cause it wasen't selling it for me. Great ending, Chris Pratt was a great idea and I always knew that. If you go make sure you have a pumped up audience it makes it so much more fun! its one of those movies you can watch a lot and thats just fun. Its not a deep story like cast away just a lot of fun. Hope you like it",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Thrilling Ride Through a Prehistoric Wonderland,"""Jurassic World"" is a thrilling and action-packed adventure that takes audiences back to the world of the dinosaurs. The plot follows a group of scientists and researchers as they attempt to create a fully functioning dinosaur theme park on the island of Isla Nublar. However, their plans quickly go awry when the dinosaurs break loose and threaten the lives of everyone on the island.The special effects in this film are top-notch and the CGI dinosaurs are incredibly realistic and convincing. The action scenes are intense and exciting, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. The performances by the cast, including Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, are solid and add depth to the characters.Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is a worthy successor to the original ""Jurassic Park"" and is sure to delight fans of the franchise. It's a thrilling and exciting film that offers a great blend of nostalgia and fresh new elements, making it a great addition to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Disappointed,"This movie history was so bad i really hope for a dinossaur to jump off the screen and eat me so i didn't had to watch the rest of this crap. We don't want any fancy CGI or really boring standart heroes and villains and overused love story, we want something in line with the first 2 movies, something more real(assuming that we will eventually resurrect dinossaur and build a multimillion dollar park), we don't want ""more teeth, bigger and hungrier"", we want our T-Rex, Albertosaurus, Ultaraptors to be just what they are, wild animals.With all this negative i must give some points due to various easter eggs from the first movie, that was nice.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Film,This is a terrific film for all viewers to watch. The crew did a splendid job in creating this film. There are some parts throughout this film that could have been a lot better and stronger but it was still watchable. The storyline of this film might have been simple and straightforward but it strong enough and worked for this film. The cast selection was fabulous and strong. They really committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry that was displayed throughout this film between the cast members was really which worked nicely for this film. This is a spectacular film for everyone to watch.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not as good as JP1, but better than JP3","Of all the dinosaur movies I have watched, this is one of the better series. It's actually pretty good for a sequel/reboot. More dinosaurs, plus we get Chris Pratt. He's my new favorite actor. And he really works in this one. I didn't get to watch this one in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Much of the thrills from the original are still fresh, and it was better than Jurassic Park 3. Soon we will be getting Fallen Kingdom and I'm sure it'll be good. There were also good scenes and well-done sets for the amusement park. Even if you haven't seen the original, give this a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you like dinosaurs in a modern setting, this is where to look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This ""Jurassic World"" Has More Bite Then Expected, Despite Flaws","3 out of 5 stars (average)I will never understand Hollywood's seemingly immortal fascination with unnecessary reboots and sequels. Since 2010, reboots of popular franchises have been spewing out the back end during the summer months hoping to rekindle the spark gained from the originals. 80's classics Robocop and A Nightmare on Elm Street were given this treatment to mediocre results, both critically and financially. However, some reboots (like Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are successful because they take the franchise into the 21st century, exploring themes and ideas that the original could not.And sometimes, reboots are just fun pieces of escapism that are not meant to be analyzed, just enjoyed.Jurassic World falls into that category. While it isn't as good as the original (come on, who was really expecting that?), this film stands on its own two feet as a fun summer popcorn flick that doesn't require you to think very hard. This seems to be what makes money nowadays, and this film is set to break box office records. Despite some questionable script decisions, Jurassic World is an enjoyable popcorn movie with a great lead performance and intense action.The film follows Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of 50/50) the owner of ""Jurassic World"", a park where dinosaurs are on display for the general public. The park is a hugely popular tourist attraction made possible by Dr. Wu (BD Wong returning from the first film), a scientist who has been with the park since the beginning all those years ago.To increase tourism (because apparently LIVE DINOSAURS ALONE can't do that), the scientists have genetically engineered a dinosaur. This does not please park trainer and exhibit inspector Owen (Chris Pratt outshining everyone), who treats the dinos with the respect they deserve. It doesn't help that he has Hoskins (Vincent D'onofrio of Netflix's Daredevil) breathing down his neck about using the raptors as weapons of war, something that Owen would not allow. Unfortunately, the genetically-made dino escapes from its enclosure, sending Owen and Claire to find it. To make matters worse, Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) have come to the park to see their aunt and thus get involved on the action.This film is a lot better than I thought it would be. The action is very intense and most of the dinosaur effects are solid (most of them). Colin Trevorrow (the director of 2012's hit Safety Not Guaranteed) knows how to build tension surprisingly well given that this is his second theatrical release. I'm sad he will not be returning to direct a sequel to this film (and let's just face it, there will be one).Performance-wise, Chris Pratt proves once again why we love him: he has charm, likeability, and charisma unlike many new actors today. He uses his leading-man abilities very well here, outshining Bryce Dallas Howard and even the great D'onofrio (who was absolutely amazing on Daredevil). Howard is giving her second-best performance here, her first being 50/50. For whatever reason, Howard has yet to give a great leading performance in her career. She's not bad by any means, but I wish she would improve a bit. The child actors are surprisingly good (and not annoying), giving performances that seem realistic for the situation they are in (one is a teenager, the other a middle school aged kid). Finally, Irrfan Khan (seen briefly in the first Amazing Spider-Man) delivers a decent performance.The only problems I have with the film are minor ones. First, Claire is wearing heels throughout, running in them with unbelievable ease. I don't wear heels myself, but my sister said that it would be IMPOSSIBLE to run in them. I bring this up because there are several shots of the heels, almost as if the director wanted us to know that she was wearing them. They don't have a payoff, seeming a bit useless in the grand scheme. Also, it is briefly mentioned that the two kids' parents might get a divorce, but we don't see anything to support that. We see the mother (Judy Greer, who really needs to get larger parts) saying good bye in the first scene, and then again when she calls Claire asking about the boys. We never see her and the husband arguing, so it just seemed rushed in. Finally, I felt the opening act was a little slow, but it picks up after about 15 minutes. It's not boring, just character introductions and such.Jurassic World isn't as good as the original, but it does its job well, and that is entertaining the viewer. John Williams' great score is included here, and it's as hard to get out of your head now as it was back in 1993. There were some kids in my theater who weren't too scared by anything, but it depends on the kid. I actually jumped a couple times, but that's just me. Overall, Jurassic World is a fun action flick for the summer crowd.Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Violence and Peril",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent,"Jurassic World is a sequel to the beloved Jurassic Park"" ranchise that attempts to recapture the magic of the original films. The movie features impressive visuals and thrilling action sequences, but unfortunately struggles with a weak plot and extremely forgettable characters. To be honest, without the previous movies' legacy, this film wouldn't be as notable as it is today. Without it, it's just an okay blockbuster with good visuals but very mediocre script.Overall, Jurassic World is a fun one-time watch for fans of the series, but it falls short of truly recapturing the magic of the first Jurassic Park.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's nowhere near the original and best movie..........,while this was a good effort with great cgi and had references to the original film it had a lot of flaws.1) The explanation given that the fake dino was so smart that he tricked the whole company and escaped from the traps of the modern technology and freed itself was at lest laughable.2) the main attraction of the series should be T-REX not a fake dino .t-rex was shown only 10 minutes at the end while most of the movie was about the raptors and that fake dino.all other dinos had little screening time in the movie.3) the sub plot to explain the reasons of the creation of the fake dino were at least ridiculous.since when the kids are bored of dinos and they had to see a new dino hybrid to grow up the interest ?Apart from that u will have a good time watching this movie but if u expect to see the greatness of the first film u will be disappointed.that's the reason i give only 8 out of 10 and not 10 out of 10 which only the first movie fully deserves.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Classic Hollywood blockbuster! brings me back to the 80s,"didn't expect too much as i really found the earlier jurassic movies kinda boring.Jurassic World gave a lot of thrills and it was overall at a good pace and entertaining. some parts , i could feel my heart beating .the movie started off quite ""cheesey"" i felt, the lead actress didn't impress. but when the action started,the show turned around positively.i liked it also it somehow reminds me of the experience i had watching movies like Indiana Jones - Temple of Doom as a kid in the 80s. it was fun.i like how , modern technology is involved making the dinosaurs quite scary, yet it has the 2 kids, and love hate adult couple (like a family) in the adventure,,,,its not Oscar winning script or acting but still, this is the Hollywood 80s movie magic most of us enjoyed and grew up with. its also easy to related cause the movie is set in a theme park, and most of us have been to one. i would say i don't mind watching it again...cant wait for it to be a ride at Universal Studios too !",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It can only be said that the rules are moderate,"It can only be said that the rules are moderate. The special effects were basically in line with expectations, and the last two Tyrannosaurus Rex had a much worse battle. The plot, as always, is a collection of no Zuo no die. Of course, there will be a lot of loopholes. The space reserved for the sequel looks small.

No authenticity,"As a pure dino's fan I was upset by many aspect of the film. First of all, the main attraction is based on a dinosaure that has never existed. This kind of movie should bring to the audiance some knowledge in science and not creating hybrid monster to make the movie scarier.Secondly I can't support when they try to put some emotions in the eyes of a T- Rex or a velociraptor. Those are lizards...they remain reptils, not mammals. The emotion should be brought by the actors which didn't make a good job. A super hero navy seal and a bimbo are not appropriate to be the main character of this movie. Laura Dern and Sam Neil were more authentic and didn't try to be funny when it wasn't necessary.Finally slow motion in a dinosaur fight is completely useless and make the scene less intense.In conclusion apart from all these criticisms, that's a quite good action film (with some excinting moment I must admit) which will delight those who are not dino connoisseurs",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than the previous sequel but still not as good as 'Park',"I think it was a brave decision for studios to give Colin Trevorrow the helm for the final Jurassic film. I really like his Safety Not Guaranteed but to then give him a project of this size and history was quite surprising. I'm not going to bang on about the previous sequels that were nothing near the original Jurassic Park. I remember watching JP at the cinema, 22 years ago, and hearing those quaking footsteps and seeing the shaking glass of water was intense, as are the Velociraptors in the kitchen. Spielberg even let himself down with Lost World so to follow up with another film was rather brash.I wouldn't be surprised if the makers and studios watched the previous film listing all the elements that worked and stood out as there seems to be a lot of the same ingredients. Kids isolated, Velociraptors and of course a tyrannosaurs rex, but bigger and stronger. The same tension is there with looming dinosaurs and I think the only original cast member is BD Wong, playing the naughty scientist. It almost feels like a reboot as oppose to a continuation.Fans of Chris Pratt should like his character but non-fans will probably hate this, playing the sarcastic, over confident dino-trainer. Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning in this, and both play their characters very well adding the awkward romance. Vincent D'Onofrio and Jake Johnson join the cast, Vinny being the nasty guy with an angle and JJ providing some comedy relief as the tech guy. But it's Irrfan Khan that steals the show for me, being acclaimed as one of the greatest actors of our time, he hails from Bollywood and does a tremendous job playing billionaire dare-devil Masrani.Disney regular composer, Michael Giacchino takes on the Jurassic theme following John William's note steps. Not quite the same, but still very good and follows suite. The CGI is on point as expected but again mimics a lot of scene from the original, though the close ups are superb.There's some clever ideas and twists to the story that make it more silly than good cinema, especially the climatic end. But certain scenes are good and have captured the essence of its '93 father. The children in the snow globe mobile in particular was classic Park stuff. That same tension is there and the ghastly dino is ferociously scary. The aerial shots were a nice touch.Jurassic World is better than the sequels but still not the T-Rex of dinosaur movies, that crown still remains with Jurassic Park. Trevorrow did a great job, so faith restored, but I think it's time to close the park for good.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 7 Story: 7 Script: 6 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points:69% 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As well as I like all the actors too,probably my favourite was Chris Pratt He did a really good job as his character. The dinosaurs all look like actual real Dino's and they were super cool my favourite was probably the raptors out of all the Raptors, it was probably blue.although i liked watching this movie over and over It's honestly one of my favourites.

"With spectacular visuals and cast, Jurassic World is not as great as it's creator, but it stands out in it's own way as a visual thriller treat.","JURASSIC WORLD-REVIEW 6/17/15Cast:Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty Simpkins, and Vincent D'OnforioRelease Date:6/12/15(2015)Director:Colin TrevorrowProducer:Universal StudiosGenre:Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated:PG-13The fourth installment in the famous franchise is big and large with more teeth. Jurassic World boasts a great cast with visuals and is directed by Colin Trevorrow, the director of the critically acclaimed movie, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". This movie acts out the extremely predictable creation of magnum opus Jurassic World envisioned by John Hammond and the genetic splice of two dinosaurs named ""Indominous Rex"". The lack of emotion, drama, and care for characters are made up with spectacular visuals. This movie may not have the best plot or characterization, but it surely has enough teeth and fun to satisfy moviegoers. The outcome? The outcome is a perfect summer blockbuster movie that is ready to tear up the box office.Twenty-two years later, after the severe events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar is finally a fully functional theme park that attracts tons of visitors each day. But since the revival of T-Rex's and Pterenadon's are very old, the Director,(Bryce Dallas Howard) and the park's engineers decide to spice things up by making a genetically modified hybrid dino.Not having learnt anything at all from the last three Jurassic movies, the main characters still end up being part of the poorly written and pictured cat and mouse chase which is basically showcased in every Jurassic movie except the first one. As Bryce Dallas Howard struggles to get control of her truant nephews, Velociraptor trainer Chris Pratt, prevents his notorious security chief,(Vincent D' Onforio), from using the trained dinosaurs as weapons in case of emergency.Exiting the pre-development hell after 10 years, this beast of a film knits together the various pieces cooked up by Steven Spielberg himself, and many others. This disaster of a plot has a big enough hole for all the Avengers to jump right into another universe. This much troubled plot is also written by Colin Trevorrow's long lasting partners Derek Conelly and Rick Jaffa the writer of the amazing ""Planet Of the Apes"". One of the biggest holes is the concept itself. After the severe aftermath of Jurassic Park, how can Jurassic World even be made?Adding up to the weak plot, the TWO lost children, giant killing dinosaur, and the zero parent material concept has been repeated multitudinous times right from the Michael Crichton time. Even though Chris Pratt keeps the movie light at some points with his uneven comedy, the plot still struggles. Unlike every Steven Spielberg movie, this movie is just unable to make you care for the characters. Even though there is a some drama and emotion during the two hour run-time, there isn't enough chemistry between the characters. By the climax of the movie, you still wouldn't care about the welfare of any of the other characters. This movie wants to do a lot, but ends up doing very well in only a few things. The characterization part of the story is actually the weakest point of the film.Even though Jurassic World comes short in it's storytelling and characterization, watching it in theaters on an IMAX screen with a bag of popcorn isn't such a bad idea. The dinosaur menagerie definitely gives you enough popcorn thrills for you to be seated on the edge. But this movie lacks to some extent the nail-biting experience you probably had when you watched the original Jurassic Park. Colin is able to bring his whole dinosaur crew into action, despite it attempt for love is soulless. It's ambitious but ultimately lacks soul. Is it any good? Yes, it can be watched as extremely fun roller-coaster dinosaur ride. The Visuals, the IMAX, and the popcorn should be enough to sell yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I miss Spielberg......,"Jurassic World. The culmination of a dream that began with the ill fated Jurassic Park. Technology has allowed scientists to extract DNA and clone the once extinct thunder lizards. Where Jurassic Park was an old school safari, Jurassic world is the highly commercialised Disneyland with Dinosaurs, where paying customers could kayak down a river of feeding Brontosaurs, ride a gyro-sphere among the Triceratops, pay a fortune for a cola, and just bask in the awe of these great creatures. But test audience did not want raptors the size of a turkey or T-rex with feathers so in cam frog DNA to make them look like how they do in the books and minds of people. People did not just want to ""bask in awe"" so the dinosaurs were turned into sideshow freaks and made to entertain with their babies being molested in petting zoos, their basic mealtimes making the Facebook page of a hundred gawking audience members. Heck, some even tried training them to do tricks but even that is not enough. Enter the Indominus Rex, a genetically spliced mutant dinosaur.What we have here is something that would split the audience. Some would call it an abomination, others would call it awesome. It is bigger, louder, fiercer, faster, yet it feels hollow and incomplete; all style and less substance. It's got teeth, its got a ferocious roar, but it lacks bite. A creature whose traits were dictated by focus groups and market research instead of a respect for the originals. A creature made of borrowed elements from the originals yet the guys who made it forgot what it was that made the originals so great and memorable.I am talking about the movie here. The very movie which the Indominus Rex acts like a parody of. No one are impressed with old school animatronic effects the same way people in the movie are not too impressed with the old school Tyrannosaurus Rex. So in came modern technology, in the movie's case in came 3D CGI, and the creators went wild with it. Some say they went overboard with it the same way scientists went overboard with the predatory trails of the Indominus Rex.Someone is making a point here it seems. Very clever. Whether it was intended or not, Jurassic World is exactly the kind of blockbuster movie that the indominus Rex was meant to parody. It is bigger in scale, with CGI special effects used to portray the fully functioning theme park and creatures within. It is fiercer, with more on screen deaths, there is more gore to push the PG13 rating and we finally get to see what would happen when soldiers fight dinosaurs. It is definitely faster; though clocking in at 124 minutes, I felt that the movie just flew by like Pterodactyl.Somewhere in there there is this kid and his teenage brother. Their aunt runs Jurassic World and starts off as an obnoxious ""corporate adult too busy for the kids"" type. There's is this funny Indian billionaire who loves flying helicopters, and then there is Star-Lord! Look it's Peter ""StarLord"" Quill and he's training Velociraptors instead of hanging out with a talking racoon and his alien tree. Wait.......he's not Star Lord? Owen Grady, you say? But he is the exact same Star Lord character, right down to the mannerisms, the body language, except that instead of a laser gun, ""Owen"" here has a hunting rifle. You're not fooling anyone Star- Lord.Simple statement: If I can't even remember your characters names, then those characters are not at all interesting.Sadly the rest of what made Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park great gets lost in messy frantic CGI action. Spielberg allowed the camera to linger on the dinosaurs, keeping things out of frame to ramp up the tension then delivering full on, clear and steady dino fighting action. Colin Trevorrow, on the other hand, seems to have taken reference from Michael Bay and JJ Abrams. Frantic camera shots neuter the dinosaur action, wide shots are so wide that you can't make out much detail, and keeping the dinos out of frame just feel like those old low budget cheats to save on the special effects budget. You even have wholly unnecessary lens flare on jeep headlights.Not that the CGI was perfect, it is not. Industral Lights and Magic (ILM) does great effects for technology (see Star Wars, Transformers, Iron Man etc) but when it comes to creatures, they fall short from the standards set by studios like WETA or MPC. It shows in the overly saturated shots of dinosaurs in the daytime. For example, the initial appearance of the velociraptors seemed a tad unfinished with the raptors looking a little out of focus from the rest of the scene.I give this thumbs up for the music, the acting and jab at the state of modern blockbusters. The family theme was good though underdeveloped and that CGI could use some work. Re-watching Jurassic Park immediately after this only brought a sense of disappointment to my heart. Even judged by modern standards, Jurassic Park stands the test of time. While Jurassic World may never achieve that timeless classic standard, it entertains it jolts, and it gives the modern blockbuster audience exactly what they want. Sadly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
