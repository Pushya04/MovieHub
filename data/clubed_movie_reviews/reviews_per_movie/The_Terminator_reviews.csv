"Amazing, even for a non-fan of the genre","I don't like action movies generally, and had to be coaxed into seeing this one by a friend.  It was a major and pleasant surprise to me, and I left it with questions beyond the scope of the film, which always happens with the ones I really like (ie, Did John know who Reese was/would be when he sent him?).  Most of all, I left it a Michael Biehn fan; he is great in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.","Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Nice night for a walk.,"Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. ""  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Arnie is cool as the bad guy, in this classic 80's action film!","It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease.The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film.There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it, I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent, but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come, a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of 'I'll be back'!Rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time,"The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! ""This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay 
 and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough.Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being.Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun.This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah.The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"The Terminator, created after another one of James Cameron's reaccuring dreams (Abyss was another one.)  A true beginning in sci-fi movies.  As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, ""they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie."" His friend said, ""take it."" Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions.  None could have pulled it off as well as he did.  Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite.  A man sent from the future to stop this machine.  He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his.  A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance.  Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.  Only drawback is it's a little dragged out at parts and gets slightly boring from time to time but it's so minor that one would have to think about it to care. A truly awesome movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi classic - if a little dated,"The Terminator is a science fiction classic, creating the iconic villain and starting what has become a quintessential sci-fi franchise.

However the concept and ideas have certainly endured and continue to inform science fiction to this day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Does the Future Hold Up?,"Candid admission time: despite selling myself as a fan of action cinema there are two classic genre films I've neglected my whole life. Predator is one, and The Terminator is another. Recently because of this blog I decided to watch both in the hopes of giving a fresh review from a new perspective. Alas, I couldn't finish Predator. I didn't think it was particularly entertaining in the action department, I cared little for the characters, the Predator itself was threatening but not enough for me to be glued. I considered it more a slasher film with buff men in lieu of stupid teens.The Terminator falls into the same boat in a way. It's a horror film more so than action, a kind of slasher/chase movie where we follow our heroes in their escape from the monster. Unlike Predator which hides the creature from us, The Terminator focuses on the cyborg hit-man and makes sure we know what he looks like and how daunting he can be.Sarah Connor is a waitress in Los Angeles when her life is shattered by the appearance of two men from the future, one a resistance fighter, another a Terminator, a cybernetic organism. The future is bleak with nuclear holocaust caused by the rise of the machines sending humans underground. With the machines ruling, a resistance fighter named John Connor has become a hero, throwing a monkey wrench into the inorganic creatures plans. Facing defeat thanks to this man, the machines send a Terminator into the past to eliminate Connor's mother and reset the timeline. Somehow one of the resistance managed to go through as well to protect Sarah Connor.Despite the futuristic ideas and plot the movie itself is very light science fiction and operates more in the horror genre. Sarah Connor is completely unprepared for what she is about to face and Arnie's Terminator is like Friday the 13ths Jason, an unstoppable brute who is seemingly unkillable. It makes for some compelling sequences of destructive action, the Terminator shooting up a police station being a particular highlight.As this is a site dedicated to action critique, I'd be remiss not to mention the editing making many action sequences quite awkward. The very first series of murders has the Terminator kill a trio of punks. What could have been a quick and effective assault is a jankily edited nightmare that hardly makes sense. As the movie progresses, I found the editing got increasingly better but overall it's another case of overediting ruining the effectiveness of action.Another reason I wasn't as enthralled by the action as others is my disdain for what I call ""Industrial Action"". These movies are typically dark, ugly affairs that focus on abandoned places and industrial areas for settings. Cannon Films was a constant perpetrator of making films that felt inorganic purely because of the settings. Cobra is a prime example and even a film like Robocop, which I do quite enjoy, comes across as bland and uninteresting because of the setting. All of these films take place in metropolitan areas but nothing feels lived in or real. Even in Terminator, the chase sequences aren't as compelling as they could be purely because of how staged it all seems. I don't care how late at night it is, there would be a lot more cars on the streets than the movie portrays. It pulls me out of the action.The other facets of The Terminator are just as artificial in my eyes. The plot is interesting as a concept but goes nowhere interesting. I'm sure T2 will expand upon the mythology built up in this first outing, but as a stand alone product The Terminator doesn't invest me in the film's world. The stakes feel nonexistent because Sarah Connor is so removed from the future war against the machines and there isn't enough of a connection thematically. We see the war and its effects, but they aren't tied into the events of 1984 enough.What ties the past and future together is Kyle, the resistance fighter protecting Sarah. The problem here is that Kyle is a weak character and the romance that buds between himself and Sarah is poorly executed and extremely two-dimensional. Sarah, for her part, has some character development but she doesn't exactly feel well-rounded and isn't interesting either. When the artificial killing machine antagonist is the most compelling character in your film, you're missing the point.I don't have a lot to say about The Terminator because I didn't feel it provided me with anything to really talk about. And that's the sign, to me, of an average film. I don't think The Terminator is bad but I do think it's two-dimensional and lacking in a lot of departments. I mentioned with Speed that you can turn your brain off and enjoy it. That was a fast paced, dumb action movie though. This is trying to have a little more gravitas and meat on the bones and I really do not think it works.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga,"The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.Now to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic.The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement.The last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) ""I'll be back."" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.In the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan, then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Intense powerful iconic,"In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer AI that achieves sentient and launches a global nuclear holocaust, in a bid to wipe out humanity. One man John Conner leads the human resistance. They are on the verge of destroying SkyNet when it sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill John Conner's mother. Connor sends soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the killer machine.This is director James Cameron's first at bat, and he hits it out of the park. It is near perfection that started a franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting during his deliveries really helped. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He is the perfect terminator. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It is a sci-fi horror that doesn't let go. It has the production of a much bigger action movie. It is a signpost for a genre, for a cultural touchstone, and for an era. It transcends being simply a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's about transformation,"I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator.  Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.  That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier.""  She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous.  And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me.  It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart.  It's quickly developing love story touches me.  Its humor makes the dark places in me smile.  But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?9.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"An excellent film, highly original","Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).The Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line ""I'll be back"" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).This is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, it is very well paced and never gets boring, and if you have the time, watch T2 right after this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Compelling science fiction,"For the gift of `Aliens' and `The Terminator' I am willing to forgive Cameron's `Titanic'. The key plot concept is beautifully simple - machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother, thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat.  One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.`The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle, with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer, and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines, including the infamous `I'll be back' are all well judged and timed, and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features, he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's `Aliens' - the human tough guy: he's got the fight, but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional - they tend to come out in the same tone of voice - he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the woman-thrown-into-chaos, somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in `Alien', although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are, for an action science fiction, above average and so never distract.It's the script, with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes, there's a certain amount of corniness - the `we loved a life time' element for example - but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and, through its passion, will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie - rarely do we see daylight, and, when we do, it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes, helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score (including a fantastic brooding credit sequence). Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of `Attack of the Clones' and `The Fellowship of the Ring', but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability, intertwined with hope, permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.`The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts, and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise, a script that mostly delivers, characters you can enjoy, and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 8/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I can see why it's a classic,I can definitely understand why this is such a popular movie and it was AMAZING for its time. I do think it's a little basic and predictable HOWEVER that's not entirely the movies own fault because this movie is what made the basics. It is what inspired great things in the future. And I definitely appreciate it for what it did but stand alone I can't give it all that much credit it's a great movie yeah but there's nothing that really stood out to me.

Entertaining sci-fi action-drama,"Entertaining sci-fi action-drama.Revolutionary special effects are what makes this movie special. The effects, from 1984, are still good even by today's standards.The plot is not bad either. Unlike most of James Cameron's movies, which are purely style over substance (yes, I'm thinking of Titanic and Avatar in particular), this movie has a decent plot. Not entirely watertight, but it exists and is reasonably coherent and plausible and not merely a medium for linking action scenes.Though he had done the two Conan movies before this, it is this movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. Not there for his acting abilities, or linguistic skill, he was every bit the action figure (not quite action hero...).Linda Hamilton was solid in her role (though her hair style shows this movie was made in the 80s...). Michael Biehn was OK, though sometimes came off as too over-the-top in his performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A great movie that quickly became very dated,"Note: My first time watching this film was in 2019.Taking off the rose colored glasses, this would be a B-list action flick that would be quickly forgotten if it were released today. It brought a new level of thought into blockbuster action flicks, but there have been successors that use time travel in an action movie much more effectively. Also, the premise was well thought out with few plot holes, but it was always explained in a way that seemed to highlight a lull in the action rather than build tension for the next scene. The acting was very minimal and forgettable, reminiscent of acting in B-list action films today.Saving the most obvious for last, the effects were very dated. The computer generated effects have aged the worst. The clothes and hairstyles are a close second, but they can be forgiven as accurate for the 80s. However, the future costumes can't be forgiven. Everyone literally wearing burlap sacks with faces covered in dirt is both cliched and unrealistic.Finally, the music screamed 80s, not only in style, but also with the disconnect between the score and what's happening on the screen. Movie scores have been one of the slowest film aspects to consistently make progress, and this film is a good example of the inconsistency that remained in the 80s. It's just becoming common to see scores written to evoke emotion for the film's specific scenes, but movies like The Terminator still miss the mark by under- or overplaying the emotion in the scene.All-in-all, it seems like it has all the makings to be an 80s classic, and I can see why it became as popular as it is today. Although I can also see that if it were released today, it would not be nearly as innovative or memorable, and I can certainly see why young Arnold thought this movie wouldn't amount to anything. Perhaps that is why the Terminator reboot series has been performing poorly in the box office.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Review of the Special Edition DVD,"I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Where the legend began...,"Who would have thought a low budget science fiction movie aptly named The Terminator would become a successful movie as well as start the meteoric rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a legend in cinema, introduce director James Cameron to Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with, give a new meaning to audiences with the immortal line ""I'll be back"", spawn a large fan base, and then witness the birth of a big-budget saga with an even bigger sequel in 1991 that outdoes the first movie with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and then continue on with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003, Terminator Salvation in 2009, and Terminator Genisys in 2015 as well as a short lived TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.Arnold Schwarzenegger introduces us to his now iconic role as The Terminator, a cyborg disguised as a human being. The Terminator has been sent back in time from 2029 to Los Angeles in 1984 to terminate Sarah Connor in order to prevent the birth of her unborn child, John Connor, who would go on to lead the human resistance to victory against Skynet and the machines in the future following a nuclear war which almost wiped out most of the human race. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a rare role as a villain, is perfect as the Terminator, a killing machine who is programmed to kill without any pity, remorse or fear in his single minded quest to terminate Sarah Connor.Linda Hamilton in an early role introduces us to Sarah Connor, a timid and mousy waitress who's life will be changed forever upon the discovery her unborn son, John Connor, will become the future leader of the human resistance. She still does not believe that such an event will happen with the nuclear war and the rise of the machines, until her encounter with the Terminator and thus begins her quest to stay alive for the sake of her unborn son and to survive this real life nightmare.Michael Biehn in one of his early roles plays Kyle Reese, a young, battle-hardened, and world-weary soldier who volunteered to be sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor to protect his mother at all costs from the Terminator. Once Reese rescues Sarah, he warns her about the impending doom of the human race from the nuclear war and her future significance carried by her and her unborn son.Keep an eye out for Bill Paxton in an early role as a street punk.Though The Terminator is now 30 years old, it still stands the test of time as a positive influence on all science fiction and action movies since. Exciting, high energy action sequences which turns downtown Los Angeles into an urban battleground and leads to an even bigger chase to a climatic showdown keeps the dynamic tension in The Terminator very tight and does not let the audience go for one moment.Taut and kinetic direction with a sharp eye for attention to detail from James Cameron keeps The Terminator as a gritty, clever, breathtaking, exciting and thrilling movie from beginning to end.Definitely one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

6.2/10 - Not Bad ; Not That Good Either,"The Terminator, directed by James Cameron, is unarguably one of the most well-known sci-fi films of all time. It follows Sarah Connor, your average young woman, that just so happens to be the one who's going to give birth to humanity's leader in the war against the machines. Both sides of the war sent their agents from the future to the present - the Terminator, a deadly cyborg assassin, sent by the machines to kill Sarah. Kyle Reese, a human soldier, sent by humanity to save her. Will they be able to stop the ruthless Terminator and save humanity?I think this review will be quite short this time, since this is pretty much a nothing movie. By that I mean, I'm pretty close to being indifferent towards it. That being the case, I don't think I have much to say here, but I'll try my best.Most of this film feels pretty flat, in my opinion. Take the main human characters - they don't have to be deep for me to enjoy them, but I also don't feel like it's a ""simple but effective"" kinda thing. They just are, you know? They don't feel real, just walking clichés with some dialogue. Their relationship and chemistry feels forced to me.On the other hand, The Terminator itself works pretty well as a character, since he has an iconic concept. Beyond showing just how merciless he is throughout the movie in a decently effective way, this guy is pretty much like a sitcom character - whatever situation you will think about, something will come up when you write the script for this character.But yeah, when I look at the film as a whole I just don't feel it goes as hard as some might think. It has some cool action scenes, some memorable moments, a solid concept. The problem is that nothing immerses me, even the best moments got relatively minor reactions out of me. It's not a bad film, but it's nothing I'd come back to, at least for now.My previous experience with James Cameron, Aliens, was quite frustrating. That being said, I remember watching The Terminator some years ago and overall enjoying it, so I didn't really know what to expect. I think that my watching experience ended up being very...okay, I guess? I don't love it, I don't hate it. I had an okay time, with some cringe moments and some decent, fun moments, especially those involving the Terminator itself. I think I'm gonna give it a 6.2/10.

A young Bill Paxton even shows up.James Cameron has had an amazing career, and this was an early triumph.

Lethally Efficient Entertainment Machine,"The police psychologist interviewing Kyle Reese says it just right at one point: ""I could make a career out of this guy!"" Make that two careers, that of action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and blockbuster filmmaker James Cameron.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a struggling waitress who has just been stood up for a date. Another date is en route; unfortunately for her it's the proverbial date from hell. He may look like a studly Austrian-American bodybuilder, but he's really a hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped in human tissue sent from the future to kill her before she can give birth to the hope of mankind's survival. Can Kyle (Michael Biehn) save her before Arnold does his job?The title character is really a thing of beauty. As Kyle explains: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead.""So what you have is ""Jaws"" for a new decade. And there can be no doubt what that decade is. From the Walkman worn by Sarah's roommate to the trendy neon sportswear on display at the ""Technoir"" nightclub, this is a 1980s movie through and through. And other than some clunky miniatures work set in the world Kyle came from, there's nothing wrong with that.The film has a lot more going for it. From start to stop this is, like ""Jaws,"" a pop-action spectacular that never stops. Even the lengthy time-travel exposition scenes are suspenseful, because you are always alert for what might come through the door in the next second. Schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression in an atypical bad- guy role, while Hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty and sudden bursts of heroism. Biehn may do the best job, his face suggesting the anguish of his character's plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope for the future personified in Sarah.Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd fashioned a clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re-viewings. There's a scene between Kyle and Sarah that brings ""Terminator's"" greatness into focus for me. He's telling her of this photograph he has been holding of her, and spent many terrible nights staring at, wondering what she was thinking. Later, Cameron has a scene where we get to see what Sarah was thinking, and it's a doozy!Then there's the police vehicle the Terminator rides around in trying to get his mark. The slogan on the side of the car reads: ""Dedicated To Serve."" Perfect!Is the Terminator supposed to be from THE future, or just ""one possible future""? Like Sarah says, a guy could go crazy thinking about this. Or at least have to wait until the next sequel. Hollywood can beat good ideas to death, but this film proves it will take a lot indeed to kill the Terminator.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Schwarzenegger at his best - awesome movie!,"Wow! Terminator 1 is probably the best sci-fi thriller of all time. I know some people like T2 more but to me, this is the definitive movie that laid the foundation for all 80s sci-fi and 90s thriller movies after it.From the starting future sequence with the hunter-killers, we are brought into a world we have rarely seen in movies. It still surprises me how Jim Cameron and the rest of the production crew managed to pull the special effects off. Anyways, this future sequence is just a preview of the darkness and entertainment this movie is about to bring to the screen.As soon as Arnold shows up doing the terminator pose, and uses classic Arnold one-liners to get some clothes from some punk guys, you immediately realize you're in for a ride.Michael Biehn does a great job playing Kyle Reese, I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. Linda Hamilton does a wonder playing Sarah Connor, and shows how an average woman living a casual life can change into a fight-for-your-life Rambo type gal.Overall, with stellar acting and directing, an insanely good plot and how-did-they-do-that special effects, this movie gets a 10/10 from me.Oh and also, don't forget, 'I'll be back' - insert Austrian accent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
James Cameron's first of many films that are modern classics.,"The Terminator was released in 1984 and its reputation has only grown since. As a matter of fact many today consider it a better film than even its sequel T2 which was a far bigger commercial and critical hit upon its release. Arnold sizzles in the role that truly defined him and it is easy to see why- He looks and acts exactly like a robot, right down to facial expressions(or lack thereof) and the stance of walk. Linda Hamilton and Michael Beihn are really good and it is a testament to Cameron's innate talent that he got such great acting from largely unknown actors. The pacing is excellent and the cinematography is suitably gritty and grainy. More than 30 years have passed since the film's release but the Terminator hasn't lost any of its punch and remains a science fiction classic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison,"Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison, James Cameron's dark vision of the future was a launching pad for several careers in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career and appearance in 1984, so his size and musculature made him the perfect choice to play the killing machine from the future. Linda Hamilton became a star after a somewhat lackluster career by portraying Sarah Connor, a role she reprises in T2: Judgment Day. Micheal Biehn, a heretofore minor character actor, gained overnight popularity as Kyle Reese and went on to film other action films, including Navy Seals and Aliens. Even Lance Henriksen can claim a large amount of his success on his role as Det. Hal Vukovich, and both Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were seen early in their careers thanks to their brief but memorable roles as the punks who first confront the Terminator.While the special effects were not what we would expect to see now, for 1984 they were exceptional. The mechanical movements of Arnold were timed and precise, and the skeletal movements of the Terminator at the end of the film are matched with his character. There are some disparities in the plot, but those are the normal disparities that come with any time travel story. The action, once we get past the initial introduction of characters, is fast. Even when the action slows, the plot moves forward with a consistency rarely seen in action films, and the on-going development of the characters is well written and acted. Its popularity is apparent, since it has spawned no less that three sequels which manage to cover every question, including how John Conner got the scars across his face. Rated R for sex, language, and violence, older teens will probably not find the solitary scene between Sarah and Kyle too embarrassing, and the younger kids should be in bed. Definitely a collectible for any good collector.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The other Six Million Dollar Man!,"$100million or more may have been spent to make the much celebrated sequel, but this, the original, stays longest in my mind, and I suspect a good many other people's too.For all the hype about T2, that film simply does not have the narrative drive which is on show here. Fusing the concept of time travel with the theme of assassination, James Cameron's picture has echoes of such classics as Day of the Jackal; the extra twist here of course is that the Terminator would appear to be indestructible. It's as though Steve Austin (TV's Bionic Man) had transformed into Mr Hyde.By creating a tightly written thriller, with an almost claustrophobic sense of tension to it, Cameron proved right at the start of his career he does not need a mega budget to make a great film. Indeed, it's significant to note that the two finest pictures of Cameron's career, critically at least, The Terminator and Aliens, are also the two films with the smallest budgets.T2, Titanic and Avatar have reaped over $4 billion, but hand on heart, can anyone honestly claim those pictures, in regard to writing, direction, and a compelling storyline come anywhere close to the tension and sense of drama which he manages to evoke here in less than a couple of hours? I seriously doubt it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The only Terminator movie that matters or is needed.,"Here I sit watching the original movie and realized I have never reviewed it. I will cut to the point: This is the ONLY movie that is needed and every other movie in the franchise is completely superfluous. T2 had the makings of being a perfect sequel, but truth be told, it is no where near the movie the first one is.I read somewhere that The Terminator came to Cameron when he had a fever dream. A dream that featured a cyborg that had one mission and would not stop no matter what. This is a truly terrifying aspect and the first movie perfectly conveyed the total terror and helplessness our hunted, Sarah Connor, goes through.Usually movies that involve time travel can be convoluted but this story, the concept of time travel makes total sense. A cyborg coming back in time to kill the mother of the man who stands up to AI overlords is a pretty simple concept to follow.What makes this movie the best is that it does not rely on CGI to make up for lack of story. Honestly, CGI has ruined the experience of of movies. I am watching the eye removal scene right now. Amazing effects, mood, and shock value that none of the movies came close to reproducing.The entire cast was perfect. Arnold was amazing and haunting. All the other Terminator movies, he was annoying. Linda Hamilton played a person whom I believed is real in this movie. In all the others, she's a cartoonish and totally unreal heroine. Everyone else in this movie was absolutely stellar.To me this is the only movie I need to see (although, I did like T3, but still, a movie that is not needed) to entertain me and put me into a state of fear and mayhem.This is a timeless and perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Visionary,"More than 30 years has passed since ""The Terminator"" has been released. Wow, how time flies by... Still, the movie remains one of the most fascinating pieces of cinema history. It may show its age in some parts, where it's ""so 80's"" and goofy you'll probably have to giggle or roll your eyes and Arnold delivers his few lines with an accent thicker than pudding, but beside these minor scenes, it has aged well and truly reminds me that they don't make them like that anymore. And if you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for? Stop reading anything about it, go grab yourself a copy, turn the lights down and the sound up and enjoy this visionary masterpiece.Why do I say is it visionary? Because there hasn't quite been anything like it before, not at this level of production. Just the idea that a near indestructible cyborg is haunting you for seemingly no reason is nightmare inducing, fundamentally great movie material. Not only that, but how James Cameron is expanding on it is sheer brilliance. Of course, since it involves sci-fi babble which you may or may not find far-fetched there is a slight chance you'll find it's plot to be nonsense. Regardless even if you dismiss the story as something completely stupid there is still plenty of impressive action, stunt-work, car chase-thrills and tension to keep you entertained. But it's far from being just mindless action. It is dark, it doesn't scare away to show some nasty stuff such as the Terminator repairing himself with this flesh torn or him going on a spree at the police station all of which cleverly emphasizes what an unstoppable, ruthless force we're dealing here with. Speaking of the scene at the police station, it is probably one of the most spectacular shootout scenes ever. The non-stop sounds of gunfire, smart use of POV shots which at the time were something creative and not overused, clear camera angles and uncompromised outcome make it something truly special. And Arnolds performance in it is pure badassery.The Terminator is one of those must-see movies. Even now where it's formula has already been copied countless times, I still can't appreciate it enough. It is a product of one of the greatest filmmaker of our time, which earned its success by pure passion for the material, imagination and vision, and it shows.

It remains impressive more than thirty years after its debut.,"This film is one of the action classics that has never left the TV since it premiered. It started a cinematographic franchise that developed later and has been one of the most dystopian visions of the future of humanity in cinema: an extermination war between humans and machines.In this film, Sarah Connor is a young girl like so many others. However, she is the target of a dark killer, who will not stop until she is killed. When he is about to succeed, another man appears, saves her and tells him the truth: the killer is actually a complex machine, sent to the past to kill her before she can give birth to a guerrilla commander who, fifty years from then, will lead the war against machines.If it is action that we are looking for, this film takes that expectation seriously: what it offers us is pure and hard action, from start to finish. It's full of normal and welcome elements in films like this: destroyed cars, car chases, police cars, exploding trucks, highway shootings, high-speed cars. Okay, these folks in the Eighties and Nineties don't seem to be able to design an action movie without destroying cars! Nothing against it, but it is something that I found curious. I particularly liked the shooting sequence at the police station, and the ending, at the factory, is just as memorable.Linda Hamilton is the most interesting actress in the cast. She is a good actress, and shows talent in the scenes where she is allowed to. I say this because the film was not nice to her: the only thing she does most of the time is to be in danger and to look scared and confused. Still, she did it sincerely. Michael Biehn has more time and opportunities to show what is worth, and he too was extremely competent in his work. But it is Arnold Schwarzenegger who takes the rug off them and makes the film iconic. The film is still from that time when he was just a muscle mountain, hard as steel, with a strong, barely disguised, German accent. He couldn't be better, and it's hard to imagine another actor for the role.James Cameron ensures an inspired direction. He knew how to guide his team and get the best out of his cast. Being a 1984 film, I was expecting something different, much more dated and looking ugly, as many films of that decade seem to be now. However, I was very impressed: cinematography is beautiful and the film is sharp and excellently filmed; sets and costumes are, of course, a reflection of the time, but that was to be expected. What about visual and special effects? Okay, I'm willing to concede that they seem archaic to our eyes, but here the fault is ours. James Cameron is an effects expert and used the best there was... in 1984. And in fact, considering it's age, special effects will look much more magnificent. Before finishing, a word of praise for the main theme of the soundtrack designed by Brad Fiedel in synthesizer: undoubtedly, one of the most striking soundtracks for action cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The terminator,"It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg - a terminator - back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease.The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film.There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A film that reworks its limitations into its strengths,"I do really love how Cameron takes what would usually be limitations and turns them into strengths.Physically intimidating actor with limited range and a monotone voice in Arnold Schwarzenegger? Cast him as an emotionless, ruthless cyborg who only wants to kill.Low budget and limited scale? Shoot action scenes at night and utilise a wide range of sometimes limited but always creative effects for those set pieces.Story about the fate of humanity, and the world being wiped out by machines made on said low budget? Tell a smaller story with a small cast, and provide an insight into that bigger story with a few short flash forwards and through dialogue.The execution isn't always perfect, but it's usually pretty great, and the first Terminator does wonders with what it had to work with, and Cameron's screenplay is strong and doesn't waste a second. My score for this would float somewhere between a 4 and a 4.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm an asshole.From memory I do slightly prefer Terminator 2, so I look forward to also rewatching that soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"One of the greats of the action genre, and just a great film overall","Have not always been a big fan of action films, after seeing my fair share poorly made, dull and predictable, sloppily written and badly acted ones that delivers just as little on the action (the worst of Steven Seagal being prime examples. The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.The Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.Action fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It was exciting,"This is one of the most famous movie series in the world. I watched it first time,I regret that I never watched before. It was so exciting and deep story.

She is a legendary character in the future.Her son achieved a great work however it was bad for the Terminator and decided to revenge against him and his mother.

1984 and Beyond ...,"This quintessential marker of the decade may be modest in terms of its budget. But it's certainly epic in terms of its ideas. A piece of action-packed ""tech stuff"" on the surface, ""The Terminator"" comes a very long way from simply being a stylish noiresque chase movie with some time travel elements thrown in to spice it up. Because, first and foremost, this stuff is thoroughly rich in meaning. In essence, it's a superbly told tale of a lone warrior on a doomed mission who is given only a fleeting moment to share with the only one of his life. While desperately trying to protect her and everything human in human beings from forces so overwhelmingly destructive that they seem to be on par with the will of the gods in Greek tragedies. And the powerful background, permeated with a sense of impending fate, against which this drama is unfolding, apart from helping to deliver a serious and convincing message, somewhat unexpectedly turns it into one of the most poignant and poetic love stories – where love conquers time and space and the moment becomes eternal. So this picture should be named among very few actually substantial and emotional fables produced by the department of mainstream entertainment – as it sets off on an infinite journey far beyond the confines of a genre  and beyond the infinite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Cheapjack thriller is crass and clunky...but undeniably well-cast,"Arnold Schwarzenegger found his niche as an action-star playing a bloodthirsty machine from 2029 A. D. who's come to present-day Los Angeles to kill a waitress who will eventually give birth to a son and future warrior. The Terminator is an expressionless villain--perfect casting for Schwarzenegger--so it's easy to see why this role reinvented the former bodybuilder's movie career. Linda Hamilton is also terrific as his target, but this is basically a cheapjack thriller, and one with a tacky sci-fi frame. Director James Cameron stages a shoot-out and a freeway chase with aplomb, but he knows nothing of subtlety and his attempts at humor are heavy-handed. Followed by ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" in 1991, wherein Arnold was improbably cast as the good guy (though audiences didn't seem to mind). ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Surprise! Arnold Plays The Villain,"Here's another film from the '80s that is reaching ""classic"" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. In retrospect, what makes this ""Terminator"" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the other Terminator movies.Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the ""good guys."" The now famous phrase by Arnold, ""I'll be back."" comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Original and classic sci-fi action,"After hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'.A mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.Keeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays.RATING: [4.5/5]",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Godather of Sci fi Movies,"Wow, this is one of them films I try and watch once a year, it's that good, a true classic, many film lovers I know agree with me and I usually always see someone's face light up when mentioning this classic (as well the excellent sequel T2)On the surface, cyborg comes back from the future to kill a woman to stop her unborn child ever being born, sounds like a B-Movie script right?? If so, then this has gotta be the best B-Movie in history (and I absolutely love B-Movies) this film is more than any one genre, Sci-Fi, B-Movie, thriller, horror , this film has it all, even some romance thrown in, the point is it's one of the best films of its kind, one of my all time favourites.
We get a glimpse of a nightmarish future where machines rule the world and then back in (present day) 1984 LA, two men (one man, one cyborg) are transported onto the LA streets both looking for a carefree young Sarah Connor, one wants to protect her, the other wants to Terminate her so the machines can continue to rule in the future and her unborn son seems to be the key to stopping them, definitely a mouthful of a plot to keep up with, so we have a cat and mouse game going as her would be killer is an unstoppable Cyborg, a T-800.The tension is present throughout pretty much the whole film, the film also screams 1980s in the best possible way, the dark brooding neo noir atmosphere, the music, the lighting, the tech-noir nightclub, theirs barely no time to rest, their is tension, drama, action right from the get go to the thrilling climax.The cast are fantastic here, Michael Biehn as a young soldier sent to protect Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, but the real star of the show is Arnie himself, a career defining role in an impressive film career of action packed hits, but none better is he here, a truly terrifying machine who will stop at nothing.James Cameron done a brilliant job with this and the direct sequel T2, but for me the original edges it due to the sheer bleakness of the plot, the films set mostly at night and I recommend watching it in the evening believe me it is not the same watching in the daytime.
Some critics say as with all films of a certain age that its dated, special effects not good compared to today, etc etc, forget all that and just enjoy the film, immerse yourself fully and pretend your in 1984 and the films just come out.
I'm hoping to watch this again soon, as it's such a personal favourite, so get the beers and some food in, and enjoy the ride, an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"No classic, but entertaining","Personally, I enjoyed the sequels better and the film is somewhat dated (especially with the electronic soundtrack), but I still liked this movie. I just don't visualize myself watching it on many repeat viewings.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's robotic acting is perfect for the role of the terminator. On the other hand, Michael Biehn has no excuse.  His performance is completely dull, and I wish James Cameron put more thought into casting the hero.  You do want the hero to have SOME inkling of a personality.  Linda Hamilton's performance, though rusty at points, is pretty good.  It's also nice to see Paul Winfield, who I think I haven't seen since ""Cliffhanger."" Lance Henriksen is always cool to watch.  The storyline is thin and easy-to-follow.  It's nice to hear the premiere of Arnie's ""I'll be back"" line.  The film didn't send me leaping from my seat, but it's worth a look.

Happy birthday to a monumental motion picture,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Terminator"" (1984) is a true classic, and one of the most important movies ever created. By ""important"" I mean that it started lots of things, which later became very common in cinema itself.There isn't anything new that I could write about this picture that was wasn't said hundred times before. Everything in this movie works and clicks on all cylinders. Made only for couple of bucks (in terms of today's sci-fi / ""actionier"" budget, even considering B movies) it stuck in people memories forever. How did maestro J. Cameron achieve that?Here are the main reasons in my opinion: Original and high concept story; Very good and believable acting by all involved; Great script; Cool action scenes; Terrific pacing; and of course all cudos to all technical stuff, effects, cinematography and so on. The idea was always the driving force behind movie, which is now safe to call masterpiece. J. Cameron proofed his genius with his first movie (first movie I mean ""Terminator"", not flying fish stuff J).Overall, as you have already saw this picture many times, there is nothing new to say. It's a true classic in every meaning of this word. Even now, 30 years after its release, this small budget B movie sci fi flick from 80's is still managing to attract audiences. If you could check some torrent sites, you would always see this film as one of the most down loadable, whenever you check it, no matter what season is, what movies there are – it's always among the most popular. It's simply just for one reason – a true movie entertainment is timeless and ageless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable).

30 cops? No problem!,"I saw the Terminator at my old neighborhood theater, the Alpine. It was the kind of theater where the occasional stray cat would run across the bottom of the screen on a Saturday night followed by one or two of his pals. It was the kind of theater where your shoe might stick to the carpet from all the spilled soda. It was the kind of theater where the occasional shootout had been known to happen, thankfully never while I visited. It was the last movie I got to see there because after it's run, they replaced it with ""Cooley High"" and ""Them"", the last two movies that would ever be shown there. The theater was torn down to make way for a McDonalds, which is still there to this day. I guess the reason I'm telling you, dear IMDB user, about the theater is because it was a symbol of ""the old days"" for me. I was ten years old when I saw the Terminator, nineteen years ago. Thinking about that fact while watching T3 two days ago made me feel a little sad, especially when it dawned on me that I had watched that movie and it's two sequels with one my oldest and closest friends. Sad to say, I think the state of movies these days has dwindled. I remember going to the movies in those years not only to see great special effects and unflinching violence (cut me some slack, I was a kid then; what kid didn't love movie violence?) but with the sincere hopes that I would be hypnotized by a great story. These days, it's rare that you actually get that. You might get some astounding special effects wrapped around a thin shell of a ""story"" and that's if you're lucky. The Terminator was one of those movies that blew me away when I first saw it and it did so with an intensity that still rivals most action movies I have seen ever since.I'm not going to go into plot details because honestly, if you're reading this, I think you know what to expect already. For those out of the loop, just know that this is the movie that made Schwarzenegger and that's no exaggeration. The definition of ruthless in the dictionary should have a picture of him from the movie right next to it. I remember watching this movie and the feeling I got, when he went into the police station and mowed down everyone and their mothers who even dared to stand up and get in his way is still a feeling I get when I watch that scene, almost twenty years later. Not that I enjoy seeing the cops bite it in fantasy or reality but the thrill of watching an unstoppable killing machine destroy everything in it's path with such frightening single-mindedness in achieving it's goals.... it's really something else. This is one of those movies that I have never gotten tired of. It's a B-movie but a B-movie with heart. There's a reason that it was voted one of the ten best movies of the '80s and it's because it's infinitely rewatchable. All of the characters are memorable in this. The only gripe that I have with the flick is that the special effects haven't held up all that well and to be truthful, they were never really that good to begin with, even back in '84. It doesn't detract much though because this movie grabs you from it's opening shot and never lets you go. This movie isn't about how cool the effects are or how much action it has. It's a movie with a great story that doesn't get overwhelmed by anything else. I love this movie and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading this and go get the damn DVD. If you think the movie sucks I will gladly refund the $15 or so dollars. Just be prepared to give me a convincing explanation as to why you hated it.I hope that people reading this understand the sentimentality behind my review. There was a time when I used to enjoy looking forward to seeing movies on the big screen. I still enjoy the occasional movie in the theaters these days and it's funny how the really good ones are made on a smaller scale. I just feel like these days, it's all about how much of a budget gets approved and how much of it goes towards the film's big action set piece. That's fine and all but how about giving me a good story to go with it? Maybe one day, the flicks will recapture the imagination they once had without resorting to the ageing tactics employed today.

Not That GREAT of a Movie,"A cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah, but is there any way to stop the seemingly indestructible cyborg?This film is smart, maybe ingenious toward the ending, but it's no where near a great or fantastic film. Just because the ending was good doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. This film delivers the action you want, some humorous scenes, and some suspenseful scenes.I liked the acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, while Michael Biehn wasn't in their league. For a 1984 film, this film has a good number of action scenes, probably a good look of the future world and the robots are good looking.This villain in the film (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is one of the famous villains ever and that stands a strong point in the film, along with the story and the acting but it wasn't all that great as a classic but you'll have fun when watching the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
True hero of the series,"While Terminator 2: Judgment Day often steals the spotlight, it's the original The Terminator to me that quietly stands as a superior entry in the series. The film might not have the explosive action or groundbreaking CGI of its successor, but it excels in areas that make it a classic in its own right-sometimes overlooked in the shadow of its blockbuster sequel.What makes The Terminator so compelling is its raw, relentless energy. The film operates more like a horror-thriller, with a cold, unstoppable force in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 hunting down Sarah Connor. The sense of dread is palpable, with James Cameron expertly building tension through a tight script and relentless pacing. The gritty atmosphere and the low-budget aesthetic only add to the film's intensity, making it feel more immediate and dangerous. Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the T-800 is iconic. His minimal dialogue and emotionless delivery make him the perfect embodiment of a machine; one that's terrifyingly efficient in its mission. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, on the other hand, is relatable and grounded, growing from an ordinary woman into a figure of resilience and determination. The chemistry between her and Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese adds an emotional layer to the film, giving it heart amid the chaos.One of the film's strongest points is its concept. The idea of a machine sent from the future to alter the past is fascinating and was quite innovative for its time. The movie dives into the themes of fate, technology, and survival in a way that feels more intimate and urgent than its sequels. It's a lean, mean story that doesn't get bogged down by too much exposition, letting the action and tension do most of the talking.However, The Terminator isn't without its minor flaws. The special effects, while groundbreaking in 1984, can feel dated by today's standards, especially during the final showdown. Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky, and the budget constraints show in certain scenes where the film's ambitions slightly exceed its means.But these are small criticisms in the grand scheme of things. The Terminator excels where it counts - storytelling, atmosphere, and character development. It's a film that has aged well, retaining its power and impact even decades later. While Terminator 2 often gets the praise, the original The Terminator deserves more recognition as the film that laid the foundation for everything that followed. It's leaner, meaner, and arguably more focused, making it a standout entry that sometimes gets overlooked in favor of its flashier sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The only good thing about this movie is the story, and even then it's not that good. Another weird part about this movie is the hero. He's just not good. He acts weird all the time to, and I'd honestly just prefer Arny to be the hero. With as much crap I'm giving this movie, I still enjoyed it, for what it is.

An unique sci-fi movie,"This film is simply flabbergasting. The plot is well designed and the viewer can see the thoughts of the main protagonists.

Beyond that, the story gives you food-for-thought concerning robots and artificial intelligence. It's definitely a must watch to say the least and I do believe it deserves the title of masterpiece.

"""I'll be back.""  Wait for him, the sequel is better.","In an age when computers began to be relied on more and more, not a scarier film could come along. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, a cyborg sent back through time to kill the mother (Hamilton) of a then-unborn resistance leader that would defeat the invading Terminator-race in the future. Michael Biehn plays an unlikely but well-done hero, with Henriksen, Boen and Winfeld as the unexpected comedic relief that lacked in the sequels. The story suffers from a paradox you could drive a big rig through; the special-effects weren't that far ahead of its time; and the soundtrack may have suited the mood for 1984, but it ended up dating poorly. Schwarzenegger fits the role perfectly. Originally, Henriksen was supposed to play the Terminator.

A sci-fi tech-noir classic,"This was one of those early movies that drew me in to the world of Hollywood. Of course, when I first watched it, I didn't have much idea about what went behind the scenes when making this movie. But now that I do, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously given what it was able to accomplish on such a low budget with such a small set of characters making what could have easily been a B-movie in the wrong hands seem like a solid sci-fi story ending with an epic feeling of the things to follow.The movie begins with what is possibly one of the coolest title cards for a 1980s flick with Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme playing in the background as the cast is listed in the form of messages displayed from a computer terminal. This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.What separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the ""other"" sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world. While I didn't find the characters to be groundbreaking or as interesting as in other dramas, the plot was extremely well constructed and allowed for some really cool paradoxes that would make for some interesting discussion (would John Conner even exist if he hadn't sent Kyle back in time).The effects deserve special mention too. It is incredible how much Stan Winston's crew and Fantasy II were able to achieve at the time. All the futuristic scenes, the sequence with the Terminator treating his injuries, the chase sequences and the entire ambitious final act all work and some of them still hold up three decades later. And Brad Fiedel's theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, as if signaling an impending apocalypse.All the actors do well in their respective roles, particularly Arnold who shines in a part that seemed almost tailor made to suit his acting capabilities. But it is Cameron who is truly the star of this endeavor, believing in his project and driving it to execution. Thank God for the success of this movie, which gave us many more masterpieces by Cameron. But then, it was entirely deserving of it. A sci-fi tech-noir classic.Overall Score: 8.0 / 10.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Ah-nold kicking butt, cyborg-style!","We really did get some of our greatest action movies out of the 1980's. In that decade, where there was action, there was Arnold. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic film role, that of the unstoppable Terminator. In this science fiction/thriller milestone, the Terminator is a cyborg sent from the year 2029 to kill the mother of the man who would save mankind from the machines. Its a film nearly everyone has seen, so there isn't a whole lot to say about it. It was a great action flick that launched a successful franchise.The special effects are a little dated at this point, but it isn't bad enough to pull you out of the movie. The animatronics and puppets are obvious but cool to watch. While on the topic of ""dated"", it is kind of amusing to see this movie take place surrounded by 80's style (that's some BIG hair). The film is loaded with plenty of action but it does slow down a bit after the first half when the audience is treated to the bulk of the movie's exposition. Linda Hamilton is awesome as Sarah Connor, target for termination, and has good on-screen chemistry with Michael Biehn. The only real weak spot (which isn't even really worth mentioning) in the movie was Bill Paxton in the opening as the leader of a punk gang. As minor as his role is, for some reason, he always makes me cringe. For some reason, he just aggravates me in this movie. Of course, he's only on screen for two minutes and his role means near to nothing, so ignore my rant.The movie does have a couple plot holes, but only if you feel like feeding a headache with thoughts of time travel mechanics. Most people don't, so it doesn't matter. The movie is a fun popcorn flick and spawned two sequels. Don't try to make sense of things, sit back, and enjoy nearly two hours of action with 80's flair and some of Arnold's best one-liners!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
*A Time-Traveling Masterpiece: The Terminator's Undying Legacy*,"The sci-fi classic *The Terminator* directed by James Cameron is not merely a film; it's an electrifying experience that transcends the boundaries of its genre and etches itself into the annals of cinematic history. A perfect concoction of relentless action, groundbreaking visual effects, and a thought-provoking narrative, this film introduced audiences to a dystopian future where technology surpasses its creators, making it a prescient cautionary tale.At its core, *The Terminator* revolves around a relentless cyborg assassin, sent from the future to eliminate Sarah Connor, the unsuspecting mother of humanity's savior. Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the titular character is iconic, perfectly embodying a chilling blend of invulnerability and terrifying precision. His utterance of few yet memorable lines has since become part of pop culture lexicon.What truly sets *The Terminator* apart is its masterful pacing and tension-building, expertly crafted by Cameron's direction. The film operates like a relentless machine, driving forward with an urgency that mirrors its own narrative. Every action sequence is meticulously choreographed, yet feels raw and chaotic-drawing the viewer into a visceral experience where stakes are ever high.Moreover, the film's themes of fate versus free will resonate even deeper today. The concept of a future dictated by technology prompts audiences to reflect on the implications of our own reliance on machines-a discussion that feels increasingly relevant in an age of AI and automation.The supporting performances, especially Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, play an indispensable role in elevating the film. Hamilton's character evolves from a naïve waitress to a fierce protector, symbolizing empowerment and resilience. Her journey throughout the film not only serves the plot but adds depth to its emotional core.Visually, *The Terminator* broke new ground for its time. Combining practical effects with innovative techniques, Cameron created a gritty yet compelling world that feels eerily plausible. The film's aesthetic, drenched in neon and shadows, crafts an atmosphere reflective of its cybernetic themes, marking it as a timeless piece that continues to influence filmmakers today.*The Terminator* is a film that defies the passage of time, leaving an indelible mark on science fiction cinema. Its ability to blend action with profound philosophical questions establishes it not only as a thrilling ride but as a poignant commentary on the human condition in an age of burgeoning technology. A must-watch for any cinephile, it serves as a reminder that sometimes, the most terrifying elements of our future are those we have yet to discover about ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Fatality and Predestination or when running away can only be a temporary option,"Simply said, ""The Terminator"" is a great film, and even greater when you watch it with the mindset of someone discovering it in 1984, a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger's career was still to be consolidated, when James Cameron wasn't yet that billion-ma'King of the world', when ""I'll be back"" was still a quote that could be heard in any film without being associated to a bad-ass catchphrase with an Austrian accent, when Linda Hamilton still looked like a lovely doll begging for protective hugs.In 1984, moviegoers went to see an entertaining B-movie starring that Conan-the-Barbarian-guy whose speech pattern could hardly be taken seriously. Even the producers and director expected a backslash from the critics. Little did they know that they had just made a milestone almost as significant for the Sci-fi genre as ""Alien"" five years before, and that their humility would be rewarded by a close-to-unanimous praise and a lightning propulsion into Pop- Culture. Arnie became THE ultimate action-movie icon, and the rest is no less legendary.And the reason the film works is its remarkable simplicity in each aspect. First of all, the plot : an Artificial Intelligence company named Skynet created such technologically advanced robots that they rebelled against humans and provoked a nuclear holocaust until they were almost defeated by the Rebel Chief John Connor. As a robot sent to kill his mother before he'd exist, Schwarzenegger appears at night, completely naked and takes some civilian clothes before tracking Sarah Connor. But we're in a basic Sci-fi movie and the villain calls for a hero, this is where Michael Biehn intervenes, he looks strong but he's not the alpha male muscular type, which eases the empathy process.His mission is to protect Sarah Connor and kill the Terminator, so running away can only be a temporary option. Yet if the villain ever inspires one thing, it is not to confront him. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, but that's not an issue, any Sarah Connor can potentially be John's mother and is terminated Skynet-style. The murders are straightforward and chilling. At first, the Police don't notice anything odd with that brutal murder, until a second Sarah Connor is gunned down. What kind of serial killer works by the name? Anyway, the most urgent is to protect any Sarah Connor living in L.A., including an adorable waitress, so far from that girl-power archetype from the sequel.And this is one of the film's beauties, the absolute contrast between the robotic killer and the harmless target. And this is where the casting pays off; Arnold Schwarzenegger was certainly criticized for the limitations of his acting range, especially at a time where his accent was stronger, but here, he's given a role that only an actor like him could have portrayed perfectly: a cold and implacable killing machine. The Terminator was nominated #22 villain in the American Film Institute, but he's not sadistic, nor vicious, he's just programmed that way, which is why he's so scary. He's like a steamroller of brutality that will ignore every obstacle until it gets him to Sarah Connor.And the film wouldn't have worked had Linda Hamilton looked or played it like Ellen Ripley in ""Alien"", Obviously, a woman like Sarah Connor needs a protection whether from the cops or from Biehn, and some bits of luck that will prevent her from the fatal encounter. Indeed, when the Terminator realizes he didn't kill the right woman although she lived in Sarah's house, begins a breathtaking, spellbinding cat-and-mouse chase. There are shootouts, there are car chases, but they felt different because this time, the enemy doesn't try to get at them but to kill them, they're means as well as ends. The Terminator is an unstoppable death warrant, guided by fatality. Notice the scene when, for once, Sarah gets the illusion of being finally protected, in a commissariat. The Terminator's ""I'll be back"", especially when heard for the first time, sums up everything, no matter how far away you try to push him, he'll get back to you.And this, resonates as the voice of fatality, the omen of an inevitable confrontation, something that neither Biehn nor Sarah can't avoid, the future has come to haunt them, and if Sarah is really the mother of a future fighter, even she will have to express that 'fighting' part of herself. Whether you look at the half-empty or half-full glass, you'll see ""Terminator"" as a predestination or fatality movie. And I guess this is why the appellation neo-noir isn't gratuitous. Noir is about people who try to escape from a painful certainty but can only triumph over it by confronting it, at the cost of something precious such as their innocence, their optimism, their faith on life or humanity.And 'The Terminator"" is mostly set at night, it features characters who hide from these robots that remind them the apocalyptic future they carry on their hands, their own responsibility. Of course, bonds ought to be made and we have some clues that the predestination thing will provide some curious loops that don't quite respect the orthodoxy of time travels. But the film isn't about time travels, it's about a sense of duty and responsibility. And in a way ""The Terminator"", as a villain, is an inspiration for the heroes, as much as he must kill them no mater what, they have to resist and to defeat him at any costs, the measure of a great antagonist is the degree to which he allows the heroes to overcome their weaknesses.As a matter of fact, the whole trilogy invites humans to question their condition, from being masters to slaves of the technology, what you can control can control you, it's all up to us to take the control of our lives back. That's what Sarah Connor will do, and this is why she becomes such a great heroine, the perfect match for such a great villain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Great action/science fiction story,"The Terminator follows a woman named Sarah Connor and two mysterious men who both appear naked in nighttime Los Angeles 1984 who both seem to be looking for her. One of them even seems to want to kill her and ruthlessly kills two other Los Angeles women named Sarah Connor. The movie is pretty well directed with the tone being ominous at the beginning and more exciting as the story moves on. The mystery element is what makes it work in the first half, with us having no idea who these men are and why they are looking for her. There turns out to be an interesting revelation for it and a cool sci-fi paradox at the end. The action scenes are exciting, but it would have been better to have it more science fiction and less action as we only see a small part of the film focusing on the future. The climax is also very exciting and well done. The acting is good but the main character is not very interesting or likable, just your average woman.

Classic horror/thriller/action hybrid,"A classic Blockbuster, The Terminator plays more like a horror film than the action film franchise that it spawned. Schwarzenegger owns the whole movie with his minimal dialogue and enormous presence. Its amazing that with only fourteen lines of dialogue he became one of the most quotable characters of all time. He carries all of his weapons like extensions of his own arms and remains completely deadpan at all times.The acting of the movie is carried by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom do an excellent job of their roles. Hamilton is a sweet but scared young woman on the run from something she doesn't understand. Biehn is a young soldier from a time far from now, with PTSD licking at the edges of his consciousness. The way Reese looks at heavy machines with apprehension is a tiny thing that speaks volumes, as is the non-existent reactions to deaths of his fellow soldiers in present day.Cameron's screenplay is a marvel, full of incredible dialogue and one of the best plot twists in cinema history. Whilst most of the visual effects are quite dated, they far from ruin the movie and the animatronic head of Schwarzenegger is certainly impressive for its time. The way Cameron cuts the movie around R-rated violence and unavailable visual effects (putting sunglasses on, brilliant!) actually contributes to the film's cult thriller status. I don't know why Schwarzenegger was given a posh combover at the start, but it is quickly messed up, and the film's score has lots of impressive horror moments but is probably better suited to this film than the very action-heavy Terminator theme we are used to today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A cultural touchstone and terrific plot that wears itself thin after some time has passed,"The Terminator (1984)I just saw this first Terminator movie in 2014 for the third time, and I expected something more, and different from it. Naturally, the surprise is gone, and I think the plot idea is maybe the strongest point to the whole movie. The movie is directed with panache, for sure—the effects, the action, the deliberate lack of depth, the epic glossy wow of it all. But it's not a rich movie, it doesn't have depths, it frankly lacks enough to make a second or third viewing worth the trouble. Unless, of course, you are already invested and committed to it for personal reasons.The first shot, very early in the movie, when the naked Schwarzenegger appears crouched in the urban night, is archetypal and terrific. And then he moves and interacts (still naked, though you don't see that) and the comic element is in place. And here we have the movie, both profound to the point of being moved, and kitschy and puerile, too. It's sort of meant to be a accessible and direct, and that makes it a great first viewing. The plot is certainly loaded with big (huge) twists and mind-bending ideas. And we want so much for right to triumph over evil.You have to ask eventually about the acting. Maybe we need a stiff automaton in the role of the robotic machine that is known as the ""terminator"" (a cyborg). So the future governor of California is off the hook. But the other main lead, the woman known so well as Sarah Connor, is a so-so actress. No way around the plain approach she has to being a regular girl caught up in the largest story possible. The other time-traveller, a human played by Michael Biehn, is pure nuts and bolts stuff, too. In fact, it's hard to really love any of the performances, except maybe the police chief.All of this boils down to a movie that scores very high on concept and on the basic effects. This is what drives it to stardom. But leave it at that. Love it for what it is, plain and simple. James Cameron, the lauded and wealthy director in charge, is no genius here, but is very very able. That's a back-handed compliment, for sure. But lovers of Kubrick or Ridley Scott know what I mean.A re-alignment of the stars for this one. Over time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Terminator A Good Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws,"The Terminator is a good sci-fi film with some flaws but it does have a compelling story, plenty of action, character development, suspense, great special effects especially for that time, and solid performances by the whole cast. I did prefer T2 and most recently Terminator Salvation over this one but the original is still a good film. Writer/Director James Cameron the man behind films like Titanic, True Lies, Alien 2, and the upcoming Avatar showed a real talent as a filmmaker with this movie which was his second one back then. Cameron is one of the best writer/directors out there and he continues to prove just that with every one of his movies. The cast are great in their roles bringing to life these imaginary characters Cameron created for the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in the title role. He may not have many lines and his screen time is cut a little short near the end well sort of Schwarzenegger still proves to be an effective villain. He was born to play The Terminator a ruthless cyborg from the future that will stop at nothing until it's mission is complete. Michael Biehn is equally impressive as time traveler Kyle Reese from the future. He gets just as much screen time if not a little more than Schwarzenegger and Biehn makes the best of his role as the hero in the movie. He brings an intensity to his performance which makes his believable as a time traveler whose mission is to protect Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton. She's also very good in the role of Sarah an ordinary woman who must find the strength within herself to stop the Terminator before he kills her. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but they're not given much to do and really any screen time to leave an impression. The whole story of the film would take me forever to fully explain so I'm not going to get into it. It's better to just watch the Terminator before knowing too much what the movie is about before any spoilers could ruin the experience. The action is pretty much non-stop making the film move at a steady pace as the main characters are introduced and the chase begins to get to Sarah Connor first. All the crashes, explosions, chases, fights, and narrow escapes are well executed most of them looking very realistic. The special effects are state of the art especially for movies back then considering they didn't have the technology available today. The few flashback sequences with Reese showing a post Judgment Day are just as good. The world is an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by machines bent on annihilating the human race. Despite some flaws with the dialogue occasionally, answered questions, and somewhat rushed love story although it had to happen or else John Connor wouldn't exist, The Terminator is still a solid sci-fi film. It's much better than other ones out there like Ultraviolet, Babylon A.D., or Aeon Flux to name a few no offense. Overall The Terminator is an entertaining sci-fi adventure definitely worth watching with plenty of action, great special effects, thrills, suspense, drama, some humor, a little romance, and terrific performances by the cast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Didnt age too well, but the adrenaline fueled ACTION is still top notch!","I was astonished when I read how cheap this movie had to be made, back in the eighties; only 6 million dollars were available! There simply was no money at all to make this movie, that went on to become an action classic, (with a few faults...)Terminator launched Arnie's carreer and rightfully so, because he portrayed the ultimate killing machine in a way that is still nervewrecking and fun to watch to this very day.Despite the cheap looking (sciencefiction) sets and some cheap looking special effects, there is something truly maniacal AND exciting about this action movie.The story: A killing machine from the future (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has come to earth to kill an innocent woman. Why? And can he be stopped?This story is as ludicrous as can be, but the execution of the ACTION is fascinating nonetheless, because of the relentless killing spree, with contineous riveting action scenes upon action scenes.One big long adrenaline fueled ACTION party! The action photography is excellent!Any bad? Yes there are some things wrong with this picture:Terminator 2 is considered to be better by many than this original and they are right, because this original has got quite some corny and cheap moments, which are fortunately absent in the sequel.

"""It absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!""","Assassination and murder often makes for a thrilling story as it is, but what if the murderer happens to be a machine from the future? Unstoppable, invincible, unable to feel pain or remorse, unable to deviate from its programming. The terminator is an inherently scary figure, partly because of the traits mentioned above, and also because it comes from a scary future ravaged by nuclear war and a robot apocalypse.The first Terminator film delivers its premise impeccably, and does so with an agreeable amount of action. Granted that all the sequels have surpassed this film in terms of action, The Terminator still delivers plenty of thrills as the titular machines brutally hunts down its targets. Most of the movie is comprised of chases: car chases, foot chases, with intermittent shootouts, explosions, and fights. In spite of this, the film drags very little; it's actually quite tight, as it effectively uses the space in between the action to develop the story and characters.And the story is quite sound, partly because of its unique premise, and largely because it's told really well. It makes phenomenal use of flashbacks to reinforce the background and characters of the story. Its focus on the characters is superb, and you really grow to care for them by the film's end. Overall, the film shows great depth and detail to make it stand above and beyond most other sci-fi flicks.The film looks great, with excellent photography and editing. A lot of scenes, such as the nightclub scene, leaves a great lasting impact. Acting is great: I love Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective roles. Writing is pretty decent. This production has plenty of good, utilitarian sets, props, costumes, and special effects.

Terminator is one for me, so I'll confess this review may come with nostalgic bias.Firstly, I was not old enough to rent this from the video store in the 80's, but it was the 80's, so the video stores didn't care and let me rent it all the time anyways.Trust me an under 10 year old seeing this as a 'new' movie, was blown away like a disco dancer in TechNoir.It's a good movie, but if it's a first time watch today, you have to put your 'film studies hat' on and think about when it was released and what impact it had to really get the hype.At the time it was a very fresh flick, computers were making their clunky baby steps into domestic life and it was the Cold War, so it's techno conspiracy of the future was on point. It spawned the action hero boom, created the 'Arnie brand', took sci-fi into a grittier direction and showed the indie film can look better and do better than the studios.Yes some of the effects are a bit rubbish, yes we didn't really notice that at the time, yes it's pretty bad near the end, but they're watchable and there's still some good stunt work and car smashing going on.The plots solid, it's not Marvel or DC it's 1984 so we don't need long drawn out back stories full of emotional drives and triggers, we need Arnie with a gun, a few cops and a couple to chase.I also like the grittier look this has, (mainly due to its budget I think), this is the neon streets of Los Angeles, with the action weaving between drunks and punks. Some of those side characters seem cheesy today, but again 80's!Overall I can see how new audiences can judge it by todays effects and productions standards and not like it, (and if you think this has aged bad, watch its rival studio film Runaway, that's a dated shocker), - but for those who can watch older films with dated elements adding to its vibe then they're in for a good watch.Movies are getting old, you've kinda got start looking at them a bit like art history - this bank rolled T2, with nobody really bankrolling this - give it some credit for spawning something that's lasted decades at least.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Super strong sci-fi classic,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his most famous role, plays a brutal killing machine sent into the past to kill the mother of the resistance leader who leads the humans in the war against the machines in the future. A human soldier is sent back in time to protect her. Cue loads of sublime science fiction mayhem. The Terminator is inevitably dated due to the small budget, but it's a great time at the movies. It is a science fiction classic and completely deserves to be, thanks to the interesting story and strong action sequences. While it's a fast paced and snappy movie which hurtles along at breakneck speed, there's a moving relationship in the film and the elements of time travel give the story unexpected depth, which ensure the film certainly does not represent its iconic antagonist. Arnold Schwarzenegger dominates the screen in brilliant badass fashion and while he doesn't have many lines, he delivers them excellently and is an intimidating and threatening villain, although he's still not as cool as R2 D2 and C3PO.The brilliantly made action ensures the film crackles with high octane thrills and genuine energy. There are too many chase sequences in the film, but at least they remain fun despite some repetition. It's overall a very well made film and delivers thrill after thrill. The runtime isn't overlong and it's easy to watch and enjoy. Acting is all around good and Sarah Connor, although she really became a cool character in the sequel, isn't your typical damsel in distress. Kyle Reese is also a very good character. In General, The Terminator is an iconic and entertaining movie which has surprising depth and plenty of fun action. It's not the best science fiction film ever and can't help but look slight next to its dream sequel, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, but mostly it's held up pretty well and even though the budget is relatively small the effects and surprisingly convincing. James Cameron's films can leave one cold, but he certainly knows how to turn millions of dollars into ultra cool cinematic art and put butts on seats.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Mordern Miracle,The Terminator is a stunning film with the best bad guy ever the Terminator played by Schwarznegger who was born with a red eye and a metal skeleton. James Cameron is one of the best directors around at the minute although Steven Spielburg's Saving private Ryan is superb Cameron is excellent. This is truly a modern miracle.,,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Classic,Great movie. The story was original and the movie executed to perfection. The main launch pad for Arnie this was. This movie puts Sci Fi movies made now in the shade if you can look past the special effects from the 80's.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The role Arnold was born to play.,Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play this character. Without him in the title role this picture would be all but forgotten.  Paul Winfield delivers the best performance of the supporting cast but his character had very little on screen time. The sequel had more FX but personally this one is better.

Arnold Schwarznegger is THE TERMINATOR.,"Science Fiction comes a long way through aliens and flying saucers. Then, when Star Wars came out in 1977, the science fiction grew to a new level. Also, the special effects were mind-blowing during that time. But now, a science fiction movie about a robot from the future emerges. The robot is called The Terminator. The Terminator is a dark and action-packed picture about a killing machine sent back through time to kill a woman who hold the key of the future. The Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarznegger, and he has a frightening performance as the metal cyborg assassin. The woman who holds the key to the future is played by Linda Hamilton. She is the victim of the killer cyborg as she is chased around Los Angeles. But, someone else also came back from the future. A solider named Kyle Reese and he is played by Micheal Biehn. The Terminator has great cinematography and develops a personality for the Terminator. In one scene after being shot in the eye, he pulls his damaged eyeball out of his eye socket and reveals the red vision that he sees. After that, he picks up a pair of glasses. The Terminator is a menacing villain that is unbeatable and destructive. All in all, this movie is a good and great one. There are good performances and great cinematography. ★★★★ 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great horror/ scifi, with a bit of intentional humour","One of the most memorable introductions, with his phonetic, computer- like diction (rarely used) , a most relentless stalker/ killer begins his search, ominously looking over LA sprawling out in front of him, from a hilltop.This apparent horror goes into science fiction territory, as we learn he is a machine sent from the future to kill a girl, and a man has also been sent to protect her at all costs.The sci-fi and horror elements are balanced with enough intentional humour, specifically from the police, to whom she goes for protection when the carnage begins. Film wisely gives the audience time to catch their breath. But the police are not merely there for comic relief, they take their job completely serious; it is their interaction with each other which evokes laughter. Yet they still have no idea what they have to protect her from, and are hopelessly at a loss when confronted by it.Calling, yet foreboding music score is a major asset. The metallic *ting* sound heard throughout the score give the film an industrial/ found object feel, which only compliments the film's tone.Classic and influential; marred only by a dippy, out-of-place love story subplot, which comes from out of nowhere and makes no sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Hey, I think this guy's a couple cans short of a six-pack""","Good action movies like this are rare. They just don't make them like they used to. But this is one for the ages. You can not create another storyline like this one and get even 1/10 the results.The Terminator is a classic and most likely will be even after the ""future"" portrayed in the film. James Cameron has done a great job of creating one of the best movies of all times.First off, there's a perfect cast. Every part seems to have been specially designed for the actor. The Terminator could not have been played by anyone other than Arnold. If the Terminator is played by anyone BESIDES Arnold, then it is not being played correctly. Arnold plays him so coldly but very cool as well (if THAT makes any sense). Michael Biehn plays the fearless, mentally unstable hero, Kyle Reese better than anyone else could have. Linda Hamilton shows her famous ""heroine"" performance here as the young, not-yet-tough Sarah Connor.Combine great performances with a perfect story and you have one of the best movies ever made.

A true Sci-Fi classic!,"""The Terminator"" was such a big hit when it got to theaters in 1984. ALthough the film's budget was somewhat low, the film managed to earn a lot of respect and attention from fans of the science fiction genre.The movie's storyline is very imaginative. It features a story of time-travel mixed with action elements, and a dose of romance. The special effects were pretty good for its time. The action scenes were very fierce, which can leave the viewers on the edge of their seats. And the romantic chemistry between Michael Biehn's & Linda Hamilton's characters was very believable, and it makes the viewer want to know more about their characters.Most of the film was shot at night, which gives the atmosphere in the movie a more darker feeling. It also helped the film-makers' greatly because the budget was very low.And finally, the Terminator itself is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role. He fits the role of the musclebound cyborg perfectly. Furthermore, he was very believable as a half-man-half-machine ""bounty hunter"". Plus, he was really scary.Overall, The Terminator is an excellent sci-fi film with a great storyline and great actors & actresses. It is a true Sci-Fi classic that spawned a great sequel and was referenced in many later films. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend that you do so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The kind of film that aspiring screen writers of today wish they had thought of first...,"When James Cameron finally got the Terminator made, the studio refused to advertise it as a ""science fiction film"", which puzzled Cameron. When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically ""Conan the Barbarian"" did that, but ""Terminator"" helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.Arnold plays the title character, a robot in human skin sent back to 1984 LA to kill Sarah Connor (a 28 year old Linda Hamilton with her hair dyed dirty blond), a good natured but lonely, somewhat scatter-brained, hapless waitress who has no idea of just how important she really is: she's the mother of John Connor, the man who will save what's left of the human race in the year 2019 when the machines have almost succeeded in taking over the world. Sarah's only hope is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, who later starred in James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss""), a soldier sent back from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Chaos and mayhem ensue, along with a high body count and the unexpected love story between Sarah & Kyle, the latter who turns out to be John Connor's father. Oh the irony of Kyle's response to Sarah's question about John's father: ""John never said much about him... I know he dies before the war.""Yes, some of the special effects are dated (namely the puppet head used for the scene where the Terminator cuts out its damaged eye and a few of the stop motion effects) and it's set in its era and it kind of runs out of steam towards the end, but the rest of the film is great: it's dark, it's eerie, it's seamy, it's atmospheric, it's violent, it's got pretty much everything. Arnold dominates pretty much every scene he's in. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are sympathetic protagonists.Personally, I like this one better than the sequels, possibly because there's no Edward Furlong in it. The big difference between the films is that the original was more of a thriller, an extended chase scene, whereas the sequels were more about style and special effects and blow you away action sequences. But it's all good in the end. This is also a great examination of what could happen should technology get out of hand, ala ""Blade Runner"".The DVD has two options of sound effects, the old mono system and a newer, more sophisticated one. I highly advise you not to listen to the newer sound system because it makes everything in the film sound really fake. The DVD also has deleted scenes, mostly notably a scene where Reese suffers an emotional break down over being displaced in time, an angle that never surfaced in the film but would have been very interesting to bring up.""I'll be back.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Future Speaks with a German Accent,"This movie blew me away when I first saw it in the theater in 1984. It was futuristic and intense with a good action movie cast and, of course, Arnold.

If you line this movie up with Halloween, The Warriors, The Thing, Alien and a few others from the late '70s to the mid '80s, you have what amounts to a latter day golden age of science fiction/action/horror films.If you're a fan, you've seen this movie countless times.

One of the best action movies ever,"The movie that put James Cameron (Titanic) on the map. The Terminator is a time travel movie about a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from the future back to murder the mother of a resistance fighter so that he will never be born. An ordinary human, Michael Biehn is also sent back by the resistance to protect the mother (Linda Hamilton.) They spend the film fleeing from the terminator. This movie is pumped full of testosterone. The chases are exciting and the terminator's relentless pursuit is harrowing. The final confrontation in the factory is scary as hell. Arnold may be maligned as an actor but this role was perfect for him. He didn't need to talk; all he needed was his square jaw and muscles. Now he's the Governator. Maybe one day he'll be the Presidentator. The Terminator is one of the best action movies ever made.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A Classic Movie Of The 80s That Mixes With Action, Horror, And Science Fiction","""The Terminator"" is one of the most popular movies that was made back in the mid-80s, and it has been well-remembered by critics and audiences alike. Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about ""The Terminator"" and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second ""Terminator"" movie along with the second ""Alien"" movie, ""The Abyss,"" ""True Lies,"" ""Titanic,"" and now ""Avatar."" I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film ""Piranha II: The Spawning,"" was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers ""The Terminator"" as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second ""Piranha"" movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous ""Terminator Theme."" The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no ""Terminator 2,"" but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. ""The Terminator"" is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"More lacking beneath the surface of explosions and gunfire than I remember, but still very much worth a watch.","The story goes that the inspiration behind the idea of the Terminator films derives from a bout of illness its creator, James Cameron, had whilst working on a previous project that had tumbled into being a bit of a creative nightmare. Frantically trying to piece what turned out to be ""Piranha: The Spawning"" together in an edit lab against a ticking clock, Cameron became run down by something which gave him all sorts of unpleasant dreams about indestructible robots chasing him; his life being in mortal danger and nobody believing him.It is perhaps the nightmarish quality of ""The Terminator"" which really allows it to stand out. Let us not mince our words, here – Cameron essentially hopped from one exploitation feature to another in making it. Everything that needs to be present for an effective Z-movie is present: the gore; the action; the nudity; the causality and the lack of a plot. That is not to be rude to the IDEA, which is wonderful - a robot killing machine is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of a brave resistance leader, who is proving to be a thorn in the side of the metal maniacs in their attempts to wipe out every last human-being. One of Cameron's characters even pokes fun at the premise, describing what the robot is attempting to do as a kind of ""retroactive abortion"". It is, however, little more than a cue for all-out mayhem across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.We have all read the essays and digested the feminist theory which revolves around the character of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) enough times by now for anybody to need to rehash it here. Put simply, Connor is the aforementioned target – the protagonist who learns of her destiny and is taken from being your generic bimbo, and a useless waitress, to a brave soldier. Later theory would revolve around Connor and the Terminator character transgressing their respective roles in the sequel, which had the 'killer' robot being reprogrammed to become a mother/guardian figure and Hamilton's character tooling up to wipe out a defenceless anomaly (Miles Bennett Dyson) for being something they were not even privy to.Chasing Connor here is Arnold Schwarzenegger's titular Terminator: a metal exoskeleton operating underneath living flesh tissue and impervious to the pathetic weaponry of the 1980's, while also sent back is one of the future humans' top fieldsmen in Kyle Reece (Michael Biehn). One of the most endearing things about watching the film now, I suppose, is that each are playing the roles they are most famous for. The opening exchanges, as both time-travellers adapt to their surroundings; tools up to take the other on and go about hunting down Sarah, are good value. We witness The Terminator dealing with three rough-shot punks upon arrival with the simplest of ease, while Reece is depicted as actually having to run away and hide when the police pick up on his otherworldly arrival. Cameron's goal is fairly obvious: the odds are stacked against the good guys.What follows is by no means 'bad', but it is remarkable as to how quickly the film settles into a causality driven process of action; chase and recovery – something is to be said, however, in the way Cameron kicks things back into life via the ingenious ways the Terminator picks back up on his prey again when it seems they've gotten away. More substantial is Cameron's social commentary, not to mention the love story which develops between Reece and Connor. Cameron shoots on location in Los Angeles at night, capturing the down-to-Earth reality of homelessness; street hoodlums and the general junk and filth which litters the streets – making, in the process, a correlation between the nightmarish ruined LA of the future, where the war is taking place. The film goes on to use a very clever transitional edit using a caterpillar track during scene whereby Reece falls asleep and dreams of the future to reiterate this: utopias do not exist.Digging a little deeper, and analysing some of the franchise's cod-philosophies to do with destiny; making the future what it is and not being bound to your fate, may very well reveal one or two more truths, but that is for the individual viewer. On the whole, and while I am unsure as to whether there is as much substance here as everybody seems to remember, ""The Terminator"" does very little of what it attempts to do especially badly, and I think that is what propels its lasting power.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Arnold Schwarzenegger is okay, but he isn't given enough to do in this first instalment to really make an impression.For the most part the film is good and watchable, but the screenplay and cinematography isn't as good as it could be. There is a lack of top tier theatrical sense and it feels dated even for its time.In addition the middle act involving a number of new characters is not interesting, and breaks up the tension and flow. The action is generic and not particularly engaging.What does work very well is the final act, where director 'James Cameron' sets the film alight and produces the best set designs and music score, leading to a satisfactory conclusion.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Shameful this film averages only an 8.0,"Prelude: I find the collective average score of movies on IMDb to be really good. Obviously, some reviews are more subjective than others. That's ok, different films appeal to different folks, for many reasons. Also, IMDb movie review averages really illustrate just how 'out of touch' RTs & other reviewers are.That said, this is an exception. Why is it that the horror and sci-fi genres (especially); automatically start out with a ratings disadvantage? It's as though their ceiling is 8 or 9 instead of 10. This is true.And the reason is, non-fans of these genres who view these movies, automatically lower the rating because of their aversion to these genres. My wife demonstrates this. In fact when I ask her why she gives ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" a ""3"", she simply states ""Because I loathe horror movies."" Then when I clarify, ""But Evelyn, compared to other movies like this, how good, how effective was it?; she'll then reply, ""Heck Bob, maybe a 9 or 10! It's really creepy!""It is rarely true the other way around. Fans of SciFi & Horror, typically also love Drama, Suspense, Action, Adventure, Fantasy & Romance genres as well. And hence, there's no blowing up of the rating curve on movies they reviews across those categories.I saw The Terminator by chance one evening (circa 1985), at home, on what was perhaps the prototype of premium subscriber TV. (I think it was ONTV, but it's so long ago I can't be sure.). And this was a special ""Premiere TV showing"".I had no idea what the movie was about. Never even heard of it in fact. Nor did I know it was Sci-fi. And the title sounded really dumb to me. Just the same, I decided to watch it.My future X-Wife/kids were in bed asleep, and I was by myself. After another long day at work, I opted to prepare myself a rather potent libation; a very strong triple Vodka with easy OJ. I sat down and settled in.So, to repeat, I guess I missed previews and nobody had ever mentioned it to me, because I had no idea what to expect. In fact, I had absolutely no expectations.Well, I was blown away. I was the edge of my recliner throughout (if that's possible.).And discovery of the terminator's true (cyber) identity, (well into the film), is done brilliantly.The movie locked me from the get-go.Arnie was still a nobody so that was cool.Linda Hamilton was a freaking doll. Heck, she still is today. Just love her.There is not just a clearly defined protagonist and antagonist, but a real hero matched against a sinister and essentially invincible enemy. An enemy almost as heartless as our current administration. Almost..I'm critical around casting and all players fit their role well.Even threw in a love story, one as unusual as it is fundamentally necessary. Gotta have a decent love story whenever possible.The action sequences are excellent. Much of the movie is a very well done chase and as such, locks one in. The direction is stellar throughout.This movie (along with Aliens for example), are among the most entertaining films EVER made, including movies outside the genre. T1 introduced effects never seen before. It was Cameron's breakthrough, and for good reason. It's legacy alone earns it a 10.

Everything Is Brilliant In Another Hit For Arnie,"Continuing my plan to watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1984 The Terminator.Plot In A Paragraph: A cyborg (Arnie) is sent from the future with one mission. Kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also sent from the future.To those that say Arnie can't act, I say watch this movie. He is TOTALLY believable as a non human!! I say that in jest of course, but it is his best performance thus far.He never could have took the role if Dino De Laurentis didn't release him from his 10 year Conan contract. He agreed, but asked Arnie to keep making Conans as long as they were profitable (Thankfully after the lukewarm reception to Conan The Destroyer, Dino never wanted to make another) and to make an action movie for him when he had a script. Arnie agreed, and was free to make other movies away from Dino.The $750,000 Arnie was paid for this was less than the $1,000,000 he was paid for the last Conan movie, but boy does it pay off. James Cameron is a genius, how all this came out of his head is amazing, and this is only his second feature film is beyond me. It's scarily brilliant. Everything is brilliant. The script is brilliant, the casting is brilliant, the performances are brilliant, the way it's shot is brilliant, Brad Fiedel's score is brilliant, Stan Wilsons special effects are brilliant, everything is brilliant.I've already praised Arnies performance, but Michael Biehn is also brilliant as the battled scarred, but brave Kyle Reece and Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor too. I can't fault a single performance in the movie.A few dodgy effects here and there, and the implausibility of the plot (I still can't get my head around how Kyle can be John Connors Dad lol) are not enough to ruin anything.In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how the role of the Terminator only having 18 lines worried him, he worried people think he was either avoiding speaking parts, or worse, most of of his dialogue was edited out because it wasn't working.He also discusses how bad the promotion was for this movie. They had it as a standard B movie, he says how Cameron begged them to change the strategy of it, but they would not listen to him!! They were only interested in promoting Amadeus. The movie succeeded because of solid reviews and good word of mouth.The Terminator grossed $38 million at the domestic Box Office making it the 21st highest grossing movie of 1984. Surprisingly neither was enough to beat Conan The Barbarian as a career high for Arnie at that point.In a way, it's lucky for Arnie, Terminator wasn't a giant blockbuster, as he may have been typecast as a bad guy.

An Important Action Film,"When it came out many people saw this film as a bad, low-budget B-move, and laughed at it. These people couldn't have felt very smart afterwords...The Terminator can be looked on two different ways: either it's a average sci-fi action film about a killer robot that goes on a killing spree, or it may be one of the best and deepest sci-fi movie ever made. I see it as the last one. Sure the action is great and Arnold as the terminator is just bad-ass. But I feel that it contains a message(or warning) that maybe technology moves at a speed that may cause it to harm us in the end. When you think about it, when this movie came out, many of the things in the movie seemed impossible. But now only 30 years later we are closing in on ""The Terminator"" future. In this age technology are used to make weapons more and more advanced, and we are already using robots on the battlefield(for example the predator drone).This makes me think, where will it stop (if ever), and will we in the end have made such powerful weapons that it exposes a threat to mankind... something to think about.I'll be back",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best thriller ever made!,"While people, specially directors, admire Hitchcock's thrillers, what we have here is pretty much an action thriller packed with more emotional firepower than any Hitchcock film. Its a classic film and obligatory for anyone who loves films to see.It is also a very 80's film: much like Back to the Future in terms of its 1980's feeling, though it is a very different film, one is a comedy while this one is a horror/action/thriller.The basic premise is also one of the best in the history of cinema: a time travel paradox is actually build up in the film in such a way that the ending fits the beginning perfectly.

"A dozen times, and it never gets old","And some of that is James Cameron's directing, but some of it is just a good story. Much better story, in some ways, than the one when the Terminator could morph into whatever shape he wanted, but that film had some good, scary scenes. And the end of that Termninator is really good film editing. But I like THIS one, before things got complicated!I know that part of the reason I like this, original one is that my oldest brother loved Arnold and would frequently say ""I'll be back"". And I suppose that's the line everyone remembers. And everyone remembers ""you are terminated"".My brother is no longer with us, but I think about him whenever this film comes on cable. Worth watching, if for no other reason than it's also the beginning of Linda Hamilton's career.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terribly outdated and overrated.,"""The Terminator"" (1984) is an overrated and dated sci-fi action flick that fails to deliver on its promising premise.The movie's low budget is painfully evident in its atrocious CGI and practical effects. The puppets are laughably bad, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's iconic face-hugging scene in the bathroom is downright embarrassing. The action sequences are equally lackluster, featuring unconvincing stunts and choppy editing.Beyond the technical shortcomings, the movie's writing is equally weak. The plot is cliché and predictable, the dialogue is clunky and forced, and the characters are underdeveloped and unlikable. The music is also a major letdown, failing to create any sense of atmosphere or tension.While the story itself might have had potential, it simply couldn't be executed with the technology available in 1984. The movie requires a high budget and modern filmmaking techniques to make the futuristic setting believable.Overall, ""The Terminator"" is a disappointing and outdated film that fails to live up to its reputation. Despite its cult status, it's a clear example of why futuristic movies from a certain era just don't hold up.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

James Cameron's Cybernetic Masterpiece.,"Cyborg - part human and part machine. Living tissue over metal inter-skeleton. Virtually indestructible. Unlimited memory capacity. And stronger than anything on earth.These are the specs of the Terminator - a cyborg sent from the future to the past - Year: 1984 ,Location: Los Angeles.Mission: to kill Sarah Connor, mother of John Connor: a leader of a resistance movement in the future and a main threat to Skynet.Skynet: an artificially intelligent system, a defense computer network built by the developed by the defense firm Cyberdyne Systems for the United States armed forces, which became self-aware and revolted against its creators.Under John Connor, the human resistance turned the tide on the machines and eventually destroyed Skynet's defense grid. In a last ditch effort, Skynet sent a cyborg, called a ""Terminator"", back in time to 1984 to kill Connor's mother Sarah before she would give birth to John.Protector for Sarah against the terminator: John Connor sent back his own operative, a young man named Kyle Reese, to save Sarah.Question is which one will reach Sarah first: The Terminator or Kyle?Schwarzenegger (who plays the cyborg) was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, ""Oh some sh*t movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.""In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.For the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the movie was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his ""feelings about the project changed"". Hurd stated that ""almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between (Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese). They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.""On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4,020,663 making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.After writer Harlan Ellison saw the film, he stated that he ""loved the movie, was just blown away by it"". Ellison believed that the screenplay for the film was based on the episodes ""Soldier"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" which he wrote for the television series The Outer Limits. Orion gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and gave him an acknowledgement credit in later prints of the film. Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that that if he did not agree with the settlement, they would have Cameron pay for any damages if Orion lost Ellison's suit. Cameron replied that he ""had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.

Typecasting?,"The perfect role for Arnold - an emotionless, musclebound robot who talks monotonously in a series of mono-syllables. Pity he thought that he could act after this, but on balance, I forgive him as this is one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever. Better than the sequel? In that respect it is similar to Alien/Aliens - the shift in emphasis makes comparison very difficult. Personally, I prefer to look at all four movies as classics in their own right.But give Cameron his due, rather than retreading old ground with his main characters, Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley are fully rounded and deeply affected by their experiences. No Jamie Lee scream queens here. Compare the burger-flipping waitress in Terminator with the gun-toting borderline psycho in T2.

Excellent sci-fi horror/thriller,"Who can turn down a James Cameron film like this? The Terminator (1984) is a classic on every level. The story was brilliantly written. The cast that was chosen for each role was done perfectly. The special effects, although very outdated by today's standards, still entertains and inspires the next generation of sci-fi filmmakers. And the music was an extreme role player throughout.The whole story itself is an enormous step in a new direction. At the time, no one was truly thinking about the possible downside to artificial intelligence. But who could have thought that machines could become smarter than humans and decide to take over? Well James Cameron did. The plot is so in depth with detail that it's hard not to become involved in the plot as well.Arnold Schwarzenegger being the choice of the Terminator was the best choice the casting department could have ever done. Not only is he good but he can be quite terrifying too. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was accurate because although she's scared quite often throughout the running time, she later becomes a much stronger individual. And Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese was a good choice too because he definitely acts and looks like a run down soldier looking to find a way to change the future that he came from.Stan Winston and his team of specialists provide the special effects and boy do they look great. With a mix of using puppetry and stop-motion animation, the entire look of the terminator is very interesting to watch. Not to mention that this thing can take a beating, either by its enemies or by itself! And the music by Brad Fiedel adds the final touch to the film. Fiedel makes the music have a sci-fi tone and whenever the terminator is on screen, there's a certain theme to it that gives it a very ominous feel. It's very creepy, but effective! It's surprising that director Cameron came to such glory from this movie after he directed such a sub-par film known as Piranha Part II: The Spawning (1981)!This is the film that launched director James Cameron into show biz. With all the elements picked out perfectly, The Terminator is bound to strike the right chord.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Dated visuals but still a good movie,Of the many great movies the 80s brought us few had more pop cultural impact than this one. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator is absolutely iconic and the premise of being hunted by a unstoppable killing machine still is as compelling and frightening as ever.What didn't age well are the special effects that are in parts so bad they really break the immersion. This film never had the budget its successor had and it sadly shows. Still I consider this a piece every one should have seen at least once if they are even remotely interested in sci-fi and/or action movies.

I won't be back,"I stayed away from this for thirty years but finally got fed up of all the people absolutely amazed I hadn't seen it and recommending it to me before it's too late. Well, it's fairly exciting enough as a low budget sci fi chiller, but does everyone really have to enjoy the same things? And judging by the music and special effects, in this case it's too late. Even if I'd seen it at an impressionable age such macho machinations were never my bag.An impregnable robot sent from 45 years in the way distant future to kill a woman who will have an important son, and another man from the future is sent to save herand unwittingly impregnate her too. Busy! The futuristic '80's music is as cheap, backward and laughable as Blade Runner's is, they also share a vision of an extremely grim future. The present is merely cars girls guns and mayhem after all. Schwarzenegger as the Terminator robot acted totally believably, and when reduced to the hilarious internal metal frame he acted with even more passion; but Harryhausen's stop motion skeletons in Jason & The Argonauts were as kittens in comparison. Made at the butt-end of the olde analogue age I bet director Cameron wished he could have done a Lucas-like Revision to it and rebooted it with cgi cartoonery for the special effects instead. However, the over the top violence was expected and delivered - the utter childishness of the multiple random killings only proves yet again to me how valueless some human film makers think other human beings lives are and therefore the contempt they must hold the audiences in. But I do realise you don't have to be in the Army to fight in the War, and most importantly this is mild stuff compared to nowadays.

White masculinity and a shoot 'em up,"Like the second movie, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, this one also has little value. Some may revere it culturally but they are clearly mistaken. It is a violent movie which showcases murder and White masculinity. I would never recommend this piece of trash to anyone.There's much more than this short paragraph to describe this film, however. This science fiction film, directed by James Cameron, has become a classic despite what I have previously stated. The horrid violence of this film is not the worst part, but rather than even the time travel to the past is not very interesting either. Other movies have much better forms of time travel than this film. You could say that film is, like the New York Times said when it was first released, ""B-movie with flair,"" or like the Pittsburgh Press and say it has ""artsy ugliness."" Both of those views have validity. I would add that this film pushed Arnold Schwarzenegger further to stardom and is one of the films is is most known for, not surprisingly.Otherwise, I don't think it is worth reviewing this film any further as I'd rather review more worthwhile films, with this film definitely deserving a rating of 1 out of 10, one of the lowest ratings I have ever given a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still holds up over 30 years later,"I just re-watched this movie; the last time I saw it was approximately 1987. For a 1984 production, this is superb science fiction. The Terminator, like Blade Runner, represents the best of the early '80s and even today has not really been surpassed despite decades of advances in CGI, digital processing, etc.The Terminator robot behaves more or less as one might expect. James Cameron is intelligent enough not to ruin the movie by anthropomorphizing the robot, in other words making it display emotions and behave too humanly. It's a computer created by computers, and acts accordingly. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at his physical peak and did a superb job conveying the sheer evil that this machine represents.Sarah and Kyle were well played. She was an ""average girl"" working at a busy family restaurant and dating mediocre guys in her spare time. We watch her grow into the strong soldier that she must become to defeat not only the Terminator but to raise a revolutionary hero who will save humanity.Kyle came across as a soldier who is very good at his profession, but has little exposure to the finer things, having grown up in a horrible post-apocalyptic world. He finally softens and opens up to Sarah, sparking a love affair that is heartbreakingly brief.You can enjoy the Terminator and simply ignore the fact that there are sequels. #2 is not bad, but quite superfluous and contradictory to the first movie in which it was made clear that ""no one goes home, and no one else comes through"" the time machine which was smashed by the humans. The first movie is an epic story and needs no sequels. But #2 is fun if you must see a little more Arnold-as-robot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

But even I saw R rated stuff like this, robocop and predator.In the 80's, no one coined as much catchphrases and kicked so much butt and killed many people like Arnold. Long before he was an old action star in the expendables, he was a hungry actor and after this, he will learn English and get muscular in commando.The first in a series of 6 chapters, follows Arnold

The Terminator: 6/10,"Arnold Schwarzenegger won't be known for his winning of Mr. Universe, etc. He's known for his phrase ""I'll be back"", which was made famous from The Terminator.He plays The Terminator, a cyborg who comes from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), an innocent waitress who doesn't believe Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) about that story. Reese also came from the future, but to protect Sarah from The Terminator, for reasons that come into detail later in the story.Schwarzenegger is fun as The Terminator. He only has about 10 lines to say in the entire movie, but I liked him in his futuristic role. Terminator is his most famous movie. It has action coming out the wazoo, but no real thrills. The 108 minute run-time seemed to go by quickly.The special FX, for 1984, were pretty good. Despite what it seemed, the exo-skeleton at the end was not stop-motion as it looked like, it was an animatronic puppet. The explosions looked real, so did all the shootings, and everything else. Biehn was very good as the guy from the future. He seemed to know what he was doing. I wonder why he hasn't been in much lately, though.Hamilton was good, too, as Sarah, but nothing to write home about. Terminator has set an example for others to follow in action movies. Many spoof movies have the ""terminator sight"", and say ""I'll be back"", and all the other catch phrases from the movie. I thought it also had some good places of humor, like all movies should. It is entertaining, also. The dreary look at the future seems almost farcical now, since we now know that there won't be a nuclear war around 1990.

"""I'll be back!""","James Cameron's 'The Terminator' (1984) is one of Cameron's many iconic films. This sci-fi action epic is about a human soldier sent from 2029 to 1984 to stop a seemingly unstoppable cyborg killing machine.'The Terminator' is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a MEGA movie star!This classic from the '80s offers a very rewarding experience with a great concept for the story!
Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator is absolutely fantastic. He really does look like a robot, excuse me, cyborg and he behaves accordingly! And oh, by the way, ""I'll be back""!Furthermore I totally have to commend the phenomenal visual effects that, to this day, still look fantastic! The make-up department obviously deserves a lot of praise as well for doing such a good job!Unfortunately there are also a couple of problems that I have with this movie!
I really don't like that there had to be a romance squished into this film! It was completely unnecessary and I just didn't buy it whatsoever! What made me even more frustrated was the motivation of our male hero, the reason why he went back in time. Absolutely preposterous!
Another thing I don't like about this film is that killing off the Terminator seems to be ridiculously hard. I'll explain what I mean by that in an example. This film has a typical movie trope that's been in movies since forever! Just when you think a character probably died, nope, he or she comes back to life! And then this character supposedly ""dies again"", but nope, not dead. And guess what, the exact same thing happens... AGAIN! And of course after each supposed death, there is a celebration and a relief. I mean I am sick and tired of this type of storytelling... at least if it is done to this extreme!
Finally I also had some issues with the pacing during a few scenes. Certain scenes were just too slow and really sucked the energy out of the film's flow, but for the most part, the film had pretty decent pacing!Overall, 'The Terminator' is a really fun and entertaining sci-fi action flick with a great villain as well as pure satisfaction for genre fans! 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
poorly paced,"This movie is iconic, a ton of references are made about it to this day and I love the intro song from the movie to the point I could draw with it on or something to get the right mood however this movie hasn't aged very well in my opinion. Sure this movie is close to 40 years old but these are many ways I didn't care for it.Firstly it's too long, it's poorly paced, some scenes could have been cut out entirely and not affected the movie at all to keep us from being bored and trust me there's a few of them. Though I admire James for having the credits in their own place, not just stamped over the movie while we try to focus on the story yet are curious who is in this.The action was very well done especially for the time in some regards. I love how as Reese fights against The Terminator he loses an eye and other stuff happens to that iconic last scene with him in it. The drive by shooting and everything. You can tell Jean Claude Van Damme was heavily inspired by Arnold's role in this when he did the far better ""Universal Soldier"" movie. Seriously go watch it if you haven't. It's everything this basic movie isn't.There are some great shots of LA, almost everything has this cold blue tint to it.The casting of Sarah and Kyle Reese were so terrible. It reminded me of Lisa and Mark from the movie The Room (2003), Sarah doesn't have the look and can remotely act but she's no super model which can be a good thing and Reese can't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Both of their hair styles are hideous. Reese's character isn't as believable as I'd want him to be. He doesn't have that look of an action hero or whatever we're supposed to believe he is. I can't take his voice seriously. There is an intimate scene in it which even I think Tommy Wiseau would go this isn't good. I'm not expecting stuff on a certain hub but still, 80s romance scenes are hilarious.The soundtrack consists of ""angry super nintendo"" music for the most part and it gets on your nerves how dull it is, yet sounds like that you'd expect from a movie in the future I guess because that is what mouth breathers expect in their crappy sci-fi movies.The only thing bad I can say about Arnold is when he fires any gun he blinks his eyes, yeah a robot would totally do that. He plays the role well. Though the claymation used would be laughed at today. The CGI for the terminator walking is so poorly paced. I see what virgin slayer 12 year old pro gamers talk about when they mention low frame rate now i think. Some of the CGI can look alright, again this movie was ground breaking but it should have came out a few years later.How they set this movie up for a sequel was lazy too though they did address a lot of stuff such as why they are naked when they travel though time.I honestly enjoyed going to the washroom more after finishing this dreadful movie, maybe if you were a kid in the 80s and nothing else was like this out at the time it would have been iconic but seeing it now and all the movies it inspired is like ""flooring it"" in a 1920s car to a car made today. Not even talking sports cars either.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best of the series,"T2 was good fun; the action and cool factor is way up there, but.... this, the original Terminator is the real deal. In fact, I'm shocked that it's rated lower than the sequel. We won't even mention anything after the 2nd film because they're just not worth it. They were for the kids. Now back to the film in question.We all know the story, so I won't bother with explaining it. What I will do is give you my reasons as to why I think The Terminator is THE film of the franchise.The Terminator is a much better character as a baddie, and as baddies go, he's BAD! Arnie nails it in the role which catapulted him into super-stardom and he is absolutely terrifying. Let's remember that while the action is still good, this is a 'horror' film, and while we can deem this inferior to T2, nobody will deny the atmosphere is superior with the original.The atmosphere is dark, filmed mostly at night in bleak and deserted areas of Los Angeles, with a music score by Brad Fiedel which will make the hair stand on end! You won't raise a smile either watching this, it's an intense rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. It doesn't make you jump like todays horrors, it in fact induces a slow feeling of dread, especially as the Terminator says very few words throughout the film and gives you the overall impression that it is one very evil thing that just wants to kill it's target no matter what..and that is scary!It's a good story too, because it's original. Apparently it came to director James Cameron in a dream, in the same way as Yesterday did with Paul McCartney.I'm not going to nitpick that Camerons depiction of the future was a bit off, because that's missing the point, it's a truly monumental moment in cinema history, and every sequel owes itself to this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The greatest claim to fame of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger,"The film that brought James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger to fame is a classic sci-fi action film that remains a marvel to this day. It has many elements in its favor and it is difficult to find fault. The cast is quite good, among the most notable, Linda Halmiton, Michael Biehn, Lance Henricksen and Arnold of course. A solid script with a good plot. Most memorable is the soundtrack by Brad Fiedel, whose main theme became iconic, and the special effects by Stan Winston, which are already an admirable relic. The Terminator is one of those 80's movies that is worth seeing again. My rating for this movie is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

1984 does it again,I don't know where to start with this classic. What an imagination. I gave this a 9. It was before its time but the character Kyle. He was very convincing.

And I watched the extras and it went over the cut outs and back lighting. They even made it look like they were running over skulls. Where in movies now its cgi and digital effects they had to really be creative. Arnold is great in this. But not his best work. Either way james made a master piece.

"Together with part 2, groundbreaking science fiction","I can't really discuss ""The Terminator"" without also discussing ""Terminator II.""  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays essentially the same character in both films, but in Part I he's a (really) bad guy, and in Part II he's the hero. It's a time travel story in which a humanoid robot from the future arrives in the present to murder a woman so she'll never give birth to a child who is destined to grow up to lead what to all appearances is an incredibly unsuccessful fight against humanoid robots in the future. And that's just the first film. In the second film the child is already born and another humanoid robot from the future, a spooky shape-shifter this time, arrives in the present to murder the kid, but a third humanoid robot (Arnold II), programmed this time to do good deeds, follows the bad robot to the present and tries to protect the kid and rescue the kid's mother who is in an insane asylum because she keeps insisting that robots from the future are trying to kill her. Did you get all that? I'm a sucker for a good time-travel story, and the next time this one's on TV, I'll be back. This is first-class science fiction  it's entertaining and it makes me think. (I also really liked Arnold in ""Total Recall,"" but I can never really work up an interest in watching it again because I can't make up my mind whether the story is taking place in the real world or in a brain aneurysm.)",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

You Will Sure Wish The Terminator is Back!,"In the not-too-distant future, machines rule the Earth and are locked in combat with a gallant band of freedom fighters led by their leader John Connor. Soon a murderous cyborg the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - a remorseless, relentless bogeyman with a bone- crushing steel skeleton and a soul-piercing red diode glare - is sent back in time from the future to kill the mother of the as-yet- unborn leader of the human rebellion. Back in present-day Los Angeles, his mother – a timorous pushover waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) - is unaware of her role in the struggles to come, until the arrival of our titular terminator, whose only purpose is to kill her and thereby change the future. Her only hope is a bashful guerrilla fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who has followed the T-800 back through time to prevent her death and evade any and all attacks from the killer cyborg, while gradually forming a romance with her throughout the mission to preserve her life. Can the Terminator track Sarah down and change the course of the future?The story is deceptively tricky: In comparison to today's packaged thrillers, this is a surprisingly vicious little film, filled with indiscriminate killings and a rough-edged feel that makes it utterly compelling. James Cameron's direction of the ensuing chaos is masterful, and the characterization of the violence has something agonizingly original about it. He manages to generate maximum excitement from the very first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the savagery but a well-written and taut screenplay with a nice eye for sharp detail that doesn't tend to drift off into the occasional ponderous bits. There's real heart and soul here, along with Arnold's best-ever performance - as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength. Hamilton's performance as the bewildered waitress who will unwittingly become the savior of the human race is terrific. Biehn shines as Sarah's knight in shining armor.The Terminator grabs us right away and carries us to the end with roller-coaster action sequences and clever time-travel twists. What it results in is arguably the best science fiction thriller of all time that throttles you with the air of a demented ballet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Great film and definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good?  Yes.  Great?  Hmmmmm...,"Is it heresy to suggest that The Terminator may be a tad overrated? That perhaps fans who so love the whole Terminator saga and mythology remember the original film as being a little better than it actually was? This low budget sci-fi action thriller is certainly an enjoyable film. And considering the franchise it spawned and all the other films it so obviously influenced it's also an important film. But does that necessarily make it a truly great film? Probably not. It's a good film, very good in spots, but there are enough things holding it back to leave it a touch shy of greatness.By now most everyone knows the film's story so a plot rehash seems rather unnecessary. In a nutshell a cyborg Terminator is sent back from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the as yet unborn human resistance leader who in that post-apocalyptic future will lead the fight against the machines which seek to exterminate humanity. Convoluted? You bet. Of course the Terminator has not come from the future alone. Human resistance fighter Kyle Reese has been sent back to protect Sarah. He must stop the unstoppable Terminator. Good luck with that. Shootouts and car chases and explosions ensue. Plot? Story? Dialogue? Sorry, don't have much for you here. But have I mentioned the explosions? Everyone likes seeing things get blown up right?As I've implied, after the story initially sets itself up there really isn't much of a story at all. The whole movie is one big chase. Certainly there are moments of great excitement but in between the big moments...well there's often not much. At times things are rather sluggish. But there's enough good stuff here to make this at least an enjoyable flick if not some kind of all-time classic film. Of course there are some very memorable characters starting with the Terminator himself (itself?), played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a stiff, robotic, inhuman, largely mute killing machine Schwarzenegger's perfect. I'm not sure if that says much for Schwarzenegger's acting ability but for this role in this movie who could be better? The Terminator doesn't have much to say but whenever he does speak you remember it. Seriously, it seems every line Arnold speaks in the movie turned into a catchphrase. Sarah Connor is a character who undergoes a serious evolution in the course of the film and Linda Hamilton portrays that wonderfully. From the sweet, innocent girl at the film's beginning to something else entirely by film's end Hamilton traces the character's journey terrifically. Schwarzenegger and Hamilton are remembered best but it may actually be Michael Biehn who gives the best performance of all as Kyle Reese. It is left to his character to explain to Sarah, and by extension to us, what the heck this movie is actually about. No small task that, making a truly preposterous, unbelievable story sound convincing. Now if you stop and think about that story you will realize there are plot holes large enough to drive an exploding tanker truck through. Time travel stories have their own peculiar issues. Paradoxes and all that. And this film's got a doozy of a paradox. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Even if it's not truly as great as it is generally remembered to be what it is ain't bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"This is Biehn's movie, not Arnold's","Why is it, that when people think about The Terminaor, they automatically think of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Well I for one, do not see this as Arnold's movie.  I see it as Michael Biehn's.  Now don't get me wrong, I think that Arnold did one hell of a job as the terminator, but i know that Biehn's Kyle Reese, gets far less credit than he's supposed to.This movie wasn't based on action, but rather plot, and acting.  Michael Biehn gives a greater performance as Kyle Reese, than any of the actors did with their parts.  We can see his tough character of the future trying to make it in the relatively calm world of the present.  Kyle also gives the best lines in any of the terminator movies.  We can forget one-liners and concentrate on Biehn's powerful speeches.  Stuff like, ""That terminator is out there.  It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.  It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.  And it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.""  And, ""Nobody get home.  Nobody else comes through.  It's just him...and me.""I especially like, ""Why didn't you bring any weapons.  Something more advanced.  Don't you have any ray guns?"" ""You go naked.  Something about the field being generated by living tissue. Nothing dead will go."" ""Why?"" ""I didn't build the ________ thing!!!""I can't explain it, but for some reason, Michael Biehn is my favourite actor.  He's played the best roles.  Like Kyle Reese, Corporal Hicks in Aliens, Hirram Coffey in The Abyss, Johnny Ringo in Tombstone, and major roles in Navy seals, and The Rock.  He's by far the best ""soldier"" style actor in Hollywood, and has one of the best portfolios in the business. Remember his name, for it's not as big as it should be.

Scary sci-fi,"I first saw TERMINATOR on a hotel room TV in Washington, D.C., with my wife and young daughter. I would say the film thrilled the heck out of us and probably scared my kid half to death, but the fact is, we were in a brightly lit hotel room and the TV wasn't particularly large. I know we were bowled over by the police station sequence and the final chase at the very least. This is one of Ah-nuld's best roles, and director James Cameron knows how to keep things moving along on a shoestring budget. The scene where Ah-nuld must deal with a partially ruined face is unforgettable. T2 came along a few years later and put the original to shame, much like ALIENS did to ALIEN. But if it were not for THE TERMINATOR, where would we be today? A groundbreaking sci-fi thriller, loosely based on a TV program and very old short story, by the way, neither of which is credited, as I recall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

John Connor also sends someone back in time to protect his mother.It's interesting to see how much Sarah ( Hamilton) developed through the films.

The Terminator: A Disappointing Time-Travel Tale,"Despite its iconic status in the scifi genre, ""The Terminator"" left me underwhelmed. While the film's concept of a relentless cyborg assassin from the future is intriguing, the execution feels dated and lackluster.The special effects, which might have been groundbreaking in 1984, appear clunky and unconvincing by today's standards. The pacing is uneven, with some scenes dragging on too long and others feeling rushed. The characters, particularly Sarah Connor, lack depth and development, making it hard to connect with their plights.Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the Terminator is iconic, but his limited dialogue and robotic performance can come across as wooden and monotonous. The film's dialogue, in general, is often clichéd and uninspired.While ""The Terminator"" has its moments of tension and action, it ultimately falls short of being the thrilling, thought-provoking experience it could have been. Fans of retro sci-fi might appreciate it for its nostalgia value, but for me, it fails to live up to the hype.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is science fiction gold,"Terminator (1984) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a young lady looking for her direction in life when a mysterious man appears and tells her she's the savior of all life and needs to go on the run with him. Initially she doesn't believe him but when a ruthless man starts hunting them down armed to the teeth she decides running rather than staying put may be a good idea.This movie is directed by James Cameron (Titanic) and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Running Man), Linda Hamilton (Dante's Peak), Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead), Michael Biehn (Aliens), Bill Paxton (Frailty) and Dick Miller (Gremlins).The storyline for this is very unique, fascinating and intricate. The action scenes were way ahead of their time, especially the mirror scene and any scenes with robotics. Arnold was perfectly cast as a menacing, overbearing character that seems unbeatable. The shootouts, crashes and chases are science fiction gold.Overall this is an all time great movie and American cinematic gold.

From those opening notes until the very end it is an enduring favorite.I suppose it is the height of '80s science fiction camp. Not exactly an elegant aesthetic but a rich and captivating one where the narrative over flows with masculinity and toughness.Say what you want about Schwarzenegger, but he is perfect as the relentless killing machine that cannot be reasoned with and cannot be stopped without a miracle.The action sequences and gun fire are exhilarating and the cinematic execution is heart stopping well thought through. This movie was indeed a work of passion even if it may not exactly be high brow.The only thing I can really be negative about is the awkward use of puppetry but somehow Cameron manages to make you want to invest feeling with the right type pf humor and the right type of pathos along the way.The ending always just makes me want to applaud and watch the sequel right away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

My stab at a review,"As there are over 140 posts here, I doubt that this will be read by many people, however, I'll get my thoughts off my chest anyhow.I liked the Terminator, being a big fan of AI stories (especially Isaac Asimov, the famous SF writer). As with many movies, especially low budget cult movies, there is always room for improvement. As the saying goes, however, hindsight is always 20/20. The film was dark and contained a brooding (though primitive) soundtrack based on repeditive percussive beats, matching the systematic mechanical nature of the machines which were the 'enemy' of the film.Many SF readers may be familiar with Asimovs three laws of robotics:- 1. A robot must not harm or by inaction allow harm to come to a human. 2. A robot must obey all orders given by humans, unless these contradict the first law. 3. A robot must protect itself from harm unless this contradicts the second and first laws, in order of priority.Many of Asimovs stories were based around both the single mindedness of the robots, and their potential danger when these laws were not installed within them. The Terminator allows the viewer to experience a robot governed by totally different laws, of which, protecting and serving humans is DEFINANTLY NOT one of them. It opened the prospect of artificial intelligence emerging on an unprepared and undereducated world, and developing its own motives and desires, and deciding that human beings are an impedement to these desires (See Terminator 2 for an explanation of these desires - when you hear it, you almost feel sorry for SkyNet, the supercomputer which creates the terminator).Arnold Schwarzenegger has become much more accomplised as an actor over the years, and is quite reasonable now (see the Sixth Day). However, back then, he was quite stiff. This fit the role of an awkward, aggressive robot extremely well, especially with that intimidating scowl permanently fixed upon his face. His then strong Austrian accent, does not impede his performance, but actually seems to enhance it in some sort of subliminal way. Perhaps watching all the old war movies where the Germans were the baddies (the Nazi elite etc...), has something to do with this.The prospects of a Terminator 3 bring me a lot of hope, however I expect a lot of disappointment after discovering who the scriptwriters were. Any computer user will puke when they've seen 'The Net' - one of their 'acclaimed' works. Perhaps a wait of five years and a REMAKE of the first would be more appropriate. It might open the avenue to another tough guy actor playing the Terminator. Let's face it - Arnolds not getting any younger especially with the heart troubles and there's nothing sadder than an aging muscleman.The film, at first, appears to be a tough guy film, especially with the overbuild '4 wheel drive' physique of the younger Arnold Schwarzenegger appearing at the start of the film. Whether it was intentional or not, James Cameron did the film credit by slowly revealing the nature of the Terminator (Arnolds role) as not a tough guy villain, but a very dangerous mechanical device with a totally narrow minded intent to kill the heroine of the movie, Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton). This leads to the end where, the terminator, stripped of its outer covering of cloned flesh, is revealed to be the warmachine it is. The metal skeleton covered with hydraulic muscles is an artistic masterpiece. The scene in the factory, although done with basic stop frame animation, was the one which most impressed me. This would look fantastic if done by computer animation, and lets hope a remake will be made.The second movie, although very imaginative in parts, was disappointing in terms of script (though not in action and visual effects). There were many recycled themes from the first, such as the tanker chase, the mimicking to Sarahs mother/John Connors Foster mother. There are many more similarities which I'm sure you'll find. James Cameron is an imaginative director, and I think he could have done much better. Why couldn't the T-1000 have a more complex role? For example, instead of going gung-ho for little John Connor, it could in secret, construct terminators in the present time and send them after the Connors one by one.The character change of Sarah Connor from the first movie to the second was a little unsettling, although novel at the first appearance. I didn't find the fact that she had turned into a hardlined semi-sane dragon woman very believable, after the performance of the vulnerable young woman she gave in the first.Like I say, I don't expect much from T3, although, with some better scriptwriters, or some advice from some accomplished science fiction writers (say, Steven Baxter, Arthur C. Clarke, Poul Anderson), a very clever plot could make up for the shortcoming of making a sequel of a sequel. I hope I am pleasantly surprised. After all Aliens (by James Cameron as well) was an excellent sequel to Alien, although not quite as good.

Wow,"A strange man comes to the earth from somewhere. We all think he is crazy, because he does not wear any clothes. He has much power, and people can't fight against him. Some women are killed by him, and one lady is being target of him even she does nothing. Is she alright? Who is going to save her and stop him? This story is very thrilling, but has some emotional parts. I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also does not smile at all. When I thought of the time that this man comes to the real word, I could help feeling fearful. However, this happening is never occurred in this world, so I could enjoy watching the film. On the other hand, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people. One more thing I was surprised to see is that there are some grotesque scenes in the film.

Good but more as a average film not great,The Terminator was a good movie but it was not great it was more of a average film though the direction done by Cameroon was good but it was somewhat boring at some places.The acting was good and the tech shown in the movie was good Arnie was good as a Villain but not great the supporting actors were just OK.The concept is good but I think that the sequel wants more work to outdo this one I liked it but I think it has to come with more weapons more techs after all it's a Robotic movie man.They had tried hard to make this good and I appreciate them at some places but I really don't like the chemistry between Kyle and Sarah the bonding between future and past come on!! It showed the son has sent his father gimme a break man.Show more Robotics and action and concentrate on your concept.It was forgettable but OK quite a entertainment only because of Arnie.Arnie rocks !!!,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Terminator,"I'm pretty sure everybody got a clue of what ""The Terminator"" is about. The year is 1984, A terminator (Arnold) is sent from the future to prevent John Connor being borned. John Connor is the leader of those who fight against the terminators. The terminator's job is then to hunt down the mother of the leader, Sarah Connor. But then, sent by John Connor, Kyle Reese. His mission is to protect Sarah from danger.The film is relatively exciting, but somehow i lost the tense and the excitement when i got deeper into the movie. People have been talking about it and said it's really good, so i actually thought i was about to watch a masterpiece.In my opinion, The Terminator is far from a masterpiece, but it's far from bad too. I mean Arnold did some decent acting, but then again he does play a robot. And the movie had 'some' Special FX that would even look good today. When i said 'some' i really mean it. Because most of the Special FX looks pretty lousy today, but i'm not going to judge the movie from that.So to conclude this whole ""review"", if you like. I didn't really feel the movie. I understand completely how it must have been back in '84. But i'm living in a society where the audience demands are pretty high. So with all this concluded i can simply say that Terminator isn't a bad movie, but it isn't that great either. But it gives a pretty good picture of the future i guess.7/10 A good, not great, not excellent, but a good SCI-FI picture...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

It all begins here.....,"The first time I watched ""The Terminator"" was around 1988 and was blown away with ""action meets sci-fi"". Needless to say it quickly made its way into my Top-3 list translating into multiple/ frequent viewings. When I caught up again recently, I found that ""The Terminator"" manages to hold the same charm and novelty as it did decades ago.Sarah Connor became a synonymous name. Arnold Schwarzenegger had yet another feather to his cap. ""The Terminator"" literally catapulted James Cameron into the big league, sort of Spielberg with his passion for science fiction and pushing the limits for CGI. Needless to say when he announced a sequel, fans waited with bated breath.The direction and CGI by 1984 standards was well ahead of its time, no sluggish or choppy feel to it. Background score elevated the action sequences and the signature tune went to attain cult status. The narrative ensures edge-of-seat excitement.

Great Storytelling: A Little Bit Of Everything,"Time-travel. Science fiction. Visions of the future. Action/Adventure. You name it, and ""The Terminator"", one of the most genre-diverse films ever made, probably has it.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins in the year 1984. Out of thin air, two individuals suddenly appear and are searching for the same woman: Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). One man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) wants to protect her. The other, a machine simple known as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to kill her. As the story unwinds and the chase continues, we are introduced to an intriguing storyline involving time-travel and the fate of the planet.Simply stated, this movie remains a classic to this day because it tells such an engaging, interesting story. It balances the time travel and sci-fi aspects with real-life drama and action. There is a little something for everyone.This was the movie that made the name James Cameron famous, and one can tell that he put a lot of effort into this undertaking. He tells a story that is actually too big (technically-speaking) for it's britches, as it is now obvious that copious amounts of either CGI or plastic were used to create some of the effects. Instead of dating the film, though, these little anachronisms actually give it a bit of gravitas. It was as if Cameron wanted so badly to direct this story, but had to rely on sub-standard equipment to ""get the job done"".Overall, ""The Terminator"" is an 80s classic. It is now kind of stereotyped as ""I'll be back"" and ""just a shoot-em-up"" chase film, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go back and watch it again, and I promise you'll be equally impressed with the storytelling ability. That, at it's core, is what makes this movie relevant 30 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Come with me if you want to live,"'The Terminator (1984)'In a world where artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming inescapable, the potential dangers of this technology have never been more pressing. It's a topic that's been explored in countless movies and books, but few have done it as well as ""The Terminator."" With its harrowing vision of a future dominated by machines, James Cameron's classic becomes more relevant today than it was nearly four decades ago.Whilst ""The Terminator"" is commonly shoehorned into the Sci-Fi Genre, it transcends that label to become something much more. Its a perfect amalgamation of styles - a chilling horror undertone spearheaded by an unstoppable, emotionless killer that eclipses even Michael Myers. Spliced with breathtaking action sequences that stand the test of time, and dropped into an unbeknownst 1980's Los Angeles scene to create a dystopian epic feel that matches the despair of 'Blade Runner'. By combining these diverse genres, ""The Terminator"" becomes a masterpiece.In a post-apocalyptic dystopian future - where humanity is at the mercy of tyrannical supercomputers - advanced teleportation technology is utilized to send T-800, a cyborg assassin, known as the ""Terminator,"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the year 1984. The Terminator's sole objective is to eliminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn child is destined to lead a rebellion against the mechanical overlords of the 21st century.Meanwhile, the human resistance movement dispatches a solitary soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), to safeguard Sarah in an effort to prevent the extinction of mankind.Can this lone protector successfully thwart the virtually indestructible killing machine, ensuring the survival of humanity?The film thrusts us straight into the action with an ever-imposing Terminator setting out on a deadly mission to eliminate all women named Sarah Connor listed in a phone book, and after swiftly dispatching the first two, he sets his sights on the real target. Sarah is thrown into a terrifying world of danger and uncertainty, unaware of the dire consequences that await her if she falls into the cyborgs clutches.Reese begins his mission at the Tech Noir night club in downtown LA, tasked with protecting her - 'come with me if you want to live' - Sarah must place her trust, and her life, into the hands of Reese for her own, and humanity's sake - she just doesn't know it yet.Praise must be given to James Cameron for his direction - he never lets too much time elapse without showing the Terminator. This keeps the T-800 firmly in our mind, as though Reese and Sarah are only a step ahead of him. The pacing is superb, it does a great job of telling the story amid the chaotic action unfolding in the background, and keeps you hooked for the entirety of its 107 minute run time.The action scenes, like the tense car chases and the police precinct shootout, are followed up nicely with just enough exposition to demonstrate why Reese's mission is so important to the future of humanity, without being impeded by bloated, unnecessary dialogue. Every line has purpose, and Cameron wants you to know that what his characters are saying is important.Visually, no other actor could pull off what Arnie manages in his outing as T-800. He is physically menacing and imposing, and demands your attention whenever he is on screen. Speaking only 17 lines throughout the entirety of the film and not even as much as flinching when shooting double barrelled shotguns or tearing a punk's heart out with his bare (cyborg) hands - Arnie perfectly embodies the emotionless, determined machine. Everything and anyone that isn't Sarah Connor is just an obstacle to be thrown aside or shot in the head.Of course, being made on a very modest budget of only $6.4 Million, The Terminator's special effects do show their age. A scene of the T-800 repairing his face requires a noticeable Arnie mask which appears quite rubbery and unrealistic, whilst the stop-motion-esque portrayal of the mechanical skeleton during the climax of the movie appears less menacing the more you see it. Not saying the Terminator model looks bad - its exposed teeth and glaring red eyes remain iconic for a reason. But it just goes to show that even James Cameron - the visionary of Avatar's Pandora and the T-1000's liquid metal effects - had to start with low-grade tech at one point.Other than a small gripe over the aesthetics, it is near impossible to find much to complain about when it comes to The Terminator. The camera work is solid, the set pieces iconic and Cameron manages to give the condensed story a feeling of grandeur. Linda Hamilton turns in what is, to this day, still her greatest on screen performance and personifies a convincing 'waitress to world saver' character arc.The supporting cast supplement the protagonist's journey well, Michael Biehn turns in a good performance portraying the PTSD stricken wreck of a man in Kyle Reese who is only way too familiar with how badly things could turn out if he fails in his mission and Paul Winfield, as pragmatic cop Traxler, voices some of the films limited humour.'The Terminator' has securely fastened its place in the 'all time great' lists in the last 40 years and it will likely be an even longer time before another idea as original and simultaneously scary as the T-800 hits our screens.As we continue to grapple with the implications of artificial intelligence in our own lives, ""The Terminator"" remains a powerful reminder of the potential risks and dangers of this technology, and the need to approach it with caution and respect. Whilst it appears that A. I. is light years away from humans succumbing to a Terminator-style apocalypse, it is a worrying thought that one day a T-800 will be hunting down your name from a phone book (or more likely your Facebook page).9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Marinetti's Hero,"A few way cool things to talk about:Every time a machine works right down to a wheelbarrow, it changes everything. It deeply alters and affects experience, and in time the new experience dictates its own logic and vision. You simply cannot fail to appreciate, for instance, the tremendous opening up of vision enabled by the automobile invention: new borders to the world, radically new impressions of seeing (in-car), the new span for knowledge, experience and time, and how that reprograms everything, like how far you can travel to court a woman and spread your genes. We are all being rewired these days by this internet thingamajig.One of these new roads paved (in part) by the automobile was an Italian movement called Futurism. Those guys took to rapturous, often combative appreciation of everything new about technology in the 1910's, fascinated by mechanics, speed, industrial noise, the precision of gears (which they hoped to express in art). Incidental to that was their fervent support of war, in their view nature's machinery for cleansing itself. Ideas from there seeped to the newly formed Soviet Union, and melded with Marxism found cinematic expression in guys like Dziga Vertov: if you don't know, he was up to some pretty radical things, looking for machine-like precision in the gears of vision.Flash forward - sixty years later. Roger Corman's factory is one of few places where film is an actual assembly-line. Sets, shots, effects, they're all interchangeable parts cheaply recycled from one b-film to the next. A young James Cameron is tutoring there. His focus is strictly on making devices work, function above art. This is nothing like the computer-generated effects we have now, those days it was a job you did with your hands and KY jello. He's one of few talented guys working for Corman, a real workhorse. He's so driven, the story goes that he flew all the way to Italy to fight producers over control of the dreadful Piranha gig.So here's Cameron's start in the business, the first time he was in control of both mechanical parts and the overall machinery of camera and vision. The idea reportedly came to him while in Rome, a single image: a metallic endoskeleton emerges from flames. This could be his way of denying the Harlan Ellison influence, but either way. You can imagine the incredible , primeval allure of that vision to a practical man like him; it must have been high pleasure of the scope of a naval engineer caressing with his mind the steel hull of a new submarine.And this is what the film is about, a craftsman's vision of what he does. Mechanism.Oh, there is a story of nuclear wars and time travel from a bleak future. There is a love interest and actual scene of lovemaking. But, all of it is mechanical on the human end, simple cogs. It's sketched quite clearly in the film; the film flags when we stop to have story explained to us, until we return to the exciting precision of function of the Terminator plot. The function is strictly violence, Marinetti's exhilarating futuristic war meant to cleanse the world of rotten humanity, and all the other Futurist tropes, the obsession with cars and speed, with gears.Central among the gear is of course a machine that is spliced into the world to bare its mechanism: rods, gears, voice emulator, repair skills, ruptured silicon skin reveals electronic -camera- eye. The accompanying Terminator-vision might as well have given video games their start in first perspective.Everything else is only incidental to the machine, only skin dressing for it to be presented in the world of humans and storytelling, to cross into our world from Cameron's workshop.Cameron does well, except one thing. I lament that he wasn't introduced by someone to Texas Chainsaw the way Scott was in preparation for Alien. It is not the roughly same genre of the two films. It's learning from Hooper's accomplishment of violent energy purely channeled and sustained in the fabric of the film, no stories asked.And everything we learn about that future is simply nonsense - my favorite bit is that machines have marshaled men in forced labor of disposing their own!Imagine the same film without a story of explanations, a bit like the first Alien. Two men have come back from god knows where, one a machine. The rest is tension, darkness, gears, heavy metal.The machine is only defeated by another machine, human-operated.Instead of going Vertov's way, Cameron would go on to attach despotic overambition to those clumsy storytelling skills - a mechanistic approach to narrative and 'message'. His cinematic machine worked, years of dedicated Corman practice made sure. And it changed everything, further tunneling our vision.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The best of the bunch,"I recently rewatched this modern masterpiece, and felt compelled to write down my thoughts.While most people agree that the excellent T2:Judgement Day is the superior film, I would argue that this often overlooked first part is even better!Schwarzenegger is at his career best here as the menacing Terminator. Before building his ""cool"" movie star persona, he portrayed the creepy cybernetic killer with tremendous dedication to the craft (learning to fire without blinking, learning to reload without looking at the weapon, letting the production shave off his eyebrows for a crucial scene - though not before having them insured) and character choices like the now iconic ""scanning"" where his eyes move before his head.In fact, the cast are all excellent. Michael Biehn brings a great deal of vulnerability to the film's time travelling hero, Linda Hamilton is wonderful as always, and the supporting cast are all likeable.The future sequences are brilliant and terrifying, and the time travel story is easy to follow and never indulges in pretentiousness despite its bittersweet ""twist""The choice to shoot most of the action at night gives the film a unique ""noir"" flavor. The action is thrilling and the pacing is pitch-perfect, a fantastic showcase of James Cameron's ability to tell a story and keep the audience on the edge of their seats despite the comparatively low budget when put next to the rest of his filmography.If I was forced to find fault with The Terminator, it would be that some of the special effects have aged poorly. But with the exception of a few shots of the ""Arnold dummy"" and the stop motion towards the end, most of them still look very impressive.This movie is as close to perfect as an action thriller can get.

"Arnie is cool as the bad guy, in this classic 80's action film!","It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg - a terminator - back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease.The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J. C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"The little B-movie that jumpstarted James Cameron's career, solidified Schwarzenegger as a leading man, and launched a massive franchise","In 1984 Los Angeles, two beings from the future of 2029 arrive via time travel. One, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cyborg killing machine intent on hunting down Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will someday give birth to John Connor, the leader of the human resistance who defeats the machines. The other is soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who has volunteered to protect Sarah Connor at all costs. At first Sarah doesn't believe the stories Reese tells her, but overtime finds herself trusting him and the two begin to fall in love as they elude the Terminator.The second directorial effort from James Cameron, Cameron had made a name for himself on a number of Roger Corman productions such as Battle Beyond the Stars or Galaxy of terror where despite a limited budget and using things like McDonald's coffee cups for parts was able to create memorable locations and impressive visuals. During the production of Cameron's directorial debut, Piranha II: The Spawning (which Cameron has disowned citing the Italian producers interference) Cameron had a dream of being chased by a metallic skeleton which served as the initial inspiration for what would become Terminator. Following a long drawn out production process with which producer Gale Anne Hurd was instrumental in seeing to fruition, the low budget B-rate sci-fi thriller became a sleeper hit in its Halloween debut and ended up doing much better than the high profile killer robot film Runaway despite having a higher profile cast and director. The Terminator is low budget high intensity filmmaking at its best.Much like John Carpenter's Halloween, the core of the movie is in Linda Hamilton's performance as Sarah Connor. Much like Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, Connor is just an ordinary person trying to live her life despite often dealing with clumsiness, lateness, and forgetfulness at her job as a waitress, but we see a bit of ourselves in Sarah Connor as this ordinary person in an extraordinary situation and the arc she goes through in the movie where she eventually becomes more hardened and has to save herself and embrace her destiny in being the literal mother of humanity's salvation. Michael Biehn is very good as Kyle Reese who plays the battle hardened solider quite well and his drive to save Sarah from an unstoppable killing machine makes a solid protagonist we can root for, and the love that develops between Reese and Connor is very well done. Then of course we have Schwarzenegger as the Terminator known as The T-800. Despite only speaking 17 lines in the movie, the cold robotic tones with which the Terminator speaks during his killing spree make him a memorable antagonist as there's no expression in the terminators face and instead only an intense level of inhuman focus. While the movie does play The Terminator as a threat, the movie still allows for some solid moments of dark humor such as a scene in a gun shop with character actor Dick Miller, or Schwarzenegger's ""I'll Be Back"" which sees its first usage here in what would be a running joke throughout his films and career.Despite its low budget, director James Cameron creates a solid vision of both the war-torn future and the dark and harsh present. The movie takes place primarily at night and Cameron gives the film that same gritty and harsh aesthetic that Walter Hill got from the Warriors or William Lustig got for his films such as Maniac. The lighting and cinematography is very ""noir-ish"" and makes nighttime Los Angeles a character itself. The war ravage future and its various elements (including the Terminator) are well done with a mixture of composite shots, stop-motion, miniatures, and animatronics to create bleak and memorable sights especially in its climax where the Terminator reveals its true form. While the effects aren't always convincing with some of the composites and effects showing ""seams"" here and there, they're still very solid in terms of what they were working with.The Terminator takes a lot of elements and combines them into an entertaining film. While the movie works as a high intensity action film, it's characters and its hinted time travel paradoxes give the film a solid head on its shoulders that compliment the action and effects.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
masterpiece,"I just watched the second half of this movie on my cable channel - and although I had seen it before years ago, watching it again, in light of Terminator 2 and 3 having now been released, you realize that a) although it didn't have the budget or the special effects of the two sequels, it is still an extremely tense and watchable chase movie and b) the 3 films put together compliment each other and the whole Terminator story snaps nicely into place.T2 was a great movie, and I've seen that many more times than T1 - probably just because of the fact that it's shown on TV more often. It's interesting now to be able to comment in retrospect on the movie that led to the making of one of my favorite action films.The most noticeable thing about this movie, I thought, was how different Linda Hamilton's Sarah Conner was compared to the battle-hardened road warrior she was in T2. It's really weird to see her all frail, distraught, and FEMININE even, in this movie. 'Are you sure you got the right person?' she asks Kyle Reese, at one point in the movie - 'I can't even balance my cheque book!'. But of course, it is this first Arnold Schwarzenegger and this first Terminator that eventually turns her into the warrior she will be. This movie, because of its lower budget, is less glossy and less polished than its sequel. However, there is more 'grit' in the original as a result, and the effect is a darker, more atmospheric movie. Whereas T2 is an action-thriller, you could probably say that T1 is more of a horror movie - the make up they used on Arnie in the movie certainly wouldn't put him out of place in a Hellraiser, or Nightmare on Elm Street movie!As for Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, I think these two were truly excellent - the acting is top notch - much, much better than in either Judgment Day or Rise of the Machines. The Terminator movies are, of course, mainly about a Robot/machines, but human characters never play second fiddle in the story line - indeed, I think it is the personal relationships formed by the humans which make the movies so good - in T1, it's the passion between Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner. When they fight for each other and desperately shout encouragement at each other, it propels the move forward and gives it a certain intensity. You find yourself rooting for Kyle and Sarah, you want them to survive, and god damn it - you want Kyle to break off the Terminator's metal skull with that iron rod in the final scene! In T2, the human aspect is John Conner teaching Arnie how to 'be' more human. The moral of T2 is that if a machine which is designed with the sole purpose of killing, can be taught the value of human life ('you can't just go around killing people!') - then why can't us humans also learn this? The relationship formed between John and the Terminator is what grounds this movie, and gives it the weight needed to elevate the quality of this sequel above that of the usual hum-drum, mass-produced by the movie studios on an almost weekly basis. In T3 - well, actually, I think the 'human aspect' in the film was actually missed, and it paid the price - it's definitely the weakest in the Trilogy by a long way. While watching T3, I didn't really care what happened to the characters, and it all felt quite lightweight and superficial compared to the first two movies.Well, I guess this 'comment' has really turned into a spiel on the Terminator movies as a whole - but nevertheless, the original is arguably the best movie of the three - it's got the right atmosphere, the better characters, the Terminator theme played on a keyboard (as opposed to a synthesiser), 'I'll be back' said without a knowing verbal wink at the audience, and of course, if it wasn't for this movie, Governor Schwarenegger wouldn't be where he is today, signing graduation diplomas for the students of California.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A lean and stylish sci-fi thriller,"I just saw The Terminator for the first in many, many years. And boy, it still works magic. Of course; some special effects look a bit dated and the soundtrack has (apart from that killer main theme) some cringeworthy 80's vibes to it. But apart from that T1 is still one hell of a sci-fi action thriller. It surprised me how lean and efficient the narrative is. Great storytelling.

Aged poorly,"I am aware that ""The Terminator"" will always be in the hearts of all the kids who grew up in the '80s, and that despite the low budget it managed to introduce fresh ideas, inspire hundreds of films and create a solid blend of sci-fi, horror, and action. However, I can't deny that it aged pretty badly. It's still quite entertaining as it's fast-paced, straight to the point and with a good atmosphere, but everything has been made better in other films. The Terminator character has been built around Arnold Schwarzenegger's stiffness and inexpressiveness, and it works great for this film.

A landmark moment in sci-fi/action cinema.,"A big, bad-ass cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels back in time to try and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), mother of the man who will—in forty years time—lead the human race to victory in a war against computers. Only one man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future, can help her her to stay alive...The Terminator, the film that rocketed James Cameron to A-list director status, and gave Arnie his most iconic role (the one which saw him coin his catchphrase ""I'll be back""), is such an accomplished piece of action/sci-fi in almost every department that, even after 25 years and many, many viewings later, it never fails to impress me.A top notch cast (which also includes Cameron regulars Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton), excellent Stan Winston effects, and a terrific score by Brad Fiedel, combined with Cameron's flawless handling of his material and Schwarzenegger's suitably mechanical performance, all adds up to one of the finest movies ever made. Whereas many time-travel tales invite the viewer to search for paradoxes, I find that this film moves at such a cracking pace and delivers all the adrenaline-pumping action I'm after, that I never stop to worry about such trifling matters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Nostalgia glasses,"People will probably want to burn me on the stake for this, but I think I know why Russian TV showed this movie maybe like 3 times since mid 90s. It's not a good movie, as people seem to believe.I have not watched it till 2024, even though I've seen the sequel multiple times and really liked it. One of the reasons was that original 1984 film was not popular on Russian TV, and it a few times, that I did see it in TV program was at very late hours, like after midnight, when I was sleeping (normally). So I finally got a chance to watch it and see what's the fuss all about.It's not good. The modern term would be ""cringy"". Yes, I know that it's supposed to be ""creepy"", since this is a horror/thriller, not an action movie, like all the sequels. But it's not ""creepy"", it's ""cringy"". Poor actor performance, poor sound (although that may be understandable considering age and low budget), not that gripping of a story, really.Looking back at what other movies I saw as a kid, I can understand why ""The Terminator"" might have been seen as a good one in 1984. It definitely has a bit more attention to details and somewhat better atmosphere compared to a lot of B-movies of the time. The premise was unique, too, so no surprise why it affected the industry the way it did. But if you watch it today and think that this is ""the best sci-fi movie ever"", you are probably even older than me and looking at it through nostalgia glasses.""The Terminator 2"" became more popular and affected the industry even more, becoming a meme, exactly because it was a better movie. It has its own things, that one could criticize, including the fact it went the ""action movie"" route, but action-oriented story-telling simply works better for the premise. ""Horror"" suits ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" waaaay more, because you need to survive while being hunted by a creature, that you can't predict at all, and that has ""superpowers"" in one way or form (unique physiology or unique tech).

Very Original,"The first time I saw this movie, I was 7 or 8 years old, a little too young to see a movie like that. Well, if a child saw a movie, it's automatically scarier, because a kid can't see immediately if it's real or not. I'm now 16, when I saw this movie 8 years ago, it was a very scary movie, and actually it still is scary after all those years. So that can only mean one thing: It's a great movie, and it is. If I compare it with its sequel, this movie has a darker and moodier atmosphere, and it's more original than T2.. If you have seen both movies, you can see that T2 inherited a lot of its original. And Arnie as the bad guy (excellent performance by Arnie), that was the best thing, he carries the whole movie by himself, no one else could do this role better than Arnold, because he was just perfect. He doesn't have to say a lot, but that's one of the most effective points of its character. Other points is his cold-blooded appearance, just ice-cold and no emotions at all. Great job, Arnie!!James Cameron has made an excellent sci-fi movie, with a very original story, a good cast and good special effects for a movie out of 1984. He really keeps the suspense in it, it never goes away, because you never know when The Terminator will strike again. With the story I have to say that it really opens your mind for the future, because what happens in that future, COULD happen in real life(So watch out for every machine in your house, you never know). Did you know that this movie had a budget for only 6$ million. James Cameron really showed me what you can do with a small budget like that, he made one of the scariest movies and one of the best sci-fi movies ever. A real classic and its sequel too, so my advice is: rent both movies or buy them, either suits me. But definitely see it.8/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This time he actually did come back...,"Being a pre-teen back in 1984, it was inevitable not to get familiar with all the action movies of the 1980's. And the 1984 ""The Terminator"" starring none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger definitely was one of the biggest action movies of the mid-Eighties.I am very sure that everyone is familiar with the ""Terminator"" franchise and the plans of Skynet. But for those of you not yet familiar with the franchise, this 1984 movie, which started it all, is about a cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from 2029 back in time to 1984 where his mission is to terminate Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines. But the humans of 2029 has managed to send back a single soldier (played by Michael Biehn) to prevent this from happening.There, essentially the entire story wrapped up with a handful of words. Despite its simplicity, then there are layers underneath the storyline which adds lots of flavor and detail to the story and the universe of the ""Terminator"" franchise. Things which will come to be realized and utilized in the later movies.For a 1984 action movie then ""The Terminator"" was just off the charts. It had great special effects, heaps of non-stop action, and best of all it had Schwarzenegger. It has all the ingredients that a good action movie need in order to be successful. And you must agree that the ""Terminator"" franchise has been successful throughout the years since 1984.Director James Cameron does what he does best here, and that is putting together a riveting action movie that grabs the audience by the you-know-whats and doesn't let go before the end credits start rolling. James Cameron really has a talent for memorable action movies.The cast in ""The Terminator"" also really had a lot of credit due for the success of the movie. Anything that Arnold Schwarzenegger touched in the mid-Eighties was bound to be an action success. And alongside him in this 1984 movie stood Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom put on equally good performances and held the level of Schwarzenegger formidably.""The Terminator"" is one of those types of action movies that never grow old. Sure certain effects are hopelessly outdated by what Hollywood dish out today, but they were really great back in 1984. And the effects do serve their purpose well enough, especially given that this movie is driven by a mixture of story, character and effects.Lots of action and lots of one-liners, ""The Terminator"" is an entertaining movie that is well-worth spending 107 minutes on watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Kind of dated today, but still entertaining","It's easy to figure that T1 wasn't make with the same kind of budget than T2. The futuristic scenes at the beginning looks pretty cheesy!

Or the little love affair that grows bigger even though there's a killing machine going after them. And of course the police sirens when everything's finish. In how many movies have we seen that.But still, The Terminator is a good movie. Arnold is very good, even though I can't say the same for Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. The Terminator is not a classic, but it's entertaining nevertheless.

Glorification of Violence and Cruelty -- Terminating Future,"The story is just an excuse to accomplish what is indicated in the title. Schwarzenegger the soulless killing machine is the only superstar, everyone and everything else is a pale supporting cast. The story takes place in 2029, the movie is from 1984, so now we can tell it didn't hit anything from the future. Except for one, humanity's growing hopelessness about the future. The script is full of nonsense and goofs. Except for the ""clever"" move that all the cruelty and suffering in the not-yet-hell world of 1984 only takes place in order to save a guy's life in the hellish world of 2029 where no people are worth living.The film presents the two most harmful clichés. One is the brainwashing-like suggestion of a horrible future. Dystopia has been obligatory in science fiction since the 1980s, and prevails so strictly that no dictatorial censorship can compete with that. For 40 years, sci-fi has been pushing thousands of terrible visions of the future in a brainwashing fashion. -- However, a number of studies prove that these projections work as self-fulfilling prophecies: whatever visions you develop, live and act according to them, you fulfill them yourself.The other most pathetically stupid and aggressive cliché in the film is that machines and artificial intelligence (the Martians, the more developed aliens etc.) will obviously destroy or at best enslave humanity. That the more intelligent, the more evil and vice versa. -- The opposite is true. Evolution and destruction are opposites of each other. Of course boring idiots of power over all can annihilate life on earth and all the interesting things -- but no way I give them more stars than 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A career highlight for Cameron and Schwarzenegger.,"Filmmaker James Cameron had already showed a real style and vision when working for Roger Corman's special effects and art department, also learning well how to shoot fast and on a low budget. Here his talent and experience paid off with this breakthrough film, truly a model action picture with its unflagging pace and intensity level. It moves forward quite well while also remaining coherent, telling an interesting story that owes a debt to not only the works of Harlan Ellison, as is credited at the end, but Michael Crichtons' ""Westworld"". Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a credible star performance as the title character, a cyborg sent to 1984 from the future by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. It wants to ensure that its primary human enemy, a man named John Connor, is never born, so the terminator is sent back in time to assassinate his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Fortunately, a protector for Sarah is also sent back, a sensitive soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese will have his work cut out for him not only trying to keep Sarah alive, but convincing her that his wild sounding story is indeed reality. ""The Terminator"" has incredible atmosphere, in both its present and future scenes, and has some wonderful eye popping visuals, not to mention fantastic special effects work by Stan Winston. Brad Fiedel's music score is catchy and iconic, but sounds even more haunting and effective when it's done as a simple piano melody. The editing (by Mark Goldblatt), art direction (by George Costello), and cinematography (by Adam Greenberg) are all first rate. The movie does date itself in certain ways (fashion styles and music), but that merely adds to the appeal in this viewers' humble opinion. It's also not wall to wall action, as it takes some breathers here and there, and is really quite touching in some of its quieter moments. The casting is spot on all the way down the line. Schwarzenegger is perfect as the relentless killing machine, especially as the role doesn't require a lot of dialogue, the under-rated Biehn does a nice job of selling his character and the material, and appealing Hamilton does a fine job with her character arc as Sarah changes from being kind of a mousy person to being more take-charge. The excellent supporting cast features such reliable people as Lance Henriksen (who's a hoot), Paul Winfield, Rick Rossovich, and Earl Boen, and there are some wonderful bits for Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, and Dick Miller. Cameron and co-writer / producer Gale Anne Hurd inject the film with a decent dose of humour (such as the terminator cycling through various possible responses to a question) that never becomes too prevalent. ""The Terminator"" is simply one of the best films of its kind, and its impact on pop culture (including Arnolds' best known cinematic one-liner of them all) is undeniable. A must see for sci-fi and action lovers. Followed by three sequels and the 'Sarah Connor Chronicles' TV series. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Relevant more than ever,"30 years down the road, James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" remains an enthralling science fiction thriller, perhaps now more relevant than ever. By now nearly everyone would have heard about how Cameron miraculously made such an excellent film on a miniscule US$6 million budget or so, or perhaps how the eponymous character turned bodybuilder- cum-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into literally Hollywood's next big thing. It is a testament to Cameron's genius into crafting his unique vision despite and because of his budget limitations, and perfectly casting his stars to suit said vision.We all know the drill by now, so let's talk quality. Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah so well as a normal young woman, confused by this sudden chain of events, that she has logically no choice but to buy into Reese's story. Michael Biehn fits Reese to a T with a gruff yet youthful look, a perfect look for a determined soldier fighting a war he wants to end badly, despite his limitations. Though it's under a relatively short amount of time, Cameron takes his time for the audience to really get to understand both Sarah and Reese's predicaments – to have characters to root and care for, to see them find a way out despite the odds. And a romantic twist is added by Cameron that surprisingly doesn't feel forced, yet somehow perfectly (and ironically) completes the time travel loop that secures John's existence. We're dealing with a romance that transcends both time and space, and Cameron handles it so well, he would revisit these romantic traits with greater detail in his future megalith ""Titanic"".What makes the film work more than it should is Cameron's genius in casting Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. A former Mr. Olympian, Schwarzenegger is renowned for his sculpted body – straight out of a Greek stone garden – more than his acting prowess. No matter, his manner of speaking less, and frighteningly intimidating stare clearly unnerve the hell out of audiences, and they still do today. Say what you will about Schwarzenegger's career as an action icon/live-action meme, the man still has a stare that can kill. His strong, iconic Austrian accent works wonders with the machine-like delivery that Cameron was intending. With Schwarzenegger's casting, the stakes are higher for both Sarah and Reese to escape this monstrosity.Because time-travel is involved and explained in an easily digestible way (physics be damned), and because Cameron directs with such efficiency and confidence it might as well be made today, the film has aged exceptionally well despite some cornball stop-motion effects that show off its low budget – all due praise to the late Stan Winston though for his remarkable, if not grotesque, make-up effects and design that add to the sheer horror aspect of the film. It is a testament to Cameron's genius that he has managed to combine great talent both in front of and behind the camera, into creating one of the seminal and memorable films of the '80s decade, and one that will spawn a successful sci-fi franchise with a dedicated fanbase. Make no mistake that the basic framework of ""The Terminator"" essentially represents a B-movie at its surface (Cameron did tutor under B-legend Roger Corman, after all), but Cameron pulls off more tricks up his sleeve. There is a lean, mean atmosphere that permeates each scene throughout, making 1984 Los Angeles seem like a lurid fever nightmare, but that's secondary compared to the hellish, poverty-stricken future he has envisioned for us humans. Brad Fiedel's metallic, iconic score seeps through every alley and night- painted street with a sense of dread and gloom, the synthesized, electronic score complementing Adam Greenberg's cyan-tinted, industrial cinematography to make it feel all the more nightmarish.Most people back than would have balked or be amazed at a wireless internet connection for everyday use, as if we are surrendering our will to technology for it to take over our lives. And I'm seeing it being endorsed in many a commercial or article. Is the development of technology a bad thing? Not at all. But a good servant can be a bad master, especially if left out of control. Cameron had a fear of that, saw the vision, and ran with it all the way. If we were to leave our household chores to artificial intelligence, or the military leaving unmanned drones to scour the battlefield, what's there to say that eventually artificial intelligence would be used to secure nuclear weapons? Or that they might even become sentient - Cleverbot and Siri may be precursors to Skynet, and Japanese technology is developing robotic humanoids that can deduce for themselves in the near future. The war shown in the film may take place in 2029, but Judgment Day can still happen. Better never than late, I say.""The Terminator"" may be surpassed by its immediate successor in terms of scale and action sequences, but this is a leaner, meaner film, and its initial allegory remains superior and more clear-cut; in the realms of science fiction it remains unmatched, as a bleak reminder of the future and technology gone wrong, perfectly represented by its unstoppable, merciless eponymous monster of a character, but also that of humanity's undying spirit to create their own fates. Cameron might have come a long way since then, having helmed two of the most expensive and highest- grossing films in history back-to-back with some truly groundbreaking visual effects technology implemented in both, but this only highlights his original, cautionary vision for the future, one that we are all far too willing to embrace wholeheartedly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Terminator review,"Fantastic film! my favourite film of the 80s along with Robert Zemeckis Back to the future. One of Arnold's first films as a professional Actor, and his most memorable role. With James Cameron directing, this is definitely my favourite film of his by far. Most people think that Terminator 2 is even better than this one. But for me, this beats it every time. I love Terminator 2, but i thought that it dragged out a lot longer than this film. This film was the perfect amount of time for a film to be running without getting boring. And leaves tension all the way. I used to be inspired by The Terminator when i was younger, and I'm pretty sure it was my favourite film at one point. Arnold Schwarzeneggar does such an amazing job as the Terminator, it's unbelievable. I know James Cameron tried to make him look cooler as the guardian in Terminator 2, but in this film to me is as cool as you can get. With supporting acts of Linda Hamilton (Sarah Conner) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese) the whole film is a complete blow-out! Schwarzeneggar was perfect for the role of The Terminator, with the size that he is, the one thing i didn't like with Terminator 2, is that he was the half the size he was in the first one. I know it was 7 years after the first one, and he had stopped bodybuilding, but still i think he should have been the same size as in the first one for playing a Terminator. With Terminator 2, it had a clever concept, and is probably the most well though out Terminator movie of them all, with Robert Patric playing a new style of Terminator. I think the first one if slightly better because it was Cameron's original idea for a film, and plus i think if you are playing a Terminator you need to be a considerably big and intimidating size like Arnold was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Nobody goes home, nobody else comes through. Its just him - and me","The Terminator is definitely one of the best Science fiction films ever made. A lot of people argue on which film is better Terminator 1 or Terminator 2, but in my opinion the first Terminator film is the better film. Although Terminator 2 (also 3) were fantastic films with better action scenes and special effects than the first Terminator film, what I prefer about the first Terminator film is the good acting,(especially by Kyle Rees/Michael Biehn) sense of depth and storyline that the other two sequels lacked. What all three Terminator films had in common were that they had elements of Science Fiction and action in them, but what the first Terminator film had that the other sequels didn't have was that it had a romance element. The romantic side of this film is how Kyle Rees travelled back in time to meet Sarah Connor(to save her from the Terminator) and falling in love with one another, while conceiving their son John Connor during their short time together. This film is quite similar to the film 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour for that film is also about a man who travels back in time to be with the women he loved.The whole concept of how Kyle Rees was sent back in time from the year 2027 to the year 1984 to save Sarah Connors life from the Terminator and then impregnating her with John Connor (the Future Saviour) is a mind boggling concept. Where does it all begin and end? If Kyle Rees from the future didn't go back in time to the year 1984, John Connor would never have been, but yet it makes absolutely no sense WHATSOVER, that Kyle Rees could be his father considering the peculiar circumstances - however he was his father for unexplainable reasons. The story just goes round and round in circles. In answer to how John Connor was Kyle Rees' son was that the original John Connor from the year 2027 wasn't Kyle Rees' son as he was somebody elses son. When John Connor sent Kyle Rees to the year 1984 to save his mothers life from the Terminator, Kyle Rees accidentally corrupted history by impregnating Sarah Connor with their son John Connor, who of which wasn't the original John Connor. When Sarah Connor found out that she was pregnant with Kyles son, she mistakenly assumed that her unborn child was the saviour John Connor from the future - when he wasn't. The real John Connor would have been a son that she would have had with another man(In a different parallel universe) who of which was never born, for Kyle Rees prevented her from meeting him because he changed history by telling her about the future - as this somehow prevented her from meeting the father of the real future saviour John Connor and bearing him as there son. Thereafter the alternate John Connor who was conceived from Kyle Rees became the new future Saviour only because his mother prepared him for it and because he wanted to live up to his mothers death wish. Its all quite complicated; the whole sequential repetitive cycle of Kyle Rees going back in time to the year 1984 and then another 44 years passes to the year 2027 and then Kyle rees travels back to the year 1984 is a never ending cycle, as its an infinite cycle that goes round and round in circles forever. The first cycle of the original undisrupted John Connor who sent his Sergeant (not father) Kyle Rees to the year 1984, was in fact the only undisrupted future history cycle that happened. However, every other time travel sequence that goes on and on forever in time travel circles that occurred after that original time travel cycle, was in fact the disrupted time travel cycles with the alternate John Connor in a new and changed parallel universe - this is as explained all due to Kyle Rees accidentally altering history. Considering the alternate John Connor took over from the original John Connor who of which got erased from time all due to Kyle Rees, one could say that the original John Connor never even existed - but yet he did! He lives in the lost dimensions/parallel universe of time.As this film is Science fictional, romantic and action based it caters for many types of viewers, whether you're a love-sick girl/ women, a person who is action thirst or just somebody with a good imagination for imaginative people, like myself, do tend to love science fiction films.Anyway, if you haven't seen this film, I strongly suggest you to watch it, for this film is non stop action, has great film atmosphere and had a great and original storyline",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Terminator,"This movie is a classic. All thanks to Jim Cameron. In my hUmbLe OpInIOn this movie is criminally underrated. People look at T2 for it's effects and story. But hey, nothing, and i mean NOTHING, can beat THE TERMINATOR",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An action/sci-fi story that defined a genre,"Some actors are defined by their most iconic roles, for better or worse. In the case of Arnold Schwarzenegger, it can be argued that his portrayal of the Terminator was the pinnacle of his career, and 1984's film by the same name marked the genesis of everyone's favorite cyborg assassin.James Cameron's 'Terminator' was a completely new, groundbreaking story told in cinema. While the special effects are somewhat laughable nowadays, they really were impressive back in 1984. The story itself was pretty pedantic, but that wasn't the main draw to begin with. Instead, it's the mix of suspense, action and Schwarzenegger's delivery of one liners like ""I'll be back"" that steal the show.But it's not just the Arnold show. Linda Hamilton gave her breakout role and is able to transform the mostly average Sarah Carter into a tough chick who must fight for her life...literally. The performance given by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sort of overlooked, but should have more reverence attached to it given the amount of screentime he had and the importance of his character.'The Terminator' is not the best entry in this franchise, but it certainly marked a strong foundation to build on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I'm confused a bit (Director's Cut Review),"I start with cons, cause there are too many. During watching i felt indifference. I didn't spent any time with each of characters(i don't really know them) so how can i be with them, share their emotions? All we know and see is kinda formal, Kyle emotional speech(on nature, in the morning) feels like outta nowhere. And also this 2 minute instant love looks strange. I can't relate to Sarah also because she don't act rational, she kinda simple and not really smart(okay, maybe it's my personal reasons), but do not forget about what i said before ""we do not really know these characters"". Well, if Kyle as simple as he looks, we can assume that we know him, but again, we have no idead about the certain events of his life, we didn't see him much among people to grasp his full personal portait. And even when we see the future, we are not that impressed by effects of that time to fully believe in dangers of war, moreover it looks both boring and unreal(in sense that you don't feel like it is happening for real), very much like action scenes. Lore is kinda simple and not intriguing. So we can come up with the conclusion that this movie has not many things to offer to the viewer. But now to the pros: shooting is quite good, Arnold acting Terminator is convincing(though it is not a simple role), overall acting is authentic, we do not just hear that Kyle is a soldier but we see every aspect of it( war flashbacks, raws, his slim body, his fighting skills, he is not afraid, he don't really pays attention to his wounds(and also not used to think abouth not critical pain), when soldier from future can knock out policeman without using hands), Terminator looks terrifying, decorations is good, movie itself aged not bad(unlike Star Wars 1 or 4 or any before the new ones). So, for the attention to details and caring i'll give it additional star, but i can't rate this film any high. If you not that of true cinematography lovers or art lovers, yeah, many people say the are, but, in fact, nearly no one is. If you think that Nolan Batman movies are good, you probably like it very much, but actually it just reflects your absence of atteintion and taste(no offense, but more or less my ratings and reviews(my approach to rate and review) aimed on minor audience that wanna see something really outstanding, or unconventional or spent their time not bad in the worst case). But here is the thing, Terminator 1984 as enetertainment or let's say ""good time spent"" and it is not art.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Genius in so many ways that it's indescribable,"They just don't make movies like this anymore. Terminator, and Alien, sound to the modern ear as some silly summer blockbuster movies, with all the sequels, prequels, cross-overs and whatnot which have downplayed their image. But what many people ignore is that the first two movies of these franchises were pure 80s (approx.) sci-fi gold, and better ; acknowledged masterpieces in general. Even today, The Terminator is original, exciting, scary and pretty damn hardcore from the first scene when the robot encounters the punks, to the succession of cruel massacres perpetrated by the insensitive killing-machine Terminator throughout the movie.It is hard to express just how perfect The Terminator is in terms of plot and character development, and chilling atmosphere, which keeps the spectator clinging to his seat all the way. The opening sequences of the movie ; a brief explanation of the apocalyptic future war, the filthy appearances of the two main antagonists (Terminator and Kyle Reese), contrasted with the simple 80s jolly life of Sarah Connor before hell breaks lose, is a lesson in movie making on how to forcefully grasp the audience's attention and involvement. And when you think you can start relaxing, the booming action starts again even stronger, and greater, until the final act which leaves you gasping for air. This crescendo in suspense and horror is found in a later Cameron film, Aliens, which blatantly bears the director's signature style seen in The Terminator.The special effects were pretty ground-breaking and innovative at the time (something which can apparently be said for almost every Cameron movie since), but what really pulls it off is the incredibly bleak and dirty atmosphere, and of course the great cast. I couldn't possibly imagine other actors than Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton for the lead roles. All the secondary characters are also fantastic. The Terminator carries a distinct 80s feel to it which I like a lot. I wasn't born when this movie was released, and was brought up mostly on 90s movies, but I must say that the 80s feeling of The Terminator adds to its ""charm"" (if I dare say so). Nonetheless, it has survived the test of time exceptionally well, it doesn't pass as outdated at all - the climax is still genuinely frightening.The fact that Cameron, at the time a newcomer, managed to direct this sci-fi masterpiece, and went on to direct sequels to both Alien and his Terminator which practically equaled if not surpassed the originals in quality, marked Cameron as one of the best new directors of his generation.The Terminator is a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
35 years on and The Terminator remains fantastic storytelling.,"This movie's still got it: punchy action, great techno-music adding to the 80s charm embedded in the production, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatest cinematic performance as The Terminator himself.The Terminator is part-thriller, part-body-horror (via the T-800's disregard for its own flesh and eyes), part-neo-noir, all adrenaline-infused action telling a story of survival and desperation. It's a multi-genre and self-contained masterpiece that captured everything special about cinema in the 80s; and it's the film that catapulted James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into Hollywood stardom.This film's always been a favourite of mine, and it's still great rewatching over and over again. It's just one of those movies that you can keep rewatching and find something new almost every time you rewatch it.Hollywood can keep trying to make a sequel to this and Terminator 2; it doesn't change the fact that the first two Terminator movies are incomparable classics of the sci-fi genre.Is there anything about this movie that hasn't already been said? I'm not sure, but I can say that this movie's had a wonderful impact on people's creativity, and modern Hollywood owes a lot to this humble film and James Cameron.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One Hell of a Thrill Ride!,"So I am watching this movie right now on AMC and it took me back to when I originally saw it. I was in college in 1984 and I went to see this film with a good friend of mine. It grabbed my attention from the opening credits and would not let me go!I had seen Arnold in a few movies so he was familiar. His performance was perfect. The adorable Linda Hamilton is terrific as the scared ""mother of the future"". The story is creepy because 26 years after it opened the concept of a machine man is believable.

"""I'll Be Back.""","The Terminator is very much a thinker's movie. The plot is that in the future there is a war between humanity and machines. The machines send back a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill a waitress named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to the future leader of the human resistance John Connor. Humanity sends a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah from the terminator. But Kyle is only human and therefore not as powerful. It has good action scenes but it's also very much a thinker's movie. It brings up questions like ""Are we going to destroy ourselves?"" and ""Will technology outgrow humanity?"" It brings up these questions which I seem to think about to this day. The best part of the movie is the police station shootout, where Schwarzenegger says the famous line, ""I'll be back.""

Good film,"Good film. The scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute.

"Just a Masterpiece, nothing less","Terminator (1) is a sci-fi/action/noir movie with a straightforward storytelling about time travel, indestructible killer machine, and everything that was 80s all about.Cool Pop/rock Disco musics, 80s fashion, the electronic dark soundtrack reflecting the overshadowing story prior scenes which take place mostly in night-time, blue/red neon lights and lasers, love scene between two desperate yet heroic characters (but not in a cheese way, no sir). Everything is just perfectly lined up, telling a very dark story which holds its apocalyptic atmosphere throughout the movie from start to the end. You just smell the 80's all over the film, leaving you in such territory of feelings that today's movies cannot give, they just can't. The time travel concept suddenly becomes one with the movie's antic factor, as this period of our history presented here is no more, even if people are desperately trying to bring us back in time with their nostalgia today, no effort is enough to give us the real feelings as this movie does.""Burnin' on the third degree""; ""You can't do that to me""; only the choice of music gives the right view to Cameron's sense of conceptualism, reflecting the cool and innocent Sarah suddenly grabbed by an unfortunate, overshadowing sorrow, as the Terminator comes to terminate her for actions that haven't even occurred from her view. Then ""Pictures of you, from another time and place"" puts Kyle Reese into this concept as he held the one and only photo of the woman of importance, Sarah Connor. Besides all this the seemingly unavoidable dark future paints the sonic foundation to the whole soundtrack, its futuristic, robotic, and deadly, but most importantly; overshadowing.The story elegantly emerges prior the scenes, built around the dark tension the movie is based on, giving the right informations at the right time in a really fast yet healthy phase.The acting is also spot on, especially Linda Hamilton's natural talent manifests itself in any kind of scene, let it be action, drama, horror. This also applies to Michael Biehn, even though there are some almost ""not that good"" acting from his part, however these are rare moments. And of course there is Arnie, with his muscles and plain face, that are quite enough for a part like THE TERMINATOR itself.With these elements above Cameron managed to create something so perfectly pure, that it just puts his latter movies look so below class. The Terminator 2: Judgement Day that came after this maintained the quality the Terminator 1 embraced, yet it couldn't remotely bring the same tension and atmosphere that the original movie had, however anything else was brought to the next level by which the movie Terminator 2 - from technical point of view - is still up to date. Terminator (1) relatively has some effects which can be considered out of date, however this immediately drops out of equation as we bring up the artistic quality of its, that couldn't and cannot be outdone by any kind of Cameron's latter productions. And that is the kind of quality that I hold most dearly.Terminator 1 is easily the best in the series, that can be watched more times than any of the sequels.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best action movies of the 80s!,"This movie is something of an enigma to me. It comes from an era in the history of film where a lot of really bad movies were made. Especially sci-fi movies suffered a lot of indignities (not counting Blade Runner, Aliens and the two Star Wars movies made in the decade) but also good action movies were quite far apart. For this movie to be a success in both genres is quite something. This is James Cameron's first masterpiece.Acting wise the movie is nothing short of excellent. Arnold Schwarzenegger produced the role that would turn out to be his signature role in the terminator. His acting is wooden, stiff and very emotionless which is of course perfect as he plays a robot from the future and even though he was outmatched villain wise by Robert Patrick's T-1000 in the sequel he is still very memorable in this movie and the ""I'll be back"" line is one of the most memorable of the 80s. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor and creates a very likable, vulnerable and at the same time strong character and you can't help but sympathize with her. The strongest performance in my opinion is that of Michael Biehn who very unjustly never became a really big name in the movie industry because his performance as Kyle Reese is everything movie acting should be about. His character is both very strong but at the same time emotionally crippled. The way he plays the role with the exact right amount of desperation is pure genius. Lance Henriksen is critically underused in his role and unfortunately doesn't have enough screen time to really create a lasting impression and that's a shame.The effects and action sequences are remarkably well construed, breath taking and exciting. James Cameron proves that he has a flair for action with this movie and even though the effects are dated they still somehow hold their own in a time where computer effects are dominating action movies. Especially the ending is very thrilling mainly because of the editing which basically makes the ending. The stop-motion elements of the movie work remarkably well, once again because of the editing. The film also uses full size puppets molded after Arnold's face and body and because of the lighting (and again the editing) you barely notice the change between real actor and puppet. Brad Fiedel's score has a very 80s feel to it and is practically the only thing that is not timeless about the movie.All in all The Terminator is definitely one of the best action and sci-fi movies of the eighties and indeed any age. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. Don't think it's just another Schwarzenegger movie, it is so much more.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.""","There used to be a time I thought the sequel blew this movie completely out of the water, because it's bigger and more epic in scale and the action is a lot stronger, but this is one of those films where it gets stronger with every re-watch. There's always something I pick up on every time I see it.The Terminator is an unrelenting experience to say the least and the whole premise of this where an almost indestructible machine only has one thing in mind, to kill you, and will stop at absolutely nothing to do it, is terrifying. It is such a simple premise, yet the way James Cameron writes and directs these characters makes this film almost perfect in my eyes.Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner is a much more grounded and vulnerable character in this film compared to the badass she would become in the sequel. In fact, she was completely unrecognisable to me once the second film roles on, yet it never feels far- fetched she would become this way because of how good the character development is in this film. You see her gradually become the soldier she is truly destined to be and all of it feels real. Plus, you've gotta love that mullet :)Michael Biehn as Kyle Reece is terrific in this film and again he also feels like a grounded character. In fact straight away it's impossible not to see the vulnerability of the character when you see all the marks and scars all over his body as he comes through the time portal. He is completely outmatched by The Terminator he is assigned to protect Sarah from so he has to out smart it. You see that life as a soldier in a post-apocalyptic world where man fights machines, is the only thing he has ever known in his life, and there's a lot of great flashback scenes that really emphasise that point so effectively. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn share great chemistry together as well, I really did buy the fact they loved each other despite the fact they only know each other for a day.Of course, how could I not mention Arnie as The Terminator. He's another one of those badass villains that has very little dialogue, but you you feel the intensity amp up every time he's on screen. To say he is a presence would be an understatement, he is friggin' scary as a villain because all he cares about is killing Sarah Conner... that's it, that is the only thing he was sent to do and he stops at absolutely nothing to do it. It is just so intense, when you see a scene where Kyle shoots him multiple times, and all it does is buy some time. And it just returns to the deadly game of cat and mouse.There are only brief fleeting moments where the film allows you to breathe. There is not a single scene in the film where I felt like it was filler or just there to kill time, it is a tightly edited masterpiece of cinema that just never lets up. It doesn't dumb itself down so that its more accessible to the audience either, there's a good 45 minutes or so where you don't know why this thing is targeting Sarah, or why she is so important and it doesn't matter because the film allows the atmosphere to take over. When she does find out why she's being targeted, it never feels tacked on, forced or drawn out with exposition.I would not change a single thing about the story or the characters in this film. There are one or two effects in this such as the 'eye' scene are dated by today's standards, but given the films budget was only $6 million, significantly smaller than the blockbuster sequel, there's bound to be a few dated scenes here or there, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's still something about that final scene with the stop motion exoskeleton that just has my skin crawling. It is such an intense final act, that had me gripped right to the end! It is a filmmaking achievement and one of my favourite films of all time :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Terminator succeeds on many levels,"Those of you who have not seen the movie, stop reading here and go rent or buy the video, since I allude to the ending.  The Terminator succeeds on many levels, many of which have been commented on by other viewers.  In general, I think this movie is distinguished by one of the most original and compelling story lines to ever come out of Hollywood.  An aspect of the Terminator that has always fascinated me is how it presents the idea of machine against human and machine against machine, and on a deeper level, how humans can both benefit and suffer from the machines they create.  The most compelling aspect of the film for me is how the Terminator is presented: a machine with only one main function, that of killing Sarah Conner.  Even though the robot needs to utilize a number of complex maneuvers in order to carry out its function, its sole purpose boils down to that one thing.  That's what Kyle Reese means when he tells Sarah that the Terminator doesn't feel remorse and absolutely will not stop, ever, until she is dead.  How fitting, then, that the only thing that Sarah is able to use to stop the Terminator is another machine that is even more remorseless than the Terminator, an industrial hydraulic press that knows only two commands, ""up"" and ""down"", and, like the Terminator, ""absolutely will not stop, ever"", until it is down.  There are many additional fascinating aspects to this exceptional movie that have been amply covered by others on this site.  I rank ""The Terminator"" among the top five science fiction movies of all time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A bit of Sci-fi classic film,"Rating-7/10The Terminator, the name emits a kind of weird thought of Arnold Schwarzenegger or maybe the name John Connor(usually pronounced in an Austrian accent). Whatever Terminator themed thing that comes to mind, this film will no doubt leave you feeling well enjoyed and engaged, in a way that many action films just fail to do.The film is interesting, and again you don't always get that from action movies but the Sci-fi is good enough to combine with the good action to make this exciting and very fun. I found this intriguing in a sense, the story is kind of predictable then also un- predictable at the same time, and that makes it both humorous yet very serious and the suspense is well done too. The ending is the best part about this, this gets better as it goes along and for me the very end is one of the most exciting moments in this entire movie.You know Arnie is the best remembered actor of this film, but not for good reason, sure he is good but don't forget about the others here though. Michael Biehn is firm as Kyle and he makes the serious moments, just that bit more serious. Linda Hamilton isn't always great here, probably the weakest of the main ""good guys"" but she still acts kind of well, just maybe not the best for a leading actor. The cast is picked well there is no doubt here but Arnie to be fair is the real memorable person, he commands his scenes and the lines he is given are at times, gold.Now James Cameron I do feel is overrated here, I know I know how do I think he Is overrated but let me get this out straight, although he is good, as is the film as a whole, I don't think it is a masterpiece. Now Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd create a script that is solid, and it works out well, but I do feel his directing can be a little too, well crash and bang, sometimes scenes get a little too fast and the fighting is too quick to be seen, although all together as said before, he is good.Why do I think this isn't a masterpiece?, well it comes down to this, now it is unique it's way of being made however, I watched this years later, I have been influenced by other films, so maybe to fully love this, you'd have to go back to 84. I do though, feel this is special, in a way in which this plot is still to this day, never been re done to a good quality, and I mean that because Sci-fi films want to emulate this, but they can't or people will know.The fast pacing of this movie makes this easy to like, and it is important because again, not so many action films do this well or make the action fast but well made(but as previously mentioned, not all the action is seamless). The Special effects are a little crazy at times, when the movie starts to go to the future, the space ships are insane and the props are actually kind of funny, of course effects weren't as good in the 80's so a bit of credit to the team behind.All together though I do find this good and although maybe my rating doesn't reflect my full opinion on this, it still tells this is a film nearly everyone likes, even if just a little. It is hard to hate this movie I admit, I mean I didn't try but finding holes in this is fruitless, just sit back and enjoy a bit of movie history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Tired of the Franchise? Don't Forget It Stands On Its Own Legs Quite Well.,"Given that the world can take this movie completely for granted now, one can forget how gradually Cameron unravels what's happening with the two nude men who emerge one night from a torrent of voltage: One, a colossal Germanic beast, dispatches of a crew of punks to obtain their clothes first thing after he instantaneously regains his orientation. Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over: Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter. The second nude, Michael Biehn, doesn't have the same massive figure or imperviousness, but he has the vigilance and taut physique of an animal, stealing clothes too, managing to pinch a gun.By this stage we're beginning to note that this smaller man may not entirely be so formidable like the other, as he's conspicuously not killed anyone yet, but we still don't understand how any of it relates to the opening title card describing a war between humans and machines, or why both men have such a concern with the three Sarah Conners in the metro area phone book. It swiftly becomes clear to us which of the three is the one who counts, as we meet her in the form of Linda Hamilton. We see how tedious her life is, with her co-worker observing, in what we don't yet recognize is irony, that in 100 years, nobody will care. Then Sarah finds on the news that someone with precisely her name has been viciously murdered. Thinking little about it, she arranges for a night out with her roommate Ginger while the LAPD, led by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen, have to manage the second execution-style killing of a Sarah Connor in one day.We still don't know what's happening, theoretically at least: We saw the giant man murder the initial Sarah, we're not familiar with the second, and neither man has yet verified himself as trustworthy the slightest bit. So when the smaller man manages to begin stalking our Sarah, we've every cause to presume that he's trouble, and so does she, having by now gathered the murders lead straight to her. She dodges into an ascetically '80s club to call the police and disappear. Two presumably deadly, anonymous, wordless men hunt the same woman in the packed nightspot. At least one now has a substantial arsenal. Eventually, half hour in, one says his very first line of dialogue: ""Come with me if you want to live."" With hero and villain now conclusively determined, the movie's remainder is utterly a chase, Schwarzenegger pursuing the two humans through LA, slaughter and nothing else on his agenda. I remain unendingly stunned by how superbly Cameron sustains the tension: Unquestionably in that first half hour, there's not one second that's missing heart and soul, when even the essential exposition of Sarah's life is managed with utmost effectiveness. Even in the enormous info-dumps that Biehn is burdened with, we have no sense of the film slumping under the load of it all. When he bothers to tell Sarah, and us, the plot in essence, it comes directly after a climactic point, when we're viscerally prepared for the film to let us decompress.There's the cost-conscious way that Cameron shares information about Biehn and Schwarzenegger, ensuring that we'll be engrossed in deciphering who they are. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned. Sarah as a convincing, appealing person is much due to Hamilton playing a young woman of no seeming significance pushed into a nightmare and never permitted to find her balance. This is usually the part that feels like just a bookmark, but Hamilton emphasizes her uncommonly distinctive sense of a woman in an '80s killer-stalking-girl flick.Biehn, never my favorite actor, nevertheless seems a sinewy, astute beast as much as a human. It evokes the frantic anguish of his future life, and makes us pity this tattered endurer. Meanwhile, the epically iconic rogue of the film: It takes authority, and in Schwarzenegger's case, a grand succession of close-mouthed expressions, tweaks of the head. He may be a machine, but he's a convincing one. It's a categorically star-making performance.Cinematographer Adam Greenberg encapsulates a grimy, murky world, scattered by overpowering fluorescents. Stan Winston's Terminator endoskeleton is the stuff of legend, even if some of the animatronics in certain shots are charmingly old-fashioned. Of all the collaborators, still, it's composer Brad Fiedel that merits the most affection: His throbbing, techno-flavored theme leads one of the finest film scores throughout all the 1980s, and it's maybe the best instrument Cameron has to use in maintaining the film's propulsion. It's exciting, dissonant and harsh, that unremitting bass line keeping the movie seeming like it'll never brake, not unless the menace is quelled. Cameron's assurance in his material brings his debut far beyond the standard of all the other films where the screenplay is merely a cause for explosions and car chases: It's a plot with import and desperate interests.

James Cameron's Breakthrough Feature Is An Undeniable Classic In Every Sense Of The Word,"One of the most original, influential & greatest examples of sci-fi actioners to surface on the silver screen, The Terminator is a masterwork of quality storytelling & passionate filmmaking that brims with unique ideas, clever imagination, relentless creativity, compelling characters & state-of-the-art craftsmanship, and is also notable for launching the filmmaking career of James Cameron while solidifying the star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Hollywood.The Terminator follows its titular character; an unstoppable & indestructible cyborg assassin from the future who is sent back in time to terminate Sarah Connor; a young waitress in the present day whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines in the post- apocalyptic future. Also arriving from the same future into the present world is Kyle Reese; a soldier whose only mission is to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator at all costs.Written & directed by James Cameron, The Terminator marks a remarkable breakthrough for the then-new filmmaker into the Hollywood industry & wonderfully showcases his excellent understanding of what constitutes a great cinema. It's astonishing how amazingly well this film has aged over the years despite its low budget plus what Cameron manages to put up on the screen on that allowance only speaks volumes about his sweeping cinematic vision, creative ability & precision eye for detail.Coming to the technical aspects, I've got nothing but praise for this film. The special effects team does a terrific job in bringing to life what is a frightening portrait of a post-apocalyptic future & it looks incredibly convincing on the screen. A few effects do appear slightly dated but it doesn't affect the whole experience by any means. Cinematography makes smart use of camera in sustaining the film's tense ambiance from start to finish while Editing unfolds the story at a brisk pace & is at its best during the action sequences.As far as acting department is concerned, The Terminator features an interesting ensemble in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton & Michael Biehn, and all 3 of them have done an outstanding job in their given roles. Biehn balances himself well as Kyle Reese, Hamilton's character arc is most rewarding for we see her going from a vulnerable victim to accepting her fate & fighting for her survival, but the real star of the film is of course Schwarzenegger in the role of Terminator; who is now ranked amongst cinema's most iconic characters.Requiring minimum amount of dialogues & a physical built that's imposing n intimidating at the same time, the role of the Terminator was tailor-made for Schwarzenegger's talents and he absolutely nailed it with his mute expressions, automated dialogue delivery & machine- like movements to give life to an antagonist that's simply invincible. Last but not the least, the background score by Brad Fiedel is an underrated gem in itself whose main theme has easily become one of the most recognizable tracks in existence today plus it compliments the whole narrative in a fascinating manner.On an overall scale, The Terminator is one of the best films of the 1980s that has exquisitely endured the test of time, is a landmark achievement of its genre that continues to inspire & influence films even today, and is one of the proudest works in the career of both Cameron & Schwarzenegger. Unforgettable for its contribution to pop culture, immortal for its lasting influence on science-fiction & action filmmaking, and significant for enriching the film world with a master storyteller who would go on to script an unparalleled legacy of his own in his later films, The Terminator is an undeniable classic in every sense of the word.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Schwarzenegger classic!,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has made an impact on the big screen.

Until one man from the future named Reese(Michael Biehn) who went after the cyborg to stop him. The Terminator seems to be more ruthless than any criminal of any class. After he gets the weapons of choice, he kills the shop owner. Why would he kill the owner when he's only target is Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). However, The Terminator got to a few wrong Sarah Connors. The first one, was a mother one bullet to the head was bad enough, did he have to totally ambush her? The action is so non-stop there, the gunshots, the car chases, and the plots keeps getting better by the minute.

"Excellent, holds up unbelievably well","There are a lot of marvelous reasons to love this. What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple: It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that ""horror"" should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any. The guns are tremendously well chosen and handled(read the Trivia to see Arnie's efforts in that area). There is violence and some relatively disturbing sights in this, as well as a little sexuality/nudity, and a moderate amount of language, that can get strong. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the notion of an exciting movie with gun-fights, car-chases, a dark tone, well-done sci-fi, that just might provide food for thought, if you go in looking for that. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Scary sci-fi horror at its best,Where my Terminator obsession began. This movie is superb in so many ways namely the character development the fantastic story and direction.

"""You can't stop him!""","Like other great action films, this is a very fast paced and thrilling ride that barely let's you catch your breath; but unlike most other great action films, the acting is very good, and the writing is phenomenal, giving us incredible dialogue, among other things. T2 is very good, but when I watch The Terminator, and I find myself wanting to memorize five or six lines or even write a book about humanoid machines or time travel, I realize that this one is much more exciting and impressive. Besides, that kid in T2 really annoys me.Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger do a good job, but Michael Biehn is the one who does not get enough credit for this movie. However, he was lucky enough to get the best lines by far. ""That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear; and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"" That line would be good if only said well, but when Biehn says it, it might be my favorite line of all time; and there are several other great lines in The Terminator.I can't think of one general thing that is bad about this movie. Aside from the afore mentioned dialogue, action, and acting(which includes the actors with smaller parts like Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen and Bill Paxton), the plot is brilliant, the music is great, and even the performance and handling of the dogs was impressive!I used to think that Empire Strikes Back was my favorite movie, but since recently watching The Terminator, after not having seen it in years, I'm pretty sure this is my favorite film of all time.Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A classic,"The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd- pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-'80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right ""action-hero"" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the ""tender moments"" last about three minutes in total.With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Organic and well made action movie (but not more than that),"I feel the best thing they did with this one is the casting of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor as she really sells the idea of a mundane normal young woman turning into a survivor/fighter while also falling for the extrange saviour from the future.The rest of the acting (including Arnold, in this case not even good enough to act as an emotionless robot), was terrible, as was the awful dialogue, for the most part.But that doesn't matter that much, because it is for the most part a simple action movie, with sci-fi touches, very well made on all fronts, but not the masterpiece the sequel would be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
In the end the Terminator will triumph - that is the real terror of mankind,"The basic plot of the movie is that a highly sophisticated machine (The Terminator) with extraordinary physical powers that also looks like a human on the outside (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to the present so that the machines can terminate the mother of the only person who can save the human species in the final war between humans and machines that rages in the future world. This is being done so that the 'savior of the human species' is never born, and with that done the machines of the future can win easily. The humans of the future come to know of this plan, and so they too send a human into the present time to stop the terminator from carrying out this plan. All the action revolves around this plot, and all the sequences are brilliantly choreographed, along with superb visual effects and dialogs. The role of Schwarzenegger is so perfectly fitting as 'The Terminator', that it is spooky. This has rightly earned him the nickname 'Terminator' of which he too is proud of. It is this spooky feeling that indicates that this is no simple sci-fi action movie, and that there runs beneath the surface theme of man versus machine, a more fundamental theme of life and death, of 'Eros' and 'Thanatos' than just action and adventure, and that is why this is a classic.Coming to the abstract ideas behind the movie, the idea of 'time travel' is now well recognized as purely fictional and therefore serves as an artistic and imaginative prop or support for other ideas. The core abstract idea is that of an ongoing struggle between mankind and the destructive effects of the reckless use of technology, also unleashed by man, which going 'out of control' threatens the entire human species. So this is actually a metaphysical battle taking place within the human mind at the 'collective unconscious' (Jungian term) level. The 'archetypes' of 'savior' and 'terminator' are again props for this battle between those human minds that through their actions and creative expressions support the sustaining force of life, and those human minds that act mechanically and insensitively, and who by their actions support the 'life terminating' or 'death' force.""Our technology has already outstripped our ability to control it."" Gen. Omar Bradley The key fact or the truth that is not apparent is that machines themselves are not players or 'beings' in this struggle, they are not entities that act themselves because they have no 'volition' or 'will' of any kind, rather machines are value neutral tools that are used either to create or to destroy. And since this core abstract idea cannot be presented or explained very explicitly, it has to take the art form of a movie like this one. (Also compare this to The Matrix). Thus 'The Terminator' is a powerful symbol of the ever increasing potential for destruction unleashed by technology that is bound to occur in the future - the event that can only be extended in time ( 'buying time') by the creative use of technology.""Art is a lie that reveals the truth"" said Pablo Picasso. And the truth is that The Terminator will ultimately succeed in wiping out mankind because it is 'designed' or 'fated' to do so. This movie buys some more time for us by it's art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Fantastic film - Arnie at his best,"I absolutely love this film - the first time I saw it, I was about eight and I found it immensely scary watching people being hunted down by the ultimate cold, ruthless killing machine. Looking back the special effects weren't that great but at the time it seemed all too real. I think the second and third films lost their way in the sense that the 'baddies' weren't scary (with the exception of Robert Patricks eyes) and too much humour was injected.While the debates continue about Johns age throughout the trilogy, I'd just like to point out the other time ""mistake"" in case some of you aren't aware of it. At the start of the film it stats that it's L.A. 1984.

Maybe I'm just too critical in my old age,"I first watching this film shortly after it came out and again when the first sequel was released. And just recently decided to take another look at it, finding it nowhere near as good as my recollections.There are several reasons for this, but most important is the flatness of the characters. They are all so one-dimensional. Of course, that doesn't apply to the Terminator, as that is expected. After all, it is a cyborg. But that doesn't excuse the others. Worse are those of passing characters ginger and the Silberman. They are nothing but cartoonish caricatures, with the psychiatrist being utterly out of place. He belongs in a comedy, and then, he isn't funny. And that's not the fault of the actor, but whomever contrived the personality.Also very bad are the romantic interludes between Kyle and Sarah. They lack depth. Their feeling for each other are not emotive, lack reality. It is as if they have been forced for the sake of the story. Also, in Sarah, there is a lack of continuity. At the nightclub and the scenes right after, she observes the Terminator in action. So why would she later ask Silberman if Kyle is crazy. What? She didn't believe her own eyes? It would have sound more real if she had defended Kyle when the psychiatrist said Kyle was looney. That opportunity to foster a bond between Kyle and Sarah was wasted.Long chases, car or otherwise, were a rather new thing in the '80s. So, to a point all those scenes can be excused for going overboard. At least most scenes seem to have a connection to the former. No incident appears to contain an outrageous new factor brought into the narrative in order to carry through with the plot.Having said all this, I really like the ending. It generates suspense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Picture anyone else as the titular HK. Just try it.,"CAn't do it,can you? That's how indelible Arnold Schwazenegger is as the title character,a perfectly made HK(Hunter KIller)android who has been sent from the future to eliminate the would-be mother of humanity's fiercest rebel and last true hope.Fortunately for the heroine of this show,SArah Connor(LInda Hamilton,before she beefed into the tough-chick she'd be type cast as AFTER T2,and probably best remembered as a similar,somewhat weaker type character in previous films like TAG and Children of the Corn),said machine has had to waste his way through Los Angeles to find her,so this buys her some time while one Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn,whose career has never completely up-turned since Aliens)also from the future,goes in pursuit of the 'droid AND protect Sarah,thus ensuring the birth of humanity's hero,one John Connor,and protecting humankind's future. As the droid draws nearer and nearer to Sarah and Kyle,and the body count rises,an adrenaline-pumping,gut-wrenching battle between Man's last best hope and a killing machine who""has no pity,no conscience,cannot be bargained with and will not stop until it finds and terminates its target(I'm paraphrasing here somewhat)"" chugs toward fruition.I learned not too long ago that director and co-writer James Cameron had NOT planned a sequel(let alone a trilogy or series)of this film and intended it to be a singular ending. Looking back at it as a whole product,it makes more sense(and that's all I'm saying from there so as to avoid any spoilers for those out there who HAVEN'T seen this film or aren't at least familiar with it). I can both understand why this film was only a marginal success when it was first released in late Fall/early Winter 1984: much of the cast were somewhat unknowns at the time,save Paul Warfield(As a doubting yet humane cop) and,of course,bodybuilding champ Schwarzenegger,and the concepts and images of the film were pure Sci-Fi,which always seems to be a bit of a hard sell to the general public. But much like another movie released around the same time,A Nightmare on Elm Street,it was a fairly unique and inexorably memorable movie that was bound to not only have sequels made but practically change the face of the genres they were made in. It's sequels are both well made(and I actually appreciated the whole size and scope of it's 1991 sequel,T2;Judgement Day somewhat better,the best of all three),and I intend to catch the next in the series,should it be made. Since Arnold vowed he was not doing any more movies as long as he's in public office,that could be a while. Still,it took almost twenty years to continue the simple storyline of man's battle with machines who've become far too powerful over just THREE movies,so what's another twenty years?

"""A serious attitude problem""","There has long been a tradition in cinema of actors whose good looks or sheer physicality far outstripped their Thespian talents. Of these Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a league of his own. His nickname of Austrian Oak seems to refer not just to his impressive stature but to his woodenness before the camera. And yet he became an icon in the 1980s by managing to get cast in parts which didn't stretch his disappointing range. What do you do with a monotonous voice and a body that looks like it could punch through concrete? You play a robot, that's what.Oh, sorry, not a robot. A *cyborg*Yes, the 1980s run of hi-octane sci-fi actioners was a boon for Schwarzenegger. The idea of some technological terror coming to get us was hardly new. It was the subject of a lot of 50s B-movies, and if you want to go back further you could include Frankenstein as well. The Terminator is essentially an update of these stories for the then-fledgling age of computers and robotics. It's not the best bit of writing ever. There is some woeful dialogue, and enough logical flaws in the plot to drive a juggernaut through, but this doesn't really matter because the screenplay only really exists to give us a thrilling action adventure. And the central premise – futuristic warriors battling it out over the life of a present day woman – provides a strong enough core to build any number of fight and chase scenes around.The Terminator was the second feature of James Cameron, and he shows early on a skillful blending of terror and excitement. The picture moves fast, so he doesn't have much time to establish elements of horror, but he is adept at throwing something into the frame – such as the prominent window behind Linda Hamilton – to introduce a little note of uncertainty and danger. To maintain the pace, Cameron's tack is to keep the images constantly moving, not letting the tempo down even in quiet moments. After Arnie utters the immortal ""I'll be back"" line, we cut between near identical close-ups of the desk sergeant's paperwork – an utterly pointless bit of editing narrative-wise but it brilliantly ratchets up the tension before it all kicks off. Cameron also loves to make the audience feel involved, frequently placing us within the action. The first shot in the modern day has the camera underneath the jaws of a monstrous-looking digger. Often characters are seen advancing towards the retreating camera. It's worth remembering that Cameron was of the first generation of filmmakers to be influenced by video games. Not that earlier directors hadn't used these techniques, but I think that idea of feeling like a participant in the action really helped shape his approach.The movie looks neat too despite what was a relatively low budget for the era and genre. They have really gone to town on all the tropes of the 80s action movie – dry ice, blue lightning and alleyways full of billowing newspapers and homeless people. In a way, that contrast between piercing white light and smoky shadow was the 80s equivalent of chiaroscuro lighting. Very often of course it is hiding the clunkiness of the special effects, which are strictly old-school. Personally I love the movie's pre-CGI charm. This really was a golden age for animatronics, even as they were becoming obsolete.So, where does Mr Schwarzenegger fit into all this? With The Terminator we have a movie where fast-paced action runs roughshod over logic, and it doesn't call for amazing dramatic performances. Look at the other players – Linda Hamilton is passable but not amazing, and Michael Biehn is dreadful to the point of irritating. Outside of this movie, both Hamilton and Biehn were better actors than Schwarzenegger, but here it is Arnie who is the most compelling and watchable, simply because playing a hard, mechanical killing machine is the one thing he could do really well. Just for once, he gets to be convincing, chilling, the captivating heart of the movie. Good for him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The cheapy budget gives it this sickly late-night wash which works in it's favour but the thin synth soundtrack hasn't fared so well. It's goes at a great relentlessly linear pace and Linda Hamilton's evergreen Sarah Connor is seriously well-rounded for the time.

Death metal!,"Kyle Reese is a child of the apocalypse who has been given the chance of a lifetime in a future where the average life expectancy is likely about 30.

Cameron was the one who initiated the discussions,"You may not like how this film develops or how slowly the plot unfolds, but you cannot deny that Cameron first initiated the discussion.Discussions about artificial intelligence, their aim to attain sentience, and their plausible uprising have had an immense effect on popular culture and millions of sci-fi fans around the world.

Certainly not, but you will feel a connection to the plot and the events that take place, and believe me, you will find yourself hooting and shouting for Sarah and her desperate struggle for survival.That's what good direction does: it compensates for flaws and can elevate a mediocre script to new heights.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Schwarzenegger At His Best!,"Originally, whilst writing the review for Predator, I thought that was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role, however, one of my favourite actors of all time was at his absolute best in this movie! A must see for any action movie lovers!The film is about a robot sent back through time to kill the mother of John Connor, whom will eventually lead the resistance against the machines in the war following judgement day. The human resistance also sent back a soldier, however, in Kyle Reese, to fight the machine and help protect Sarah, John's mother. Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop the unstoppable, and this robot will kill everyone and everything in order to complete his machine!The film just basically depicts their fight against the Terminator, which is portrayed amazingly by Arnie and actually I do not believe any actor in the world could have portrayed the cold hearted machine better!

Terrifying - a cult classic,"The explosive sci-fi thriller that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a superstar is now acknowledged as a cult classic, but it's certainly worth remembering that it did only modest business at the box office. Nevertheless, big Arnie hasn't gone hungry since.The plot line of an unstoppable killer robot has become one of the most overused concepts in sci-fi cinema, but director James Cameron has imbued the film with plenty of wit and a relentless sense of pace. Even with today's standards, the make-up effects and the prosthetics are just as terrifyingly effective as they were in 1984. However, this is much more than the usual guns-blazing action B-movie: at the heart of the story lies a woman's reluctance to come to terms with what she must soon face, and the tragedy of a love that can never be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"Arnold Schwarzenegger brings presence, intensity and menace in James Cameron's futuristic sci fi nightmare. James Cameron really showed his talents as not only a writer, but as a film maker in this classic. The story is fluent, the pace is frantic and is grounded by excellent direction, great performances and good dialogue. The tone of the film is dark and its ambiance is amped up by Brad Fiedel's ominous and percussive score. Stan Winston's special make up f/x are top notch. While Arnold as The Terminator is a focal point and in this role he is perfect, it would be criminal to overlook the rest of the cast in this picture. Michael Biehn gave an exceptional, intense balls out performance here and carries the story delivering exposition while being chased by The Terminator. Linda Hamilton is great too. She shows a lot of range in this film. Lance Hendrickson and Paul Winfield give brief, but memorable performances as cops. There also are some cool cameos from Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punk rockers. This movie is a solid production and holds up well. I am not much of a fan of the sequels.

"Good, not great","This movie, like Die Hard, was one of the films I simply did not watch growing up. I was born in the era, but for some reason or another didn't find the urge to give in. That is until 2011.Though I thought it was good, I'm not quite sure Terminator lived up to its reputation. I mean, the stop-motion special effects disappointed me and the lack of action in the beginning was a little off-putting. Also, the storyline seemed to stretch a little bit. But I guess that happens when you deal with a time travel in a movie. It takes a little extra concentration to get everything straight.I did, however, enjoy most of the film. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the tension was high during the Terminators' ruthless massacre. The acting was above average and the dialog was nothing special, but good.All-in-all, The Terminator wasn't a masterpiece but it was entertaining...and that's all you can ask for I guess.

The Haunting Future,"The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters.

The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films.Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for.

Let's Cut The Chase: This Film Is Fantastic!,"In order to properly appreciate The Terminator, you have to look at this film and take into consideration the budget that it was made on and the status of the director who created it. Before this film, James Cameron was not the king of the world like he was after Titanic and Avatar broke through. He was a person who very little people had faith in with a film idea that didn't go over very well among the top studios. And if you look at this film from a technical point of view, you can see that they were being conservative with the budget for a bizarre science fiction premise created by a struggling filmmaker who nobody really had much faith in. But in the end, it turned out to be a very good movie with real heart and soul, exciting and suspenseful action, an interesting if unlikely plot, and great performances from Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.But what about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well, Arnold is unique in this film since he is not really a character in the traditional sense. He is more of an obstacle; a force of nature that cannot be stopped that haunts the protagonists with his fierce demeanor and acute focus on his main mission: to murder Sarah Connor. There is an intensity to his presence on-screen, no small part do to Brad Fiedel's excellent score which includes a foreboding metallic heartbeat every time the Terminator walks onto the scene. And fascinatingly enough, his ""character"" as the Terminator encompasses a very dark fantasy of man: the ability to do anything to anyone without any consequences or anyone being able to stop you.The movie hits all the right notes! It starts with a disastrous view of the future before jumping into a dark, disturbing view of the present, with the gritty, dirty streets of nighttime LA providing the perfect setting for a suspenseful chase between man and a murderous machine. It gives us a glimpse of lighthearted humanity as we see Sarah Connor, and ordinary young woman living her life as a normal person, before we are thrown into her nightmare as she finds herself stalked by an unknown assailant with an unknown cause. We feel sympathy for her as she finds herself not only in physical danger but facing the emotional crisis of having the responsibility of saving humanity in the future. And we feel for Kyle Reece, the soldier sent from the future to protect her against impossible odds, as we see him trying to operate in a world that he does not know after growing up in the wake of nuclear destruction. Even the minor characters feel real and human. The only thing ""wooden"" about the acting in the movie would be from Arnold himself, but that's okay because his character is supposed to be a lifeless, emotionless killing machine - and he excels at his role as the Terminator in that way.But despite how much I love this movie (I even love it more than Terminator 2: Judgement Day, believe it or not), I can't ignore the fact that certain elements of the film have not aged well at all! Chase scenes that were filmed and sped up to look faster, choppy stop-motion animations on the Terminator endoskeleton, and prosthetic animatronics with plastic skin are just a few examples of how this film shows its age and its low budget. Setbacks like this can take modern moviegoers out of the experience simply because a lot of the special effects look incredibly dated compared to other films, even films that came before this movie like Return of the Jedi.However, in the end, this film comes across as James Cameron's true labor of love. This isn't the blockbuster high-budget mega production Titanic or Avatar. This is the film that got his name well known among the movie-making industry. This was his equivalent to Spielberg's Jaws or Lucas' Star Wars: a film that was so hard to make, but you can see he poured his heart into, and it paid off! You have to respect something like that!Just watch this film! Do it! Do it now! Go! Leave this review and find a copy of The Terminator and watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Classic 80's Action,"Terminator, The (1984)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Everyone knows the story to this action classic so there's no point in going over it again but you really can't blame any of the stories you've heard about how hard it was for Cameron to get this made. It's quite well known that this movie barely got made and if you hear the story you might see why a producer or studio might pass on making it. There's no doubt in my mind that in lesser hands this film would have turned out to be a disaster but Cameron really makes it what it is. The fact that he found someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger to play the killing Terminator is never a bad thing but Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn also fill their roles quite nicely. What works best for the film is its dark tone, which Cameron never comes away from. Even the ""softer"" moments of the film, those inside the motel between Hamilton and Biehn's characters, are quite dark and the overall tone and atmosphere is what really makes it stand out. There are numerous great moments but the highlight has to be the scene where the Terminator does an operation on itself. The police station massacre has always been an uneasy scene to watch but that's a good thing. The movie has non-stop action from start to finish and you throw in the fine performances and that makes this a classic for the genre. The special effects are top notch as is the score so there's no doubt that this film deserves its reputation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"It was great. Is still is. Arnie was always the best as the bad guy. There's a rumor, Don't know if its true. Arnie has a brief cameo in Terminator Salvation.","Cameron was stuck in Rome in the early eighties editing Piranha II: The Spawning; a film that he was not even supposed to be working on. During the late nights in the editing room Cameron started to dream of an image of a robotic skeleton emerging from a massive explosion. He took that idea home with him and while waiting for his paycheck from Piranha II, he and his future wife future wife Gale Anne Hurd developed a story around the image.If only I could turn some of my crazy dreams into a multi million dollar franchise. Any type of decent sci fi story that was inspired by a dream or a nightmare is pretty cool in my book. You've gotta respect a guy who trusts his vision enough to see it through all the rejection they went through to get that film made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I'll be back...,"The original ""Terminator"" is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance against the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg. I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequels. But then again, those are action movies.Visually, the film is first rate. Fantasy II's future sequences and Stan Winston's make-up and Terminator endo-skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making. Even in this day and age of CG-everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation. Additionally, for the special edition DVD they redid some of the sound effects, like the Terminator's long-slide .45. There are lots of extras, including deleted scenes, still galleries, and two interview reels with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, plus Biehn and Hamilton.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Pure, dark brilliance","I have always loved this film, for well over half my life. I was about 6 when I first saw it, 12 years ago. T2 had always been my favourite film but recently, The Terminator has eclipsed T2 to become my favourite movie of all time. There is so much more to this film than its sequel. T2 is simple action whereas this film is an action, romance, horror and suspense thriller all rolled in to one.The Terminator's story is very strong and eclipses every Sci-Fi film there is. The idea of time travel has always fascinated me and, whilst this film does not explore as much as Back to the Future does, the intricate description of Reese going back through time and the bleak setting of the future world is highly imaginative. Cameron does really well at capturing the audience's attention and imagination and shows how talented a director and writer he is. The love story between Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is beautiful. The idea of a man travelling back in time to protect the woman he loves is so wonderful and sentimental. As well as having a good story, this film is highly entertaining. The TechNoir bar scene, the car chase and the police station scene are especially good and are absolutely stunning to watch.The acting in this film is brilliant. Arnie was not at all developed when it came to acting which made him much less human which is very effective when playing a cyborg. Schwarzenegger is not in this film to deliver lines with any power, but is in more as a physical force and someone who appears unstoppable. Kyle Reese is, for me, the best hero ever and he is played by my favourite actor. His intense vulnerability makes him very interesting and the way he is so prepared to sacrifice himself for the mission objective, the love of his life. Biehn is so good in this role as he plays protector very well but does perfectly at playing someone 'lost in time'. Biehn's performance in this film is sadly underrated but for me, it is completely unforgettable. Linda Hamilton is brilliant in this film and her character's gradual transformation, which is completed in Terminator 2, is very convincing. Her ability at appearing terrified is equally convincing. There is also good support from Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield as the policemen investigating the case. They do well to give the film a touch of humour and their contrasting personalities makes an effective pairing.The fact that this film was made on a small budget also impresses me, especially as the special effects don't work out too badly, except for the stop motion scene where the endoskeleton is chasing Kyle and Sarah. Stan Winston is a special effects genius and it is incredible to look at all the films he has worked on. His wizardry at transforming James Cameron's artwork to solid matter is very impressive to say the least.Also good is Brad Fiedel's score. Whilst it is simplistic and completely on a synthesizer, it matches the mood of the film perfectly, and is very effective at getting an adrenaline rush. Also, the Terminator theme is a classic tune that will live on in eternity just like the Jaws theme. Tahnee Cain and the Tryanglz make up the bulk of the small amount of songs The Terminator has to offer and like the score, their songs reflect the atmosphere of the film.An intensely stylish film that benefits very well from being shot mainly at night to give a real dark atmosphere, Terminator rose above a moderate budget to become an all time classic. The Terminator did a fantastic job at bringing credibility back to the Sci-Fi genre and simultaneously show the importance of a human theme. Almost everyone has seen this film, if you haven't, you really must! James Cameron at his very best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome movie,"Hard to believe that James Cameron started out with something as small budgeted as The Terminator, and now he has directed the two highest grossing films of all time. Today a lot of people hate James Cameron because he has mediocre stories mixed in with amazing special effects, where as 30 years ago he brought us a very well done story about how technology may overthrow the human race one day.Now a few things I didn't like in this movie, it is a little bit slow, if you are very impatient you may not like this movie, but if you can get pass the slower parts you will find a really fun flick. I don't see why they couldn't just wrap laser guns in a piece of meat, I didn't see much purpose in following the police chief, he doesn't have much impact on the story, and it can be very depressing at times, and would have been nice to have a little more comic relief.I love stories that try to warn us about how we can mess up the future, either by government or technology. This film applies more today than it did back in 1984 now that we have Internet, cell phones, iPods and all that. The special effects are excellent, and this movie had a very low budget. The action scenes are good, but nothing groundbreaking, they get the story moving, but they're nothing special. And the characters are all interesting, weather you like James Cameron or not, you can't deny he knows how to make a strong female lead, and Sarah Conner is one of them. She starts out as a waitress who can't even do her job right, then becomes a bada** near the end.The Terminator is one of the best examples of how to make a film on a low budget. Both the story, and the special effects are great, the characters are interesting, and it's just a fun movie to watch.

"An over-rated, dated film","Directed by the phenomenal and successful director James Cameron (who also directed classic films such as ""Aliens"", ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"") ""The Terminator"" is James Cameron's first major success as a film, and he has, ever since, periodically released box-office royalty one after the other. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (who also stars in Predator) who plays the terminator, Michael Biehn (who stars in both Aliens and The Abyss) who plays Kyle Reese, and Linda Hamilton playing Sarah Connor. First look; a great cast, but unfortunately, some overacting by the supporting cast can become annoying, though it be brief. The film has a unique and brutal antagonist but fails to become truly interesting and just seems to drag despite the short film time of 107 minutes.

The Terminator,"Arnold Schwarzenegger arrives in 1984 Los Angeles, in his birthday suit, and on a mission. Firstly, to get some clothes then to eliminate all the ""Sarah Connor"" folks listed in the phone book. Moments later ""Kyle"" (Michael Biehn) arrives with the aim of thwarting this dastardly plan - and soon the race is on. Meanwhile, ""Sarah"" (Linda Hamilton) is blissfully unaware that she is a target until the news bulletins start reporting the brutal slaying of her namesakes. She is spooked, and takes refuge in a night club while the city's finest head to her rescue. Thing is, Arnie is not just a big muscly bloke, he's a big muscly killing machine - and a nigh-on immortal one at that. ""Kyle"" and ""Sarah"" now have their work cut out just to stay alive while they try to concoct a plan that will destroy her nemesis before it destroys them - and pretty much everyone else it comes into contact with! Aside from the synthesiser music - which has dated quite badly - this film still holds up as a solid and entertaining sci-fi horror film. True, the script is never top of James Cameron's priorities, and here is no different, but the pace of the film and the sparing but effective use of the special effects build to quite an exciting crush-endo that is good to watch with a surprising degree of jeopardy right until the very end. Hamilton is not a very good actress, but as the momentum builds she gels well with Biehn making the whole thing well a worth a watch on a big screen even now, almost forty years on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Best low budget sci-fi movie ever !,"At only 6.4 million dollars, this movie must be the best low budget science fiction movie ever made. Much credit goes to James Cameron for great selection of actors to create one of a kind classic.When I watch this movie now, I'm surprised at how dark the mood of this movie is. It's much darker than T2, and T3 was Terminator in name only.Arnold showed versatile side of him. He wasn't just a robot, he had character that was all his own. ""I'll be back"" became a cliché in his future movies such as the Commando. By this time Arnold had 10 years of acting experience, and this was the defining role that really put him on the map.What made this movie stand out so much out of all the rest of low budget science fiction drama was the presence of Arnold, He really played the part with believability.Rough around the edges, but good enough to shock you, this is one of the best movie of this kind ever created.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest movies to come out of Hollywood.,"And will probably not be accepted in today's harshing-by-the-minute counter-violence standards. It tells the story of a Terminator coming from 2029 to kill the Sarah Connor, mother of John Conner, the leader of the resistance to prevent him from ever being born. The resistance also sends someone through time to protect Sarah and a hunt ensues across LA.This movie is a straight action with a little love story that develops between Kyle, the protector, and Sarah, the protectee. It involves a lot of shooting, killing, maiming and ferocious and disgustingly beautiful scenes (The one where the Terminator fixes his hand and eye using scalpel).It has almost no element of drama, feeling and very little humor so I don't really know why I liked it, but I did. This movie is not for everyone, it should only be viewed by the action-freaks, disgust-lovers and the mature in mind with absolutley nothing to do.That's about it, too bad I can't get any good quotes out of this movie, all of the best ones are from the sequel, so go see that one too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Good Cameron film,"This and 'Aliens' - forget 'Titanic.Cameron is a force in film, possibly as damaging in his way as Speilberg, but with far fewer and less varied films. What he sees and can display must be attractive to judge from the receipts. What he cannot see is less obvious. Here is his first real film, his 'Rocky.'In my comment on 'Aliens,' I noted the radically differing styles of Cameron and the man who invented the sexual, scifi horror genre. Cameron starts with the stunts, adds humor and then finds places for the actors and situations. Most work the other way around. Scott starts with a general vision first; for him, stunts are merely punctuation of the visual space. But Cameron starts with a mechanical skeleton, not at all unlike that shown here.And then his strategy is to be relentless in eliminating the human elements of the film: those elements like character development, richness of situation, emotional space. He crushes them just like Arnie's cybergoon, because they simply mess up the cleanliness of his movie. Such 'soft' stuff is for wimps. Any sort of irony or annotation is for eggheads and who needs 'em.In the roughly 20 years since this was made, the film world has changed radically with much energy attracted to the Cameron model. The machines in Hollywood are winning. Four years later, 'Die Hard' introduced a simple sort of self-effacing irony into the model and until now that is the only human remnant remaining.

One of the All Time Greats.,"We all know the story, so i wont bore you on that. What i want to say is this, the Terminator is a timeless classic that is often overlooked due to its far poorer and yet far well known sequel that, from my point of view, should never have been created, if it were to be so infinitely inferior compared to The Terminator. The Terminator could well have just turned into a B-movie, but didnt. The great thing about it is how right from the start to the very end of the music (another brilliant thing about it), it has you at the edge of your seat, your attention never waivers, and no matter how many times you watch it, it just gets better and better. The music is, to put it bluntly, almost the best. The only music in a film that is better is that of The Last of the Mohicans. From my point of view, the music of a film is more important than the dialogue and visuals of a film, and after the first time i watched The Terminator, that music has stuck in my mind ever since (and im glad for it !). The other reasons that The Terminator is so good is its characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his very best in this film, and i still think he has never managed to top this performace. Granted, he said less than 100 words or something, but that doesnt matter. The music and his actions when he was on screen defied any dialogue, and the less he talked, the better he was. The scene in the technoir club and the Police Station ""incident"" are two of the greatest scenes ever. Linda Hamilton was brilliant as the innocent waitress who's boring every day life, being continuously stood-up, suddenly turns into the most important living being on earth. Finally, there is Michael Biehn. Now i thought that Linda should have been catapulted into super stardom, when she wasnt, but Michael Biehns' luck in Hollywood is evan worse. He pulls off a performance that i dont think any other actor could have done. From my point of view, he was perfect. He had the greatest lines and the best character in all the film. You can really feel pity for this guy to say the least, as he seems so small compared to the massive bulk of Arnold, and yet just as Arnold keeps on getting up after being shot up, for a human, Riece does very well, showing the urgency and importance of his misson, as he must succeed. Michael Biehn gets no where near enough credit for this film, and instead of being in the Hollywood A List, hes way down the line. When it came out in the Cinemas', i watched The Rock, it had Sean Connery and Michael Biehn in it, i thought that both of them would have pivotal parts, and was hugely disappointed too see him die almost immediately after less time on screen than Ray Parkes in TPM. This guy really has been literally dumped on. Finally, James Cameron, for a guy who made the most expensive film ever, i have one piece of advice, get back to low budgets, cause this is the best film you've ever made and are ever likely to make. So, in conclusion, if anybody out there hasnt watched this film, watch it, its one of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the Best Movies of All Time,"The Terminator is one of the truly best sci-fi movies that exist today. The plot is fantastic also making it one of my favourite movies along with the sequel. The story of Sarah Connor and The Terminator really blew me away first time I watched it, as a kid. The only times I actually were allowed to watch it was when I was sick and had to stay home and my mother permitted me to watch it. I was so happy, those were the times!Well, The Terminator has a fantastic dark atmosphere unlike T2, really underlining the scary story being told. The score also has great influence on this matter; it has a very dark and edgy feel to it, however the main theme is kind of sad. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a perfect cast as the cynical Terminator and he would be hard to imagine playing the hero, since Michael Biehn does it very well.James Cameron laid his ground on this movie making a lot of top-notch movies; still this is one of his best. There are many memorable scenes, although the ""cat scene"" is the best, I really like the way the Terminator and the motel-guy talks: AY BAHDEE YA GAT A DEAD GAT IN DER ER WHAT? FAWK-YOU-ASS-WHOLE.The special effects, however, are all but mind-blowing. I didn't notice it when I was kid, but now e.g. it looks really funny when we see the endoskeleton walk around. Of course special effects doesn't make a movie, but it's the only thing this movie lacks.Rating: 10/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Frightening termination,"Glorified original movie, with color and energy, adrenaline racing, this '84 blockbuster was, where all actors were at the top of their, Arnie of course, most of all, where Biehn is great as the guy, sent back in time to save Sarah Connor (Hamilton) from termination, by our favorite robot/terminator. See, she's gonna have a baby, that'll grow up and lead the resistance, against bad forces and Armageddon. This is a cool fast moving flick from start to finish, and never lacks, or loses grip of it's story. It's script has a beautiful flow, of great action and unforgettable scenes that will stay implanted in your mind forever. Going to see this as a teen, was one of the greatest movie experiences I had. It's wonderfully shot, every scene , and for people who want to see Arnie at the top his game in the acting circuit, this is the flick to see. Must see entertainment and a bucket list movie.

Kind of groundbreaking,"(1984) The Terminator
SCIENCE-FICTION ACTIONExtremely groundbreaking both in terms of Arnold's long extensive film career and as James Cameron's breakthrough film which critics as well as audiences stopped and took notice with it's idea about cyborg's coming to earth which has influenced many films a plenty such as (1992) Universal Soldier, (1987) RoboCop, Guyver and (1989) Cyborg and many others! The set-up has a soldier (Michael Biehn) sent from the future with it's mission is to locate and protect a particular Sarah Conner from total annihilation or total hope of the future from a very destructive cyborg called The Terminator played ideally by Arnold Swartzenegger who was also sent from the future to see to it, this pessimistic future will not continue to get better! Although the original rating is ""R"", this became a box-office smash hit with audiences demanding to see more like it!

The holy grail of Sci-fi horror.,"IMHO, you can't do much better than the Terminator.  It is sci-fi horror at its finest.  This movie introduces us to one of the best villains ever seen next to Darth Vader himself.  Anyone who prefers the kinder, gentler Terminator over the monster that Arnold portrays here is a person with quite different tastes than mine.  Watching that cyborg calmly slicing his damaged eye out and impersonating Sara's Mom are chilling sights that you won't soon forget!  Arnold absolutely makes this movie what it is, it's true that he was born to play this role, although all others involved are excellent.Most people of course think of the ""I'll be back"" line, which has become Arnold's catch phrase, and has become rather tired.  Not here.  The things that the Terminator says ARE often funny, but not in a yuck-yuck one liner type of way.  The key is that the Terminator is not trying to be funny at all!  He SEEMS funny because he simply makes demands or states facts, which is not the way real humans interact.  So we laugh when the Terminator says, ""I'll be back"", not in a ""Arnolds bein' funny"" way, but in a nervous, ""what's the heck is he talking about?"" way.  He truly appears to have no soul at all, and gives the performance of a lifetime. So for those who like Arnold's newer, funnier movies, be warned- don't expect anything pleasant here. There is no kid, no happy ending, no ""everything will be all right"" message. The Terminator is very bleak, very scary, very dark, and not for everyone by any means.  But if you like sci-fi horror movies this is the holy grail and may never be topped.P.S. -I don't know much about guns, but listen carefully to what the Terminator tries to order in the gun shop early in the film.  Also notice that he stares downward while talking in this scene because he's reading the list off his eyeballs.  Great attention to detail, great stuff!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"All Time Classic, Paved The Way For Most Sci-Fi Films","Today the effects used in the movie are outdated so most of the young generation will probably discard them but when released The Terminator was a masterpiece and gave plenty of material for many screenwriters to work with. It's no secret that even today many movies are inspired by The Terminator and why shouldn't they when we have 3 amazing actors (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn) who simply gave their all for this movie to be a hit? Sure the plot may seem as far too complicated at first but James Cameron wanted to get deep into the entire time paradox and he made it. Was it a success? Well i think that if it wasn't then The Terminator wouldn't be considered one of the top movies of all time. Is a time paradox like that possible? Probably not since something needs to exist now in order to exist in the future and not vice versa but in the end we are talking about a movie and it simply doesn't get any better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Cool,"Okay, let's ditch the analytical stuff and go straight for the pure, unadulterated coolness of The Terminator (1984):
Forget everything you think you know about action movies. The Terminator isn't just a film, it's a chrome-plated, leather-clad, time-traveling punch to the gut. From the moment that endoskeleton peeks through the smoke, you know you're witnessing something legendary.Arnold Schwarzenegger? He wasn't acting, he was the Terminator. A relentless, unstoppable force of nature, delivered with the kind of icy cool that makes you want to simultaneously hide under the couch and high-five him. Every line, every movement, every gaze is iconic. He redefined what it meant to be a badass.And Sarah Connor? Forget damsels in distress. This is a woman forged in the fires of a dystopian future, rising from terrified waitress to the mother of the resistance. Linda Hamilton's transformation is raw, powerful, and utterly inspiring. You're not just watching her survive, you're watching her become a legend.James Cameron? He didn't just direct this movie, he weaponized it. The pacing is like a runaway train, the special effects are mind-blowing (even today!), and the atmosphere is thick with dread and adrenaline. It's a masterclass in tension, action, and sheer cinematic brilliance.This isn't just a movie you watch, it's an experience. It's the sound of a shotgun racking, the glint of steel in the shadows, the roar of a time machine tearing through reality. It's a pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, adrenaline-fueled ride that will leave you breathless and wanting more.The Terminator isn't just cool, it's ice-cold. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to strap on a leather jacket, grab a shotgun, and tell fate to go to hell. It's a timeless classic, a cinematic masterpiece, and a testament to the power of pure, unadulterated awesomeness. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and prepare to be blown away. You won't regret it. Watch it now!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The greatest movie ever made,"The Terminator has long been my favorite movie of all time.  It was a movie I thought that was way ahead of a time.

Sarah Hamilton also gives the performance of her career and Arnold delivers an outstanding performance in the few memorable lines that he gives.

Anti-SDI,"The only alternative to our dependence on machines is devolving to a primitive existence of labor intensive survival, that leaves little time for leisure activities and vanity devices like Walkman and hair driers.So in the future when our sophisticated, high-tech indulgences become self aware and decide we are the plague that infests this planet, all Hell breaks loose. This is not an original Sci-Fi scenario but it is one ready made for the Reagan era (SDI) and our periodic pondering of industrial and technological ""advancements"".This was a modest budget sleeper that awakened movie goers with its dark palette of stylized violence and intense, non-stop action and pacing. It revved them up with a screen filled with loud machines, dark cityscapes, seedy motels, and an air of impending doom. The intensity only pauses long enough for the virgin Father (a modern twist) to plant the seed of the ""Savior"".This has all the elements of a classic Sci-Fi welded on to a Horror movie chassis that moves like a roller-coaster.

Pulse pumping survival classic,"The Terminator, a cyborg assassin is sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to alter the future. However, a solider is also sent back to stop the assassin.The Terminator remains one of the most enjoyable Science fiction films of all time. Bradfield's pulse pumping score and nostalgic music from an array of obscure bands all adds to the lure of this timeless classic.James Cameron's direction is excellent, giving the visuals scope and depth. His above average story and screenplay stop it falling into B-movie hell.The time travel is logical; in as much as if Sarah had never met Kyle, John would have been the off spring of one of her dates. Either way it's highly satisfying science fiction and not science fact.The films cast include Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen who play it natural and straight, Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson briefly turn up. The leads Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor give flawless performances and keep you routing for their survival from the now infamous Arnold Schwarzenegger, as the Terminator. The film has a gritty and edgy look, with some gore moments, even though some of the effects have dated, the practical effects from Oscar winner Stan Winston hold up to this day.A defining moment for sci-fi action, Schwarzenegger and Cameron.

"I'll be back to this film, great.","The original film in the Terminator franchise from over thirty years ago in 1984. Its funny I've seen all the sequels it spawned (except Salvation) but I had never watched the original. What with the rave reviews from others I thought what better time than to watch. Director James Cameron brought this film to the screen in an era before CGI was used extensively in these films. What you see is mostly real using models, masks and make up effects. Some of these effects have aged somewhat compared to modern movies but the film is still highly recommended.This film was one of Austrian bodybuilder cum 'actor' cum politician cum 'actor' again Arnold Schwarzenegger's biggest if not the biggest hit however it spawned an even better in my opinion Terminator 2 in 1991. One aspect that made me laugh was how a character called Kyle Reese (sent back to 1984 from a future world in 2027) confidently says that cyborg technology is invented some forty years from now. By my arithmetic that is only 9 years from now? I can't see it happening! Some of the fashions and nightclub music from the 1984 era seen in the film also made me laugh. The Kyle Reese character is played by Michael Biehn. It got me thinking. What happened to his career? An enjoyable film experience but not a classic in my opinion and for that I award it 7.By the way the arithmetic was on the date of this review. (27/11/2015).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Cyborg Assassin from the Future,"This film essentially begins in the future with a cyborg known simply as a ""Terminator"" (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) traveling back in time to 1984 with an assignment to kill a young woman named ""Sarah Connor"" (Linda Hamilton). The reason for this is that her continued existence is a direct threat to a collection of intelligent machines who want to destroy all mankind. So, to prevent this assassination from happening, a warrior named ""Kyle Reese"" (Michael Biehn) also makes the perilous journey through time to act as Linda's bodyguard. The problem is that the Terminator is nearly invincible and he will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a pretty good action film which should certainly satisfy most viewers looking for a movie of this sort as it consists of almost nonstop mayhem from start-to-finish.

Arnie was more enjoyable in the original because he seemed terrifying. The scenes where he gets shot, but just rises up were breathtaking.The acting, the dialogue and story were brilliant. One issue with the film, and the only I find, is the special effects in some scenes such as the cyborg's mask. It was obviously fake but it doesn't strike me that hard.

The best movie of the franchise,"Like many great film franchises the first is often the best. And there is a simple reason character development. Because like star wars, alien, ,the matrix, Halloween, what do these films have in common? The director was forced in a situation where they had to tell a great story on a budget and improvise to get the best out of everything from the score to the acting which made a tight script and not spectacle.The terminator has it in spades great action story all filmed on a small budget with great care to make every dollar work. Yes T2 is a better movie and more entertaining but the studio had to spend a hundred million dollars while the budget of this was mere 6.8 million dollars so in theory T2 should be at least 10 times better. Well it's not. But it certainly raises the bar and is more real. But T3 is literally is a remake of the terminator if James Cameron had the budget, time and special effects to truly put his original vision on screen it would be T2. This is also the only film in the franchise to be a horror movie in most aspects the glowing eyes firing Lazer beams killing people eating rats the unstoppable killer taking every one out in a police station to muffled noises of people dying and groning in pain, to just plain brutal murder of everyone who gets in the terminators way while he scrolls through the phone book for his next victim.

Original and Still the Best,"This movie has so many good action scenes, my favorite being the police massacre scene because it shows just how cold and relentless the Terminator is in pursuit of something it wants.This is definitely Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role yet. He has yet been able to top it off. His performance in T2 was alright but it wasn't typical Schwarzenegger. Michael Biehn probably gives his best performance here also. His role in Aliens was pretty awesome, too. He did take a turn in The Abyss by playing a bad guy. Linda Hamilton, an extremely underused actress plays probably her most convincing role of her career. Her performance in T2 was great, but it's sad that she won't be appearing in the T3.One final note about the Special Edition DVD. The many special features it has like the ""Terminated"" scenes and stuff is cool, but the sound quality of the remastered version is poor. The reason why I probably hate the remastered version so much is probably because I'm used to watching an old unmastered version of the movie that my dad taped off of Cinemax or HBO or something like that",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A slasher movie in disguise,"Terminator at first may look like another B-Movie of the 80's but its more than that. It's a masterpiece in storytelling combining the elements of action and sci-fi with those of a slasher.It has the T-800 having one specific target that is Sarah Conner with Kyle Reese being send from the future to protect her. He knows everything about the Terminator yet no one knows of the dangers it causes making him look like a nutcase everytime he is trying to warn people, but those that view him as such soon might rethink their viewpoint in case they survive an T-800 encounter. No one near Sarah Conner is save making the T-800 pretty much feel like an emotionless force of nature.The score and acting are incredible aswell. Minor flaws would be some aged effects but it doesn't bother me at all. Therefore I give The Terminator a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie has held up pretty well over time.,"I think the original premise of the Terminator was right one but over time they have changed it into something it is not while also becoming more PC correct in later versions. It is a shame that such a great ground breaking concept has been slowly eroded over time.One thing I do like about the later movies is that they have tried to keep Linda Hamilton and Arnold in the movies. At some point that will no longer be possible and the transition to new actors had been awkward. They set up new actors in the parts and then do not follow through with them which gives the franchise a time limit.I also have not liked how Linda Hamilton's part has gone from a girly girl learning to be strong to a strong butch character. Hollywood loves to take young new starlets that are America's sweethearts and ruin them. Every single American dream girl has changed into a rough and tough unattractive mess. Linda Hamilton is the worst example of this.Hollywood is more about who you know, what you are willing to do, how much personal freedom you are willing to give up on and off the set than a professional career for an actor.Admittedly, Linda has had a few personal problems since childhood so it is even more astonishing that she could play everyone's sweetheart early on. But Hollywood will use anyone for its own monetary gain. With all that, they made a great movie in the first three, and fairly well made sequels that are still mentionable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Terminator (1984),"Directed by James Cameron. Starring Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen, Bess Motta, Rick Rossovich, Dick Miller. (R)In arguably his most iconic role, Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as a cyborg sent back in time from a post-nuclear holocaust future to kill the mother (Hamilton) of the leader of the human resistance; Biehn is the human soldier that goes back to protect her. Pulse-pounding hybrid of science fiction, action and horror set a new standard for genre filmmaking going forward; like ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" before it (an influence on this film, per director Cameron), pic was made on a limited budget, but stretched the dollar for maximum stunt-and-special-effects spectacle. Effective blend of cold-blooded, hard-edged violence and surprisingly sensitive human interest; the characterizations may not be deep, and the paradoxes don't warrant scrutiny, but it's so fast-paced and well-made that such quibbles aren't worth worrying about. Major influence on the tech-noir style alongside ""Blade Runner,"" and firmly put its young, ambitious director on the map. Bill Paxton has a bit part as a street punk. Followed by several sequels, a television spin-off, comic book series, etc.88/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Magnificent,"James Cameron's masterpiece was made in 1984. The Terminator made Schwarzenegger star in Hollywood and at the same his trademark sentence ""I'll be back"" was created. I haven't so much experience about sci-fi movies (Star Wars maybe only exception) so I can't compare this film to other ones.In 2029 there is war between people and machines controlled by AI Skynet. A cyborg named Terminator (Schwarzenegger) comes from future to year 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She will be mother of John Connor, who is a leader of the resistance. The resistance also send their own soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to past. Terminator is very unemotional and brutal assassin. The Plot is very simple. On the other hand it isn't whole truth. There are many other things in the film. The Terminator is very exciting and scary film. A slowly rising tension and creepy music keep you tightly in their grip. Actors are very good. The film raises questions about robotics and nuclear war. There is a tragic romance between Sarah and Reese complementing the film.I don't find weaknesses. Definitely worth watching for everyone if action scenes aren't problem. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An absolute game changer for Sci-Fi action,"This is an absolute classic and it's a film that not only started a franchise, but spawned a concept that's spilled into all areas of modern cultural entertainment, let alone other movies.In the future, machines are the dominant force on earth. Human kind has practically been wiped out, all apart from small cells of freedom fighters and rebels, who all follow the lead of John Connor - an almost prophetic guerrilla leader who's standing up to the machines. To change the course of the human/ machine war, an assassin robot is sent back in time to kill the unborn leader's mother before he can be born and have any impact on the war. In order to counter this, and make sure that John Connor is born, a freedom fighter is also sent back in time, to stop the assassin robot. This is where things get tricky, certain actions from either machine or man could detrimentally affect the future and have a butterfly effect on the way things turn out - the future may not end up being the future while the past is in flux. Does that make sense?? (I tried explaining this to a friend in the early 90's and it just garnered blank expressions!).I'll start by saying that cast in this film is absolutely brilliant, everyone delivers a top class performance, for some people this film elevated them to superstar status allowing them to choose better movies that they may have previously had. The standout star in this film is undoubtedly Arnold Schwarzenegger. While he only had a few lines in the film that's all he actually needed as his mannerisms and demeanour are enough to portray brick-wall dominance and violence. It's probably fair to say that had he been given more lines, then this film may have been slightly spoiled, his English accent at the time wasn't brilliant, and the use of little dialogue lends well to portraying an emotionless machine intent on bringing death. Props also need to go to Michael Biehn, who acts as the story teller and the vehicle for the films pace, he's the freedom fighter sent from the future to protect Linda Hamilton's character, who is going to be the mother of the human resistance. A lot of people really got their big break here, from Arnie, to Biehn, Hamilton, even the likes of Bill Paxton and Lance Henrikson - some of who, carried on their relationship with directory Cameron in other movies.The look and feel of the film, the cinematography is splendid. Mainly filmed at night or in dark locations, set in urban areas, this really films like a dark and moody film. There are flashbacks (or flash forwards as it's from the future), that juxtapose the urban landscape with the warzone future that's yet to come. The CGI and special effects in the film are fantastic, while they look slightly dated now in places, at the time these were revolutionary and haunting. James Cameron does a brilliant job knitting together a great story with a top cast, great effects and fantastic visuals. Breaking the mould and making Sci-Fi bigger and better than ever, bringing the future to your current existence (while previous sci-fi classics have usually looked at being in the future already, or even space exploration) this almost smart but lethal, almost Orwellian, action chase film is an absolute masterpiece, and it's easy to see why, despite being low budget, it broke so many records and conventions - and spawned sequels, prequels, comics, TV series, as well as inspiring other parts of modern entertainment. Easily one of my favourite films of all time 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Stands the test of time,"Recently watched again as decent 2022 offerings have been few and far between and hadn't watched for a long time. My opinion has always been that T2 is the best in the series and I still believe that although I have enormous respect for the Inaugural movie. Dark. Gritty. Full of action and Undeniably 80's. Lacks the comedy that was gradually introduced in the sequel and taken to ridiculous levels in the terrible 3rd movie. But I think the more serious approach is what appeals to me about Schwarzenegger's first outing as the T101. He plays a brutal relentless killer, emotionless and satisfyingly true to the MO of a terminator. The special effects are of the era. But the movie hits so many good notes that it's easy to overlook the'hi tec' prosthetic's of 1984. Great movie. A Classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Machines vs Hearts: Revisiting The Terminator,"The Terminator is an iconic Hollywood property that blew the minds of teenagers who found ways to see it in the eighties. Despite its explosive reputation now, it was a bit of a gamble for the studio at the time, backed by a modest budget of $6.4 million-a factor that is evident in the effects, particularly in the future battleground scenes shot with miniatures. Terminator 2 followed with a budget more than 15 times larger, breaking new ground in special effects.The original film presents a grungy, guerrilla aesthetic, mostly shot at night and often filmed without the necessary permits. The story centres on a courageous man battling to save the future against a relentless machine. And what a machine! Arnold Schwarzenegger's Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Model 101, a remorseless tissue-moulded android (or flesh-wrapped robot), serves as the film's formidable antagonist. His standout moment may well be the storming of the police station, which may have drawn inspiration from Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), but his badassedness is established when he wipes the floor with Bill Paxton's punk leader.The movie boasts great action and humour-primarily through witty repartee-and takes us on a chaotic journey across an already dystopian modern day Los Angeles. From dimly lit malls to dark alleys inhabited by the homeless and high-tech assembly lines, the film immerses viewers in its world. At its emotional core, however, lies the accelerated romance between Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese and Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. Their rapport is established at lightning speed yet feels authentic. Connor shines as the kind-hearted but beleaguered waitress with leonine hair, who transforms into a formidable kick-assing warrior by the film's climax, fully justifying that iconic hairdo.While the obstacles faced by the production are readily visible, Cameron navigates them skillfully, treating them like a nimble bar-room moggy dancing between the glasses without knocking a single one over.The Terminator remains a compelling and highly original thrill ride, exploring themes of love, fate, and resilience that still resonate powerfully, it looms large in cinematic history forty years later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Compelling. Utterly.,"The ultimate success of Terminator is based on the casting of Schwarzenegger. Everybody knows that; and just a quick glance through the comments of IMDB users is enough to convince anyone that that is the majority view. But why? Surely any hulking brute could have filled the role just as amply? Answer - no. Arnie wasn't just born to play a cyborg because he had a pneumatic physique. On the contrary, it's his robotic austrian grasp of English, his total physical stiffness, and his face redolent of a Barbie Doll ""Ken"" on anabolic steroids that do it. In 1986, the real Arnie was little more than an android himself - so unwieldy that he'd had to tone down his workout for 'Conan' simply so as to be able to swing a sword comfortably. It's one reason why the play's most grating 'special effect' (the moquette head used to conduct the eye operation) paradoxically doesn't grate that much: it may look like bad Harryhausen; but then again so does Schwarzenegger.The film's other major selling-point is its gritty reality. Terminator had low production values; and the result is a city and characters that don't look like they've been made up to look normal, but just convince naturally. Lance Henirksen, Paul Winfield and Earl Boen do a great job as fatigued, bored, caffeine/nicotine dependent middle-rankers caught up in something which they simply do not understand until it's far too late. The fact that the film only depicts the future post-apocalypse in the odd isolated scene or two (which really don't do anything for the film apart from make the limitations of its budget that bit more noticeable) keeps it firmly seated in the 80s. Someone said that the 80s are now more alien to us than a mesolithic culture. I don't agree with that in the slightest; but I vaguely see what he's getting at when I see 80s LA in Terminator; though familiar, it's cold, unfriendly, and deeply threatening. The 'First Encounter' sequence in the night-club builds up an almost unbearable sense of tension with its muffled background acoustic rock, the blood-red disco lighting, and the slow-motion photography, which suddenly explodes into full-speed, frenetic action, and the audience's terror, pent up for a good twenty minutes or more, gets a chance to release itself as Michael Biehn blasts Arnie out through the window with his shotgun, each volley almost prompting a relieved scream of encouragement mixed with fear from the viewer.Everything else slots into place very nicely: the music is brooding and, as someone else rightly puts it lower down, primitive in a mechanical way; reflecting the Terminator's quasi-primal relentlessness. Unlike T2, none of the action sequences look contrived; the sequel has a tendency to lose itself up its own sphincter with John-Woo style shots; cf Arnie's boot trampling the rose bouquet in slo-mo in the shopping mall. T1 has none of this. It is exciting, yet somehow faintly believable. There is no attempt to make the camera-work 'speak' in any way: the director is simply content to let the camera rest on the Terminator, who speaks well enough for himself. Add in the odd bit of black humour (""you're dead, honey"", quips Sarah's work chum as they view the news of the Terminator's first strike on TV) and you have an extremely compelling film. I defy anyone to watch the first ten minutes and not sit through the rest. The whole premise of the Terminator's invincibility leaves us on tenterhooks throughout, wondering how the hell he CAN be stopped. The sense of relief when it eventually succumbs is overwhelming, and postively catharthic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One of science fiction's best movies.,"Excellent, excellent film. For being over twenty years old, the effects hold up well. The lovely Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are perfect for their roles. Few movies are better paced as The Terminator boasts some of the finest lines and visuals in film history. I suggest to anyone who is interested in science fiction, that you must watch this movie.It's Los Angeles and 1984. Two beings from the future, one a killing cyborg, the other a skilled fighting human, come to the present seeking the same woman, Sarah Connor. She holds the key to the future in her son, who's not even a thought to her mind before the cyborg starts killing every Sarah Connor in the phone book.What makes Terminator a science fiction classic is how you can compare the movie to real life. Before computers became a mandatory household luxury, there was already a vision that we would overly rely on them and this movie does an excellent job in giving us a fantastic worst-case scenario, playing on our fears and imagination. The scene at the police station is one of my personal favorites. The music is excellent, the direction is sharp, and everyone is in top form.

A timeless classic,"Ah yes the original Terminator film of 1984. It is sometimes hard to write a review for a film where lots has been said. My opinion of this film is an opinion known by many as many people share the same I opinion I have. Yes, The Terminator is one of the best films I have ever seen.The Terminator was directed and written by James Cameron who was not very well known at the time. Of course, now these days he is often considered by many to be one of the greatest movie directors of all time with movies like Titanic, Avatar, and Aliens just to name a few. The film notably stars Arnold Schwarzenegger ,who had previously starred in the Conan movies, as the killer cyborg. The film also stars Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn whose carrers would start thanks to this film. The film had a some what small budget of 6 million dollars and was a box office hit upon release and the film was popular enough to spawn sequels.The film is about a war that happened in the future (2029). It was a war between man and machine. The world is a wasteland and the humans take refuge and fight for their lives. The humans are lead by John Connor and the machines are not happy with that so they send a cyborg back in time to the year 1984 to prevent the existence of John Connor by killing his mother before he is born. The humans send a protector to protect Sarah Connor. What we get is over an hour and a half of fast paced, sci fi action.I just love everything about this film. First, the music. Brad Fiedel created one of the best theme songs ever to be put in a movie and not just the main theme, but the whole soundtrack. Each song works well with their scenes. Second, the overall tone. The tone of this film is dark, with most of the scenes taking place at night. It gives a sense of not knowing what the future holds for anybody. You see people living their lives not knowing that the world will be a wasteland. Third, the action scenes. While the sequels are more heavy on action, this film tends to be sci fi heavy. That is not to say that there isn't action because there is plenty of it. Everything from the Tech-Noir scene, the Police Station scene, even the big chase scene and the film's finale are all truly spectacular. There is never a dull moment. Fourth, the ability to hold my attention at all times. Every single bit of this film holds my attention. When Kyle has his flashbacks, I want to know about what his time is like and by showing me what it is like, the film has got my attention. Other great things include the acting. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fantastic job as the Terminator. He truly is menacing and quite scary in fact. Even Bill Paxton does a great job even though he had the smallest part in the film! The effects of this film are great as well. Certain effects have not aged entirely well but I tend to overlook that because they were impressive for the time and do remember that the film was on a 6 million dollar budget.In conclusion, The Terminator is a timeless classic that excels in every aspect. I think the Library of Congress said it best when this film was selected for preservation for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Terminator is entertaining from start to finish with suspense, sci fi action, and a fantastic story overall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A great noir film,"I had only seen Avatar and Titanic when I, watching TV found True Lies. It was a great spy film and I enjoyed it. The next day I watched Titanic, as excellent as ever. Then I thought about watching other James Cameron films.He s definitely a genius and while waiting for Avatar 2, I watched The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The basic idea of the film is that in the future most of humanity has been wiped out by machines. A brave man named John leads the human resistance against the machines. Machines are nearly wiped out, when they send the Terminator, an almost unstoppable cyborg back in time with one goal:murder Sarah , the future mother of John. By doing so, humans would already be wiped out. However, a human called Kyle Reese is also transported back in time to save Sarah. The film is great and I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A classic,"Here we go with another review of a favorite of mine. Terminator is an old but gold type of film. You get corny one liners that are still in use by the general public for comedic purposes, you get the bullets and explosion action, and you get a solid plot all packed into one film. There's not much to dislike with the film except for that the effects are a bit dated, but not for it's time of production and that doesn't change how good of a movie it still is. As most of you reading this already know, this is the movie that everyone familiarizes Arnold Schwarzenegger with. According to IMDb, Schwarzenegger even stated that ""the Terminator is a defining work in my career"" and most of us couldn't agree more. This movie was also nominated for 6 awards and won 8 awards which to me seems a little underwhelming. But whatever the case may be I really enjoyed this movie and I encourage those of you who have not seen it to give it a watch.What's it about: A human soldier sent from the future of 2029 to the year 1984 is tasked with protecting a young woman, with which her unborn child is impertinent to the future of the humans salvation, from being killed by a ruthless cyborg called a Terminator.What's the message: This is a message about fighting what would be considered impossible odds. When things seem impossible we just can't give up. A lot of us have fought or are fighting the impossible so that we can see a brighter future for ourselves.What to know before you watch:Profanity is moderateSex & nudity is moderateViolence & Gore is moderateOther scores:MetacriticMetascore: 84%User Score: 7.6/10Rotten TomatoesTomatometer: 100%Audience Score: 89%My scoresBiased: 9/10Unbiased: 8/10Rewatch value: 5/5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Holds up well in 2024,"""The Terminator"" is pure action, philosophy, and entertainment all in one. Forty years later, it holds up well today and reminds you why and how Arnold Schwarzenegger is an instant movie star. The theme is quite prophetic and even predates the concepts introduced in ""Back to the Future."" In this movie though, things have a serious, more foreboding tone that makes you question whether the year 2029 in the movie could indeed turn into reality. It's just around the corner, folks. Could it really happen? Well it's all fodder for speculation, albeit a very compelling one with the quick advent of ChatGPT in the past year and a half, now Sora, and the soon to be revealed AGI ( Artificial General Intelligence).

"Great, just GREAT!","This is one of the FEW Sci-Fi movies I have watched over and over and over and (you get the point (others like it are CONTACT))... Although the plot is highly unrealistic (at least I think so), it makes you think ""Do we entrust computers with too much? Should we make them so ""smart"" that they can do most stuff for us?"" This is one of the movies where I am impressed with Arnold... He plays his role almost PERFECT (hardly any lines, just a cold, rutheless killing-machine). And Linda plays her role exelently too.The movies has a lot of everything needed for a good action flick: lots of action, lots of explosions and lots of chasing/stalking (and a tad of love), but it manages to balance in the grey area between too much and too little, making this a true masterpiece.The story of a world overrun by 'borgs, using the few remaining ""fleshies"" as slaves can easily get boring, but this movie keeps the excitement up from beginning 'till end...

The Birth of Machine-Fiction,"This is the first successful debut of Cameron as director. And he did it really nice. I am personally a man of movie taste, that really likes originality as the basic aspect. In this year (2010's), however, there are so many copycats in cinema. The rebirth of idea, is so rotten, that even the visual-effects is brand-new, the story is unpleasantly same. I just can't watch movie like that. Fortunately, I've found the era of idea treasure, it was in 1980's, the new beginning of action and science fiction. ""The Terminator"", is one of the first notable movie that defines its decade. It is somehow full of explosion, but still pay attention in its screenplay. Yeah, I know that the acting is not that good, but just be honest, the robot's acting, good or bad it is always the same. Don't mind the acting from the robot character, at least for this movie. A little awkward act don't break the entire movie, but there are other reasons that make it worth eight out of ten. My general statement for this film is astonishingly creative from the screenplay until the editing, mind the acting.Usually, it's hard to make something new even in the movie, and it is harder to be accepted by the general audience. But, I think it is just came at the exact time. From the time-line of cinema we know that ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"" have started the trend of science fiction in the late 1970's. But, the firework of this genre is begin in 1980's, when there are so many ""scientific"" creature that starred the movie. From robot, UFO, alien, etc. So do the action-genre, it also began in 1980's, ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"" hit the movie-lovers with not so familiar genre. It can be concluded that ""The Terminator"" came at the right time. When the hype of all the trend is high, it released as one of the science fiction node. Just think, everyone, no matter who, must have been heard about this movie. It's just another effect of the trend. Even until now, they keep airing this movie over and over. Just for introduce the original-sequel of epic fiction.Let's talk about the movie itself. Don't worry, it's still human enough. Of all, the science fiction aspect I just love the future- fairy-tale spoken by future human. And, the unaccepted story by the nowadays human, that's all I mean in that movie. The feeling of being alone in the world, trapped in another world that nobody would care of you. Yeah, that pain only available in story, or in reality if we truly experienced it. The action is so incredible, society realizes another kind of suspense, the fast scene with so many explosion. That's the modern suspense. With the climax in the end of the movie and obvious yet unbeatable enemy, just other classic aspects of ""The Terminator"". In fact, it's the Cameron style to provide such a splendid cinema experience, that I think everyone would sit and watch until the movie is ended. Brilliant directing skill in middle era of cinema.Nevertheless, it is the birth of machine-fiction. I just admire the very idea, combined with technical aspects, this movie is nothing but pleasantly-sharp.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best science fiction movie ever.,"This movie has the best hero and one of the best villains in the history of science fiction movies or any movies in general. Kyle Reese(the hero played by Michael Biehn) is the greatest. He crossed time, with no chance of going back, to protect a woman he never meet. The woman is Sarah Connor. She is to be the mother of John Connor, humanity's leader in the war against the machines. This man has tremendous courage. He has to go back without weapons or clothing to face a Terminator, so Sarah can live. Arnold is absolutely terrifying as the unstoppable machine. Even though people have been seeing parodies of his portrayel for nearly twenty years, his performance is still powerful. The ending is perfect.

Sci-Fi/Horror masterpiece!,"First of all, what is with all the reviews mentioning dated CGI? There is no CGI in this movie. Everything is practical effects or stop motion animation. Even for its time the effects were low budget as this was a small independent film. For its budget and what they had to work with, the effects are incredibly effective and way ahead of their time.As for the movie itself, it's a brilliant film that delivers scares, action, drama, and a mind blowing time loop ending. The film begins as a typical horror film, starting with the villain out to kill, the hero trying to save, and the victim trying to survive. But as the film progresses it flips convention on its head. The story builds upon itself with complicated layers, creating an epic & interesting mythology, and delivering emotional stakes that films of this genre often lack.The Terminator is one of the best films ever made.

It can be considered like a bit of a horror flick that gives you a sense of suspense that can terrify you, and then there's extremely awesome action scenes that not only are entertaining but help the movie engage to extreme levels of creativity that advance the plot.

A tense sci-fi tech-noir thriller,"The film's premise supposedly came in a dream when Cameron fell ill during the release of his first film, Piranha II: The Spawning (1982). The dream involved a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s television series The Outer Limits, and films such as The Driver (1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981). I wonder if the 1960s film Cyborg 2087 starring Michael Rennie was also an inspiration.Filming, took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles. While shooting the film, Cameron would employ what he termed ""guerilla film-making"" tactics in order to get around the need for permits to film certain scenes.The special effects included miniatures and stop-motion animation and were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.Schwarzenegger prepared for the role by training with guns every day for a month. He practised for two weeks stripping and reassembling guns blindfolded until his actions became automatic.The Terminator soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel who said it reflected the mechanical man and his heartbeat""Of particular relevance to audiences in the 21st Century is the film's exploration of the potential dangers surrounding the development and evolution of technology. Many people these days are fearful of the possibility of being dominated by artificial intelligence and having their lives regulated by algorithms.As to the concept of time travel and changing the future? Did Reece and Sarah succeed in preventing the future destruction of humanity by preventing the Terminator from changing the past? And what of the Terminator's arm that was not crushed by the hydraulic press? Did it provide the basis for the future machine take-over process to start due to reverse-engineering?

This gives us the origins of Sarah Connor and her struggle against the machines. This has to be one of my favorite Arnie films; this and T2. It's also one of my favorite James Cameron sci-fi films, along with Aliens and Avatar. Though Arnie is portrayed as a villain in this one, he literally steals the show. And the special effects by Stan Winston are good too. I'll keep this one and the second one as my favorite Arnie Terminator films and avoid the others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
He'll be back.,"Since 'The Terminator (1984)' is so iconic, it's easy to forget just how downright solid its storytelling really is. I mean, the core concept alone is so 'out there' that it's a miracle it's as house-held as it currently is. It's really clever stuff. Basically, the feature takes the tropes of the 'slasher' genre and tells them through a science-fiction lens, with the classic 'unstoppable killer' literally being an unstoppable killing machine. The eponymous 'Terminator' doesn't think or feel and it has no sense of self-preservation. It exists for one purpose only: to kill the protagonist. All of this is excellently conveyed through performance (I needn't even mention Schwarzenegger), action and dialogue; the film takes its antagonist seriously so so do we. This makes for a tense and engaging experience that's effortlessly propelled by its world-building. This alone would make for a compelling story, but Cameron wasn't content with keeping things that simple. Instead, he decided to create one of the most satisfying time-travel narratives to date. The whole thing feels incredibly insular yet decidedly massive, as the relatively small-stakes central plot is perpetuated only by its context within the large-scale 'future war' and its world-ending consequences. Indeed, the flick is rather bold in its decision not to tie victory directly into 'saving of the world', rather to ensuring that it only gets destroyed so much: the nuclear war is inevitable but, eventually, the human resistance can win if it's allowed to exist in the first place. Having both the small-scale, in-the-moment, horror-driven elements and the near-intangible, sweeping, science-fiction stuff run simultaneously allows for a wonderfully unique and uniquely wonderful experience. Biehn's future-fighter, 'Reese', is a remarkably interesting character. The way he remembers things that haven't happened yet, his infrequent yet effective flashbacks to the post-apocalyptic future and the way he interacts with a version of a historical figure who has yet to do any of the things she's famous for are all intriguing and well-written. Also, the way he is used to convey exposition is particularly good, as it naturally hints at a much wider world than the budget could afford. Carter's 'Conner' initially comes across as a relatively generic 'final girl' but slowly garners more agency, culminating in a showdown that sees her finally accept what she must do to survive and do it with style. Her romance with 'Reese' is rushed, feels forced and, generally, could have been developed further, especially since it's integral to the story. Its introduction also marks a slower portion of the piece. Still, these issues are small when stacked against the flick's many positives. Overall, it's tense, exciting and enjoyable. It's a mash-up of many genres (including 'action', I'll add) that works far better than you might expect. Plus, its story, as iconic as it is, really is fantastic. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
James Cameron has created a film that sweats the 80s.,"Sometimes badly aged, sometimes a little better, it is, with the necessary hindsight, a good film, without being a film of genius. The plot, first of all, is quite simplistic, does not have time to get into the movie and points and characters that could have been extensively developed are ultimately almost details or extras, and takes away interests and intelligibility for the film.The characters are not very well developed, we don't really have time to be moved by others but, all that aside, the scenario is original, and is located halfway between thriller and pure science fiction. The theme of machine control, destruction, atomic warfare is very present and bears witness to its time. The acting is pretty good, although Reese is hard to take for anything other than a serial killer, given his looks and expressions. The film is not very original of its time from the point of view of the image and the framing, but no doubt that the special effects must have been formidable for the time. But only for the time. Today the inlays and special effects seem to have aged very badly.The film's atmosphere is gripping and takes on accents of sincerity with the help if small details scattered throughout the film which are really a way of making it better. The music is correct, nothing more, and at the end of the film we don't really remember a general theme that could be emblematic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The unstoppable cult icon.,"Schwarzenegger; love him or hate him you have to give him credit for knowing what he is and what he isn't. He knows his acting presence is never going to be mentioned with the same breathless awe of Meryl Streep. Arnie does a great job of choosing roles that suit him perfectly. One of those roles is the near monk-like silence of the cult classic killing machine known as the Terminator.We can overlook the fact that Skynet chose to send back a Terminator with a heavy Austrian accent to 1980's America because over the twenty or so times I have seen this film I really could not care less. This is probably Schwarzenegger's greatest film. The role doesn't ask too much of him and he plays it perfectly. As soon as Arnie is teleported, crouching fully naked beside a dump truck he is the Terminator. Many people would demean him, claiming it only works because he cannot act. I disagree. Acting is making the viewer believe and whilst watching this film you don't see former Mr Universe, you see an unstoppable cyborg killer would will not stop and not rest until he has completed his task.What works for The Terminator is the simple premise and James Cameron's ability to put a new spin on something we've seen before. He did it with Alien and like it or not he did it with Avatar. The rules of time travel are well worked out and simply explained. Nothing dead can travel back in time (Hence why we get treated to Arnie and Michael Biehn's buttocks at the start of the film). The Terminator itself cheats this rule by being living organism over metal skeleton.Perhaps most striking about this film, given that it was made in the action hero 1980s where machine gun wielding bodybuilders was the norm, is that the hero character is female. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now an icon. She's not the atypical screaming woman who's running up the stairs instead of out the door. She's a normal woman, working part time at a diner, living with a roommate and struggling to find a boyfriend that isn't more concerned about his car. When the time comes, she steps up to the demands of the film. She never thought she could be a hero or brave or fight a cyborg from the future but she does all of these things and the film is really about her and her journey.Much of the colour and explanation comes from the haunted but utterly devoted Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who successfully balances the forlornness of the future with his love for Sarah and determined resolve to protect her. He is the underdog in this fight and it's hard not to root for someone so passionate.A supporting cast of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen as the psychiatrist add a light-heartiness to a very bleak and depressing environment. It works. Cameron's direction and pacing transition well between visions of a possible future and the unravelling present.There is a reason this film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry a requisite being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant'. The Terminator is all these things. It is a film that has referenced and inspired so many others and if it's not on your list of films to watch before you die, then you are a fool.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Necessity is the mother of invention,"Yes, T2 is one of the greatest sequels of all time. Yes, the Terminator franchise has more garbage thrown in it than even Cameron thought was possible back in 1984. Yes, Arnie never looked better on screen than when he was playing an emotionless robot. None of that detracts from the masterpiece that is The Terminator though.This was a time when James Cameron was trying to make it in Hollywood. This was a guy who, to make ends meet during filming, would go to Macdonalds with a 2 for 1 voucher, eat one Big Mac that day and save the other Big Mac for the next day. Necessity truly is the mother of invention. Cameron needed to create a masterpiece to solidify his place in Hollywood and in making The Terminator he did just that.Everyone puts in a stellar performance here and though the special effects leave a lot to be desired today it's safe to say that it doesn't detract from the relentless mercilessness of the killing machine that Arnie portrays.

Terminator? Darn Near Killed Her!,"Lean, mean and efficient. Like its title-character, so is James Cameron's breakthrough film, ""The Terminator."" Securing its status as a sci-fi classic almost immediately upon impact, it made a star out of a certain Austrian bodybuilder, introduced Hollywood to one of the finest blockbuster directors of our time and forever changed the landscape of both the science fiction and action genres.The film opens with a muscle-bound machine -- or a ""Terminator"" as they are more commonly known -- (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arriving in Los Angeles, strictly for business purposes. It seems he has been sent back in time after his creators -- the man-made machines that have taken over and enslaved civilization -- have exhausted all their resources in trying to squash a pesky pest in resistance leader John Connor. His mission: destroy Connor's mother, (Linda Hamilton) before he has even been conceptualized, thus ensuring victory for all machine kind. Soon enough the bad bot finds a thorn in his side, as the resistance has found a way to send one of their own, a solider by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), back in time to preserve the future fruit of Miss Connor's loins.What is often forgotten about the film amidst its cultural impact is just how tightly-paced and well oiled it really is. There truly isn't a moment of fat to be found here. Keeping things under the two hour mark, Cameron crams just as much action as he does character into the film. Sure, there are action scenes galore and you can bet it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Crucial to the film's success though are moments where the film breathes, letting in moments of social commentary and humor like fresh air at all the right moments. To be sure, the Terminator's pursuit of Kyle and Sarah is made all the more intense because you believe in them and are placed amidst the chaos via your own investment in the characters.While Schwarzenegger is absolutely unforgettable as the unstoppable killing machine, the film is certainly helped a great deal by Biehn's intensity and commitment to material that may have sounded ridiculous on paper. Hamilton plays it straight as the girl-next-door type caught in the crossfire. Shame her career never really extended beyond this film and its sequel, as she really embodies a character you want to root for. Of course, none of this would even matter if not for Cameron's knack for white-knuckled action and tension. Almost like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" with a robot, the film is stripped down and singularly focused. As Reese states early on, The Terminator will not stop until Sarah is dead. Keeping true to such a theme, the film is intense from front to back.While there are certainly things that date the film -- some rough effects by today's standards, Linda Hamilton looking a bit like Joe Dirt -- it has held up remarkably well over the years. At close to 30 years of age, there are few films that have come along in its wake that can even compare. Even if you've seen it a hundred times, it still entertains like few films of its ilk can. Truly a bonafide classic, ""The Terminator"" stands in a class by its own. Be sure to look out for the equally awesome sequel, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but beware of the diminishing returns brought on by two later sequels and a well-meaning but utterly unnecessary TV series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still a damn fine movie nearly twenty years later.,"Just caught yet another re-run of The Terminator on late night TV. Gotta say, this film still delivers the goods nearly twenty years after its release.Okay, so the 80's hairstyles and the god-awful fashion date it a little, and the story has been mimicked, plagurised and downright ripped-off dozens of times by now, but essentially this is still as lean and mean as it ever was.In fact, when you compare both the original and the awesome sequel, T2, to the likes of The Matrix, this flick still reigns supreme as an astonishingly well-crafted (given the meagre budget) masterclass in how to marry complex exposition to unrelenting action, without resorting to flashy gimmickery or million dollar excesses.Director James Cameron's ability to deliver the movie's sometimes weighty exposition without slowing the plot down is still a joy to behold, and the performances endure as knockouts all round - you really can still identify and believe in Kyle and Sarah's plight.Yeah, I'll grant you that the effects work in the finale does look a little ropey, what with the advent of CGI, but even by today's standards, The Terminator is still a classic to be reckoned with, the technical effects work alone being near miraculous in their execution given the limited finances available.In an era of formulaic junk cramming the multiplexes in the name of entertainment, The Terminator is still simultaneously smart, thrilling and iconic.

Among the Best,The Terminator launched an era of sci-fi action and endless copy cats that never lived up to the originals. The film sets a lone soldier Kyle Reese who is sent back through time to protect a woman Sarah Connor who has a important destiny in the future. His opponent is a half human half machine programmed to kill Sarah at all cost. The film is both quite violent yet blends a romantic story within it's plot that is touching and central to the story. For a film of the middle 1980's the visual effects are still good yet somewhat dated but when this film first appeared they were amazing. Stan Winston was a master of animatronics and makeup effects and his work shines here. Arnold Schwarzenegger comes off well as the emotionless machine and is well balanced by Micheal Biehn's passionate Reese. Linda Hamilton completes the trio and does solid acting as a confused and scared Sarah Connor who finds her world and reality crumbling as the film progresses toward it's conclusion. This film defined Arnold as action star and coined one of the most well known one liners in Hollywood history.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""The Terminator"" (1984): A Timeless Sci-Fi Masterpiece","James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" is a quintessential science fiction film that transcends time and continues to captivate audiences decades after its release.

A pretty cool Sci-Fi movie to watch.,"I didn't see this till 2005. Since there was no way I could of seen it before since it's rated R.Anyways this is a cool movie. And the title that Arnold is famous for.This is taken place in L.A. of 1984. Out of nowhere a man appears out of thin air. And something about him isn't human. In another area another man appears out of thin air, and seems to act more human. At the other side of town an ordinary woman named Sarah Conner is your average girl of the 80s. Little does she know that her life will soon change forever.She hears the news about 2 woman getting murdered, it didn't seem too important to her, except those 2 victims are both named Sarah Conner. She soon gets the bad feeling that the killer will be after her next. Once she encounters the killer she gets saved by a man named Kyle Reese, who was given orders to protect her from the killer who is in fact a lethal machine from the future called a Terminator.Terminator is indeed a classic Sci-Fi film. I recommend this to those who like Sci-Fi flicks or 80s theme stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi at its best,"The Terminator is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. The story revolves around an innocent woman in 1984. Her life has great significance in the years to come. Two soldiers are sent from the future, one to protect her and one to terminate her. Of course she falls in love with the one sent to protect her and the one sent to destroy her? This guy just happens to be an unstoppable, unkillable machine.....its Arnie at his best, its sci-fi at its best, its my favourite film ever....can't wait till T3 in 2002",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""That's what it does! That's ALL it does!""","A genuinely iconic film that made the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It let Schwarzenegger slip the bounds of his very limited niche as a bodybuilder and made him an action star. Cameron didn't seem to see it as a science fiction film, but it is now a classic in that genre. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were fantastic as well. There are a lot of comments about plot holes, but there are always going to be possible paradoxes when it comes to time travel movies/books. The effects were pretty awesome for 1984. The terminator itself, with its relentless focus on its mission, has also become an iconic character/idea. You really have to give Cameron his props for imagination. Note to Cameron: There is probably an entire movie waiting to be made in the 2029 world of John Conner/humans vs. Skynet/HK's/terminators.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The birth of a legend,"I have never seen Piranha II: The Spawning, and to be honest it's not high on my priority list. So to my way of thinking, this is James Cameron's real directoral debut. And what an opening it is.To be just, it really shows its obvious budget limitations at times. The calibre of the action is occasionally lethargic and under-edited, which I'd bet meant there wasn't time or money to shoot and edit more aggressively. For most films, that would be it. But The Terminator has enough brains in its scripting and execution that the film as a whole remains a choice offering. The dystopian theme of the merciless future coming back to haunt the unsuspecting past makes this a deserved classic, and Cameron shows are rare budgeting genius as to what he can and cannot show to keep his audience impressed and off-balance (he knows we'll accept the time travel and the future with minimal evidence, but we'll never forgive him if we don't see the robot under there, so that's where he put all the money).What's more, the actors give it a sense of just plain fun. Linda Hamilton may embody the 80s blond toy look at first, but soon shows herself to made of much firmer stuff. Michael Biehn has never received the attention he deserved after this film. He creates a completely different kind of soldier-hero, sensitive and vulnerable, deadly with the agility of a cat rather than channeling John Wayne. In fact, in the greatest of this movie's tricks on its audience, all the traditional macho hero requirements are fulfilled admirably by Arnold Schwarzenegger the killing machine. It makes one wonder about the spirit in which Cameron contributed to that Rambo screenplay.In the final analysis, The Terminator is not to be missed by anyone who presumes to say they enjoy movies. It's a good one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My favourtie movie ever,"This movie is still my all time favourite....the plot is pretty simpleAn innocent woman called Sarah Connor in 1984 is targeted for assasination in the future where a war is happening between humanity and machines.  The machines target her because she will give birth to John Connor, he is humanitys last hope.  The humans send a soldier called Kyle Reese to protect her, he has fallen in love with Sarah from a photgraph he has of her as he says to her 'I came across time for you Sarah'This film has everything the tension is remarkable, it is dark and brutal and yet there is still time for a love story.  All the actors put in great performances.  Especially Arnie who is genuinelly scary as The Terminator. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Waitress' Rage Against the Machine,"A ruthless, relentless killer robot from the future arrives in 1984 to assassinate a waitress. This basically summarizes The Terminator, an adrenaline-pumping sci-fi classic that's aged like a fine wine.The performances of the two leads are nothing short of mechanical perfection. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an absolute machine-literally. He's got this icy, deadpan expression and iconic killer catchphrases throughout the movie that's both terrifying and oddly hilarious. Linda Hamilton's transformation from a regular waitress to a fierce, survivalist warrior is a character arc that's worth every second of screen time. She's not just a damsel in distress; she's the real deal, and her evolution is one of the film's highlights.The Terminator also raises some thought-provoking questions about artificial intelligence, the future, and our own capacity for destruction. It's not all ""Hasta la vista, baby""; there's some meaty stuff to chew on if you're into that sort of thing. There are moments when the '80s fashion and special effects might make you chuckle, but hey, it's all part of the charm. And let's not forget the synthesizer-heavy soundtrack-it's like a time capsule of '80s awesomeness.James Cameron, the director, deserves some serious credit here. The way he combines action, suspense, and sci-fi elements is nothing short of groundbreaking. The film's relentless pace keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the practical effects and stunts still hold up today. It's a thrilling, action-packed ride with a dash of dark humor, and it's a must-watch for anyone who loves a good dose of time-traveling mayhem. So, if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. You won't be back; you'll be glued to the screen from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terminator the movie which always gives me goosebumps,"The Terminator is a science fiction action film directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.This movie is the first movie of the Terminator series.One of the best Sci-Fi action movie with strong acting and great ending. The movie is excellent movie and considering the movie was been made with limited budget and no VFX the movie is purely magical.Acting is strong and Arnold Schwarzenegger was as usual superb and had the job with great perfection, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were also equally impressive with Linda Hamilton being more better among the two.Screenplay of the movie is gripping and the climax is strong, the movie also has a mesmerizing music and a strong background music.This is one of my Favorite movie which i can watch many times. A Must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A very fun romp through chase scenes by an evil robot from the future.,"I thought it was pretty cool how The Terminator premiered in the same year as another slasher film, A Nightmare on Elm Street. However, that movie is supernatural horror while this is science fiction horror. In The Terminator, the plot is always on the move - just like the main characters trying to get away from the T-800. Kyle Reese told Sarah Connor all she needs to know about the future he is from and the Terminator while he is driving her away from the Terminator. Arnold Schwarzenegger was worried that playing a villain would be terrible for his acting career, but he turned out to like playing the bad guy for once and he had the right body to play a strong robot who looked like a human. However, his one condition for James Cameron getting him back for Terminator 2 was that his T-800 character would become the hero protecting Sarah Connor from a new Terminator villain. In the 1-hour ""Other Voices"" documentary from the The Terminator DVD, I learned that Linda Hamilton really broke her ankle during filming, which meant all of her running scenes were filmed late in the schedule, and that made the peril of those moments feel even more real to me when I know why Sarah was having a hard time running away from a huge truck and carrying Kyle Reese at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I love robots,"This looks and sounds so eighties! It is the epitome of the decade. The hair, the production design, the effects, everything in this film is defined by and defines the eighties. Not that it's a bad thing, it is good to be distinctive. The sound design is excellent, surprisingly good considering the age. The music fits with the tone but I did find it a touch synth which comes across as a bit cheesy. The story is actually really strong and incredibly well told. I love time travel and robots! The future war scenes compliment and contrast the eighties perfectly. The slow menacing stalker makes this feel a little like a slasher horror movie, again a very good thing. My only real gripe is that it is occasionally a little slow. Overall it really is an awesome film that never ceases to entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I'll be back,"The phrase ""I'll be back"" conjures up pretty much one image in today's world; yes, that of the first of the Terminator series of movies in which Arnold plays different facets of machines in mans' clothing.Nighttime, wind, and electricity swirl around and the appetence of a naked Any (Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Frightening in itself but only a taste of what is to come. It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one is being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.What is so intriguing about the Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton)?Who will find her first the police or the Terminator?What effect can the outcome have on humankind?I thought Arnold's accent added to the character of the movie. It is the way one says ""I'll be back"" that adds the threat.Even though this is the best of the series of movies as the first usually is, you will want to watch the others for variations on this theme.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
