Val Kilmer's Magnum Opus,"The Doors is unapologetically a film about sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. For 140 minutes we follow Doors singer Jim Morrison from his days as an aspiring film student at UCLA to his death in Paris in 1970 at the age of 27. Writer-director Oliver Stone based the story of the film on some 150 transcripts detailing the life and character of Morrison. The result is far from flattering. The Doors paints a picture of a man enamored with death, his own inevitable demise more a relief than an agony.Death stalks Morrison wherever he goes from a young age. As a child driving through the New Mexico desert with his family, Morrison happens across the site of a car accident littered with dead and dying Navahos. We watch the young Morrison endure what seems to be a sort of possession rite by spirits of the dead natives. Years later he'll profess to be a shaman and from what we see on screen, he might well have believed it to be true. Native American spirits dance alongside Morrison as he sings on stage. Whether these were real or simply an acid fueled hallucination is left deliberately unclear by Stone. Likewise, a death-like character (Richard Rutowski) shadows Morrison throughout his life as a rock singer. Whether this indicates Morrison saw death as a friend, was actually accompanied by Rutowski (who was a real life friend of Morrison), or was simply hallucinating remains ambiguous. What is clear is the following: in his great desire to self destruct, Morrison drank whiskey like water and spent an inordinate amount of time on precarious ledges outside Hotel windows thirty stories up.Kilmer's performance as Morrison is easily the finest of his career. Raw, nervy, deliberately off putting and confrontational, moments of sobriety are few are far between for this insecure egomaniac. At times I didn't feel as though I was watching a portrayal of a character long deceased so much as a documentary. From threatening suicide repeatedly to quarreling constantly with police at concerts, scenes of bad behavior are many but moments of insight are few and far between. This doesn't seem a shortcoming on behalf of director Stone so much as an accurate depiction of the highly acidic Morrison as he truly was; this was a man who didn't want to be understood. This was an artist on the constant edge of oblivion; an iconoclast who refused to be loved and was close to intolerable whenever possible. Of course it's less than a pleasant experience following the venomous creature that Morrison became for the film's final hour as he goes from alcohol induced nervous breakdown to drug fueled indecent exposure, but I for one appreciate Stone's refusal to Hollywoodize the life and death of Morrison. Kilmer abandons completely all instinct for self preservation on screen, submerging himself in a performance that can only be described as his magnum opus.Meg Ryan leads the supporting cast as Pamela ""Morrison"" Courson, Morrison's longtime lover and common-law wife. Ryan seems lost in the role but thankfully spends a minimal amount of time on screen as Morrison was a firm supporter of the ""free love"" social movement. Indeed, he spends more time with journalist and witchcraft enthusiast Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan), an amalgam of several Morrison lovers who suffered through his frequent alcohol and drug induced impotence. A very fine Michael Madsen is wasted as actor Tom Baker, a friend of Morrison's whose relationship is grossly underdeveloped. The only performance among the supporting cast worthy of praise is that of quirky character actor Crispin Glover in a cameo as Andy Warhol, a scene that is absolutely spellbinding.Some may criticize The Doors for glamorizing a life of excess; this film gives younger viewers the idea that drugs and promiscuous sex are fun, critics may charge. Those who would are missing the point entirely. As are those who would interpret this film as the cautionary tale of a life wasted. Little about the character we view on screen is glamorous. It seems no accident that Morrison died as he did. This was a man obsessed with death; his demise seems more a moment of wish fulfillment than tragedy. My only significant criticism of the film is that the title is certainly a misnomer; this could have easily been titled ""The Jim Morrison Story"" as there is not a single scene on screen without the eccentric singer while the remaining members of the band are relegated to obscurity. Call it art imitating life once more.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A compelling but seriously flawed film,"My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.One thing you can say about Oliver Stones The Doors is that Stone has no intention of forcing the audience to like the main character. Stone spends almost the entire 138 minutes making Jim Morrison into the biggest asshole that he possibly can. Really, when I first rented this film I had no idea what to expect since Oliver Stone is sort of hit-or-miss with me. I can honestly say the film held my attention completely but at the end I was unsatisfied with what I had seen.The remaining members of The Doors have criticized this film saying that it only portrayed one side of Morrison and that some of the actions in the film were far worse than anything he ever did (throwing the TV in the studio for instance). To be honest, I felt exactly the same way. By the end I was like, ""There has to be more to this man than this!!!!""."" I know Morrison had drinking and drug problems, and thats on full display. Stone makes clear that we see the flaws of Morrison and pretty much nothing else. If Stone wanted to make a film that showed the dark side of a rock star than he accomplished his goal admirably.But the film is just too disappointingly shallow. Morrison was supposedly a very shy front-man at first which we actually do see in the beginning when he sings with his back turned toward the audience. It's a shame Stone didn't explore this ""shy, intelligent"" man that the Doors always talk about instead of the sadistic asshole on display here. If Stone had made Morrison into a more well-rounded character than this could have been a great film.What cannot be criticized about the film is Val Kilmer's electrifying performance. Forget the small little flaws like Kilmer is six inches taller than Morrison was and that Kilmers face is a little fatter than Morrisons and just watch this magnificent piece of acting. I have never been that impressed with Val Kilmer's acting ability before I saw this film so seeing him in this was a mindblowing experience. He completely inhabits Morrison and its hard to believe he was actually the second choice for the role. This will undoubtedly be a career best for Kilmer and it is a damn shame he didn't at least get an Oscar Nomination.The supporting cast is also impressive, particularly Meg Ryan. Ryan excels much more in lighter roles but here she dos a very good job as Morrison's girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Kevin Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, and Frank Whaley do the best they can with limited screen time as the remaining members of The Doors.Stone's films have always been uneven when it comes to visual styles. In such films as Natural Born Killers, Any Given Sunday, and to some extent, Nixon, they have been exercises of cinematic masturbation with hyper editing and completely unnecessary film stock switches. Fortunately, thats not the case here as the film has a more straightforward look that complements the film well instead of distracting us.Stone can make a compelling film and The Doors is never boring. It has a lot of good points: a tremendous lead performance, impressive supporting work, effective cinematography, and a great soundtrack. Its a shame that the film is hampered by a shallow script. If the script were better it is quite possible The Doors could have been a great film. As it stands, its a compelling, though definitely disappointing film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An ordinary film with one extraordinary performance,"Watching Oliver Stone's The Doors can be at times a frustrating experience. Considering the central figure in the film is pretty much always drunk or stoned or both the entire plot seems to unfold in a bit of a haze. Those watching the film may come away feeling a little stoned themselves. Yet through the drug and alcohol-fueled haze this film does have a lot to recommend it. Most notably it has one of the most stunningly brilliant acting performances you could ever hope to see. Val Kilmer, playing Jim Morrison, is simply perfect in the role. It sounds clichéd but Kilmer really seems to become Morrison. The physical resemblance is eerie and their voices are so similar it is fairly impossible when listening to the film's soundtrack to figure out when exactly you're hearing Morrison and when you're hearing Kilmer. Tracing Morrison's journey from shy, reserved youth to manic, drugged-out rock god the performance by Kilmer is mesmerizing throughout.As good as Kilmer is you can't help but feel that his performance deserved to be surrounded by a better film. The film might as well have been titled ""Morrison"" because it is much more the story of one man than it is the story of his band. And therein lies much of the problem because while Kilmer is undeniably terrific, Morrison, at least as he is portrayed in this film, is not a very sympathetic character. That shy, quiet guy we see on the beach at the film's beginning becomes a bit of a monster, at times almost completely unlikable. And since the film revolves entirely around Morrison it makes the film often hard to embrace. Many would argue that Morrison was unfairly portrayed here, not nearly as mean-spirited and hot-tempered as we are led to believe. The truth probably lies somewhere in between but the fact remains that in this film it is very hard to embrace Jim Morrison and as such it is very hard to completely embrace the film.With the focus almost completely on Kilmer's Morrison the rest of the cast comes off as little more than bit players. Kyle MacLachlan as keyboardist Ray Manzarek has the most to do amongst the remaining band members and his performance is fine but it really gets swallowed up by the ever-present and always center stage Morrison. Meg Ryan, playing Morrison's longtime companion Pamela Courson, is allowed only to react to Morrison's antics and never establishes a character and identity of her own. Even when stoned out of her mind, as everybody in this film always seems to be, Pamela comes across as the wholesome girl next door who is, well, rather dull. Kathleen Quinlan has a more memorable turn as another woman in Morrison's life, Patricia Kennealy, who is anything but dull. But again her character is there only to serve Jim. It's always about Jim. Nobody could deny that Jim Morrison was the most captivating figure in The Doors. But as the film unfolds and you watch Morrison stumble from one stupor to the next you'll probably wish we could have spent a little more time with some of the other characters. This film version of Jim Morrison is a hard guy to love.So in the end what are we left with? You get one awe-inspiring, magnificent performance but that performance overshadows everything else going on in the film. You get a fascinating life story but one that unfortunately proceeds mostly in a frustrating drug-induced haze. You certainly get a tremendous soundtrack with all of The Doors' most notable songs. Well, most of them anyway. There seems to be a real yin and yang with this movie. There is plenty that is very good about it, but all that is good seems to be balanced out by something which frustrates. Jim Morrison led an extraordinary life but this film which tells his tale ends up being rather ordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Lizard King,"We all know how legendary The Doors were and still are, and sooner or later someone was going to make a film about them. Might as well be Oliver Stone. Given the subject matter, Stone was able to go off the deep end with his imagery here to the point of making one have an epileptic seizure OR think they just dropped some acid. Either way, it's great to watch in my book.The film is flawed in that it's not titled correctly. It's not about The Doors, it's about Jim Morrison and basically just the wild and crazy side of him. That's ok I guess, Morrison was The Doors. Many have criticized Stone for not depicting Jim in the proper light, but given how many people knew him it had to be an almost impossible task to please everyone as everyone knew him differently. I think we all can attest to this through the friendships we have with our friends. Some know us as one way, and some know us as another. I respect Stone for trying and feel sorry for him about the flak people have given him as I know he is a very talented director. I think his intentions were spawned out of true admiration and that he made this film for himself and to pay tribute, and not to win any awards. More of this can be found on the Special Edition DVD from Stone himself.Even if one does not enjoy the trippy qualities of the film such as I do, or any part for that matter, one could not avoid admitting how well Val Kilmer portrays Morrison. It's simply amazing and is one of the best performances that I can bring to mind, and is the best example of how to literally become someone else, bar none. He doesn't act like he's Jim Morrison, he becomes Jim Morrison. He is Jim Morrison. This is no doubt helped by the uncanny facial similarities the two have. Not only that, most of the singing that's in the film was done by Kilmer himself and even a few of the original band members admitted that they honestly could not tell the difference between their two voices. Even if you hate Val Kilmer, this performance jumps in your face and screams for respect while trying to strangle you.As mentioned earlier, some do not like the film for several reasons. One is that it makes Jim look like a monster and that it only glorifies his wild and uninhibited behavior. Two is that it's basically just one big acid trip into bits of history about the band. For one, Oliver Stone said it best....when you have to condense a person's life, a legend at that, into two measly hours you must take the highlights. Everyone lives longer than two hours, even Jim. We all know Jim was crazy, and with so many of the insane stories Stone heard while trying to piece together the script for this, a lot of what he heard was simply what you see. The wild and crazy side. As a result, what we're left with is not an accurate depiction of The Doors or of Jim Morrison. It is entertaining, yes, but it is not accurate. I think it could have been done perfectly, but it would have been excruciatingly difficult...and still not everyone would like it. And as far as the trippiness of the film, well that's Oliver Stone for you. We saw the same thing in Natural Born Killers a few years later. I personally like the style of it and felt that it was in place here but that's just my opinion. The '60's, drugs, and rock and roll equals trippy.Overall a decent attempt at one of the most difficult subjects to cover, legends. And even though it's not entirely accurate and even though Morrison is one of my idols and he deserved a little better, I do enjoy the film greatly. The film should have been named Pandora's Box.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Mr. Mojo Risin And The Turbulent 60s,"Although less popular now, Jim Morrison was an American pop culture icon during the late 1960s. He liked to refer to himself as ""Mr. Mojo Risin"", an anagram of his name. Oliver Stone's film ""The Doors"" is mostly about Morrison ... his rise to stardom in the 1960s, his personality, and his mysterious death in 1971.Influenced in childhood by American Indians, Morrison grew up fascinated with Indian Shamanism, elements of which he would later infuse into his poetry and music while hanging out in the mid 60s in the hip areas of Los Angeles. Here he would meet musician Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan). Along with two other band members, the group would form ""The Doors"", a name Morrison borrowed from the title of Aldous Huxley's book on drug use and enlightenment, called ""The Doors Of Perception"". During this time Morrison comes across as sensitive, shy, poetic, and an idealistic dreamer. The film's first hour is quite good. We get some insights into Jim's early years, and we get to hear some of that great music, like ""Riders On The Storm"", and ""Light My Fire"".The film's second half is less interesting. Morrison himself has changed, as a result of his celebrity status. His narcissism, his boozing and drug use, have turned his world into chaos, which is evident in a couple of staged concert events, one in New Haven, the other in Miami. The amount of time that Oliver Stone spends on these noisy, chaotic events is excessive. Some of that could have been edited out.As with most Stone films, the cinematography in ""The Doors"" is excellent, and includes some early CGI. Val Kilmer is a great choice to play the part of Morrison. And Kathleen Quinlan is good as Patricia, the seductive witch. The film's images at the cemetery in Paris, together with Gothic background music, make for a haunting finale.Stone's movie is not to be taken in a literal sense. Rather, it is suggestive of the complex mix of personal and cultural forces that interacted to create a pop culture legend. As a byproduct of this cinematic tribute, the viewer gets to see how the late 1960s really were, with the art deco, the hippie lingo, and all that hostility that existed in society. The film thus counters the political revisionism that later decades have assigned to that period. As such, ""The Doors"" complements and reinforces other films of that era which also ""tell it like it really was"": ""Medium Cool"", ""Easy Rider"", ""Alice's Restaurant"", and ""Zabriskie Point"", to name a few.Despite a noisy, irksome second half, ""The Doors"" is an intriguing film about an intriguing historical figure. Mr. Mojo Risin's ""style"" may have died with the times. But Jim Morrison, himself, lives on ... as legend.",,Anonymous,Music
A refreshing cinematic breakthrough in an era in which cinema seems all but forgotten!,"This film is truly a gem.  The Doors is easily the best film of the rock n' roll genre and at least one of the most important films of its era. Though I am not an Oliver Stone fan I must give credit where it is due.  Stone really does a terrific job with this film, and shows what he is capable of when he actually knows about the subject he is attempting to comment on. A few of the scenes in the film are almost exact recreations of actual events. However, the magnificent thing about this film is that it manages to recreate a certain amount of reality while simultaneously realizing that for a film to possess its own vitality it must transcend the preexisting reality, move beyond the surface, beyond everything that is obvious, and express and explore something deeper.  Val Kilmer delivers a powerful performance in which he almost seems to be channeling the energy of Jim Morrison, and though I've seen many of Meg Ryan's films this is the only one I can recollect where she does such a good job that she makes you really forget about her and focus on the character.  The cinematography of the film by Robert Richardson (Platoon, Wall Street, Born on The Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Casino, Bringing out the Dead, and many more) is bold and unique making the film one of the most distinct visual films I've ever seen.  This film is truly one of a kind, and breaks through into new cinematic territory, giving priority to the visual aspects of the film in an era where there are so few films that even give much consideration to the single most important aspect of the motion picture.  The genius of this film is that it is visual-audio as opposed to audio-visual and is more concerned with expressing something than simply impressing the audience.  The Doors is a refreshing cinematic breakthrough in an era in which cinema seems all but forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Superb Performance...Incredible Casting,"I totally agree with several before me that at some point in the film, one forgets he is watching Val Kilmer play the late Jim Morrison. This is a marvelous performance by a gifted actor. His physical appearance and voice really capture the essence of one of the top five or six rock bands ever. There is lots of documentary footage of the doors because they came along when videotaping and filming were everywhere, so to capture a realistic display of performances in a film had too be good. We get to watch the guys slowly evolve. We get to see how Morrison held sway over the group. Ray Manzarek had an incredible talent of his own, and yet he kept being dwarfed by the charismatic lead singer. There were times when Morrison's performances were almost transcendent. The music is really good here as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
solid biopic,"It's 1965 L.A. Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), UCLA film student, meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan). He quits school and forms The Doors with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan), John Densmore (Kevin Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley). They become one of the foremost counter culture rock banks of the era. The band drifts apart as Jim travels a different path with witchy journalist Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan). In 1970, he faces charges for exposing himself during a Miami concert. He's living with Pam when he dies in Paris at age 27 in 1971.Director Oliver Stone delivers a solid biopic with his cinematic style to depict the drugged out hippie time and the chaotic nature of the band. Val Kilmer delivers his most impressive performance of his career. The movie could probably add some drama but I'm not sure how exactly. The world is burning down and he's a part of the chaos. His end is predictable for fans and newcomers alike. There may be a dramatic story in there somewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great visual film that concentrates on one aspect of a brilliant but troubled rock legend.,"Jim Morrison wrote many of the Doors songs and was a complete drunk by the time he died in 1971. This film depicts Morrison in a very one sided view. Yes he was an alcoholic with a disregard for authority, yes he was on self destruct mode and burnt out quickly reaffirming the James Dean ""Live fast Die young"" motif. But what is missing from Stone's depiction of him was his great intellect,his absurd humour and his natural talent as a composer and vocalist. However it is a wonderfully visual film that takes the viewers on a hallucinogenic ride through drug hazed Los Angeles in the late 60's. It was the first of many films that Stone created in the 90's using an almost dream like quality to evoke the feeling of the turbulent times.Although this picture is not a 100% accurate account of who or what Jim Morrison was it is still very engaging and enjoyable. A good place for someone who is new to the Doors to start.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Film,"I Love the doors and Jim Morrison. So I thought that I would love this film too. I thought it was great, Val Kilmer did a fantastic job and I hardly doubt whether anybody else could have done better. But I did get a little bored at times. (I guess I felt how some of his band mates felt about his antics!) There is no doubting that Jim Morrison was a hugely talented individual, but he did have his demons. This film recreated this brilliantly and portrayed Jim as I would have imagined him to be (not being alive at the same time as Jim was!) The film, however, is only a 7/10 because it isn't the greatest film I've ever seen. It does provide an insight into Jim's Life and it was portrayed very well. I have seen better but I have seen a whole lot worse too! I would recommend this film to any fans of 'the doors' but you probably won't enjoy it if you don't like the band!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"A hypnotic film, but it emphasizes the negative side of Jim Morrison and is filled with fabrications","RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Oliver Stone, ""The Doors"" chronicles the Southern California band The Doors and their rise and fall between 1966-1971. The film focuses on charismatic singer Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) who falls into alcoholism and drug-addiction. He flew to France in March, 1971, to join his girlfriend, Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan), and pursue a different career, but died the next summer due to his ongoing substance abuse. The other band members are played by Kyle MacLachlan (Ray Manzarek), Frank Whaley (Robby Krieger) and Kevin Dillon (John Densmore).I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. The first time I heard of them was when my older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, ""The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills."" Yeah, I thought the name was pretty lame until I discovered Morrison's reasoning behind it:There is what is known; And there is what is unknown; In between are the doorsAnother thing that won my respect was their song that was used in the opening of ""Apocalypse Now,"" which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, not ""Redux""). After that I bought their ""Best Of"" album and my impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone else. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits,' augmented by a strange carnival feel. Over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting vox. I prefer their more artistic songs like ""Riders on the Storm"" and ""The End"" as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of ""Light My Fire"" or the goofy charm of ""People are Strange""?The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal struggle through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse eventually spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted the surrounding monuments with gaudy graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.So ""The Doors"" is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final years, an image of wild excess. Because of this, I was left with a bad impression of the man. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents on the altar of alcohol & drug idolatry.Yet this was only part of the truth. Thankfully the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disc, ""The Road to Excess"" (1997), balances things out. One of Morrison's sweethearts, wiccan Patricia Kennealy (played by Kathleen Quinlan in the movie), the guitarist and another guy offer the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while sometimes true, aren't ""all that happened."" They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was ""the most influential person I've ever met.""In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man.BOTTOM LINE: Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and vital to the film in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award. In any case, if you're in the mood for something that captures that late-60s counter-culture vibe ""The Doors"" is worth checking out, but it tends to exaggerate things in the name of mythmaking, which is usually the case with movies. For instance, Jim never lit up a closet door with Pamela locked inside (rolling my eyes), the idiotic Thanksgiving dinner sequence never happened and the naked revelries at concerts (and the bonfire) are overblown fabrications. Still, the movie's mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and highlighted by The Doors' music throughout.Unfortunately, the first half is superior to the second half, which becomes too unpleasant, offering a very limited and unflattering impression of Morrison. That's why it's essential to also watch ""The Road to Excess"" on the bonus disc or, better yet, the excellent 2009 documentary ""The Doors: When You're a Stranger,"" which exclusively uses footage and photos from 1966-1971. Another problem with Stone's movie is that it loses its dramatic pull in the second half in preference for hypnotic yet chaotic visual mayhem, not to mention outright lies.Lastly, in ""The Road to Excess"" Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: ""To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison."" Huh? Another dubious line is: ""The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess led straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 20 minutes.GRADE: C (but the ""The Road to Excess"" documentary gets an A-/B+)",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Slice of an age,"It is not about a band, a rock legend and a kind of music. It is about a time, lost, old, fresh and dusty. About a color of soul and nuances of feelings. A masterpiece in a strange form. A fight and exploration, search, travel and lot of questions in dark skin. An America and a silhouette of freedom. And, like in every Stone's movie, a demonstration of personal truth. A film without definition. Hipnotic and power, sad and sarcastic. And a magnificent Jim Morrison. In the sounds of his seasons, in the fairy-tale about good as ambiguous gift and evil as normality. In fact, story of every teenager. With same joys and escapes and death of games. So, a beautiful film. About yourself and the lost words, cruel myths and evening of hope.",,Anonymous,Music
"Kilmer's amazing performance saves the day, but only just!","The story of the short - but influential - life of Jim Morrison and The Doors: who exploded on the music scene in the late 1960's and are still hugely popular today.(As if you don't know all this already!)The Doors were a fantastic group, and if you don't believe me just flick through a stranger's CD collection: There is usually a Doors compilation in their somewhere.But what do you want to believe about the group itself and what they represented and what they believed in? This movie believes The Doors were Jim Morrison and a group of half-assed sidekick men and to hell with the fact that some of the better tunes were written by other band members or the overall (organ based) sound had little to do with Jim Boy.Rock and roll cannot be encapsulated in two hours. All you can do is form lists and put lines through them one by one. Early life (lied about - by JM - because it didn't fit hippie fashion), form the band, band gets famous, band takes drugs, band falls out over drugs, you know the full list as well as I do - unless you are coming to rock movies for the first time.The central problem I have is I don't like the stoned or the drunk. Indeed most sober people don't. I can't care less if the person that is drunk/stoned is very talented or has written great songs or even that they are sexy. They are bores and they are bores that urinate on the carpet. JM urinated on a lot of people's carpet and from his early death it is clear that as a drinker he was a bit of a lightweight.(Often consumed - in the street fashion - straight from the bottle.)When sober (more times than this movie acknowledges) he was a big reader and a smart enough guy, but rock doesn't like smart all that much. It much prefers extroverts with an inflated sense of their own importance and who die young enough to not embarrass the fans by their middle age or worse. As Bono once said ""I don't want to be a firework that explodes for the enjoyment of the general public.""What holds this movie together is Val Kilmer. My word is he good. He looks Morrison, he acts Morrison and he sings Morrison. Nobody could be better. Even the original band were amazed. The concert scenes are so well created that they look like a documentary and - strange though it may sound - they should have recorded a full concert and put it out as an extra on the DVD. A new art form, a fictionalised version of a real 1960's gig.Indeed, Kilmer is as strong as the other band members are weak. Indeed they are so weak they are almost extras in their own movie (the title is a con - this is Jimmy and the Whoever's!) Meg Ryan is a total miscast as his nagging wife and Billy Idol (who is called Cat in the movie) seems to need to shout things at random to remind people he is still there. If you can remember the names of the actors playing the other band members or recall a line they said you need to go on the road as Mr. Memory! However at times I don't know if they are angry at Morrison or their itchy wigs.Narcotic taking (legal or illegal) is someone else's business. It is easy for me - as someone that views self-poisoning as the greatest form of madness on the planet - to claim to be moral superior just because it isn't my knee-jerk. However it does seem to work for artistic people, at least for a short while. It makes things better before it makes things much worse. And it doesn't get any worse than being in your grave at 27 - unless that is the place you want to be.To love someone you have to love them when they are old, bald or grey. The fans that desecrate his grave (and those around it) at Perè Lachaise in Paris (nothing like shown in this movie, by the way - look up the cemeteries own web site on Google) like him dead and buried. You don't even have to pay to be in his company. The Lizard King is dead, long live the next wandering poet and their entertaining and manic odes to their own self-pity...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Captures the rock and roll lifestyle perfectly.,"I am a 17 year old student who is just getting into the amazing band that is the Doors. I watched the movie knowing about how Oliver Stone skewed the facts and changed some things around, so instead of expecting a 100% factual biography on Jim Morrison, I watched it expecting an entertaining film with great music...That's what I got.Even though the film isn't completely factual, it conveyed really well what the rock and roll was like for most rock stars. Drugs, alcohol, sex. It all happens in this film. Oliver Stone didn't really do wonders with Jim Morrison's story, but his direction style was really good with this movie. The concert scenes were done really great, and for someone who's just getting into the music, they were really great scenes to watch.The performances in this movie are something else. I'd have to say that from the Val Kilmer movies that I've seen, this is his best performance. He's really a perfect film incarnation of Jim Morrison, even if it's Oliver Stone's version of Jim Morrison. Everybody in the movie does a really good job in their roles, and it was really cool to watch.So if you want a 100% factual Jim Morrison biography, read a book. If you want an entertaining movie about an awesome rock band in the 60's with awesome music, this is a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,"Like it says here, on the silvery special two-disc DVD set, ""Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), one of the most sensual and exciting figures in the history of rock and roll, explodes on the screen in 'The Doors', the electrifying movie about a time called the sixties and a legendary outlaw who rocked America's consciousness - forever. Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, and Billy Idol also star."" Probably, it would be more accurate to describe Mr. Idol's appearance as a cameo. And, Ms. Ryan and the others are merely featured players; this is an imaginary biography of Jim Morrison, tripping in the limelight.Five to OneIt's not even close to opening ""The Doors"" - but, the film does include an appropriately mesmerizing simulation by Val Kilmer (as Jim Morrison). Mr. Kilmer is so good he almost makes up for the surprising lack of substance (but not substance abuse) and reality. Director Oliver Stone, who did so well with previous 1960s-based films, is unable to present an honest picture of Mr. Morrison. Certainly, it hurts that Morrison isn't around to offer advice - but, ""Other Voices"" (the other members of the band) are extended thanks at the end of the film, indicating they approved of and/or contributed to the contents of this biography.People Are StrangeUnfortunately, the film skips over Morrison, Ray Manzarek (Mr. MacLachlan), John Densmore (Mr. Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Mr. Whaley) as musicians. The legendary melding of Morrison's moody poetics with Mr. Manzarek's rock sensibilities (the ""Moonlight Drive"" at Venice Beach ) is covered, but the creation of actual music that mattered is scuttled to focus almost singularly on Morrison's alcoholic acid trip. Morrison was cruel, kind, and often very drunk - but, he and the other Doors were much more worthy than wasted. This film is technically sound, and Kilmer's performance is excellent.

Val Kilmer At His Finest!,"A biopic about the 1960-70s rock band of the same name which emphasizes the life of its late lead singer, Jim Morrison, 'The Doors' proves to be a showcase for the under-rated Val Kilmer. As Jim Morrison, Kilmer delivers a knockout performance, that deserved an Oscar Nod, if not a Win.'The Doors' Synopsis: The story of the famous and influential 1960's rock band and its lead singer and composer, Jim Morrison.'The Doors' celebrates music & Morrison's journey, which unfortunately is just a memory. Morrison was talented & handsome, but he gave inn to drugs & all the wrong stuff, only to end his life. However, 'The Doors' is infectiously entertaining & addictive.Master Filmmaker Oliver Stone Directs 'The Doors' with visible energy & enthusiasm. The Screenplay is worthy & depicts Morrison's journey with no diplomacy. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is sharp.Performance-Wise: Val Kilmer is At His Finest. He plays the legendary musician with mesmeric ease. Undoubtedly, its among the finest performances from the early 1990's. Among other performers, Meg Ryan is first-rate as Pamela Courson.On the whole, 'The Doors' is rich in music with a heroic leading performance. Strongly Recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Film,"If anyone did not know anything about Jim Morrison and his rise to fame as a great Rock ""N"" Roll performer, Director Oliver Stone gave one fantastic biography in this film. Jim Morrison was played by Val Kilmer who gave a very outstanding performance who put his heart and soul into this role along with Meg Ryan, (Pamela Courson) who is a faithful young girl who fell in love with Jim after he walked into her bedroom and broke up her marriage. Pamela stayed with Jim through out his entire career from 1960 until his death in the 70's. There is nothing left for your imagination, plenty of female nudity, sex, drugs and indecent exposure by Jim Morrison on the stage of one of his rock band concerts which caused great commotion and put Jim Morrison into a court of law with jail sentences. Great film about a performer who had a great message but lost his way by using drugs and booze.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Absorbing movie - i didn't want it to end. (my only friend...),"Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison. The name Val Kilmer is, or should be, synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing, but immensely fun and commanding. You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture. Here, he IS The Doors: The Movie. There, he WAS Wonderland. I am exaggerating, i suppose. For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you've experienced what the sixties were like. Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were, and has actually cultivated love in me for their music. I didn't realise they had more than one classic: Light my Fire, The End, People are Strange, Love her Madly, Break on Through to the Other Side, Riders on the Storm, Touch Me, Roadhouse Blues (Let it roll, baby roll) and probably more i'm yet to discover.For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol's factory actually felt like, see I Shot Andy Warhol. Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in ""I Shot,"" but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation. This, however, is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole.Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: ""Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?""",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not the story it should have been... but watchable,"One thing you can say for Stone is that he knows how to make a good LOOKING movie. Unfortunately he plays so fast and loose with the truth that the end result is more a work of fiction rather than of history. Such is the case with ""The Doors"", a movie that any real Doors fan knows is only a caricature of the band's front-man, Jim Morrison.Stone took the most sensational moments in Morrison's life and focused on it entirely, the end result being that he captured only a mere sliver of Morrison's true life and personality. While the film medium as a whole has never been as good as books when documenting someone's life or career, Stone's portrayal of Morrison unforgivably verges on fiction in its artistic license. Absent is the sensitive, intelligent person who many - including himself - considered a true poet, missing is the person who acknowledged the ridiculousness of his celebrity and sought to destroy it one glorious night in Miami, and equally missing is the source of the person who WAS James Douglas Morrison. As comedian Denis Leary once put it after seeing the movie, ""Here I can sum it up for you - I'm a drunk, I'm a nobody, I'm a drunk, I'm famous, I'm a drunk, I'm dead!"" Not exactly the best summation for a man whose cultural contributions to American music can still be felt 35 years after his death. Nice going, Oliver.On the positive side the movie looks incredibly good, (most likely due to cinematographer Robert Richardson rather than Stone himself), and the viewer does come away with a feel for Morrison's charisma, stage presence, and mystical inclinations. Val Kilmer had deep shoes to fill and very convincingly does so - perhaps the only person on planet earth capable of bringing such a complicated character as Morrison to the screen. The rest of the cast also is well-placed, even though the characters on the screen were considerably different than who they were portraying. (Thanks again, Oliver.)All in all, the movie is worth watching. If you're an intrigued first-timer being introduced to the music and legacy of The Doors from this movie, take it with a grain of salt and do yourself a favor - go out and get the biographies of former band members Ray Manzarek and John Densmore, then watch the live concert material available. You'll be glad you did.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Nothing to touch the earth, not to see the sun, nothing left to do but run, run, run, let's run.""","This is just a sampling of the lyrics that singer/writer Jim Morrison contributed to his group The Doors, and just this, as part of his epic piece ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" shows his skill as a master of the written word. He is shown in Oliver Stone's The Doors as a shy, though often obnoxious and crude, persona who self describes himself in one scene: ""I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being, but with the soul of a clown that forces me to blow it at the most crucial of moments."" He may have blown it in the end, but it makes for a fascinating story.As being a Doors fan, the music and words are the best character of the movie- the songs represent feelings and emotions, desires and hatreds, and other facets of life in the late 60's, are indispensable gems of rock and blues. While the Doors recorded only six albums together (not counting American Prayer, Morrison's awesome feat of an album) each one is still transfixed into the minds of people all over the world. It's thirty-two years since the king died, but in another thirty-two he will still be remembered. And that is a fact that Stone plays with like Travis Bickle in front of the mirror with his guns in Taxi Driver. He reveals only Morrison's known persona, and not the quiet moments. The concert recreations are grand, but there isn't more of the sweet Jim (one glimpse of such a Jim is seen at a birthday party when he gives out gifts as ""Chief Mojo Risin)What is shown is splendid enough for his abilities- he paints a vivid picture of Los Angeles 1965 onward, with Val Kilmer in the second best acting job of 1991 (deserved of an Oscar nomination), and puts Jim in the middle. He is a man who is fascinated with death, with man's wills to power, and how life gets painful without the chemicals top open the mind. Kilmer gets so much into your head in this film that by the end you'll love him, hate him, or feel wonder about him. I felt wonder about him, wonder why he looked to heroes who gave him such ideas about the love of death, wonder why he felt the need to take it to the limits.But his desires are Stone's as well, and while this isn't a perfect film, it's one that isn't easily forgotten.

When Oliver Stone goes to hell Jim Morrison is gonna be waiting for him ready to kick his head in.,"I cannot put into words just how appalling this film is from the point of view of a lifelong Jim Morrison/Doors fan.Firstly, after seeing the movie in full (I walked out of the cinema the first time I went to see it), I amazed as to how Ray M and John D had gotten involved in the movie when they themselves could see how fictional it was. But then again, Ray and John were always Judas's to Jim in life so why not in death....even their versions of history have been bent to paint themselves in a less heartless light in my opinion.Val Kilmer...what can I say.  The man is wooden at the best of times and he was diabolical as Jim.  If you have to make a movie then Jason Patric would have made a FANTASTIC Jim.Oliver Stone, known for portraying history in Stoneworld Vision, came at this subject from a sensational and almost entirely incorrect angle.  As someone who knows a hell of a lot about the history of The Doors I can categorically say that 80% of this film was fiction, 15% was a grossly distorted version of true events and the other 5% was to some extent true. I also hate the way Stone makes composites of characters.I think this could be justified by some people if it was actually a good film anyway but it just wasnt.  I never felt for a second I was in the 60's, terrible wigs/false beards, the wardrobe was consistently poor, the script was dire, terrible casting (in particular Kevin Dillon, Meg Ryan, Val Kilmer and what the hell was Billy Idol there for?) and the overall feel of the movie was all wrong.However, Stone did pull some nice shots off from a cinematography point of view and there were some good choices of location.  The score was obviously good (except when Val tried to sing) but that was to be expected surely.He got the characters wrong, he got history TOTALLY wrong and he tried to ruin the memory of an intelligent man.  He was only ever going to film Jim as The Lizard King but he didn't even get that bit right; Doors fans should know what I mean by that.I hate this movie passionatly and could tolerate it if I thought it would help gain new fans of the music but I don't think it does.If you want the real Jim Morrison/Doors then your best bet is to go read a book like Angels Dance and Angels Die or No-One Here Gets Out Alive (as flawed as that is).Jim had a sense of humour but I bet it would be sorely tested by this pretentious, self serviant piece of fiction that dares to claim it is a rock documentary.  I can only hope that when Stone meets Morrison in the next world Jim isn't too drunk to knock him out.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hmmmm....bad, yet good.","First off, The Doors are my favorite band. EVER. No one can match up to their revolutionary style, their originality, or the music. They are truly THE GREATEST AMERICAN BAND. And one of the most influential bands. EVER. Also one of the most controversial bands. Those are just some of the reasons why The Doors are my fav.Anyway...the Oliver Stone film is good, but not a spectacular piece of work. I did enjoy watching it and would also recommend it. If you never listened to The Doors or aren't really into them then I think this flick will get you interested in the band and their music. But for the most part the movie seems to focus too much on Morrison and in some parts when it does, it seems fake. For example, when Jim is talking or arguing with his girl he is always taking a line from one of his songs and/or from his poems. If you listened to the music before then you would know what I mean. It seems Stone didn't know what to write so he just borrowed some lines from a song/poem and put them in the script. And the preformance by Kilmer is very good, but not great. It seems as if he's trying too hard to become him and when he does he seems to go overboard. But as a movie this is good. As a biography about Jim Morrison this is mediocre. Even the fellow members of The Doors say Morrison isn't portrayed 100%, saying that the movie just portrayed the bad, drunk, disgusting Morrison and never really showed the good humored, shy, sensitive Morrison.Well, at least there's still the music.",,Anonymous,Music
Dances With Wolves meets Woodstock as told by Oliver Stone,"I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and about a year later I was taking to Doors guitarist Robby Krieger who is credited as a technical adviser on this film. I noted to Krieger that Jim Morrison is often depicted as a dark, brooding doomed poet and I felt that was an unfair one dimensional view of him. I said that I bet Jim Morrison was probably also a very humorous guy and since Krieger knew him I asked if I was right. Krieger said I was and that Jim Morrison was one of the funniest people he had ever known. That's an example of what's wrong with this movie. Director Oliver Stone strips away the fun and humanity of Jim Morrison and makes him a dark psychedelic cartoon character. This film goes nowhere and has nothing to say. Just another example of Oliver Stone's love for revisionist history. The film looks good thanks to one of the best cinematographers of contemporary times Robert Richardson who previously had done Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and Wall Street and would go on to do A Few Good Men, JFK. Natural Born Killers, Kill Bill, Wag the Dog, and the Horse Whisperer. Val Kilmer did an excellent portrayal of Morrison in his looks and speech and mannerisms and must have put a lot of work into his role. Unfortunately for Kilmer he's all dressed up and has nowhere to go. The Indian shaman angle to this film grabbed on to this movie and wouldn't let go. It was overdone, overblown, distracting and confusing. Every time you thought this film was about to go somewhere it would come to a halt and go in some other direction. Kathleen Quinlan, Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan are among a nice cast including Crispin Glover and actor/musicians Paul Williams and Bonnie Bramlett. I would give this a 6.0 because it's not a total loss but I would not recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Very insightful movie and excellent performance by Val,"Val Kilmer did a great job portraying Jim Morrison. He brings you into the spiraling life of Jim Morrison and back to the days of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.Throughout the movie you see what made Jim Morrison tick, and get to hear some great music along the way. The cinematography during his drug induced hallucinations is well done and helps pull you into Morrison;s life. Definitely a movie you can sit and watch more than once and one you can enjoy whatever age you are.Whether you were a dedicated Mossison fan or have never followed him, this movie is entertaining on it's face. The fact that the movie portrays the real life of a rock and roll legend, makes the movie that much more interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
changed my life,"My eyes were closed until autumn 1995, when channel 5 in Sweden showed The Doors. I taped it and didn't think too much of it in the beginning. The only thing I knew about The Doors was their song ""Light my fire"".A friend of mine, who borrowed the film from me, told me he liked the ""cave"" scene and the music in it. I myself liked the scene where Jim climbs up to Pam's balcony. That was pretty much it. But then I noticed the song ""love street"" which is played in the beginning, and then I realized that the guitar intro to ""The end"" wasn't that bad. After that I bought the soundtrack and now I was pretty much hooked. I put my eurodisco records on a shelf and became a ""rock'n roller"", and Jim was my role model. My relationship to Jim Morrison is actually the closest to being a gay that I will ever be.The best part of the film are the opening thirty minutes, where Jim ""quits"" his film class on UCLA, follows Pam home from the beach and takes her out on a night walk, rehearses with the band and ""Light my fire"" is introduced. Too bad we never get to see the band being formed. I love that story, when Jim meets Ray on the beach and that conversation leads up to Jim singing ""Moonlight drive"". This scene is also one of few which shows the real Jim Morrison, but I will get back to that later. Around this time, Jim meets his girlfriend with whom he stayed until he died.After half an hour, the movie takes on in a different direction. It is from now on, a very dark movie. This is for a reason, and the reason is that Oliver wants the audience to see everything through Jim's eyes. The result is that some scenes are very surreal and after a while you may think that Oliver Stone himself took some acid before shooting them.The negative side of the film, which have made many people upset, is the way Jim Morrison is presented. Jim is high or/and drunk in nearly every scene he appears in, and since the movie is shown through his angle the result is the surrealism and spaced-out scenes. ""Jimbo"" has unfortunately a bigger part than Jim. (See the movie and you'll know what I mean.)I have read practically every book there is to read about The Doors, including the one named ""light my fire"", written by the organist Ray Manzarek. This guy isn't too happy with the movie. I see his point but at the same time, he confirms in the book that most of the things in the movie has actually happened; the back against the audience, the Ed Sullivan sequence where Jim sings the word ""higher"" on national television, the TV-throwing in the studio. Other things could never happen or are just simply wrong; the Andy Warhole-party where Jim is abandoned by the rest of the band (something that true friends would never do to one another), Jim's student project (his movie didn't look like that at all), Jim's red mustang (Jim had a blue mustang which he actually called ""the blue lady"").Oliver Stone focuses the movie on the wrong things. Sure, Jim Morrison was a pothead, but he was also a very intelligent, sensitive, friendly and funny person. This is far from the picture most people have of him after seeing the movie. But if you know this, and just want some Rock'n roll in your life you will like the movie anyway. Another strange thing is that Oliver Stone has said that he loved Jim and wanted the movie to be a sort of homage to him!? Some homage. So the film is great, however it is not the real story of Jim Morrison. The only time we see the sensitive side of Jim is when he turns down an early offer from a record company man who tells him to ""drop those guys"".The music numbers are the scenes that impresses me the most. The choreography, the lighting of the stage, and, above all, the fact that Val Kilmer actually sings all the songs by himself. Look at the ""Not to touch the earth"" sequence and you'll know what I mean.And now we come to the best thing with this movie. The ONE thing that made me buy it and watch it about 30 times after that. That thing is Val Kilmer. An actor who hadn't made anything spectacular before this and haven't really done anything after it. He was born to do this part. It isn't the real Jim, but an alternative Jim who you kind of love to hate. But now I'm only talking about the personality. Kilmer walks like, talks like, sings like, and above all looks like Jim. And some looks. What wouldn't I give to have that hair or that wardrobe.Besides Kilmer, there are many more great and well-known actors in this movie; Mimi Rogers, Michael Wincott, Josie Bissett, Crispin Glover, Kathleen Quinlan (who plays the very true character Patricia Keneally), and one of the few actors that I can't stand; Michael Madsen. Also, some artists gone acting; Billy Idol, Swedens own Eagle-Eye Cherry (whose scene were cut out from the final film), and if my eyes aren't lying to me; Billy Vera. And oh yeah, I almost forgot: MEG RYAN (arrr).Also, do not forget to check out the cool end credits, with fast speeding pictures of night time L.A, being played to ""L.A woman"".I now see that channel four is showing ""Wall Street"". Very appropriate way to spend the rest of this evening, don't you think? Of course, it can't be compared to The Doors but nevertheless!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Bust on through to the other side. Sex, drugs and Rock 'n' Roll!","Dynamic and explosive story of a L.A. band trying to deal with discovery, fame and dealing with its moody lead singer, who has his own demons to fight. Oliver Stone directs this ode to The Doors. Some of the scenes are almost duplicates of actual events. And on the other hand you also deal with many inaccuracies. It is quite apparent that this movie is based on the myth of Jim Morrison and The Doors and does not get too much farther from that. At times it seems that the other members of the band are only sidemen to the moody, energetic, blatantly sexual front man. Not since Kurt Russell gave us the excellent portrayal of Elvis Presley in ELVIS(79)have we had a powerful performance like Val Kilmer as Morrison. Kilmer even does some of the vocals himself. Fans of The Doors no doubt will knit-pick this film to death and love it at the same time. It is well worth watching several times. Besides the flawless Kilmer, also in the cast are: Kathleen Quinlan, Michael Madsen, Kyle MacLachlan, Meg Ryan, Kevin Dillon and Billy Idol. Love it two times and two times more.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A self-destructive masterpiece,"I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen.I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play.At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method.I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining but not factual,"Many people have gone on record about the many inconsistencies and problems with the film, but take it for what it is: a heavily dramatized biopic that tries to bring a mood or feeling from the Man, myth, and legend, as well as the wild frenetic music of the band.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Want to hate it, but it's the Doors","Visually this is a great film, musically it's a better film, authentically it sucks. I like Oliver stone's style, his rapid and intoxicating sweeps intended to not just entice you, it enshrouds you. But as with JFK, he takes dangerous license with real people and events. Val Kilmer's Morrison was spot on, that is before Stone got through with him. The Doors is told through the perspective of Morrison, but in this film Oliver Stone makes him out to be a dysfunctional poet in a cloud of perpetual haze, so stoned, so drunk, so wasted, he can't even stand up straight. That's not the real Morrison. It was a part of him, but the film makes it about him. Jim Morrison was much more cogent and functional than Stone's caricaturization. The entire movie, in fact, became more about Morrison's drug induced neurosis than about The Doors. I felt Stone was pushing too hard to deliver his message through a prism of false perception and amplified through a distorted, almost irritating, cosmic psychedelia. It lacked anchors and believable people. The film is a buffet of hyperbolic drivel punctuated with some really good scenes and awesome concert footage. The Navajo were quite cool, however. Overall I can stand this movie in segments, as a whole I think it does a great disservice to one the best American bands ever.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Could have been so much more...,"I'm a big Doors fan, and if I could see one defunct band perform, it would be them. I've read all the bios on Jim Morrison, and I idolize him.Surprisingly, Oliver Stone doesn't sensationalize as much in this film than he does in others. Jim lived a very hectic and crazy life, and it's easy to film his hedonistic lifestyle. Val Kilmer (Jim Morrison), Meg Ryan (Pamela Courson), Kyle McLachlan (Ray Manzarek), Kevin Dillon (John Densmore), Frank Whaley (Robby Krieger), and Kathleen Quinlan (Patricia Keneally) look like dead-on copies of the real thing. Kilmer, especially, delivers an Oscar worthy performance, and probably the best celebrity impersonation of anyone besides Jim Carrey's Andy Kaufman.The music is superb (it's Doors music after all) and the direction is good. It's very hypnotic to watch. It certainly gives you the idea of how Jim Morrison himself felt the 60's were like.My problem with the film is that it seems to dwell on Jim's negative attributes. Jim was one of the true gentlemen of rock and was very giving and generous, but scenes like these are few and far between. Oliver paints Jim as a self-destructive maniac. Scenes like Jim throwing Pam into a closet and setting it on fire or his tirade on Thanksgiving weren't needed. And of course, Stone sensationalizes The Door's appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, watch the movie version and the actual version; they're nothing alike. Also Patricia wasn't the lady with Jim on the night he got busted in New Haven, nor was she the woman who drank blood and snorted cocaine with him, those happened with other women.Still, there's a lot to like here. The concert scenes are terrific, the dialog is great, and there are some amusing characters. Although I'd still recommend one of the many documentaries (some made by the Doors themselves) if you want the real Jim Morrison story, this movie does a pretty good job of telling the tale. Just remember that The Lizard King wasn't as scaly as portrayed here.",,Anonymous,Music

Visually Stunning Forerunner to Natural Born Killers,"First off, let me say that I couldn't care less how realic or unrealistic this movie is. 'The Doors' has received plenty of criticism over its historical accuracy, and from what I've read the criticism is probably due, but I regard the movie as simply that, a movie. Oliver Stone's historical track record (JFK, Platoon, Salvador) makes it clear that his movies are heavily steeped in history, but diverge, aiming for message and visuals rather than accuracy.That said, I thought 'The Doors' was a brilliant movie. I am a child of the 1990's, I was born long after Jim died, so I guess I look more for impressions and statements in movies, rather than linear narrative. And 'The Doors' gave me much cause for excitement. I saw the movies several months after seeing Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' (which I found even more brilliant), and the stylistic parallels between the two were uncanny. I believe the real strength in 'The Doors' lies in its visual style: the strong red visuals running the movies length, effective and stunning use of timelapse photography, surreal editing, not to mention the Indian theme (which also appears in 'NBK').I agree that Jim was portrayed in a bad light. The first forty minutes of the movie were narratively wonderful, the remaining ninety minutes portrayed Jim going off the 'deep end'. However, Stone did redeem his character in the closing two scenes, though perhaps a little too neatly.The four or five concerts in the movie were mindblowingly staged, shot and edited (particularly the last two), with the strong hallucenagenic theme running through them and the everpresent Indian. Jim's character (played to perfection by Kilmar) for me represeted someone who, as was stated in the movie, pushed the limits: a true electric poet in the fashion of romantics like Keats. If seen in the right light, 'The Doors' can be an inspirational movie.

Door to Where?,"A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use...Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"love this movie two times, and forever after that","Probably no music biopic has ever done a greater job looking into its subject than ""The Doors"". Focusing mainly on Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), we get to see his masterful ability to write songs, but also his demons and his descent into complete madness. Jim Morrison was a genius and a nut. The movie never makes the mistake of becoming a litany of songs: it looks at the historical context, with the Vietnam War and everything else that made up the '60s. Val Kilmer does an incredible job playing Jim Morrison, and Meg Ryan is equally good as his girlfriend Pamela. Believe you me, there will never be another Jim Morrison. When he died in 1971, that really was the end.When I went to Paris in 1994, I went to Pere Lachaise and saw Jim Morrison's grave. There are signs pointing to it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's enjoyable, to say the least","It's a sycophantic trip to see the MYTH of Jim Morrison, although the title would imply it was a movie about the Doors. How so many people who were actually there were technical advisors got there help axed (save for the credits and screen time it seems) should show that Stone has problems with the truth (sorry, everybody's done this argument, but why was this movie made then?) I read that Patricia Keneally-Morrison wanted to kill Oliver ""Soviet Loner"" Stone when she saw it (that would've been interesting and maybe even cool!) It got a 7 from me for it's entertainment value (The Doors rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!) but I can't say the rest of the movie really did it for me other than it's tripiness. Look for all the band members and Jim's wife!!! (and A.J.Langer, she's the buck-skinned girl who kisses Jim)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An uninhibited celebration and hyperbole of the myth,"In Oliver Stone's vision of 1960s California - the time and scene which fostered Jim Morrison and his band The Doors - every image and sensibility you would associate with it are amplified and embellished almost to the point of mockery. Still, there is nothing satirical in Stone's angle, which is all about nostalgia and idealism, as if Morrison was dead right: drugging, boozing, philandering and rebellion was and is the way to live. And maybe it is. The problem with The Doors, in many ways a complete and engrossing biopic, is that it doesn't offer an alternative view. We never actually get to know the person behind the myth. Instead we get an uninhibited celebration and hyperbole of the myth. Stone's visionary approach also has its advantages, however, and one of them is that it connects his images closer to The Doors' music and Morrison's lyrics. For large portions of its running time, the film is like a continual music video, with a thematic line from a certain childhood experience of Morrison's. There are abundances of snakes and moons and death, and if we don't get to know the everyday man that Morrison also must have been, we certainly get to know some of the demons which eventually led to his demise. And we get to know, or rather revisit, some brilliant pieces of music and a couple of legendary live acts, most notably The Doors' famous performance of ""The End"" from the Whisky a Go Go nightclub. Val Kilmer gives an invested, close to complete performance as Morrison - a performance which could also have been moving had Stone given him more real emotion to work with.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
No one is getting out of here alive!,"What an incredible piece of art! The Doors is without doubt the most underrated movie I have seen so far. Given that it is dealing with a character of which almost everybody already has a picture of his own, this might not be a surprise. It is a surprise though, how poorly the movie's message seems to have been accepted.What Oliver Stone has done here, is not an accurate portrayal of Jim Morrison or the Doors. Instead he has created something far more valuable: An extremely deep insight into the work of the Doors, but mostly Jim Morrison. You have to understand this movie as a fusion of Jim Morrison and his art, as a portrayal of his life from the perspective of the artist.This does not mean the movie is portraying something imaginary, which never existed like this. Jim Morrison WAS like this, just he was not like this for most of the time or for most of the people around him. So you could ask, why making a movie from a perspective, why portraying a side, that for most does only cover a small piece of reality? The answer is simple: Because this piece is the one that persisted, the one that will persist. And that is not by accident, it is because this is the most fascinating and deepest picture Jim Morrison has left for others to explore.The idea of having only a short moment to live, the idea of putting all your passion and all your anger into this moment - at the same time being desperately in search for a way to forget, to bear this fate. The life on the edge of death, in a world of beauty and pain - the desperate attempt to squeeze out every feeling just possible from your given moments, before everything is over. Giving away everything, in the light of the insight that you won't be able to hold tight anything - being delivered to death:""You have seen This entertainment through and through. You've seen your birth, your life and death; You might recall all of the rest...""If you now go into criticizing and analyzing this attitude, for good reasons for sure, stop for a moment and imagine:I am the lizard king - I can do anything!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Val Kilmer Electrifies as the Legendary Jim Morrison!,"If you spoke to any hard-enthused hipster from the 1960's, you would learn what a legend Jim Morrison, the frontman of the rock'n'roll band The Doors, was. He was known for his onstage antics and he lived the life of the pill and the bottle until his untimely death at the age of 27. He left behind an amazing catalog of songs that people still listen to today. ""The End"" is an incredible rock song that became meaningful to me. For a long, long time, people have been trying to capitalize on this myth. Enter Oliver Stone, the man behind the hard-hitting Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July. Stone, for a long time, tried to make a biographical film about Morrison. I can't say I was particularly pleased with the final film. Stone indulges in Morrison's dark side for the entire time and makes him seem to be some crazy loon. Val Kilmer himself is electrifying as Morrison. He looks like and even sounds like Morrison. Unfortunately, he was let down by a shallow script, written by Stone himself. The surviving band members respected and even adored Kilmer's performance. Yet most of them criticized Stone's direction but none other than keyboardist Ray Manzarek who refused to even speak to Kilmer to help with the preparation. Many scenes that had Jim Morrison at his worst were exaggerated or even completely fabricated. That certainly angered the bandmates whom some even vouched for Stone to direct this film. While I may have no personal feelings towards Morrison in one way or another, the script is a disappointment. Thankfully, Kilmer does his best to pick up the slack.In order to get the film in production, Stone had to get through lots of legal mumble jumble with the rights. For example, the parents of Pamela Courson (Jim's girlfriend) would not allow Stone to include Jim's poetry unless the director agreed not to blame Courson for Jim's eventual death. In reality, Courson is believed to have given the drugs that killed him to the man and she blamed herself. Within the bandmates themselves, there were conflicting views. Manzarek was ready to immortalize the band's accomplishments...but not with Stone at the helm. Conversely, guitarist Bobby Krieger did not want a biopic...unless Stone was directing. The subject was a hot commodity given that Scorsese and De Palma tried to get the rights to direct, but Stone won the day as he also crafted the script alongside Randall Johnson. I already said the script took certain (or many) liberties, but at least Stone kept the film visually interesting. The trip to the Mojave Desert is straight psychedelic. The concert scenes are visually (although not historically accurate) impressive.Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan) and Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) met at UCLA in 1965 and decided to form a rock band. With the additions of Bobby Krieger (Frank Whaley) and John Densmore (Kevin Dillon), the band known as The Doors formed. Jim became known for his controversial lyrics and his onstage hysterics, yet was undoubtedly charismatic despite an exorbitant amount of drug and alcohol use. Soon enough, the band is wondering what is happening to Jim. Jim is very popular with the general public but always had run-ins with the law. Sticking by Jim's side is his long-time girlfriend, Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan). But being a rock star, he indulges in a drug-induced affair with a reporter named Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan).Even though the script does not portray Jim Morrison in a positive light, you cannot deny how electric Val Kilmer's performance is. He spent hours and days learning 50 songs from the band although only 15 songs were used. He sang over Morrison's voice and the results were unreal. Not even the band was able to tell him apart. Meg Ryan is normally known for her lighter fare but I think she did a decent job tackling the juicy Pamela Courson role. You could probably call the film ""Jim Morrison"" and the title would stick because of how limited the screen time was for the band members. The respective actors did make their characters believable at least.Overall, The Doors could have been much better if someone did not allow Oliver Stone to get swept away in his indulgences. I like most Stone films, but this is certainly a disappointment especially given Val Kilmer's commitment. Still, he visually made the film interesting. Kilmer is, by far, the best part of the movie. Playing a man like Jim Morrison who is nearly mythical is not an easy task. Listening to him belt out ""Light My Fire"" proves he was up for the mission. I wish Oliver Stone was.My Grade: C.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Oliver Stone and The Doors - A Match Made in Pretention Heaven,"After four bombastic head-trips (the first of which, ""Salvador"" was quite good) director Oliver Stone found his match with The Doors as subject matter. In fact, I could not imagine any other director doing justice to the band, at least in spirit. The Doors, after all, wore their pretentions on their sleeves and featured a lead singer who represented just about every chemical and sexual excess imaginable.This is not to say that the Doors were not a good band - for the most part they were downright great, especially when it came to the darker side of things. In this respect the movie is quite successful, welding together an impressive number of songs on the soundtrack and reenacting their outrageous concerts with grandeur and sweep. And Val Kilmer, who has since earned a reputation as Hollywood's biggest jerk, truly takes you inside the skin of the Lizard King.Unfortunately, the film is pockmarked with scenes of domestic strife between Jim and the band, Jim and his two wives and Jim and his drunken cronies that are awfully histrionic - if not laughable. And except for the sequences showing Jim and the group in their rather brief climb to the top, Morrison is portrayed almost incessantly as a swaggering lush who treatshis friends and lovers as so much trash.To anyone who's a fan of The Doors, I say see the film for the way it represents the band as a musical unit. But if you want a full-bodied (and accurate) portrayal of them as people, read a book.",,Anonymous,Music
I am the Lizard King. I can do anything.,"Filmmaker Oliver Stones' ode to sex, drugs & rock 'n' roll in the 60s tells the story of the great, impactful rock band, or, to be more specific, its charismatic and dynamic frontman Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer).""The Doors"" is a somewhat flawed - but still compelling - experience. Stone often turns it into a chaotic assault on the senses, and, when it's all over, we don't feel that we've really learned that much about Morrison. We DO get a great sense of the commotion he was always causing: a sensual, poetically inclined, authority-defying figure, he did a masterful job of just GALVANIZING an audience. Much of the film dramatizes how his typically eccentric behavior would affect those closest to him.Despite an extremely large cast just packed with familiar faces, Kilmers' uncanny performance essentially IS the film. He does an expert job of becoming the man he is portraying. In fact, he often tends to blow the other players off the screen. Only Kathleen Quinlan, as the journalist Patricia Kennealy, gives him any real competition. That said, the sequence with Crispin Glover in a cameo as Andy Warhol is also well worth seeing.A generous assortment of classic Doors tunes and Robert Richardsons' excellent widescreen photography are a big help. Stone, at the least, does a fine job of recreating sights & sounds of this point in American history.The real John Densmore (drummer for the band) appears as an engineer during the final session; Stone has a brief bit as a UCLA film professor, and that's Stones' son Sean (now a director in his own right) as the young Morrison.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Stone Successful In Creating Atmosphere of The Doors,"Jim Morrison was dead long before I was born, yet I can still feel his angst through his music. I can relate to many of his songs, and I'm not even a drug user. The key to his magic is the atmosphere the songs create. Oliver Stone, who grew up with The Doors, recreates this atmosphere so well that I sometimes feel stoned myself from just watching the film! I don't know if it is accurate, and knowing Stone, it probably isn't. But then again, I don't care. The mood of the film brought through the feeling of what it must have been like to be with The Doors during that rebellious and experimental time. It takes a great talent to transfer the attitude of one decade to another 30 years later. Val Kilmer was absolutely MAGNIFICENT as Morrison, and it only helps that of all living actors he is by FAR the closest look alike to Morrison. Recommended for anyone who wants a night to ""Ride the Snake"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Took me long enough,"I was a big fan of The Doors and saw them live once. Morrison was a few years older than me so he was a part of my ""culture"" at the time and their music is still unlike anyone else's and still amazingly haunts. I distinctly still remember where I was when I heard he died. I was very upset. It is now 2022 and I finally got around to seeing this film, which I once avoided like the plague until I just forgot about it and now have some interest. One of the reasons for my avoidance is that I never cared for Kilmer. I never understood his fame as I didn't think he was much of an actor, though I've heard he's really good in Tombstone, but I personally was never impressed by anything that I ever saw him in. He then went through his screwy years around the time of him and Brando in The Island of Dr. Moreau, which I unfortunately did see and it was a mess for all involved. In any event, this is a fever dream of a film and for the most part, it works. It's biggest problem to me is the latter stages conveniently wrapping up so many relationships, but the music is awesome and very creatively used as a background score. And as has been said many times, this is Kilmer's finest moment and it most assuredly is from my point of view. He seems obsessed with the character. I had forgotten the famous actors in this. Meg Ryan is just miscast. Kathleen Quinlan who I met once years ago at Actors' Equity in NYC just after she did I Never Promised You a Rose Garden was refreshing and beautiful in real life, but this here is not the Quinlan I met or have ever seen before. Not sure what to make of it nor the character she plays. None of the males in this make any real impression. This is truly an Oliver Stone movie! Between him and Kilmer, I'm sorry it took me so long to see this. This life story of a talented, smart and rebellious young man on a continuous downward spiral doesn't always work, but what does is sometimes sensational.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best life adaptations of fame,"I saw this one outta sheer love for Morrison. Though in the first half hour or so, i was taken aback by few forced deliverance to imitate his aura, i was pleasantly surprised by the longevity of character that kilmer created. and by the time the titles rolled, i strongly believed that this is the closest you will ever get to screen adaptations of an idol, kilmer has not played Morrison, he IS Morrison in this one, through his convoluted hours of bliss, to his on-stage romance with the realization of phallic power, from his hours of loneliness to his unrest with the commoditization of music, from his profound, almost indifferent deliverance to his childish vulnerability, kilmer scores. a great achievement for oliver stone too, meg Ryan could have been replaced for the better though....i also did not quite understand two things- why were all the other doors shown so smaller against Morrison, and where was the serene emotion seen in Morrison's eyes when he used to perform as seen in many of his live acts? kilmer does push it a little more towards insanity which is true but only in parts. his last days in France are not covered well, possibly due to the controversy surrounding his demise. another good thing about the classic is its uncompromising, unbiased portrayal of one of the greatest ever rock and youth idols.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A mixed bag.,"""The Doors"" is one of my all-time favorite bands, I love just about every one of their songs, most of all ""Light My Fire,"" ""Break On Through,"" ""Peace Frog,"" ""The End,"" ""L.A. Woman,"" ""Roadhouse Blues"" and so on and so forth.This movie doesn't do the band justice. It's all about Jim Morrison, played by Val Kilmer. It should have just been called ""Jim: The Druggish Semi-True Biography."" It's all about visual style, and little substance. Even for a film about Jim, it's not very well-made.Jim's childhood is almost totally ignored - there's an opening sequence about an Indian spirit carrying over into his soul, but that's it. His lover back in the '60s, a self-proclaimed ""witch,"" says on the DVD that the ""real Jim Morrison"" she knew and loved is ""not in this movie."" Oliver Stone even complains that he felt Meg Ryan's performance as Jim's wife was too self-conscious and unconvincing. I totally agree. As Stone points out, she's too self-aware -- she covers her nudity in one scene, and that would have never happened back in the '60s, ESPECIALLY if you were alone, with your husband, in bed.Val Kilmer sounds and acts the part well but really doesn't look much like Jim. It doesn't matter because he's so convincing through his physicality that his features don't detract from the realism - I never for a moment thought, ""It's just Kilmer."" It's too bad that such a great performance is wasted on a movie that is just OK. Visually, ""The Doors"" is superb. It's really trippy, ""Apocalypse Now""-style stuff that captures the tone of The Doors, as well as the era itself. It has a few moments of good energy and character exploration, such as Jim's exposure to a crowd shortly before his death.But overall Stone focuses on the visual too much and not enough on the story itself. The soundtrack rocks, the cinematography and outer layer of the film is amazing - but that's about it.Hopefully someone will come along in the future and match the visuals of this film, but add a heart and soul - after all, that's what Morrison was most famous for during his time, and it's just a little ironic that the film lacks passion and soul.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

For Doors fans only,"Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" tells of the rise to demise of Jim Morrison, lead for the title rock band, icon of the hippy culture, and celebrated/notorious/controversial rock musician. The film focuses on Morrison's brief six year career and features a fine performance by Kilmer, much of ""The Doors"" music, and plenty of Hollywood sensationalism. I watched the film as a matter of curiosity since I lived through the period but never really knew who Morrison was (which pretty much makes me no expert) and found myself doing a lot of fast forwarding through the music and concerts. Unfortunately, Morrison wasn't all that interesting making the film of questionable value to anyone who was not a ""Doors"" or Morrison fan. B-",6.0,Anonymous,Music

I got the feeling there was more to Jim Morrison than this.....,"I first watched Oliver Stone's The Doors many years ago....I was only about 13 and didn't know any better.  Since then I've grown as a person and opened myself to all types of music, and am now a fan of The Doors' music. Watching this movie again now on the Bravo channel, I have a totally different outlook on the film (maybe my first outlook, since I was so young when I first saw it).  Basically, I can't help but feel that there was so much more to Jim Morrison than what Stone chose to portray in his film.  Now that I've listened (and continue to listen) to the Doors' music, based on the music alone I know that there was more to Jim Morrison.  There was a beauty with Morrison and, quite frankly, it's not shown here.  Stone's film is very one-dimensional, which is an inconceivable crime to commit seeing how multi-dimensional Morrison was....even his music alone!  I'm not saying that he didn't lead a wild life of sorts, but Stone paints Morrison as if that was all he was.  He doesn't delve into the man and his music....it's just a rock star living the wild life who just happens to be a pretty damn good lyricist/entertainer.  To make his talent a sidenote is very irresponsible in my opinion, and that is what kills the movie.  I don't think Stone poured himself into a movie, where it really HURT the film, more than The Doors.  Natural Born Killers was basically his story, his baby....so you can put yourself in the film, as you're making a point about an issue.  But you can't do that with a so-called bio flick, it takes so much away from the person you're trying to tribute/acknowledge.  The effort is there, but The Doors is overdone and unfortunately not truly representative of the subject (Morrison).** out of **** stars.P.S.

Other highlights are the scene in ""The Factory"" of Andy Warhol,with even better music of The Velvet Underground in the background and the stage brawls with the cops(GO JIM GO).Stone shows us that America wasn't ready for The Doors at that time in history and probably still aren't,considering the popularity of the religious and highly old fashioned psycho George W.

When the music' over turn out the light,"***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group ""The Doors"" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group ""The Doors"" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history.It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing ""The Beatles"" & ""Rolling Stones"" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents.It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier!It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally.In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him.P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended.

I love the music and i really like the Indian and desert influences around Jim's poetry and music.

Even though Jim is portrayed as being a crazy alcoholic and a cheat and the fact that the film misses out much of the goods points about him, this is what makes the film exciting towards the viewers.

She is clearly support but I was surprised by how well she does in a small but important role.Recreating the atmosphere of the 1960's is pretty well done. The 60's are portrayed pretty well as a decade where young women believed that liberation was trying to strip naked & streak through concerts. At one point in the film, Morrison gets the Jack Black treatment by the audience as he dives into it and is carried around.

He did it with Nixon, he'll most likely do it with his upcoming Alexander the Great movie, and he most certainly did it with ""The Doors.""First and foremost, Jim Morrison was a well-educated, intelligent, and very funny person who got along very well with almost everyone he encountered in his 27 short years of life (if he is in fact dead). Ray Manzarek, the real Doors keyboardist, said Oliver Stone twisted Morrison's image around, making it appear as though Morrison was a constantly drugged-out, crazy rock-n-roll jerk who loved two things: drugs and loose women. This is not the true Jim Morrison. The real man was, yes, an alcoholic who indeed had his way with many easy ladies, but he was so much more. He was the most revolutionary rockstar in history who paved the way for modern rockers and punks and rebels to act and portray themselves. And if anyone disagrees with me, I'd like them to prove me wrong. And not only that, Morrison was one of the most gifted poets in history, penning some of the best lyrics ever written. Finally, he was one hell of a good singer who, although he may not have had the best voice in music history, definitely had the greatest, most blood-curdling screams and rough, awesome voices.In conclusion, Oliver Stone should have never made such a ridiculously terrible movie about my favorite band, and one of the best bands ever, The Doors.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Violent Booze Soaked Story of a Wasted Life...,"The Doors, it requires no plot synopsis nor an explanation because the name speaks for itself. The thing that makes this movie hard not to watch is a strange formula; 1 part music, 2 parts music, and 97 parts self destruction.I just saw this movie for the first time today, and as not too big a doors fan I had to look for something else to like in this film and what I found was a serious of excellent performances and bizarre visual elements that make it very hard to look away. Val Kilmer does a good job as Jim Morrison in the fact that his performance makes it hard to determine whether or not Morrison was a man to be loved or hated and was perfectly countered by Meg Ryan showing how he dragged her down with him. The unpredictability of the lead character also kept me going, how he was joking one moment and going psychotic the next. The depiction of the rock God certainly wasn't very flattering and I think it's better that way because it's honest, Jim Morrison was a drug addled alcoholic asshole on a path to self destruction that no one (not even people he loved) could stop.The drug sequences are something that I would usually find unique if it wasn't Oliver Stone, he seems to be quite accustomed to that. I did however enjoy the way that it would be manipulated to seem as if time literally stopped in certain moments in the movie, mixtures of sounds and colors or lack thereof peeling the viewer away from what little normality was already there. Sometimes though it took away from the movie itself, there were times where I think I would have enjoyed these particular moments far more if I'd smoked a joint before they happened.Now for the parts that needed work, I initially had the same problem with this that I had with ""Walk The Line"". I didn't enjoy the fact that one minute we see Morrison as a kid and the next moment he's a 21 year old acid dropping film student in Venice. I don't like when movies jump to the halfway evolution of a character without explaining how it came to be that way. It jumps too quickly into the success of the Doors as if thew whole thing was overnight. This movie is pretty lengthy as it is I know, but it wouldn't hurt to toss in an extra 10 minutes. Another thing was this movie could have lost at least a half hour if it had cut down on unnecessarily long sequences, in particular some of the concert scenes. I don't care about the music, even the Doors can drag on sometimes. And there were other parts but we won't go into it.All together it was a well rounded movie about the downward spiral of one of the most vibrant, overrated (by Morrison's own admission), and ultimately too human for his own good artists of the sixties. It was a sad story about a wasted life told through music and drugs and insanity... but it still could've been better...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A great time capsule of the 60's and one of Oliver Stone's finest works!,"I KNOW I'm giving way too many stars for this, but I don't care; The Doors were one of my very first favourite groups. I fondly recall, when I was 11, and Elektra Records released 'The Doors' Greatest Hits', and the album-length version of 'Light My Fire' was played all the time on the radio, and I was mesmerized by the instrumental middle of the song, got the album from my parents for Christmas, and started a lifelong love affair with the band. Yes, Jim Morrison is highly overrated. Yes, the movie is an extremely self-indulgent mess and it can be quite incoherent and incohesive. But the Sixties, the L.A. rock scene back then, and especially Morrison's life, were just like that, so it is oh so fitting!I adore the fact that it was Oliver Stone's labour of love (one of thankfully many) and that the surviving members of the band basically had full input. I would take this and 'Talk Radio' (my personal favourite Stone's throw) over a hundred of Stone's politically over-the-top movies any day!When I was 17, I took my life savings and visited, on my own, nine European countries, including France and its capital, Paris. Did I go for the Eiffel Tower, wild romance on Richard Linklater-esque trains, or its outstanding magic and sidewalk cafes? No--train-wise I had to put up with a stupid labour strike, such that an overnight sleeper car from Berne, Switzerland to Paris had to be switched, in the middle of the night, FOUR times, just so they could prove a point. And it was just to see Morrison's grave. I met 20 fantastic people who had made the pilgrimage from all over the world, and it was my first time having red wine and smoking pot. The graffiti and the sculpture of him, in the Pere Lachaise cemetery, were fascinating, as was his life. Would I go through that again? Of course I would.It's Val Kilmer's best work by a mile. The film just oozes charisma and breathes life--just as the band's work must have done back in the day. Worth a purchase and re-watches (I watch it each year on Jim's birthday and accidentally bought it twice), for any fan of 60's music or its culture.

A CLASSIC! THE KING OF ROCK MUSICALS!,"Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" remains the King Kong of rock musicals! A big budgeted, bigger than life depiction of the legendary rock band, it also captures a very realistic view of the late 1960's. Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance as the late, Jim Morrison, giving such an increadible performance, at times you forget it really isn't Jim. He certainly should have been nominated for an Oscar. Sadly, Val Kilmer has never been able to give a performance as great as this one, with his career recently sliding into limited release feature films that haven't given him a box office hit in many years. The entire cast here is great, although Meg Ryan's cheeky, giggly persona didn't do the character of Pamela proper justice. Meg is cute, but never has really been a deep artistic actress. I think she was mis-casted in this role. The concert sequences are nothing short of amazing, and the visual effects used throughout the film are breath taking. This movie takes you on a non-stop roller coaster ride trip back in time. And will remain a cult classic. This movie is heavy sex, drugs, and rock and roll, no holds barred. It truly is ""The celebration of the lizard""!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
a masterpiece.,"I was a generation too late for the Doors.Yes , I had heard some of their hits, knew that they were led by the mercurial guy Jim Morrison, who in the footsteps of true rock legends, had committed suicide.But that was about it.Why I am mentioning this is to clarify that I the praise that is going to follow is not because I am a true-blue Doors fan, and that I dig anything and everything related to Doors. The reason is because, quite simply, it is a brilliant film. Oliver Stone handles the subject matter with a kind of mastery that ordinary directors won't even dare. Who would dare to start off a movie on Doors with what initially seems a scene of no consequence in the desert? The whole atmosphere of the 60s is built up superbly.Yes, the ,mandatory wigs, big sunglasses, beads and amulets, naked women, Woodstock...all are there, but there is more.It's the intangible, that feeling which you get that yes, this is what the 60s was.The wild world of rock and roll, made more complicated by the fact that Jim Morrison was far more enigmatic and complex than your typical rockstar,and at the same time an absolute brilliant song-writer is all conveyed just the way it should be. And as if all this was not enough, you have Val Kilmer playing one of the most brilliant lead performances as Jim Morrison.In fact, the similarity between is quite eerie.I watched a couple of Jim Morrison vids after the movie, and boy,u would think that they are related. Yes, liberties have been taken with the actual events.Morrison was not as moody and self-destructive as shown in the movie.So don't go into the movie expecting a documentary on Jim , instead, watch it as a glimpse into the crazy world of 60s, and each and every minute of the movie will be worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Central cast [Meg Ryan, Frank Whaley, Kyle MacLaclan, Kevin Dillon as Jim's wife and the rest of the Doors] is perfect, as are the odd compilation of supporting players: Mimi Rogers, Kathleen Quinlan, the always-whacked-out Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, and bit parts by Michael Madsen, Jennifer Rubin, Will Jordan, Paul Williams, etc.The only flaw I can see [from Stone] is the ending [featuring real-life Doors drummer John Densmore], which makes it seem as if Morrison is still alive...As if.3.5 of 4 Niro~Stars",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Riders On The Storm,"Back in the mid-1960's, before one of rock's most awesome singers, Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, stepped into the limelight (along with his talented comrades) and conquered the world of rock'n'roll - It was singer Jim Morrison of The Doors who ruled (in my opinion) as the reigning King of the Vocal Chords.Right from the start, director Oliver Stone's evocative film, The Doors, makes no excuses for not being a panoramic view of the entire band as a whole. This film's obviously myopic focus is on that of Jim Morrison who is presented to the viewer as though he were both a separate entity and as the entire embodiment of the band, The Doors, itself - All in one whirlwind of a package.The movie ""The Doors"" contains some of the most exceptionally exhilarating live concert-footage that I've ever seen recorded on film. And, as an added bonus - It would be a literal understatement to say that Val Kilmer, as Jim Morrison, puts in a truly remarkable performance.The only real flaw to mar this otherwise finely-executed film was the despicable performance of Meg Ryan who played Morrison's hippie-dippie girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Ryan really stank, big-time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Typical of Oliver Stone, style over everything else.","The Doors, or more appropriately, Jim Morrison: The Movie, is about Jim Morrison's short, but influential life from his failed film career to the band The Doors, to his untimely death. I'm not quite sure what this movie was trying to say about Morrison and the band. If it was saying that Jim was anything but a crazy drug addict, then it failed, because that's the only side we see of him here. Occasionally, Stone lets us see his poetic side, but very rarely, and when it does show it's because he's tripping on acid. There's no emotional connections to any character, except maybe Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson, but not much for her either. So, with no emotion and no character development, what we have is the outline of what happened with The Doors, and a lot of Val Kilmer imitating Jim Morrison's singing.Everything about this was not all bad. The acting is quite good. Val Kilmer was very believable playing the hard rocker who didn't care for anyone else's opinions. Meg Ryan was good as his struggling girlfriend. Kathleen Quinlin is very good as his critic sex mate. Even Kyle McLaughlan was good as the keyboard player Ray Manzerack. Along with being a good actor, McLaughlan also had the best character, an advocate of Morrison's work, but also a sense of reason that was never listened to. Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon play the other two band members in small thankless roles.The direction starts off pretty cool, but by the end turns into a major headache. Stone constantly uses blue and red lenses on the camera, no matter what the scene, so instead of being used to symbolize sadness, or anger, they're just there to look cool. A lot of odd zoom ins and strange camera angles are used, and again, they start pretty neat, but after you realize Oliver Stone is just throwing them about for no reason, they get tiring. This whole movie can be compared to his later film ""Natural Born Killers"". They both have uncaring character, a weird style that get's to be a huge headache, and an ending making us think ""Why should we care?""It's really hard to tell why this film was made. Obviously because Oliver Stone wanted to make a film on this popular band, but to show what? Was it to show how influential Morrison was? Because it showed he was influential to some people, but that was because of his crazy music, not himself personally. Was this meant as an homage to the band? Because it actually made the band look bad, and if this is why it was made, then it was an even bigger failed attempt then this movie was. Or was this made because Oliver Stone liked the music and just wanted to make a movie? Probably. This had no purpose or reason to be made, except maybe to turn people on to the music, and even that didn't work for me.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 135 mins.

Classic Oliver Stone - Bits of Both Worlds,"Oliver Stone's rock & roll biography THE DOORS (1991) contains a fine performance by Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, is enchantingly shot by Robert Richardson who goes the distance in capturing the 'acid experience', and is accompanied by a fine soundtrack that may become overused when Stone paints himself into a corner. The variable film is best when Morrison and his California cools go searching in the desert and experience Native American spirituality, and when they're in studio fighting, struggling and recording, or when Kilmer runs the show with his great impressionism. The film faults when Morrison starts showing his more sensitive side concerning his childhood and romantic relationship towards Meg Ryan's character, or the fact that the artistic rambling by 'The American Poet' is mostly things you've heard when shuffling through a Doors record, and it doesn't really do much to get beneath Morrison's or the audience's skin.

Stone's strange vision of a strange trip.,"While much of what I saw in Oliver Stone's film The Doors very well probably happened, I have no doubt that a lot of it didn't actually happen the way Mr. Stone wants us to think it did. I know Jim Morrison drank and drugged himself to death, and he was one strange, stoned, drunk rock and roll, genius poet, but there is not one moment in this film that isn't depicted as out of control, drug induced, violent and crazy. Watching this film gave me a headache. Stone attempts to take the reader on one mad ride after another as we fly through Jim Morrison and The Doors all too brief life and death as a great rock and roll band. Instead of focusing more on how he met his lifetime companion, and how The Doors formed, this movie is more obsessed with showing us just what a tragic figure Morrison was.Hey Oliver, how about a little bit more on the band and less on the sadness that was Jim Morrison?",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"""a far out trip with the lizard king, but...""","by Dane Youssef""Ray Manzarek turned down Stone's many requests to help in the movie. Manzarek has since said that the movie is a horrible account of the history of the band."" --FROM IMDb triviaGee, I wish he had participated.Stone's ""The Doors"" is a film that loves ""the lizard king's"" stage presence. And the poetic and haunting music he left behind.Stone weaves magnificent unworldly music with mind-blowing visuals, joining the sound and look of two worlds together. We see what the inside of Morrison must've really been like.But seems to have little to no interest in who the rest of ""The Doors"" really were.There is a moment in this film where Morrison is mugging into the camera, making sexy, seductive smiles, cute little pouts and angry-tiger faces for a photographer. Morrison is a Greek sex god as well as a rock god.The photographer tells him: ""You don't need those guys. YOU'RE the talent. You're the one they want. YOU ARE the doors.""She's not the only one who thinks so. A manager who sees them performing at a club says the same thing, offering Morrison a gig if he drops those ""others."" HE'S THE TALENT, he tells Morrison.Many agree with this, apparently and especially Oliver Stone himself, who focuses ENTIRELY about Morrison at his best (and worst) and makes every sequence is this movie a drugged-out trip into the lizard-king's idol status and pin-up persona.The problem--that's ALL this movie seems to be about.Stone may have misnamed this film ""The Doors."" Perhaps he should have named it ""This Is The End: Life & Fast-Times of Jim Morrison."" Morrison was dead by 27, thanks to all the hard work, talent and success to get him there.Morrison truly is the entire focus of Stone's film, perhaps because he was the true mastermind behind it all. Perhaps Morrison truly was ""The Doors.""The rest of the band's stories--from THEIR point of view. What were they about? The movie seems to be made by someone who loved the music and hated the man. Despised him. By the time Morrison moves on to harder drugs, he has gone from a sensitive soulful poet to a raving and destructive monster.The drugs'll do that, you know.Morrison was actually a sweet, deep, thoughtful and sensitive man. Not to mention very shy and humble. But his art wasn't really much until he started using drugs to fuel his creative fires. Like Hendrix, Cobin, Joplin, the narcotics gave him musical genius and inspiration.Himself, especially. He hurts his girlfriend every way he can, he infuriates the other members of the band, he misses rehearsals and performances (well, actually, sometimes he shows up late).If you've ever seen a backstage band biopic, you know how everything will play out. Passionate, talented kids meet, unique, fresh and with big ideas, the group comes together, they make it big, the seduction of the fame, the money, the power, the sex... and they undo themselves until they're sitting in a pool of their own filth and sick in a state of depression and anger.Well actually, once again, in this case, that's just Morrison. Most of the band just backs him up and just gets angrier and angrier by his steady stream of destruction. He inhales every drug and woman he can and starts to harm everyone who crosses his path, including himself, so he can ""break on through to the other side.""Effective, but I wish Stone had taken the focus off this for just a little while.I would have liked some digging into the rest of the band--the history, the bonding, the feelings there. Who they all were. He doesn't even scratch the surface there.The best of this, I suppose, is when Morrison takes his girlfriend and the band on a peyote-fulled trip out to the desert. They bond over fantasies and nightmares, planning the future---and unraveling. What's going to happen to them?Val Kilmer gives perhaps the best performance of his life. He looks like Morrison, as well as sings just like him (rumor had it the real-life band could not tell the difference between Morrison and Kilmer's vocals). He also prances around the stage with as much perverse, energy, fire and gusto as Morrison ever did. He's larger and bigger than life. He captures all the little things about Morrison, as well as the big ones. He has his soul. He does not impersonate Morrison, he possesses him. Perfectly.But a little of Jim goes a long, long, long way. Stone doesn't seem perturbed and keeps laying it on. I got the wild image of Morrison early on and I would've liked to know more about this poet's soul.""They want my dick, not my words,"" he remarks sadly.Other performances are strong, with Kyle MacLachlan as Morrison's truest believer and band-keyboardist (""Twin Peaks"" and ""Showgirls""), Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger (""Swimming with Sharks,"" ""Jimmy Show"" and ""Homage""), Meg Ryan, Billy Idol and Kevin Dillion. They don't really shine, but then they're all never really allowed to. It's all Kilmer's show as Morrison---like the real ""Doors""?Apparently, the movie seems to think so. By the end of the film, of course, Morrison has died--of course. It plays out not so much like a tragedy as really the best thing for everybody (especially Morrison himself--he's finally achieved his dream).Kilmer's performance, the Door's music and Stone's crazy LSD-eyed view make this movie really worth seeing... it's all like a crazy three-month long trip while The Doors are blasting all the time---Morrison at the center of it all. Still blowing everyone away with this fire...Still, I recommend the film. But be forewarned--this is the life of Jim Morrison...""Pretty pretentious, Stone.""by Dane Youssef",6.0,Anonymous,Music
As good a Doors movie as we will ever see,"This film has been hit with a lot of criticism over the years. I guess that with a group as controversial and beloved as the Doors, there are always going to be points of disagreement. And there were things that rubbed me the wrong way too, like casting pleasant Meg Ryan as Pamela Courson, who in some accounts was no sweetheart. And the Morrison death scene too, which most likely came from a heroin overdose - but there is no sign of that in the film. (I'm no Doors expert btw, but I have read a few things here and there.)

It's of course a movie about the group the Doors, although the main focus lies upon Jim Morrison (played by Val Kilmer). One of the career highlights of Val Kilmer, someone who saw him here, would've thought his future had to look bright in the movie industry. Forward to today and he's more known for being difficult on set It's a shame, as he has shown (in the Doors and other movies) that he can be a great actor.I was (and maybe still am?) not fully aware of the whole Doors/Morrison story. Let's call it their ups and downs, if you will. Stone bases his movie on facts, but took the liberty of making up things, as he went along (making the film). Which is his right as a filmmaker, but something that some people didn't take that lightly, accusing him of being a liar.

For instance when the audience were singing along to his add libbing at the beginning of 'break on through' which became known as 'dead cats dead rats' we were lead to believe that this was a piece which had been performed many times before (untrue).

Oliver Stone and Val Kilmer do a fine job in paying tribute to Jim Morrison and The Doors.,"There's no denying that Jim Morrison at the height of his popularity was a free spirited, larger-than-life icon of the 1960s music scene. Women wanted him and men wanted to be him. Away from the microphone, Jim Morrison's life was plagued by alcoholism, drug use, obsession with death, womanising, and bizarre behaviour which saw him having numerous run ins with the law. Oliver Stone does not apologise in pulling no punches and navigating through controversy in telling the psychedelic tale of Jim Morrison's short life and his band The Doors.The movie centers on Jim Morrison's life (Val Kilmer, Top Gun) as well as his fellow band members including John Densmore (Kevin Dillon, Entourage), Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan, Blue Velvet), and Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley, Pulp Fiction). The movie also depicts his relationship with Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle) and Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan, Apollo 13). As the Doors become hugely successful, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as ""The Lizard King"" and his lifestyle descends into alcoholism and drugs. Jim Morrison also raises the ire of many club owners and managers including his own band members and friends grow weary of Jim's bizarre and confrontational behaviour as well as his tardiness for rehearsals and concerts. Jim also finds himself in hot water with the law after being arrested for obscene behaviour on stage.Val Kilmer gives one of his best performances as Jim Morrison. Their likeness is very similar to each other and Val Kilmer does the movie justice by paying tribute to a legend who's untimely death has seen his legacy immortalised. It was also surreal to watch and listen to many of the old songs being resurrected in the movie.The rest of the supporting cast rounds out the movie quite well. In particular the likable Meg Ryan was excellent as Jim Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson. There is an assortment of actors and actresses in small roles including Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Kelly Hu (Cradle 2 The Grave), singer Billy Idol, Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Debi Mazar (Entourage), Michael Wincott (The Crow), Josie Bissett (Melrose Place) and Titus Welliver (Bosch).Director Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from controversy especially evidenced by movies such as Platoon (1986), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), JFK (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994). A lot of Jim Morrison's family, close friends and even fellow band members did not appreciate the way how Jim Morrison was depicted and the movie caused a lot of upset.The Doors pays tribute to Jim Morrison and his band The Doors and this was made possible largely due to the efforts of director Oliver Stone who brought the story to life on the big screen and Val Kilmer in one of his most memorable performances showcasing his abilities as a quality actor by bringing to life the tragic tale of Jim Morrison who was destined to live a short life.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Kilmer's Spotlight,"Oliver Stone has impressed us even more. Stone's masterpiece has shown rock legend Jim Morrison in this visually stunning and excellent work of art. To top that off would be Val Kilmer's best performance, nobody could have filled Jim Morrison's shoes as much as Kilmer. The unusual camera angles, the cinematography and the soundtrack provided by the Doors really makes this more of an amazing artwork. The film clearly deserves more award nominations than it got, everything from start to end was mind-bending and head frying. The film is mostly for Doors fans but is still a great film in anyones eyes. This truly is the best biography of any rock legend. The films is most definently deserving of 10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Movie about a hero? Or just a very damaged trouble maker?,"Forth most, telling this tale of Jim Morrison, it's about an artist, an actual true poet of the modern age, a wild and tormented soul and perhaps a true seeker of existential truth. It's also about the 60s and 70s hippie culture and music.Val Kilmer does a pretty good performance. Meg Ryan is good too, well worth mentioning. And it's amazing how Kilmer almost sounds as Jim Morrison when he sings. It's about sex, drugs and rock n roll, and a little love and romance too. It's also about the rise from the nobody to fame and fortune. It's about the dynamics within a band group. It's about a piece of cultural history of the modern age.It's a pretty good film. I saw the directors cut, which is almost 2 and a half hour, and enjoyed the entire ride of the movie. Though it did get a bit boring at times and sometimes felt didn't really have that much of a point. But sure, Jim Morrison was a very interesting individual, his life and persona is well worth to try to tell a story about. As those larger then life characters are always good fun, especially when their based on real people. And Morrison was perhaps a bit crazy, but he was also very real. That's what I think anyway. This movie is very much worth seeing if you're into the music scene of the 60s and 70s. Though, even if a good movie, Almost Famous is a bit more charming and entertaining, but that's just what I think.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A great movie but the truth is twisted,"This is one of my favourite movies, although the view of Jim Morrison is very one sided, particularly in the second half of the film. It just portrays Jim as a alcoholic, drug addict maniac. This was one side of him, but he was also a brilliant poet and songwriter and actually a very polite person while sober. I don't know why Oliver Stone had to twist things round so much, because the story would still be very interesting if it was just told straight. Anyhow, Val Kilmer's performance is great although I decided he obviously isn't much of a singer after seeing this. Still, it's an excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Please Note: LOTS of flashing lights in this film!!,"Didn't comb through all the reviews but I think it should be more widely known ahead of time if you plan to watch this movie there are a lot of flashing lights and may affect some people who are sensitive to that. Don't want you to have any unpleasant surprises!Ok so the movie itself: i love the music of the Doors, and i had heard Val Kilmer's performance / resemblance as Mr. Mojo Risin was uncanny- and it totally was! It was a treat for a young person like me to feel like i am seeing the real deal. Not just Jim, but their entire band, crew, audience, felt really real.I have to admit, going into this movie about psychedelic/ acid rock... i don't think i was prepared for how trippy it was. I'm so glad I didn't smoke or edible before watching this, haha. Lots of moments I felt really anxious and worried about Jim and those around him.Maybe it depends on the setting in which you watch this. I was in my bedroom alone in the dark so i thought the lights were intense and, well, the film itself was more intense than I had expected. But I mean that in a way where I felt moved by it after it was over. It had me thinking about The Doors fame, not as stories I read online or in books, but as it happened in real time back then. Funny how it felt so REAL but also like a TRIP all at once.I'm glad i finally watched it. RIP to Jim and Ray.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Doors (1991),"Oliver Stone, a director notorious for rewriting historical events to suit his own agenda, is in typical form in this epic aggrandizement.Though Stone is often regarded as one of cinema's foremost chroniclers of the 60s, The Doors seems aimed not so much at those who ""were there,"" & who might thus be expected to view the film from a nostalgic as well as a critical perspective, as it is at young people liable to be seduced by the film's idealistic glamor without questioning its historical validity. I know; I was one of their smitten multitudes at the time it came out. Hence the movie finds Stone (as usual) simply doing whatever he wants, with a kind of indulgence that can only be described as adolescentfrom having Jim Morrison quit UCLA Film School when he actually graduated from it to attributing the words of French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud to Morrison himself. It wouldn't have been out of line if he'd marketed his film in conjunction with meal deals and ""Doors"" action figures, because that, in spite of star Val Kilmer's best efforts, is precisely what the script makes this story into. Peppered with cringingly bad but campishly fabulous dialog like ""We're gonna fu*k death away, baby"" and ""Would you forget about The Doors? It's you they wantJim Morrison, the god of rock"" Stone's script might have easily come right out of Spinal Tap; even if, in all fairness, 20-something rock stars in the prime of their careers do tend to be clichés...whether they're prodigiously brilliant lyricists or not.By most accounts, there seems to be no doubt Morrison was probably as excessive as Stone portrays him here. In fact, the rock star's theatricality fits...and mostly conveniently renders superfluous...the director's penchant for the same. But even with so much real-life luridness to work with, Stone doesn't hesitate to repeatedly insert inventions.....such as in the scene where a jealously raging ""Jim"" locks a heroin-droopy ""Pam"" in the closet and sets it on fire.On the positive side, Val Kilmer does a wonderful job here. His is one of those rare performances that is more psychic channeling than homage, and his physical resemblance to Morrison is uncanny. But Meg Ryan as the 18-24 year old Pamela Courson, Morrison's ""cosmic mate,"" is absurd, and Kathleen Quinlan as his wife-by-Wiccan handfasting ceremony Patricia Kennealy is even more off the mark. The innately eccentric Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol is an interesting choice, and one that might have worked, if his hairpiece had only looked less like an Eva Gabor catalog accessory. The cinematography, as it is in most of Stone's films, is stunning, evoking other campy but beautiful road films like Easy Rider & Zabriskie Point.Those who care enough about The Doors to inquire further are advised to read Danny Sugarman's biography ""No One Here Gets Out Alive."" As for Stone, 18 years later, he's still in a Tim Drummish/Peter Panish haze, and his penchant for action figureyfrom entertainers to politicians.is strong as ever.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
If you take a walk to the Père Lachaise.....,"...you will see Morrison's grave .It's exactly how Stone depicts it in his movie.The singer still retains a strong cult here there and everywhere.He rests in peace near French singers Serge Gainsbourg and Edith Piaf,both famous for having burnt the candle at both ends .Like him.The beginning of the movie made me fear a Godardesque treatment (they hint at the French director several times)but fortunately Stone wisely forgot the pretentious French Nouvelle Vague and opted for a chronological plot.Like in those rock stars biopics,too little time is given over to musical creation (""Light my fire"" is the only exception) and most of the rest is devoted to spectacular shows with plenty of ""lewd and lascivious behavior in public"" .Also included is the meeting with Nico ,but the latter has a short appearance,which is wise,cause the actress does not look German at all.Ray Manzarek did not like the film which he called ""fake"" .Val Kilmer,however,gives a good performance which is commendable for portraying such an icon was not an easy task.",,Anonymous,Music
A mesmerizing performance by Val Kilmer in a good musical biopic...,"The latest in our musical biopic series was Oliver Stone's 1991 film ""The Doors"". Despite my major disdain for Stone, he's made some remarkable films. I didn't know much about Jim Morrison going in (other than seeing his grave at Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris) and only vaguely knew The Doors' music. The film offers an authentic portrayal of the late '60s rock scene, with Val Kilmer mesmerizing as Morrison. The movie doesn't shy away from showing Morrison as a troubled yet immensely talented figure, embodying the ultimate rockstar lifestyle.We followed up the biopic with The Doors documentary, ""When You're Strange"", which was the perfect complement. Watching the documentary after the film added depth and context to Morrison's story. There was tons of archival footage and while we still didn't get any answers as to Morrison's demons, it was a great doc. Both movies are worth seeing especially if you're a Doors fan or just interested in the history of rock and roll.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An entertaining and inaccurate look at The Lizard King.,"First of all I have to say that I quite liked this movie. It was entertaining(mildly) and great for an evening spent with friends. I'ts ROCK AND ROLL.Now-for anybody wanting to get behind Morrison the myth and know Morrison the man-this is not the movie for you.This movie doesn't get much past the drugs, groupies etc etc. Shock value-yes. Excess-yes. And as I stated it IS entertaining.But it doesn't tell you anything. This movie is not a 10 and it so could have been. I have no problem with Kilmer's acting. He really creeped me out with the physical transofrmation as well as doing his own singing(quite erie actually). All the other roles were well cast too with the possible exception of Pamela(Meg Ryan??) Sorry Oliver that was off, she's to preppy and girly girly to play a sixtie's rock star and poet's girlfriend. That said-good acting doesn't mean a thing if the movie in general(the script) doesn't cut it. Jim Morrison was one of the most influential poet and song writers in the world and I for one would have liked to see that sweet, mystical part of him, that part of him that captured hundreds of thousands of people worldwide expanded on.There is not another movie that does it but anyone wanting to get a sense of Jim would be strongly advised to read ""strange days"" a book about Jim written by his wife Patricia Keneely(did I spell it right??).There was a review posted on here that said the patricia character didn't exist. She actually did exist and was the only woman Jim ever wed. That's just one thing among many many others the movie barely touched on.So that's my review-again-entertaining-yes. Holds your interest-yes. good acting(for the most part)-yes.Deep, analytical or getting inside the incredible person that was Jim Morrison-no way baby!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It Made a Fan Out of Me,"Despite it's flaws, I can't help but include Oliver Stone's THE DOORS whenever I'm asked my favorite movies. I knew nothing of the band before seeing the movie and I'd only heard the name Jim Morrison in passing. This film changed all that, as it follows the Doors' formation in Venice Beach, CA in 1966, their rise to fame, and Morrison's plunge into alcoholism and ultimate demise in Paris in 1971. This film turned me into a fan of the band overnight, exposing me to the amazing music and the mystery surrounding one of music's most interesting figureheads.Seeing as how I watched this movie pre-fandom, I was able to view it with a more unbiased eye. Val Kilmer was amazing as Morrison, and I still believe so after having further exposure to Morrison through video and biographies. I can't think of any that could've done a better job portraying Morrison's coy style, erratic behavior, and tortured psyche. Kilmer's vocals were astounding, and often hard to discern from the real Morrison. Meg Ryan was hit-or-miss for me in her role as Pam Courson, Morrison's longtime lover/soulmate. There were points in the film where I felt she did a great job, and others where she didn't quite fit the role. On the other hand, the film is loaded with great performances from Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillon, Frank Whaley, and, my personal favorite cameo...Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol.My only major issue with the film are the liberties Oliver Stone took with the details of Morrison's life. Those who watch this film need to understand that Stone exaggerated a good deal in this movie, tweaked history, and seemed to focus on Morrison's drunken antics rather than the tortured artist or his underlying intelligence (the man was tested at genius level IQ of 149 in grade school). Instead, Morrison is portrayed as a fool and overgrown child. I also wish the movie had given a bit more focus to the group dynamics amongst the band members, but Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger are essentially pushed into the background.Regardless, the movie is entertaining. Stone was sure to include many of the important events in the career of the Doors, from their firing at the Whiskey a Go-Go to Jim's legal troubles in New Haven and Miami. It gives you one perspective on the Morrison myth but I urge you not to accept Stone's movie as fact. If you find yourself as big a fan as me after viewing the film, do yourself a favor and read a couple of biographies on Jim. Once you've collected information, you can form your own opinion, but in the meantime, enjoy THE DOORS.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Bodyswerve territory,"I've seen this flick a few times - it's a pretty poor offering.Stone sleep-walked thru this one, basically it's a 2 hour mtv pop video that has the standard 'self-indulgent pretty boy with an opedial complex' tacked on for a plot:-) I understand that the families of the morrison and his girlfriend managed to wrangle some script control in pre-production stages and perhaps it's for that reason the movie is so tedious, however, I like generally like oliver stone movies and i still was expecting a lot more than this.The only thing i liked about the movie were the credits opening with 'riders on the storm' and the camera sweeping out over the hills and out into the desert, there were a few other odd touches but not enough to hold the intrest.Beyond an incredibly uncanny stunning resemblance to jim morrison (and some nice make-up) kilmer's characterisation is virtually zero and meg ryan is (as usual) awful - in fairness though neither is helped by an absolute dog of a script.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Great musical biography film,"Oliver Stone's The Door's is a biographical take on Jim Morrison and you'd be hard pressed to find a lot of faults here- Kilmer is literally the photo copy of the real Jim and Meg Ryan is adorable as his girlfriend.

No one here Get's out alive. The Legend of Jim Morrison.,THE DOORS Is a stand out Rock bio. first class all the way. Playing right up to the myths of Jim Morrison. The Story of The Doors is a easy one to tell. The Story of Jim Morrison isn't. Oliver Stone does his best here giving us the old John Ford adage. When the legend becomes fact print the legend. Morrison's childhood wasn't an easy one. A true genius Morrison read everything he got his hands on and memorized it books became his only friends.His only true friends in school remember him as a risk taker and a practical joker. The teachers Hated him Because Morrison Had been more well read then them and always thought outside the box. I time he became a Rebel against the system testing people Always testing them. Morrison became interested in film and went to The film school at UCLA there he met Ray Manzerek a Man that became his best friend and mentor . Thru Ray Morrison met Robby Kriger and John Densmore after Morrison read his poetry to Ray on a beach in Venice California after quitting film school Morrison spent a year on a friends roof top taking drugs and writing poetry. To Ray these sounded like songs. The popular line is Ray told Jim let's start a band and make a million bucks and Morrison replied I already have a name for it THE DOORS. That part is true. Morrison was influenced by the works of Huxley and the poems of William Blake took the line if the Doors of perception were cleared everything would appear as it is infinite. Together They created a revolution that is still felt today. The Myths of Jim Morrison are great stories but they eclipse the Actual Jim Morrison. The Jim Morrison that actually was a nice guy that cared about his fans and loved his friends and had a problem in Drugs and booze. The Drugs and Booze twisted Morrison into a bizarre parody of himself. A Morrison that slept with every woman that crossed his path and caught his eye. Yet a Morrison that was hopelessly in love with Pam Courson. They had a stormy and chaotic relationship as the movie indicates. But each was the love of the other's life. Morrison was also a first rate poet and a first rate singer. A fact that gets overlooked by his looks and his body. A fact he hated which is why in his later years Morrison became fat and bearded trying to destroy the sex god image. Oliver Stone touches on all of this and he gives us the myths trying to look like facts. and he omitted a lot. But it's a two hour long movie and Stone had to omit a lot but add in Indians and Foretelling Morrison's death. But the movie itself never suffers from that. In fact the movie is a steady roller coaster ride. Going from one extreme to the next that by the time it ends you just sit back and go Wow. And man does this movie make me miss Jim Morrison. I never knew him but it makes me wonder .What heights could this man have reached If he had still been alive. The possibilities are endless. Or maybe it was a merciful act by fate to take the Lizard King so early. Either Way the movie is a powerhouse keg of dynamite. As for Val Kilmer I've just one question. How the Hell did he NOT get nominated for his portrayal of Jim Morrison ? He should have been and Won the Oscar. His portrayal is simply that powerful. A Incredible movie by any means of the imagination.,10.0,Anonymous,Music

A True Disservice,"You know, as dynamic and visceral a filmmaker as Oliver Stone can be, his deliberately subjective assessment of his subjects is not always appropriate. In the case of ""The Doors"", I will say that I find Stone's symbolic pulp imposition of 60's and 70's culture onto the titular individuals inappropriate at least, near slanderous at worst. Based on interviews, concert footage, essentially any real documentation of The Doors it is more than clear that these were articulate, talented and sensitive individuals...something almost at odds with Stone's bombastic and exploitative treatment (or perhaps his real perspective on the group). If Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek are considered peripheral players to the sensationalized events of the film, perhaps they should consider themselves lucky. Jim Morrison (played, albeit, with real intention and commitment by Val Kilmer) is made into a truly abhorrent caricature, devoid of all the subtlety and contradiction that made him a genuinely compelling performer and lyricist. The pathetic and near-transcendent humanity of Morrison in the midst of self-destruction and the complex interplay of the group's playing is completely overlooked by Stone in this film in favor of - what else- kinky sex, copious amounts of drugs and petty gestures of rock recreation. While the excess of this story may be real, the human was too.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The definative rock bio (and that's NOT a complement),"Rock bios.  Is there anything sillier?  Sometimes they can be okay, but normally, they're just sleazified accounts of our heros (or anti-heros) which are so very boring.  The pacing is usually sluggish and the characters have diolauge that sucks.  This is the film that has all of those bad points, but also many of  the good traits (although, I can't remember any esoteric jokes for Doors fans like the film BACKBEAT had for Beatles fans, like using song titles in the diolauge). One of the first things to note is that the second-highest billing goes to a character who didn't exist!  Patricia, is simply a composite character invented to shorten the economy of characters yet still tell famous tales of Morrison's life.  I didn't like this character and, while I don't know whether Morrison ever did try and convince a girlfriend to have an abortion, I sure didn't think it was a cool scene.  I'll return to the bad in a little bit. On the other hand, the cast of a rock bio is almost always good. Val Kilmer is fabulous as the Lizard King.  The whole band seems accurate, except Kevin Dillon seems somewhat cockier than John Densmore ever did in real life.  Meg Ryan was probably pretty accurate as Pamela, and Crispin Glover is great as Andy Warhol. The music is, of course, excellent, although a friend of mine has the album and if they were going to use a Velvet Underground song on it, they should have put more artists on it for consistancy's sake or take theirs off and have an all Doors affair. Back to the bad.  Not only is the Patricia character little more than an on switch for bad Morrison (or, rather, particularly bad Morrison), she also messes up the relationship between Jimbo and Pam Courson.  Did he really need two love interests? Usually, filmmakers ignore infedelities and make the guy's chick his one-and-only.  Why go to the trouble of creating someone else? As for the diolauge.  Yes, the diolauge ALWAYS sucks in biopics, especially rock biopics, especially this one!  Nothing slows down the pacing of a film like exposition, but this one is a nightmeare in that regard!  Take the scene where Krieger presents ""Light My Fire"" and they improve upon it.  It's as if they read a brief discription of what everyone did and recited what they're supposed to do and tried adding a modicum of non squiter to cover it up.  It's just labored exposition that doesn't sound like things people would say. Now, Manzarek and Morrison meet, obviously, in a film class.  The way it's portrayed, Morrison makes a bizzare and depressing film about NAZIs and other nonsense.  According to Manzarek's book LIGHT MY FIRE, it was nothing like that.  Indeed, Morrison is notorious for his horrible antics, but the film makes him out to be essentially pure evil.  It portrays Morrison as having no redeeming value.  He's basically portrayed as a pied piper of horror and misery and people either react to him in disgust, use him to further themselves (Warhol, the briefly-seen photographer, the patricia monstrosity) or submit to him as if he's a high priest.  Never has a music bio been so condescending and yet so distrustful. On many levels, this film is entertaining and competant.  Even exciting at times.  But mostly, it's a depressing character assassination.  Stone is obviously fascinated by Morrison, but this film plays almost more like a docudrama about a disease or serial killer whose makers fall under a spell. Stone's worst crime is that he didn't give us a film about someone he admires, but someone he's obsessed with in a negative way. He doesn't seem to like Morrison.  It's as if he's afraid of him.",,Anonymous,Music
"""The movie will begin in five moments..."" the myth and the film.","The Doors are one of those bands who have travelled through generations , mantaining the same spirit throughout the decades. Oliver Stone made an extraordinary film, not as a biography, but as a work of art. He wanted to teld the story of the myth, enduring it, not the story of the man. Val Kilmer is at his best, sometimes I got scared with the resemblance, in the most remarcable work of his life so far. Being a fan of The Doors I must say that the relations between scenarios, characters and soundtrack is also truely overwelming. The focus on Jim Morrison is a central aspect of the film and, in my opinion that's the reason why it  the film impresses everybody, even those less familiar with the band's music and reputation. The way Stone films the path from stardom to decadence is one of the key features to understand its success. It is a film to remain a part of history as a document of a generation, and a way to pass the spirit and the music of The Doors to the future fans.

A cinematic advance in an era where true cinema seems all but forgotten!,"This film is a gem!  Without a doubt the best film of the music genre of cinema.  Val Kilmer delivers an astounding performance in which he almost seems to be channeling the energy of Jim Morrison.  Although I am not a fan of Oliver Stone I must give credit where it is due he did a terrific job with this film.  This film is what Stone is capable of when he actually knows what he is attempting to comment on.  Stone does an amazing job several times throughout the film of recreating events as they actually occurred, but simultaneously realizes that ultimately for a film to possess its own vitality, a vitality beyond that of a mere representation or reflection of reality it must transcend reality and attempt to express something much deeper than what is on the surface.  Stone also does an excellent job in getting stellar performances out of the rest of the cast. This is one of the few films of Meg Ryan's I've ever seen where she does a good enough job to make you really forget about her and focus on the character.  The cinematography by Robert Richardson (director of photography of Platoon, Wall Street, Natural Born Killers, Born on the Fourth of July, Casino, Bringing Out the Dead, and many more) is bold and extraordinary, making it one of the most unique and distinct visual films I have ever seen. The great thing about this film is it is so much more than a behind the scenes account of a rock n' roll band.  It is also very interesting in that most of the score consists of songs of the band that the story is about, and I have never seen another film that has accomplished this to the same extent.  In a time when there are so few films that give first priority to the cinematic content of the film this is a refreshing masterpiece that discovers new territory.  Whether or not you enjoy the film it is one of the few cinematic films of its decade, and it is also safe to say that there is no other film exactly like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Impressive film,"I have never been a fan of Meg Ryan or Val Kilmer but I have to say their performances in this movie blew me away. When this movie first came out I refused to go watch it for those two reasons alone. I thought the film would be laughable. Well,I do love the Doors and when I found the movie for 99 cents at a thrift store and needed some entertainment for the weekend,I purchased it. Amazed and impressed,I watched it three times! Val Kilmer was incredible,rough and sexy,not the usual arrogant ,pretty boy he plays in so many films. Meg Ryan was beautiful and sensitive. I was surprised to see Kyle McLachlin(strong,sensible but SO cool-he looked like John Sebastin,Loving Spoonful!),Paul Williams,Crispin Glover and Kathleen Quinlan(you must see her-simply amazing!) who all played excellent roles. Val Kilmer would have been my last choice for this role,just by the characters he played in other films,but whoever chose him is a genius because after seeing the film,he was the perfect choice for the role.

The Bores,"Oliver Stone's The Doors is a film as chaotic and electrifying as its subject, Jim Morrison, but it ultimately drowns in its own excess. While Val Kilmer delivers an astonishingly immersive performance-so convincing that even surviving band members struggled to distinguish his voice from Morrison's-the film itself fixates too much on the rock star's self-destructive tendencies at the expense of his artistry.Stone, known for his intense and immersive filmmaking, crafts a visual and sonic experience that mirrors Morrison's hallucinatory world. The cinematography, editing, and music work together to create a psychedelic fever dream. Yet, while this approach captures the wild energy of The Doors as a band, it also makes the film feel repetitive and exhausting. Morrison is portrayed less as a poetic visionary and more as a reckless hedonist, making it hard to connect with him beyond his destructive impulses.The biggest flaw of The Doors is its lack of balance. Morrison's musical genius and the collaborative nature of the band take a backseat to his substance-fueled downward spiral. Other band members-Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore-are relegated to the background, making the story feel one-sided. The film paints Morrison as larger than life but rarely allows us to see him beyond the myth.Ultimately, The Doors is an intoxicating but frustrating biopic-visually stunning, sonically thrilling, but emotionally hollow. It's a film that captures the chaos of Morrison's life but loses sight of the depth behind the legend.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Drags on and on and on,"This film was incredibly tedious and although Val Kilmer looked the part, overall the piece failed to capture the incredible charisma Jim Morrison had.

By the end I wanted to throw my shoe at the screen.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth seeing once but it is sadly all over the place in many regards and almost totally failed to engage me,"Starting out on his poetic journey as a film student in LA, Jim Morrison meets Ray Manzarek, who he would go on to form The Doors with. With an immediate following and good songs, they get picked up by a label despite them being pulled off stage for Jim declaring his desire to 'f**k his father'. With their music, Jim's creativity and their infamy The Doors become big but Morrison himself becomes bigger and refuses to play along  bucking the system, getting arrested, upsetting the establishment, doing drugs and sleeping with every woman he can. However as time goes on he becomes increasingly erratic to the detriment of the band.Although I like the songs of theirs that I have heard, it would do others on this forum a disservice to describe myself as a fan. However I was interested enough in them to give this film a try, although the fact that it was by Oliver Stone would have been enough for me to try it out. What is immediately apparent though is that Stone has been overwhelmed by the supposed poetry of the period and the laughable idea that Morrison was some sort of visionary who was guided by spirits in his creativity  it is surreal and hilarious to see the constant presence of a Native American wandering around in all the scenes. It is this forced mysticism that really spoils the film, forcing it down our throats rather than telling us a story and letting us take what we will from it. The story is dragged out by scenes of drug taking etc and it makes the film too long for the material to support, making it dull  surprising if you consider the subject matter!Stone's direction helps keep it worth seeing, using different techniques to deliver a visually interesting (if slightly uninspiring) telling of Morrison's life. However, having given him that, Stone was also shoulder much of the blame for the major flaws in the film  the overdone mysticism I've already mentioned but even poorer are the half-assed attempts to take meaning from a childhood that we are told nothing about. The fights over whether or not this is a true story is one that I will leave to the fans but for my money I immediately discarded most of what I was being told once the Indian started walking around! After that stuff started to become a big part of the film I just watched it as a film as opposed to a true story. The music is all good and the recreation of shows are pretty enjoyable and, if not accurate, certainly felt of the time to me. It's just a shame that the films narrative is rather weak and just not good enough to make this an engaging film.The cast is deep with famous faces and most do OK. Kilmer does a great impression of Morrison's voice during the shows but outside of these he is lumbered with a sort of Jesus-like character as directed by Stone; he does try really hard and he is good it's just that I never bought Morrison as the person that Stone would have me believe he was. Meg Ryan is a strange choice and she works as the loyal, girl-next-door type but when her descent happens I was not convinced by it for a second. Support is generally good from MacLachlan, Dillon and Whaley, while the background is filled with well known faces  some in roles, some very hard to spot because they move so quickly. Madsen, Idol, Quinlan are the most obvious but there are a range of small roles (some extras) for Studi, Westerman, Kelly Hu, Mimi Rogers, Crispin Glover, Eagle Eye Cherry, Jennifer Tilly and Stone himself. However a busy cast doesn't guarantee great performances and, while Kilmer is pretty good in the lead role, it is the script that gives nobody very much to really work with that takes away from the cast  the film is about Morrison, having so many people in support just cluttered the film unnecessarily.Overall this is not a rubbish film it is just not a very good one. It's lack of involving narrative makes it feel overlong and the whole mysticism thing is a total dud that got laughs from me at several points  I don't know how much of the story is true or not but I'm content to believe that all that side of it is just nonsense! Stone directs well and makes everything look interesting (particularly the gigs) but his script takes away from the very thing he was trying to do. By the end of the film (when it arrives) I was bored and really beyond caring. If you really want to know about The Doors then there are plenty of firsthand accounts in books etc rather than relying on this film where Stone just seemed to make up aspects to suit himself. Could have been interesting and, although it's just about worth seeing once, it fails on it's potential and comes across as a rather confused and dull mess.",,Anonymous,Music

Jim Morrison Featuring The Doors,"The Doors biopic is, obviously, about The Doors... kind of. Its more of a Jim Morrison biopic to where it barely gives insight on the relationship between band and Morrison which separates this movie from being a Jim film rather than it about the band. Besides all that, it really isn't a bad film. Its a pretty good Morrison film, actually. But since it is called ""The Doors"" i came in expecting to see quite a bit of the band itself but i barely got to see it. All i really saw was an interesting yet annoying acid trip of the mess-ily told story of Jim Morrison with a sprinkle of The Doors.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock America With a Movie,"Oliver Stone is mostly known for films like ""JFK,"" films whose influence can be widely seen and recognized or whose subject matters were considered common ground for all. It is ironic, then, that his two best films were actually the fearless, belittled ""Alexander"" and the psychedelic ""The Doors."" This biography of Jim Morrison's enigmatically short career chronicles Morrison's (the confidence-inspiring Val Kilmer) rise from UCLA Film School dropout to his sheer infamy in the 1960s, the trippiest of all decades. The cast is good, especially in regards to the many cameos by the actual people from the story (example: Patricia Kennealy as a priestess).What amazes me about this movie is what would come to be its similarity to ""Alexander."" Morrison is Kilmer's Philip-- a swaggering, staggering, boozing idol. The visual style and trippy feel of the films mesh beautifully. The only thing that makes ""The Doors"" not as enjoyable is (in addition to some general weak dialogue and poor staging) its constant flashes of whiplash-inducingly random nudity. Though ""Alexander"" took the rap for being sexual, it had barely over one scene of actual sex in the movie-- but with its references, explicit content, and thunderous parade of breasts, ""The Doors"" outdoes that film.One of a great many psychedelic films worth checking out, and well worth the mere $5 price tag at a certain retail giant....",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Oliver Stone Delivers Drug Addiction,"The Doors broke onto the scene in the late '60s with a ""Carnival Music"" sound. Jim Morrison takes you for a ride that could be your last. Follow the ""Pied Piper"" of Rock and Roll to your doom. The Merry go Round doesn't stop unless you can dislodge yourself and fly away. As Pamela Courson discovered the ""Magic Ride"" with Jim is short and addictively deadly.The Doors reflected the constant Jungle Warfare in Viet Nam - ""The End"", ""The Musics Over"" and several other tunes drag you down into the depths of despair - showing endless war and strife. Jim and his massive alcohol and drug addiction ""Lit His Fire"" alright, along with countless other lost souls.We survived the War and the Revolution and we're still here - we are the ""Beautiful Friend"" that Morrison sings about. Addiction took many of us and is still reaping it's deadly harvest. We were able to detach ourselves from Morrison and his Death Spiral - we survived to look back at his destruction along with those that followed him.Oliver Stone showed the uncontrolled Jim Morrison and the destructive power he wielded. No one could stop or prevent the eventual outcome. I however lived to learn from this legendary ""Pied Piper"".",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Doors – where good music divides itself from the Justin Gagas and Lady Biebers,"I've heard and read much criticism about Oliver Stones ""The Doors""-biopic. The shortest may have been ""I'm nobody, I'm drunk and depressed; I'm famous, I'm drunk and depressed. I'm fat, I'm drunk and depressed and I'm famous and dead"" (presumably no longer drunk and depressed). Others have criticized that Val Kilmer looks nothing like the real ""Lizard King"", or that the story adds little new to story of both band and singer. That may to an extent be all true that ""The Doors"" is an excellent film.At the same time I have to warn that is by no means an objective opinion. See, I come from a generation where the music of ""Pink Floyd"", ""The Rolling Stones"", ""The Who"" and ""The Doors"" was an integral part of growing-up. It didn't even matter that Jim Morrison had already been dead for more than 20 years. See, it was a divided time, where honest music had become scare and channels like MTV had just begun their barrage of intolerable, artificially-hyped fluff (little did we know of the horrors to still come). So there was the alternative between this Pop, some contemporary honest Rock- and Metal-acts like ""Guns N'Roses"" or ""Nirvana"", and of course the ""Golden Oldies"" from father's tape- and record-collection. This was all zealously played on the weekends and when Oliver Stones ""The Doors"" finally arrived on videotape, this too was zealously watched before, during and often after various parties. As said: Good times that stand between an objective review.How true to the fact Stones film is, let historians and people from the era decide that. Fact is, that the film captured the essence of the time, the 1960's and 70's, at least to the point where we viewers, who weren't around then, would like to envision it. We cared little about the social-upheaval of the time, the Flower-Power-movement or Vietnam; we cared about honest Rock-music, epic performances and one of the most charismatic band-leaders of the time. All this we got in both the music and the film itself. Again, it is true that Val Kilmer optically didn't look much like Morrison but the performance went far beyond anything that has since (and after) been given by many look-alike characters. Kilmer even did the unthinkable: singing most of the material himself and emulating the Lizard King to a tit. Yes, after a few moments Kilmer has convinced us that he IS Morrison, by virtues of acting, not make-up or special-effects. Indeed, a performance that would have deserved more praise and awards than it got.If there's any criticism from my side, it may be that the film is too short. Not just from a fans perspective, who would have spent some more time with Jim, Ray and the other boys (all superbly acted by all involved, included extras and cameos), but because we would have wished to learn a little more about the enigma that was Jim Morrison. Like Oliver Stone once said himself (paraphrasing here): ""A movie is two hours and you cannot condense a persons full life to two hours"". Sure, there must have been more to Morrison than the fast-living hellraiser and drunken hoodlum-poet in the movie, but more often it's what left out from a persons life rather than what's been meticulously shown that turns a life into a legend. That's a balance that Oliver Stone got just right and hence the film gets a very subjective 8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kilmer's best work,"Val Kilmer shines in this performance as Jim Morrison. I don't know how much of the film is really true (knowing Oliver Stone, not much).

Amazing imitation of Jim Morrison,"Val Kilmer does an amazing job at not only acting as Jim, but also singing his music. Val Kilmer had a band called the Doors before he became an actor. It was a garage band, tribute to The Doors. They played in clubs and such. He sang the songs himself and worked with the original Doors band in getting down all the characteristics of Jim Morrison as close as possible. A great job by Oliver Stone to project the imagine of one of the best bands of the 60's onto the movie screen! The Doors endorsed the movie, so it would have to be very accurate. Most bands would not have endorsed a movie about themselves. A movie meant to see!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Val Kilmer folks if for no other movie he ever did this is the one that will knock you're socks off completely,, he is better in this than Heat . He sounds just like Morisson,, I really thought that Meg Ryan for the character for Pamela was an odd choice,, but it didn't work out too bad,, it is a wonderful trip,, hearing all of those classic and some not so classic doors songs in the movie,, yeah the movie is long,, and follows Jim's childhood to his death,, follows the band somewhat,, and Pamela,, a great movie , but i think you need to have lived a little and had some life experiences before y ou can completely understand a movie like this,,, great job for everyone involved in the picture,, i think Jim would be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent Movie...Great Movie if You Like the Doors,"One of the only problems with this movie is that it cuts straight from the car accident scene that Morrison witnessed as a child to the late 60's, when he is completely immersed in a world of excess.  Morrison's late childhood and teenage years are not represented in this movie, and if you've ever seen a documentary about him (i.e. VH1 Legends), you would know that his experience as a military brat, his interests as a child, and his relationship with his family would shape his unusual personality and drive him towards poetry, music and the excesses of dope, booze and sex.Most of scenes in the movie actually took place.  The TV- throwing scene, the closet-burning scene, and the ""You killed my duck"" scene are the exceptions.  It seems to dwell on the most negative aspects of Morrison's life and personality, and that doesn't help to paint him in a positive light.The positives:  Val Kilmer was great (the acting was pretty good), Stone's experimentation with camera techniques (like the peyote scene), and of course the music.  The biggest contribution was from the band for which this movie was named.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

If Morrison never made music he would just be another weirdo in a smokey basement reading to ppl in berets and all those great songs would never have been made.

Kilmer really did a great job at portraying Morrison. He did his best and pulled it off well in my book.I don't view this movie as ""the gospel"" of The Doors band but I enjoy the film as simply a fun rock movie film with some true to real life events.

Stone's Beautiful Tribute Succeeds All The Way,"Only Oliver Stone could manage to make a 140 minute bio-drama about this band and make it work. He and cinematographer Robert Richardson make this a wonderful, tripped-out experience that never leaves reality behind (I'm speaking of drama, not facts) and never lets nostalgia overcome the story. Of course I'll give credit where it's due, Val Kilmer gives what is probably his best performance in the role of the one and only Jim Morrison.The film opens with a depiction of that famous event from Morrison's childhood, when he saw the Indian die, setting the viewer up for the semi-legendary tone of this film. Stone clearly has a reverence for the time and the man. From there we follow Morrison from being misunderstood in film-school through his life and love and years with The Doors, to his death in Paris. Along the way, Oliver Stone works another miracle: he prevents Meg Ryan from ruining the film with that irritating ""cuteness"" that's left so many others in flames. Ryan is forced into the non-cute position of Morrison's lover and ""muse"" who suffers endlessly at his fame and drug abuse. One of my favorite scenes has Kilmer dangling out a window asking Ryan if she'd die for him.The soundtrack is almost entirely Doors songs, many of which are performed (very well) by Kilmer. The supporting cast features an unrecognizable Kyle MacLachlan in a good turn as another member of The Doors. As with many Stone films, fact and fiction are blended together to tell the story, but it doesn't detract at all from the worth of this film. What the viewer gets is an emotionally active look at the short life and career of Jim Morrison. The performances are good, Stone's script and direction are in good form, and the photography and editing elevate the film to a higher level of cinema.THE DOORS is a must see picture. Never before or since has there been a celebrity biography to succeed so thoroughly as a drama and as a film. Reggie can't get enough of this!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Do your homework!,"I'd normally never dream of commenting on a movie on a website. It's much more fun to do that at home with friends, but while reading some other comments on this movie, I couldn't hold it back any more.First of all: Before watching this movie it's better to know a little something about The Doors and especially about Jim Morrison. This movie pretty accurately describes Jim's life during the sixties, and his relationship with the rest of the band and everyone around him. The fact that it was made in cooperation with the other members of the band kind of gives that away.Secondly: If you don't know anything about Jim, it's easy to say that the film was over the top. But that's exactly how Jim Morrison was, over the top, larger then life, a genius in his own time. He was a living legend that refused to abide by the rules society placed on him.And thirdly: Some sequences in the movie will strike you as awkward if you're not familiar with the Doors, but fans will recognise them, and appreciate the effort put into this film.At this point I have to say that Val Kilmer's portrayal of Jim was scary in it's accuracy. Not only did he look like him, but he seemed to get everything right. His movement, his manner of talking, the way Jim would give away a show. It wasn't acting, it was almost like seeing Jim reincarnated.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One-sided Jim Morrison: a monster,"Expectations are always high when it comes to biopics, as if they are to show everything and accurately. But biopics are movies per se, therefore the one-sided, completely insane and possessed side of Jim Morrison shown in this film is just the filmmakers' choice here.So let's deal with it, but isn't the film too long for this crazy trip towards self-destruction? The actors are good and the filming is great, but there is too much insanity in the script, which in the end becomes boring.Where is the poet's greatness, what is the basis for the legend? Or it's just lewd behavior, drugs and booze instead of the real freedom? So, ultimately the flower power movement and the rebels in rock were hijacked by the man and by their own flaws.

A Near Masterpiece.,"Oliver Stone's The Doors is an amazing movie that is entertaining, captivating, atmospheric and highly rewatchable.Val Kilmer portrays The Doors's leader Jim Morrison and gives a flawless performance of a flawed man. Kilmer captures the spirit of Jim Morrison in every scene, creating a sometimes sympathetic, sometimes unlikeable, but overall brilliant character.Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon portray Morrison's band mates Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore respectively. They do a very good job and the chemistry between them works just fine.Meg Ryan is also great as Jim's soulmate, Pamela Courson. Needless to say, both Kilmer and Ryan also show perfect chemistry and create some of the film's most memorable scenes.To me, The Doors is a near masterpiece. Maybe a ""love or hate"" film.

About Meg Ryan as Pam,"I was born in 1979 and absolutely after The Doors in ultimate glory and Jim Morrison was death.

I think no man can directing better than what Oliver Stone did. And no man will perfectly being Jim except Val Kilmer. But I have sadly say that, they should re-casting Pamela. Coz Meg Ryan looked just not good to be Pamela. I really don't know what the real Pamela was look like, I wasn't even born yet. But still Meg Ryan looked too sweet to consume drugs or even smoke a pot",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Performance in great, but flawed film","I want to add a few words, because reading many of the reviews, it's apparent that many did not get the message of the film or who Morrison was and Val Kilmer tried to be.The Morrison of the film was a Dionysius-figure. Dionysius was a god of the ancient Greeks who was honored by rites in which people went wild for a prescribed period of time. It was kind of like the modern New Years Eve or the New Orleans Mardi Gras, or a wild rock festival, but in context of religious rites.Morrison's books at the beginning of the film show that he was media savvy before becoming famous. It's in the original script, but was unfortunately cut out of the film. He very much wanted to get power as the native-American shamans did, through ritual, drugs, dance and trance.All the fore-mentioned, except the holidays, are a part of religious practice. In the film, Morrison tells his friend that ""people want something sacred"". He was trying to introduce that into the rock music of the time, while most other white musicians were ripping off licks of the black bluesmen. That's why he was such a sensation at the time, because he was so different.Questions as to whether Kilmer/Morrison were nice guys, did too many drugs, and so on, are totally beside the point. What Morrison wanted was for everyone to lose their rational, everyday mentality for a sacred trance, a druggy religiosity... anything but what was evident in the 60s, i.e. Viet Nam, poverty, racism, and people choosing sides in a political struggle inside the US. The 60s must be seen in relation to what came before, the Eisenhower 50s, a time of plenty, but of little progress on any other front, especially music, except for black music.Oliver Stone does a good job of getting these messages across. The middle sections of the film are the best, the concert scenes, the confrontation with the East Coast establishment, the excess in life, art and substances. Btw, excess in these items was and is still considered one of the ways to knowledge, believe it or not.Hats off to Val Kilmer for his wonderfully talented impersonization of Jim Morrison. A great performance, probably the greatest of his career. He walks, talks and sings the songs as Morrison did. Read more about the film if you want to know how hard Kilmer and Stone prepared for the role. Read the original script to get more background to what the film says, because a lot of context didn't make it into the film.Finally, it's great to go back to a time when things were more free, more uninhibited, before people were hung up in digital toys trance, as they are now. Nothing as strong is going on now. The 60s will return in a different form, as will all the other eras, as they have for millenia.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Drug dream,"Does the world really need ~two hours of a drug conceived movie trying to convince us that the source of Jim Morrison's genius was that he was always high or drunk?Kudos to Val Kilmer for an excellent performance overcoming the unnecessary but inescapable pervasive drug parafernalia ambience permeating the entire movie.A documentary with real live footage, live music scenes and original film clips and interviews of the actual people involved behind the scenes would have served us better than this fantasmagorical production exclusively focusing on Jim Morrison's character flaws ensconced in a continuous drug stupor.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Either way, even though the Doors had GREAT musicians, the Doors would NOT be the Doors without Morrison...ANYWAY, IMHO ...What DID work: the way the movie included the music and when, the scenes, the 60's feeling, Val Kilmer's performance, the final shots at the Lachaise cemetery ... even Oliver Stone's interpretation of where Morrison was at, his identification with native Americans, the lizard king, his love for poetry ... why The Doors are such an important R&R band ...What did NOT work: Some of the exaggerations or made up scenes (Pam's burning, thanksgiving), showing Jim Morrison as very (ironically) one-dimensional... he just wants to get fed-up ... Robbie's line: ""you like pain but you are constantly trying to avoid it"" shows what Oliver Stone thought ...Final recommendation: If you like music and you are not old like me and want to get a sense of what that time was like (leaving some room for doubt as this is Stone's perception after all), then do watch this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The BEST Rock Biography Ever Made,"In honor of Morrison's passing I watched this again. In my humble opinion it's the best rock and roll biography movie ever made. Maybe because I've seen this plot fifty times since this film (Musician gets famous, musician gets addicted, musician dies too young), but in my experience this was the first one so it didn't seem cliche yet. LThe casting is superb. Val Kilmer literally became Jim Morrison. And Meg Ryan shows her incredible range, going from the milquetoast Sally Albright to the debauched Pamela Courson (the ultimate enabling muse). And the supporting actors are awesome as well, including don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them cameos by Billy Idol and even John Densmore himself. And the weaving in of Doors music and Morrison's poetry is brilliant. I mean, who really cares if rock journalist Patricia Kennealy said ""Blood is the rose of mysterious union"" which became a lyric in ""Peace Frog""? The line works perfectly in that scene.Such are the liberties that Oliver Stone took with this movie. I'm on record as saying ""Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story"" and Stone embraces that philosophy here. I know enough about Morrison's real life to know this isn't scene-for-scene, word-for-word true (including one mistake I point out in my book On This Date In Music). But for my money it's close enough and more importantly it's entertaining. Engrossing. Mind-bending.Just as Morrison would have wanted.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Portryal of Jim and the '60s,"Val Kilmer was casted perfectly as Jim Morrison. He looks exactly like him and his voice closely resembles Jim's also.This movie truly captures the turbulent lifestyle of Jim Morrison. This movie explores all aspects of his life from his experimentations with hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and peyote to his alcoholism and even his wild sex life. The camera acts as a window into the mind of an obsessive and troubled, but extremely talented rock star. It cuts through all the garbage talk about Morrison being some prophet or visionary, as many believe he was, and exposes him for the true drugged-up, troubled human being he was.The whole scene of drug experimentation, sex, and the cultural revolution of the '60s is shown in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Val Kilmer at his peak!,"Val Kilmer is amazing as Jim Morrison. Not only does he look like him but his acting seems spot on - at least for the little bit of footage I've seem of him outside of televised performances. The film does move along at a slow but nice pace but in the end, it's all about Jim. And in this, Val is the man!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Watch Live at Hollywood Bowl, etc and see The Doors in Action","Before I saw this movie, I only had occasionally heard ""Light My Fire"", and ""Touch Me"".  It is important to note that this movie helped make me the Doors fan I am today.  However, after becoming a Doors fan, I have completely denounced this movie. This movie would like to say that Jim was just an acid head who had the good luck of having a few minutes of fame. This is entirely WRONG.  The doors were the most ambitious band of the sixties/seventies.  Their likes would not be seen in rock for decades to come. The next time you go to a concert and you actually see a show and not just some guys plucking guitars, thank Jim Morrison and the doors.If/When you really want to see a true story of the doors, watch ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"", ""The Soft Parade"", ""Dance On Fire"", or any other actual footage of the concerts. There are several biographies on Morrison, and he himself had written a couple of poetry books. Please, don't rely on this 130 minute film to provide you an accurate assessment of THE DOORS' career and legacy.",,Anonymous,Music
"Pretty good, pretty neat","The Doors are one of my favorite bands (perhaps my favorite).  And this movie is probably the biggest reason why.I'm not saying this movie is without its flaws, because it is not (the one-dimensional portrayal of Morrison, most noteably).But great music and stunning visual effects more than make up for those few flaws.As I mentioned above, there's more to Morrison than is portrayed in the movie.  Sure, he was over the top and larger than life sometimes, but he was also, more often than not, an oridinary guy with ordinary feelings and problems.  But the spirit of Jim Morrison and the Doors endures and inspires regardless of what you think of him.I would have liked to have seen more emphasis put on the other band members (since the movies is called ""The Doors"" not ""Jim Morrison"") but hey, I'll forgive Stone -- he did an incredible job.My Grade:  A",8.0,Anonymous,Music
just another Oliver Stone fever dream,"In an early scene of Oliver Stone's typically overwrought tribute to one of the 6o's more typically overwrought bands, young rock messiah Jim Morrison makes an uninvited visit (over the balcony) to the Venice Beach pad of his girlfriend Pamela Courson, who says, ""don't you believe in doors?"" Morrison's reply, ""they're a waste of time"", not only provides the one moment of (unintended) wit in the entire film, but sounds an ominous warning to what follows: another jarring one-note melodrama from a director clearly too preoccupied with his own bogus sense of cinematic 'style'. Stone's ballistic visual scheme and grade school symbolism are perfectly matched (in his own mind, at least) to the feverish 60's counter-culture of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but even at such a strenuous length (135 minutes) the film only scratches at the surface of its subject: concert follows scandalous concert, with no variation in tone or texture, until the Lizard King finally overdoses and dies. Val Kilmer does a credible rendering of Morrison's languid sex-and-death mannerisms, but the ill-judged caricatures of Ed Sullivan and Andy Warhol are foolish, as is the non-existent bust added to the martyr's graffiti-covered Paris tomb: it resembles Kilmer more than Kilmer resembles Morrison.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
I wrote this review with honesty and thoughtful reflection on this great film.Enjoy!,"Val Kilmer delivers a shocking portrayal of the late 1960s rock/poet icon Jim Morrison. I believe passionately in the music of the Doors,and in the anarchy they incite in their fans. In THE DOORS, Val Kilmer loses himself in the creative process,(for lack of a better term) and virtually becomes Jim Morrison. THE DOORS movie followed up extremely well on John Densmore's 1991 book, Riders on the storm. Poetic God Morrison, also emerges from the story as a desperate martyr. Truly a must see. I would honestly give this brilliant cinematic masterpiece a 8.0 - 9.0 out of ten! In my opinion this movie has to be considered worthy of the eventual label, ""cult classic"".Awesome.Aiden D.

ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind,"I waited 30 years to see this cuz I was so conflicted about how Oliver Stone would depict The Doors and Jim Morrison. I have to say the pros and cons were both what I would have expected from him. I'm not even sure this was a particularly great movie, but it gets a purely subjective 9 cuz it blew me away on a personal level and took me back to a younger time when life really was pulsating weirdness and wonder. Maybe the film overemphasized the drugs and drinking and the out of control ego and the fascination with death. But early in the movie Jim and Ray talk about making the new myths, so why not make a movie that is more myth than reality? Jim may have wanted to be seen as a quiet sensitive poet, but it is more fitting, and kind of a cosmic joke which he would appreciate, that he is remembered as the new myth that he himself created.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
So Sad,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Doors. Jim and Ray were musical geniuses.Val Kilmer's performance is unbelievably excellent. It's a travesty that he was not nominated for an Oscar.I was a bit disappointed in the way Oliver Stone put this movie together. It's hard to place my finger on specifics, but I would have expected better.The movie made me so sad. Jim and I were born in the same year. I was in California in the 60's. I understand that time ... yet it makes me very sad. Such a great talent, totally consumed by alcohol and other drugs. Pam is not well developed in the film but her story is equally sad, killing herself with an overdose 3 years after Jim killed himself.I'm a forever fan of the great, but foolish, Jim Morrison.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great if you're into drugs and chaos,"This is a total waste of celluloid.

"Stone and The Doors, interesting combination of Madness","I love The Doors and see it as one of Oliver Stone's best work.  But as much as I loved the film I do have a problem with the story.  The film is called The Doors but the movie is about Jim Morriosn.  I admire Morrison just as much as the next person but with a title like that then shouldn't it concentrate on Robby Kriger and John Densmore just as much as they do with Jim.   After when Jim and Ray meet on the beach and they are talking about forming a band and names for it we then cut to the next scene where the band have emsebled without even an introdction to Kreiger and Densmore.  It would have been good to see how they met and how they clicked as a band.  Oliver Stone said in an interview that there wasn't time to include this, but it is a very important part that should have not be missed.Without Kreiger we wouldn't have the great riff to Touch Me and Light My Fire.  Without Ray we wouldn't have most of The Doors songs as no one else could have done the organ solo in L.A. Woman any better.  The Doors were much more than just Jim Morrison and that's what the film lacks in characters and plot.The Doors is a hypnotic trip that is just so obsorbing you lose yourself within the film.   Every shot that Stone did was stunning to the voice of Jim Morrison.   Val Kilmer is so like Morrison you could never tell them apart.   The rest of the band were on top form and i think it was great to see Meg Ryan in a performance you wouldn't see her play today.   Billy Idol's cameo's were admirable as was Michael Wincott and I think the best line in the film is when Paul Rothchild played by Wincott who is the producer of the band says to Jim during an argument ""I watched this happen to Janis, I'm not gonna see the same happen to you"".  If it wasn't that line then it was something like that but it was in reference to Janis Joplin who was a female version of Morrison and they died at the same age in similar circumstances, but the that line is very true and tragic.Still this is a powerful film none the less but I hate the fact that Stone used every Doors song to go with every scene.  Even before they were a band in the film you could here Love Street and Indian Summer in the background. I think a bit of Hendrix or Stones would have gone down a treat to mix with the music that surronded the band at the time of their get together.   Alex Cox used  bands like The Pogues and Joe Strummer to connect the time with the music in Sid and Nancy.   The one's that weren't a Doors song were The Velvet Underground's Heroin and Venus in Furs.  This is where Stone lacks in creativity in movies.  He should have done what he did with the Natural Born Killers soundtrack.  Hire a musician to compose the music and choose the songs that fit the scenes.  Ray Manzrek could have done that instead of not being involved at all.A great film with minor flaws and great performances.",,Anonymous,Music
"Good movie, but not really accurate.","Being a huge fan of the Doors (and Jim Morrison), I was expecting the film.. .Well, I don't really know what I expected. I guess I was expecting a good film. I got what I was looking for. However, this film completely distorted my view of Jim Morrison's personality. In the film, he's portrayed (quite well, might I add) by Val Kilmer as a drunk and a junkie. Granted, when he wasn't stoned he was usually drunk, but the film doesn't point out his good qualities. Few and far between though they may be, they were still there. He wasn't just a musical genius A-Hole. He was supposedly a nice guy when he was sober. If you want to learn about Jim Morrison, read No One Here Gets Out Alive. If you want a really great film with hardly any historical accuracy, rent ""The Doors."" If for nothing other than the incredible soundtrack. Of course, perhaps I'm a little biased. As I mentioned, I'm a huge fan of the Doors. I guess so, because otherwise I wouldn't have cared to see the movie. But I digress. Oh, I guess not because I'm done.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Val was great!,"As I understand it, when the movie was still in the embryonic stage, John Travolta was being considered to play Jim. The surviving three Doors absolutely refused the idea, saying Jim would roll over in his grave if the King of Disco ""Saturday Night Fever"" star was chosen to portray Jim ""The Lizard King"". Thankfully, Val Kilmer was chosen. His voice is surprisingly close to Jim (after much training of course) and his facial features even have a strong resemblance to Jim's. Val did his homework, his stances, speech, actions were very good, even did a good job at Jim's primordial scream on stage. It is a good thing Val was chosen, John Travolta couldn't have pulled it off, in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Music
"Like, That's the way things were, man!","""The Doors"" is a really cool movie, man!  Yeah, like back in the sixties there were hippies and they took a lot of drugs and booze and stuff.  And, like Jim Morrison lived in the clouds, y'know?  He made some great music and he liked being the bad boy of Rock.  He never cared about tomorrow.This is a good movie, cause, like it tells it like it was, man.  Like, Jim wasn't ""just plain folks"" y'know he like did his own thing.  This flick re-creates the whole scene in that surrealistic kinda way that it all happened.   Oliver Stone made brilliant use of video techniques to blend the story and the music.I lived through the sixties in high school and college.  I was a ""Straight"" but there were a lot of ""hips"" all over the place, y'know and a few times kids actually lit up a J right in class.   Some of the kids walked about three feet above the sidewalk.  I didn't approve of everything that went on -- being around people like that only reinforced my resolve to stay away from drugs.  The majority of students were straights, but just about everyone dug the Doors' music.The student newspaper was radical and there were some other reeeeeeaaaly far out publications.  We had some great concerts on campus, but unfortunately we never had the Doors.  A few times there were confrontations between the hippies and ROTC cadets.   Once we even had a student sit-in.  Ah, the good old days!The Doors' music IS the Sixties and Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison.  I, like, definitely recommend this film, especially the younger folks including my own teenage children who weren't around back then.   Cause like that's like how it was.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie,I really enjoyed this movie. It was compelling and entertaining and exciting. I wouldn't say this movie was inaccurate like some people are saying I would say it left some pretty important parts out of Jims life. They focused on the wild side of Jim probably because it is the most entertaining and most unique. I would of liked to see more of his articulate side because he was a very smart guy. But overall it gives you a nice description of the doors and Jim and it kept me interested throughout the movie. You get to see the interesting band that the doors really were.

All the naked girls helped give it the feel of the time and helped me pay attention too.  If nothing else it was great to hear all those songs again and know that others wanted to hear them again enough for a movie like this to be made.I didn't see the movie when it came out because I was sure I would pick it apart, but I actually enjoyed the film.*** 1/2 out of five",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Kilmer actually sang the songs while Ryan, Kilmer and The Doors band members act brilliantly. As is true with all of Stones films it is not all historically accurate, rather he combines his cinematic genius with the reality of The Doors, Morrison and LA in the 60's.

Like Gary Oldman's spot-on performance as Beethoven in Immortal Beloved, Kilmer has us believing we are watching Jim Morrison himself throughout this film. He channels the quirky and inscrutable showman brilliantly, in full color. Kilmer is absolutely stunning in this film. Incredible. The film itself has its imperfections - it doesn't quite rise to 10-star status - but Kilmer's performance is as good as it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
GREAT FILM MAKING,"Although quite self indulgent Oliver Stone again shows his great film making techniques. Loosely based on ""Rock God"" Jim Morrison, Stone integrates superb editing, music, choreography, even animal noises to produce tremendous effect.  In the blood/sex scene,  for example, which Stone sets up with the previous news conference scene, the wild choreographed sex orgy dance is put to the music of Orff's ""Carmana Burana."" The floating minicam is well used by him in a number of episodes.Who would have thought that MS. Quinlan would go from Vicca sorceress to playing the role of Marion Lovell, demonstrating what a fine actor she is, along with the dependable Meg Ryan.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A good movie But a better title would have been ""break on through""","The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole ""Free to be me"" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"I am the lizard king, I drink a lot.","I saw this film on its release in1991 and being a massiveDoors fan at the time (hasn't every male had fantasies of being a Jim Morrison figure at some point) I felt that the film was over blown and bloated,- a bit like Morrison in his later years. I didn't rate it all, the music is amazing, likewise the concert footage in fact anytime you hear the Doors music the film comes alive. When it crashes is anytime in which the mythology of Morrison is laid bare. Let's face it he was a very insecure drunk who wrote bad poetry. Is the film any good? Yes it's great but only if you don't know anything about The Doors. So
watching the film a fresh after 30 years I think it is a great film and works well as a primer for the Doors music, but overall and it's purely down to Morrison and Courson ( his put upon girlfriend) being such unlikable people I have to say it's not likeable, ironically it's immensely enjoyable but I didn't like it.

It's Oliver Stone's biography of the Doors, and what a movie it is.Now, I have to say that I have nothing against Oliver Stone or Jim Morrison or the sixties or anything associated with any of these.  But I think we can all agree that the way Oliver Stone chooses to envision the sixties and Jim Morrison is... well... a *little* much.Let's just say that I completely lost it when they started dancing around in the desert, going on about the Mystical Time Serpent or something.By the way, I now know less about the Doors than I did when the movie started, so if you're looking for a dead-serious biography, look elsewhere.

But on this case, the director Oliver Stone was very happy on translate to screen the life and art of the most important rock'n'roll's icon of all the times, the man who brings to music a new way to write lyrics, with a strong poetry, who was a performer and, at the same time, real, the front man who's been followed and imitated by 9 between 10 of the rock'n'roll singers.

greatest film on a rock band ever!!!!,"As a huge fan of The Doors and Oliver Stone I had big expectation's for this film and wasn't dissapointed. Stone done  a great job with this incredibly realistic portrait of the rock band The Doors. Val Kilmer is a real mirror image of the rock and roll god Jim Morrison and in my opinion plays the part perfectly, with great sutilty and also with the unpredictable erratic behaviour as Jim was known for with his drug and alcohol abuse. When the film came out in an interview Val Kilmer said that he wasn't Jim Morrisons biggest fan and disagreed with his destructive ways. None of this is evident throughout the film as his performance is certainly for me a career best for Val but im sure he has the personality to be a regular leading man, but  he has not reached his potential as a serious big name actor like Tom Cruise,Edward Norton,Brad Pitt etc...I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the band and for me this film is right up there with Oliver Stones JFK ,Platoon and the highly underrated Salvador. I think Oliver Stone is still the greatest director around today but his films of the last few years [any Given Sunday,U-Turn )are not nearly near his high standard.Lets just cross our fingers and hope with his latest film in the making Alexander the Great (played by none other than my fellow countryman Colin Farrell ) he can reach the same hights he has with his other work.Sit back with this enjoyable film with your feet up and many tins of beer and enjoy the ride....",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wlid Child...,"I do have to admit that i kinda like this movie,not by the reputation of doors,not because they were a deep impact rock'n'roll band,but it was because Val Kilmer's performance as Jim was best,sort of thrilling and very talented performance,the concerts are remade very well,specially those very Jim's moves,he was most rebellious,most refreshing,modernest and greatest artists ever...but with the movie i can say they have tried their best,Oliver Stones's direction is not as good as Platoon ,Born on the Forth of July ,or J.F.K,but it is really good.i have my own idea about it but Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison is Jim himself.the movie is the story of early days of Jim's life with an accident on the road that impacted whole his life an further,his days on the beach and his companion with Pamela Courson(Meg Ryan)his lifetime companion,the Doors Band and their special kind of music ,with breaking all the borders,and Jim's against the law behaviors ,his travel to Paris and his death . the performances are so so ones.but one among all will shine and thats Val Kilmer's.he did Jim's all behaviors and habits .besides his voice.he is the new Jim Morrison. others are sort of usual.like Meg Ryan playing Pamela is just something very usual.i wonder if Pamela herself has been like this.but seriously to be a companion for their short lives with Jim's manners must be the hardest.the movie shows his glorious moments and mad moments.when he terminated himself in the age 27.and also did Pamela at the same age. the movie shows of how Jim was The WILDCHILD of 60s.good movie.over",8.0,Anonymous,Music

This is my favorite movie in my collection,"Anyone that doesn't love this film, or at least respect it for what it is ""needs their art spoon-fed to them"". Stone does a near perfect job of depicting The Doors and the band members. He does add some fallacies but it's a movie, it was necessary to make a little more money off it. Kilmer to this day is the best actor that I believe he could have cast for the part.Any Doors fan, and those soon to be, will absolutely love this film.Much care had to be taken to get the atmosphere of the era just right, and I don't think anyone else could have done a better job at it. Movies like this make me wonder what happened to the rock scene in the past decade or two.",,Anonymous,Music
That movie is great,The first time i saw the movie The Doors I walked out of the room high. The movie somehow made me become high. The movie is entertaining and original. I read the book Riders on the storm and it has a lot of the movie in it. I also read Light my Fire and it has a few things in there also that I saw in the film. Jim Morrison was possessed by the Devil. If you think i am full of it then look closely as his lyrics. He was a great song writer or poet if you want to take it further but he was crazy. I love the guy and I have a poster of him in my room. I like just about every song the Doors have and when it comes to the movie I think it is incredible. I know some of it was pushed alil over the top and Jim wasn't always crazy but from what I read about him its close. I would deff. recommend anyone who reads this to see the movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is as artistic and entertaining as The Doors best hits,"Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, lives up to the iconic band's best hits. Although critic Roger Ebert only gave it a 2 1/2 out of 4 stars, this movie was a hit with audiences. Arguably Kilmer's best performance in his career, he auditioned for Stone by sending tapes of him singing The Doors tunes. Meg Ryan plays Pamela Courson, Morrison's love interest who goes in and out of his life depending on the drug trip he is on. Supporting characters include Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as Robby Krieger, Kevin Dillon as John Densmore and Kathleen Quinlan as a satanic worshiper who helps Morrison get his virility back.
The movie travels like a drug trip and the audience takes the journey as a member inside the famous band. Definitely a classic afor any Doors fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Highly Entertaining, Sensory-Driven Film","Granted, ""The Doors"" eschews historical precision for sensory-driven, impressionistic indulgences. This isn't a biographical deep-dive of Jim Morrison's mind, but then again, director Oliver Stone never offered that as an intention.Even the deepest-thinking rock stars carry a cartoonish projection by virtue of their chosen vocation, and this film's indulgence in dramatized character elements are true to form. Val Kilmer's performance as Morrison remains much maligned, but is absolutely in line with Hollywood's exploitations of rock n roll mythology. Kilmer inhabits the sketch with a contrived detachment directly reflective of what Stone was going for in the movie as a whole.Shot in the era in which impressionist rock videos reigned supreme, ""The Doors"" leverages those rich indulgences, and marries them with the band's remarkable, unassailable music catalog. Highly recommended, but not for those who expect to find Jim Morrison pontificating from the psychiatrist's couch. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful.""

general comment,"First thing first, I really enjoyed this film and it is part of my collection. Oliver Stone's vision of remembering Jim was deeply sown with alcoholism and drug abuse juxtaposed with groupie sex and minimal importance on concert performance. (not to far from the truth) To the reviewers that said Stone only scratched the surface of the Doors front man, I agree. However, in the case of Jim Morrison I think that the public yearns for a secret or something ""under the surface"" about icons as Jim Morrison that made them who they are remembered for. Maybe that was it; Jim Morrison was simply a drunk posing as a poet. Although I disagree, to a certain extent there is some truth. I wish that Stone could have focused more on concert performance because that is how the Doors got their fame. The Doors of Perception are locked by the patch within lies the key.

A great film. Pity it was not 100% factual.,"The doors as an entity were and still are a magical phenomenon. The doors, the film is a testament to oliver stone's creative and ground breaking film making. It's just a damn shame that it was dramatised in the way that it was, so well infact that most people who noever knew about the doors except for the music didn't realise. It's an old debate nowadays, but a good one. On it's own, the film is a classic, absolutely excellent film.

Amazing portrail of Morrison,"After seeying this film for the second time, I concluded that Val Kilmer might be the most underated actor in Hollywood!

Watching the rise and fall of the ledgend that was Jim Morrison, before our eyes, at times it was hard to remember that what I was seeying onscreen was not, in fact, the actual Jim!

I am the Lizard King; I can do anything !,"This magnum opus directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer, who inhabits the Mr Mojo Risin character like a second skin, is spot on and captures fully the Doors as well as the mystique of the Lizard King himself, James Douglas Morrison aka Jim Morrison, poet, singer, and ultimate sex symbol of not just 1967-71, but posthumously for decades.My wife thinks Morrison is the sexiest rock star of all time.I'm certain many women share that view.This film is far from perfect but in its two odd hours it captures the Doors rise to fame better than any book, documentary or other media could.

No Place Left to Hide but the Other Side,"Fascinating the Folly of Fame, Fortune, and Failure. Jim Morrison had all of these including the Folly. Forever Wanting to be Heard and Heeded, He became Immediately Aware that this was Futile because as He so Aptly put it...""They want my Dick, not my words.""This was Probably one of the Reasons that Morrison Retreated so Readily into the Subconscious (He claimed that's where He lived) by way of Drugs and Alcohol. There was no other way to Escape the Predicament of the ""Rock Star"" Persona and Sex Symbolism that Overwhelmed His Personality and Talent.Oliver Stone Mythologizes in Movies, no matter if the Subject is a Real Person (JFK, Nixon) or a Fictional Construct (NBK). That's what He does as a Director and Artist and there is No Doubt when One is Watching an Oliver Stone Movie that it is a Picturesque Presentation Pulsating with Flourishes of the Medium.The Doors is a Smooth Looking Film with a Seamless Portrayal by Val Kilmer and the 1960's Setting Looks Great. The Concert Scenes Especially have a Vintage Verisimilitude that Cannot be Over Praised. The Movie is so well done that it Hurts while Watching the Self Destructive Behavior and the Erosion of Spirit into a Cauldron of Excessive Pollution by Substances, most Especially Alcohol.When Jim is Feeding His Head with Psychoactives like Peyote, LSD, and Marijuana there is a Spark and a Stimulation by a Receptive, Caring Soul, but when He takes to the Bottle the Fire that has been Lit is Immediately and Irreparably Snuffed Out.

"The Man, The Myth, The Legend, The Movie...","First of all let me begin by telling you that I am a huge Doors and Morrison fan that believes Morrison was a beautiful poet, wonderful singer (or crooner at least), highly intelligent individual, and a one of a kind creature. Now this normally means that this is the point that I should begin bashing Oliver Stones film because it ""was only portraying Jim as a drug addled fool who was a creep to everyone around him and deserved the premature death that came to him"" etc.. Well, I wont be getting that hardheaded today.In fact I am fan of this film and find it to be highly misunderstood. First of all I personally see the movie as not a biopic of Jim Morrisons life but a biopic of Jim Morrisons myth and legend. We've all heard the stories of the excess of drugs and alcohol he had done, all of the insane antics he had pulled (hanging off from hotel balcony's and setting rooms ablaze), his strange and random sexual promiscuity's, and of course the infamous Miami concert. All of these incidents and more are put into the film as we would have remembered them from our outsiders perspective. Nothing solved and no insight gained, just a straight view of how we've been groomed to remember him. An easier way of putting it is that the film is a collage of memories we, as fans, would have when thinking back on The Doors legend. The ultimate sex, drugs, and rock&roll story. So if you're looking for a ""Coal Miners Daughter"" kind of insight into Morrisons true life, I recommend that you steer clear from this movie and go pick up one of the many Morrison bio's from the Library (No One Here Get's Out Alive would be my personal choice).The film begins where, as far as Jim would let us know, his life began. On a desert highway where he and his family passed by the sight of a wreck that killed some Pueblo Indians. Jim would later say that this was the most important moment of his life and believed that the soul of one of the dying Indians jumped into his body. We actually see this Indian soul in the film and get to observe as it follows Jim all the way up till the end. We see nothing else from Jims childhood and are brought directly to the next checkpoint in Morrisons legend, his quiting of UCLA Film School. This trend of going from checkpoint to checkpoint continues all the way up to the last point we know of in Paris.Val Kilmer, who is always fantastic, once again steals the screen with his performance of the late artist. Not only is he visually astounding in his replication of Jim but he also does some of his own vocals, nearly identical to that of Morrison. Another performance worth mentioning is Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, he is only on screen for a very short amount of time but what a time it was. If you know anything about Warhol you'll know what I'm talking about when you see him. The majority of the soundtrack is the Doors own music, in fact it's almost played out like a music video for the band half the time and a lot of the dialog spoken is even Jims own lyrics and poetry. All in all Stone did an excellent job in bringing to screen the ultimate rock lifestyle.To sum it up, see this film if you are into The Doors music, great performances, and an interesting look into the life of a stereotypical rock star legend... just try to understand it's a movie of a myth not a man.S.C.W.",,Anonymous,Music

Worth watching but a bit of a disappointment,"""The Doors"" is a fine movie.  However I found myself disappointed at its finish.  Not because it takes liberties with  the facts of Jim Morrison's life but because it is some interesting subject matter spread over too long a film.  There are certainly moments of greatness (the last scene of Morrison's tomb being a perfect example) but there are also scenes that go on too long and lose much of their effect as a result(the numerous concert scenes).  I think another shortcoming was the fact that through too much of the film Oliver Stone generates very little sympathy for Morrison and makes him out to be an uncaring villain.  He also fails to establish any interest in the rest of the band or any feeling that they have a personal connection/relationship with Jim.   On the other hand the cinematography is great and Stone puts in plenty of Doors music.  Also, Val Kilmer turns in a brilliant performance.* To any Doors fans who saw this movie but want to know more about Morrison and the Doors read Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek",,Anonymous,Music
The doors of Stone's perception,"Great acting, great directing, great music. Has nothing to do with Jim Morrison. Val was amazing as a brilliant but troubled rock star sounding like and resembling the singer/poet known as Jim Morrison. No one could have matched his performance, not by a sight. The photography, script and cast were all outstanding.That said, Stone's obsessive emo worship of Jim as the drunken uber hippie he wished he could be is for too self-indulgent and salacious to be taken seriously. Stone, and the public at large, seem to forget that while Jim had an amazing voice matched by exceptional charisma and intelligence, the music was written collectively by the Doors. Most of the music was created by the guitarist and organist - can you name them? Jim focused on the lyrics. Yet we barely get more than a superficial impression of the other 3 Doors.Like many of his films, the self inserts and willful neglect of meaningful substance in favor of stylish fantasy undermines any pretense at reality. In purely fictional films like Natural Born Killers or U-Turn, it works. For the ""historical"" films Stone seems drawn to, this predilection for style over substance is overbearing and undermines the premise. The fictionalization of Jim presented here is Amadeus-like in scale. When one witnesses such absurdity and ""creative"" license, what can one say but: Stone. While Stone is an occasionally great filmmaker, he needs to stay as far away from historical figures as possible. His childish fantasies and love of the sweet leaf long ago addled his brain. To a man, the remaining 3 members of the Doors blasted this fantastic and incredible portrayal of their front man as pure fiction. And that's just what this fan film is: pure fiction.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Kilmer's Best,"Great film, one of Val kilmer's best performances.  This film gives a great beginning look at Jim Morrison, a very gifted poet who was caught up in a bad era of sex and drugs, which dragged him down to the point of death.As a biography film, this movie cuts it.  Oliver Stone, while managing to highlight major events in the life of the band, he focuses mostly on the scandal that surrounded Jim Morrison.  He depicts Morrison as a boozing, out of control psychopath who is on a self destructive mission, and looking to take someone with him.Well folks, the Real Jim Morrison was NOT like that.Okay, honestly, Jim had his moments where things got crazy, but they happened very few and far between, and it seemed to me that Stone comprised these moments, put them back to back, and called it a movie.  A lot of the facts of Jim's life weren't included, some were stretched, and others never happened.  For instance, in the scene where Jim and party were flying to Miami for the infamous concert, Jim is heard asking Paul Rothchild to get him some heroin.  Well, Jim never did heroin...it was the one drug he never touched, because he lost some friends to it.  The irony to that is it was Pam's drug of choice, which provoked many fights.What I felt was missing from the movie were bit showing the other side of Jim, which would show him as a gentleman, and a calm collected individual when he was away from substances. As a celebrity, Jim loved his fans, and cared for them...it was the overwhelming attention from the masses that he didn't care for, and it was why he tried to escape.Overall, the film does a great job depicting the world that the Doors were a part of, showing the turbulence of the 60's, and it also is a great introduction to the Doors, and to Jim Morrison.  This is the movie that got me listening to the Doors, and it peaked my interest.  Though I wish that Jim was shown in a better light, it is definitely worth watching over and over.",,Anonymous,Music
An Unfortunate Attempt-Doesn't Do the Band Justice,"Even for hard-core Doors fans, Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" falls far short of portraying the band that rocked the Sixties Music Scene. For beginners, the movie focuses exclusively on Morrison, skillfully portrayed by almost look-alike, Val Kilmer, whose performance as The Lizard King borders on over-the top. The rest of the band is given practically no character, with Manzarek made to look like the only musically-oriented member of the band. Kevin Dillon spends the entire movie looking scared. The movie wallows too much in Morrison's personal life,choosing instead to show a violent, depraved, psychotic side, and less of the tormented poet Morrison actually was. The cinematography at best was amateur. One of the only potential saving graces of the movie, the included two-dozen songs, are poorly placed in the movie. Overall, the movie is an extreme disappointment, and is better titled Jim Morrison: How I learned to stop worrying and commit suicide. Even the best of Doors fans will find this attempt at recreating the band's history a shame to the music, with Kilmer's performance being the only saving grace.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

A great movie.And by the way, if your looking for a good movie to watch when your tripping acid or any drug for that matter, this movie is a good choice. The part in the dessert when Jim is talking to the rest of the band.......amazing, watch it and you'll see what I mean.",,Anonymous,Music
Morrison Hotel!,"The film's called The Doors, but it's most definitely not about The Doors. The Doors were a band that have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Around the late 60's/1970 they were also frequently lauded as being one of the most exciting live acts in the world. If you're looking for a film to give you an inkling about such a band's history, this again, is not it.What this is, is an almost two and a half hour attempt by Oliver Stone to get inside lead singer Jim Morrison's head. Predictably to any one who knows anything about Morrison (and Stone), we get plenty of sex, drugs (including alcohol), but surprisingly not a great deal of rock 'n roll for a movie of this nature. Supposedly based on John Densmore's memoire Riders on the Storm, the film ends with a footnote thanking the surviving Doors members for their cooperation. However since its release, the Doors have criticised the film, as not truly being representative of the group nor Morrison himself.With good reason I should think. We know Morrison lived life to excess to such an extent that he died prematurely aged only 27, but do we really need the vast majority of the movie's running time to focus on that way too excessive lifestyle? We get the message very clearly early on. There's virtually no screen time focusing on the recording success of the first American band to have 8 consecutive gold records and sell over 100 million albums world-wide. The other three band members are given no back-stories and subsequently have no more than a shadowy impact in the story. I guess it is pretty difficult, when the Morrison character is almost in every scene. This is to take nothing away from Val Kilmer's wonderful performance as Jim Morrison. Besides looking incredibly like him, he does sound much the same too. Meg Ryan pops up intermittently as Morrison's (main) girlfriend (later wife) Pam, but she is given very little with which to work too. She either seems to. be in bed with Morrison or throwing things at him, just about in equal measure.Again with live performances, Stone just seems to concentrate on the controversial, headline attracting elements. The film is a bare cupboard in terms of providing evidence of the band's electric reputation as a live act.The end when it comes, rather ironically, comes very quickly. We hear a little of the group's final (very successful) album LA Woman haphazardly, as Jim attends a suburban party with the band, where he tells them he's going to Paris. Next thing we see is his Parisian grave ... The End! There is just no consistent balance to the narrative at all and in a film of this length, it really stands out.Bohemian Rhapsody tells a similar story as The Doors, but just does it so much better. It also primarily focuses on Queen's lead singer Freddy Mercury, who like Morrison lived a way too hedonistic lifestyle, also dying prematurely. But we do get a greater collective sense of the band itself and a very welcome focus on their music and live performances, which Oliver Stone's The Doors seems to completely forget about, to its detriment.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Val Kilmer plays almost as good of a Jim Morrison as the Lizard King himself--- honestly if the two stood next to each other it would be a tough call.  The soundtrack was basically the Greatest Hits.  It's a long (2 1/2 hours or so) movie, but it'll keep you glued to your seat, especially if you're a fan of the band, and even if you're not, which I wasn't the first time I saw it, you will become one.",,Anonymous,Music

Let's face it: The Doors had one real moment of creativity (""The End"") and that's not really enough to make an entire movie out of.

"Musically incontinent, chaotic tale of drunkard rock star","Another bombastic movie from Oliver Stone, notorious director of overlong, violent, chaotic movies. Allegedly, Stone wanted to pay tribute to the Doors, a group that was the soundtrack of his youth. What he ended up doing was bad-mouthing Jim Morrison.In fact, the movie should not even be titled ""The Doors, because it is almost exclusively about Morrison's debauchery and flirting with death. A relatively wealthy and healthy kid, Morrison was permanently tormented (by what?) during his short life, did not appreciate fame and fortune, and ended up as an alcoholic and a junkie.It is well known that Morrison was obsessed by a car crash he witnessed as a child. However, his report of the accident was questioned by his whole family who was travelling with him. None of his relatives saw what Jim mentioned (bodies of Indians lying on the road) and the whole accident was probably just a minor one.This episode is saying a lot about the self-aggrandizing attitude of Jim and his egotism. Not to mention that drunkards and junkies tend to be self-obsessed and boring, even – or maybe even more - when they are rock stars. Morrison's saving graces were his sex appeal and his skill with words. Stone chose to dilute the story of Morrision' self destruction with endless sequences of Kilmer (uncannily looking like Morrison) gyrating on stage, drinking, screwing every woman around and being obnoxious.I am sure nobody would like to put up with that, but at the end of the movie we have a weird scene of the Door splitting up and the other members expressing regret at Morrison's departure to France. I would have been delighted to see him go Finally, his death is treated as a mystery, as if a junkie dying of an overdose would be so mysteriousStrictly for the most die-hard fans, who no doubt will find something likable and/or regret that their hero was presented in such an unflattering fashion.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Jim Morrison:  The Ultimate Rock Star,"The documentary film The Doors (1991, dir. Oliver Stone) recounts the life of the lead singer of The Doors, Jim Morrison.  It begins with Morrison as a child traveling through the Western U.S.  He encounters a fatal wreck in which Morrison sees a dying Indian.  This experience later plays a major part in Morrison's quest for oblivion.  Morrison wanted to die in an illustrious way.  He knew he was going to die; he just wanted to experience it thoroughly. Morrison started his quest as a film student at UCLA; eventually he dropped out of school after his soon-to-be band mates.  The rock group, The Doors, was formed and they began playing in small clubs and bars.  Till one day an agent signs them and they began their wild journey as rock stars. The Doors tells of Jim Morrison's descent into ""the other side"" and his drug-fueled path.  Morrison's constant alcohol and drug abuse promoted this idea along with his wild acts and behaviors.  Morrison's lifestyle starts to create tension in the band and in his marriage.  The band eventually broke up and Morrison and his wife, Pamela Courson,  moved to France.  There in 1971 Morrison died of an apparent heart failure. Oliver Stone effectively demonstrated Morrison's idea that one achieves deep and spiritual understanding by reaching obilivion.

Being a huge fan of the Doors and having read two books about them I was interested to see how Oliver Stone (one of my favorite directors by the way) would present the story. And he did something I didn't think possible. He made the Doors seem boring. The film meanders from one incident to another without yielding anything really revealing about the band or Jim either for that matter. All in all an almost complete waste of time.,3.0,Anonymous,Music
A great glimpse into the life and art of Jim Morrison and The Doors,"I found Oliver Stone's film The Doors to be an effective and genuine glimpse into the life of Jim Morrison and the music that The Doors created. Some have taken issue with some of the subjective aspects of the film but Oliver Stone is a fan, after all, and every fan has their own interpretation of what the band means to them. I don't think it was meant to be a literal interpretation of exactly what happened any more than any of their songs were to be taken literally. I became a fan of the band through this film, which endears it to me. I thought Val Kilmer did a tremendous job bringing Morrison's character to the screen, and if you've seen footage or read any books about him I think you would have to agree. The music they recorded does the best job of explaining who they were and what they were all about and for an authentic view behind the scenes, I would recommend reading No One Here Gets Out Alive. But I thought the film was a great portrayal of that era and this band's place within it.",,Anonymous,Music
Good movie... better books...,"If anyone can take the life span of a single person and compact it into a 2 hour feature... an accurate 2 hour feature that is, I would be very impressed.  I will give credit for this being a good film, definitely worth watching.  Val Kilmar does a great job, does his own vocals for some of the scenes, great depiction of an amature band trying to work together and deal with instant fame and fortune while dealing with the real life problems of the lead singer.Notice I said ""of an amature band"" and not The Doors.  All bands start of small and as unknowns with the hope of making it big.  Some probably more prepared then others, others possible less interested in making it big then some.  I'm a big Fan of The Doors and their music as I'm sure many of you maybe, but keep in mind these guys are just four guys, three of which were musicians and one of which was a little bit of everything.This movie does portray them as a group of ""normal"" guys getting into the music scene.  Great sets and locations, reinactments, and many interesting moments revolving around Jim and his constant drinking habits and then some. BUT if your interested in knowing about Jim and not just a good movie, read a biography on him, read several ones, find out what his wives say, his band members thoughts, or even what his agents write about him.  Look for similar stories and events and compare their view points, get an idea of who they are by they way they right and see who's being truthful, who's exagerrating, who's guess and who's just plain lying.  As far I know, and correct me if I'm wrong... but I don't believe Oliver Stone and Jim Morrison were ever friends?  If you were to die and someone made a movie about you, what aspect of your life do you think wold be glorified to make it big in the box office?  That's Hollywood.",,Anonymous,Music
A very selective portrayal of Jim Morrison,"A movie I liked quite a bit better when it was first released than I do thirty plus years later. Some of reasons for the lessening of my appreciation being my age when I saw the theatrical release in 1991 versus today re: my shifting perspective as to who Morrison actually was as opposed to the rock star myth image. Unfortunately, it's the rock star myth image that director Oliver Stone chose to portray.With The Doors (1991), Stone tackles the subject in terms of the screenplay with the same technique he used in his other films (JFK, Nixon) depicting real life people, places and events. Which is to say he takes a lot of liberties with the known facts in the service of his own artistic expression. Thus, there are a multitude of composite characters and in particular composite scenes, some of which have fragments of real-life events and more than a few which plain never happened at all, a complete listing of which would be overlong.For a viewer who wasn't aware of The Doors or hadn't read multiple biographies of Morrison prior to seeing the movie, these fictionalizations might not particularly matter. For someone such as myself who was aware of the facts surrounding Morrison and the chronology of events surrounding the real-life Doors, viewing the movie becomes all too often a case of saying ""that didn't happen"" or ""that person never existed"" to the point where one wonders why Stone felt compelled to film a biopic where factual instances are frequently jettisoned. Stone's explanation for this usually was along the lines of 'creative license' yet Morrison's life in factual terms was interesting enough that it really didn't require being fictionalized to the degree it was in the movie.There is also a great deal of selectivity in the character aspects of the real people onscreen. This is most profound particularly with Morrison and his girlfriend, Pam Courson. Apparently, in order to secure licensing rights, Stone had to tone down the wilder aspects of Pam Courson in order to gain her families approval for the portrayal of her (the Coursons having acquired the rights to Morrison's poetry and being custodians of Jim Morrison's estate). The result being that Pam Courson as blandly portrayed by Meg Ryan came off in the movie as someone virtually unrecognizable personality-wise to those who actually knew her. As for Morrison himself, for whatever reasons Stone chose to focus on scenes which depicted Morrison at his drunken, drugged up worst. Granted, there were plenty of instances of Morrison exhibiting drunken, boorish behavior in his lifetime to select from. One can't help but get the feeling as the movie unwinds that Stone basically felt Morrison became little other than an alcoholic, self-indulgent buffoon the more famous he got, which begs the question as to what turned Stone onto making the movie in the first place if that was his basic take on him. The net reality of Morrison's life was ultimately a downer in terms of what he did to himself and how his life ended up. While THAT aspect is one Stone captures well, it doesn't make for a compelling (certainly not an uplifting) experience for the viewer. As comedian Denis Leary said back in the early 1990's, ""you don't need a 3-hour movie about the Doors...it's basically 'I'm drunk, I'm nobody, I'm drunk, I'm famous, I'm drunk, I'm dead...Big Fat Dead Guy in a Bathtub, there's your title.""On the plus side, I'd say the strongest aspects of The Doors (1991) are those involving the visuals, the concert scenes and the effort Val Kilmer undertook to portray Jim Morrison. I'd certainly say it was one of the better performances Kilmer - an actor who overall I found to be pretty wooden in his delivery in his other movies - ever gave. I wasn't a particular fan of the technique where Kilmer's vocals were overdubbed onto Morrison's for the performance/singing sequences, mostly because Kilmer doesn't sound like Morrison. Outside of that, though, Kilmer gave an energetic, committed performance. The concert sequences were exciting to look at, as were many of the obvious fantasy sequences: the Doors tripping on LSD in the desert (another event which never happened in real life) in particular stands out.Honestly, though, I think either a longtime fan or someone just getting into The Doors would be better served watching the multiple home video releases the band began putting out in the early 1980's and reading some of the more reputable Morrison biographies to get a sense of who Morrison was and what the band were about. That's my general feeling regarding practically all rock biopic docudramas where there is both ample footage and written accounts of the real thing as opposed to a fictionalized, sensationalized portrayal. Thus, four stars for Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991): some interesting and compelling visual moments to be found but too much emphasis on the fiction/myth of Jim Morrison, and the aspects that did ring true didn't portray a pretty picture. Overall, a bummer.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Val Kilmer and Oliver Stone capture the 1960s,"More than any other film (Hair, Woodstock, etc), this captures the cultural changes in white America during the 1960s. Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Oliver Stone and everyone involved with this production are to be commended. The spirit of Jim Morrison lives in the film. This is a most accurate expression of the drug culture of 1960s - the good and the bad of it. The experiences I remember from living in New York in 1968, attending concerts at the Fillmore-East, listening to WBAI radio, the concerts in Central Park, the music of Jim Morrison and so many others (Carlos Santana, Jimi Hendrix) are communicated to another generation.

Rocksploitation more than a biopic,"I didn't think rocksploitation was an actual genre until I saw this film - has all the ""rock star"" clichés and little else. Too long and not enough events occur - it's like a long jam session of Light My Fire interrupted by a few events. Stone could've cut an hour of the film and nothing will be missed.If you want a realistic depiction of the Doors, this is not the place. If you want an enjoyable film about a rock band, this is not the place.I wouldn't recommend watching this film as entertainment, but if anyone is considering making a rock film, they should watch this first as a ""What not to do"" guide. If someone wants to make a movie about a rock star with substance abuse problems and nothing else, then it's already been done before. It's called ""The Doors.""That's all the value I see from this movie - a lesson for others to avoid the mistakes that were done here.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Idiosyncratic's Rhetoric,"Readers: I warn you that this review may reveal the plot/conclusion of this film.Oliver Stone has really outdone himself in the production of The doors. The best choice that he has ever made has been the casting of Val Kilmer to portray Jim Morrison.  I have the DVD of this film and they say that in some parts of the film, they actually used Val's actual voice to sing parts of the songs.  This is a smart move by Stone because Val not only looks like the actual Jim Morrison, but he sounds like him to.  I think that it would've taken away from the authenticity of the picture if they did voice overs because you can usually tell whether or not a person is singing or lipsinking.  Val Kilmer plays an exceptional role as Morrison and he does not only act the part, he becomes the part.  It is said that ""bad actors act"".  Good actors become the character and I think that this role is one in which Kilmer shines on the big screen.  Think about it, Kilmer must have really studied Jim's personality and how he acted.  I felt as though it were really Jim when I was watching the film.  Personally, I liked this picture and would recommend watching it to anybody who likes movies from the hippy era.  ENJOY!J. D.

Great performance from Val Kilmer.,"Val Kilmer does an amazing job as Jim Morrison. He even did his own singing in the film. Which I find very impressive, he sounded very similar to Jim Morrison. Unfortunately the rest of the film suffers. For having a long runtime they waste a lot of it. Instead of explaining how some of these amazing songs are written. Or giving more depth to the other band mates. They waste time showing, Jim Morrison doing drugs and having a twenty minute long sex scene. These scenes showing his excess could have been shorter.

****1/2 out of 5,"You don't need to be a Doors fan to feel the magic that this movie gives off. Whether you love him or hate him there is no denying that Oliver Stone is one of the most unique minds in cinema these days. Stone fans will love this as he stamps his trademark style all over this, there is no man who could have done this movie justice except for him. Alongside Stone's mezmorizing direction comes a script that is almost as poetic as the Doors themselves. Val Kilmer is a dead ringer for Jim Morrison. Whenever the focus is on him he is not a man playing a character we are actually looking at Jim Morrison. The film cronicles the life of Morrison from the death of his parents at a young age right up until his untimely death due to drugs, a topic that Stone doesn't touch upon lightly in this film. The desert secene is beautifuuly directed and wonderfully acted, it also feels like you are being sucked in yourself and actually living the life of this utterly twisted man. The soundtrack fuels the film with many Doors classics. The movie may run a little longer than it should and this makes some areas seem rather dry and dragged on lossing it half a star but Doors fans and Stone fans alike will rank this high one their lists as a classic to go down in history right beside the likes of Stones other works of art and even though like most Stone movies this is not for all tastes and the ones who don't like it are the ones who hated Natural Born Killers and U-Turn but for the ones who will understand it will be provided with a roller coaster ride through the live or a great muscian.",,Anonymous,Music
The Gizzard King,"According to According to *No One Here Gets Out Alive* by Danny Sugarman, that's pretty much the way Morrison acted in real life: A mean, fat,narcissistic, drunk. But that's true of many rock stars. If you were disappointed by how this movie depicts him, maybe you should choose better idols.Look up all the live footage of the performances of The Doors now available, and Jim Morrison generally does nothing but stand frozen at the microphone stand, crooning with his eyes closed. He was not much of a performer, and Val Kilmer was a far better Jim Morrison than Morrison ever was.Despite Stone's clumsy attempts at being artistic, this is one long soap opera.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
A great study of a very complex and talented rock idol.,"For those of us that grew up in the sixties and seventies many remember wild parties, rampant availability of drugs, emotional distancing from our gov't and the war, and rock 'n roll. It was a time of social involvement and tuning out. And it was a time that saw music icons become our evangelists.Jim Morrison was that type for many. A UCLA dropout whose mystical lyrics and style masked a deep pain about his family upbringing. A character so complex that even the other band members were both in awe and disgust over the guy who was clearly the heart of the group. Morrison's life and death is a topic of legend and Oliver Stone does a marvelous job bringing all those complexities to film. The technical way the film is shot is terrific and helps to recreate the haziness that pervaded much of the late sixties.But it is Val Kilmer's incredible performance that stands out above even the film. He so ""nails"" the character that as the movie moves forward you'd swear Kilmer and Morrison are one. Much in the same way Gary Busey was Buddy Holly, in his portrayal, Kilmer is Morrison. Also, as Busey should have won an Academy Award for his performance so should have Kilmer.The dialogue, dress, attitudes, style are all period. The music, for anyone familiar with the short but terrific contribution of the group, is outstanding. This is a movie, that despite its length, keeps you riveted and keeps me coming back from time to time.",,Anonymous,Music
Boomers Will Love Themselves Over This,"Yes, I appreciated The Doors music as a teen in the 1990s so I was excited to see this flick. As I'm now in my 40's I've concluded Baby Boomers are obnoxious self-important narcissists who confuse depth with non-sensical substance abusive pretentious droning.As bloated and self-congratulatory as its director Oliver Stone (who I admire when he makes films that depict real people). Yes, he is that voice of THAT generation that you mock openly in 2021. The hippie generation who still pretend like they are their childrens' friends. Who are still too cool for school and tie a ponytail off when their entire top of their head misses hair. These are the laughable flower children. Sad, I know.Excess is the name of the game with this biopic of The Doors which should probably be renamed ""Jim Morrison Annoys Me But Somehow Deserves A Movie"" Yes, the flick paints him to be a waxing poetic intellectual who just imbibed way too many things. Women and alcohol, most likely. And the hedonistic behavior, while attempting to explain his mannerism, instead makes the audience want to vomit (not Boomers though, you celebrate this blathering drunk moron).
I will give it up for Val Kilmer though. A LOT was said back in the 1990's how he enveloped Jim Morrison. And, in his own Method acting ways, probably lived like Morrison to his detriment. Most of his behavior, I would not begin to explain other than to say, a stumbling drunk is nothing to celebrate or cheer. Which is the confusion of this flick.Sad also, are the supporting characters. Specifically, Meg Ryan, whose self-conscious breast shots make her seem less a ""free the girls"" spirit than a girl next door just first experiencing what sex is. It's uncomfortable to watch her struggle to be...free. Perhaps that was her interpretation of Pamela Courson, but...boy is she annoying.Essentially, this is a who's who of cameos of 90's actors representing 60's culture. I shudder at watching a Pearl Jam biopic featuring Millenials. This should make you cringe as well.It is a WELL crafted movie. It is shot brilliantly by Robert Richardson. Whose dreamy gauzy images reflect what feels like looking through pot haze. And edited fine enough. But the subject matter didn't warrant a movie. The people around The Doors were far more interesting than the band itself. To be honest, Jim Morrison himself seemed one dimensional. Probably just as so in real life. These are the beautiful people in life that have things thrown to them, regardless of their talent. His lyrics sucked. And the real kudos should go to Ray Manzarek who suffered this fool only because Morrison was the looks of this band.So as a 90's teen, it was a wallpaper movie to put in the background at a party. As a grown adult, this flick is unwatchable.
At the time, we all were wondering why Val didn't win an Oscar for this performance. Looking back, it would've been a very head scratching award, knowing that the empty shell of a person who believed he had the depth of a philosopher grated on the Oscar community. Today, they most likely would celebrate it.

Morrison: a god with a lowercase g,"I own the movie, I watch the movie, I enjoy the movie.  I'm sure that they could have done a better and more accurate job but at least they didn't screw it up.  Val Kilmer does an excellent job and I couldn't picture someone doing it better.  The one summary that bothers me because I know that it's true was from Denis Leary: ""I'm drunk, I'm nobody.  I'm drunk, I'm famous. I'm drunk, I'm f***'ing dead.""  Despite that, Morrison was one hell of a musician/poet/partier and has more of my respect than Eddie Vedder or any other soul.  All of this added to a story that couldn't fail.  How could you mess up the story of a life that was that interesting? You couldn't, obviously.  I've read a couple of books about him from his wife and producer and they did fine.  It's the essence that saves it.  You cannot screw up a story about him.

Awful Movie,"This movie is a total waste of two and a half hours; I kept thinking that I should turn it off but didn't, thinking it would get better but it just kept getting worse. I'm not a huge fan of the Doors, I only know their more mainstream songs but love rock history so I was curious. From the little bit of research I've done on Morrison and the others this movie gives a very one-sided perspective. I now care even less about the band and their music than I did before watching, and find the portrayal of Jim Morrison disgusting. Since I've read that Jim had another side to his personality than what the movie showed I wish Stone had included that, maybe then I wouldn't have come away with such a negative opinion of Morrison.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Will Val ever act in another movie with this much intensity?,"My favorite Door songs are:  Love me Two Times, (of course) Light My Fire, People are Strange (really a favorite of mine since I related to it so well) Don't You Love Her Madly and Riders on the Storm.  Now that I got that out, I have to say that I truly enjoyed this movie.  I was 12, 13 and 14 during the Door reign, and to tell you the truth, I was not into the Doors inner sanctum, I just liked their music and of course, Jim's voice.Val K., has not done a movie with so much intensity after this one.  He really WAS Jim Morrison.  I have to check to see if he sung any of the songs or if he lip synced.  If he sang, maybe he has Jim's spirit in him.  He even looks a little like Jim.  Great casting Oliver.  One thing about Stone, when he does a movie, you better have time to see it because it is LONG! Also, it can't bore you and this did not bore me.I recommend this movie and I believe Jim is not dead and he is hiding from the law.

Shallow Pretentious Overlong,"Val Kilmer gives a dead-on impersonation of the self-destructive singer Jim Morrison in this big-budget rock bio-pic by Hollywood's favorite rewriter of history:  Oliver Stone.  This mistitled film -- it is about Jim Morrison, not the band -- has a great look, but suffers from being shallow, pretentious, and overlong.  Not only do you never get to the bottom of Jim Morrison, this film never even shows you why Morrison's life was worth depicting at such expense.  Perhaps director Stone meant to show how the eternal battle between the world and the creative muse can destroy a sensitive artist, but he only manages to show that Morrison was a jerk who sealed his own fate.  Unless that was Stone's intention, the film is failure.  It is a pity indeed that the film didn't rise to the level of Kilmer's performance.",,Anonymous,Music
Hot Mess,"The first 35 minutes were passable.We see Jim Morrison at UCLA film school where he and Ray Manzarek were classmates. Post graduation they meet on Venice Beach. Jim reads his poetry to Ray and they decide to form a band. The next scene Robby Krieger and John Densmore are just dropped in and they're working on Krieger's song Light My Fire. The sequence was compressed as Light My Fire was originally sort of pop sounding. Densmore and Krieger had some Latin music background. They need an intro so Manzarek comes up with the organ part that was inspired by Bach's Invention # 8. Then the group goes on tour and gets recognized by some producers.After that, the movie falls apart into ""Jim Morrison being drunk/high and incoherent"" in one gratuitous, chaotic scene after another - concerts, dinner parties, the studio. There's really no further story or character development. It gets really tedious, boring and repetitive.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Val Kilmer is excellent as Jim Morrison of The Doors.,"Interesting the way ""The Doors"" came about, inspired by a line of poetry, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, ""If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite,"" thus the band found their name.You see Jim Morrison considered himself a poet first, and at one point in his college days was also pursuing film, but in a chance encounter he was asked to sing some of his words and the lead singer evolved from that.Val Kilmer is superb as Jim Morrison. The movie is very well made but as it moved forward I found it increasingly harder to watch. I developed a great repulsion for Jim Morrison. While he was talented he was a human being devoid of redeeming qualities. He had a faithful girlfriend who loved him, for example, but at any chance he would jump in bed with any random good-looking girl. He drank too much, he did drugs too much, he had no respect for anyone, not even his fellow band members.I was listening to popular music in the 1960s when ""The Doors"" first made their mark, but I was never a fan of their music. Now, seeing how much of a disaster Morrison was I am glad I never became a fan.The movie seems to pretty well follow the history of ""The Doors"" and ends with Morrison's death in Paris in 1971. I missed it when it first came out but now was able to watch it on Amazon streaming movies.",,Anonymous,Music
What an insight,"""The Doors"" is just another piece in the bigger picture of the turbulent sixties which director Oliver Stone has so painstakingly created for us, along with ""Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""J.F.K."". It has none of the power of its accompaniments, however it is an accurate depiction of the life and times of 'James Morrison.The cast are quite sensational and very convincing with Kilmer a stand out as the spaced out Morrison. The era and the music is recreated splendidly and one is given a real feel for what was a troubled time. Stone's movie is very honest, never trying to sway your emotions and always letting you come to your own conclusions.Never a sensational film (and not to my liking), but still one heck of an insight.Wednesday, October 28, 1992 - Video",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Very Good Movie With a Bad Rap.,"It's beyond me why everyone rails on this movie for being historically inaccurate. It's a good movie, a bit weird maybe, but quality none the less. Whether it is or is not historically accutare, who cares? If I want to know the facts of Jim Morrison's life I'll read the books by Ray Manzarek and Patricia Keneally-Morrison, two people that knew Jim and spent lots and lots of time with him. I'm not going to ask Oliver Stone, a man that was not a part of the Doors or their family of friends, and to the best of my knowledge, never had anything to with anything to do with anything remotely related to Jim Morrison and/or The Doors.Anyone looking to movies for historical fact needs serious help. History is boring. That's why no one want to read history books in the first place. What's historically accurate generally isn't that good of a story.If you are dead set on having historical accuracy, well too bad. Nearly any film based on real life events will have the facts altered either slightly or dramatically. Life stories take an entire lifetime to live out, but life stories in film have to be told in a reasonable amount of time, so facts are cut to fit the time frame.",,Anonymous,Music
A guilty pleasure,"I'm willing to admit that much of what I enjoy and consider great art (or at least great entertainment) is considered garbage by most other people. That's fine. Everyone's opinion is valid, and ""true art"" is typically boring anyway. THE DOORS is one of those films I've yet to get my fill of, and that I watch on TV whenever I can (which unfortunately isn't often, since it's not as popular a film as it once was), along with other films I've ""OD'd"" on such as the INDIANA JONES series, BRAVEHEART, and various films by Quentin Tarantino. Someday, maybe, I'll have seen THE DOORS so many times that I'll have gotten sick of it, but that date lies far, far in the future - partly because I LOVE it!I wasn't even born when the band broke up in the early '70s, but I grew up with them because my parents had been in high school and college when the Doors were at the height of their fame, and they were part of my parents' collective playlist along with the Beatles and nearly everyone on the soundtrack of THE BIG CHILL. Over time, as I heard more and more of their repertoire, I came to be fascinated by the Doors. To this day, I consider them the first ""modern"" rock stars in the sense in which the MTV and VH-1 generations (to which I belong) think of them, and a major influence on both alternative and progressive rock (and heavy metal, too, in some ways). I can hear or at least perceive their influence in many rock bands that followed them, including Blue Oyster Cult, Oingo Boingo, Tool, and even Nirvana. ESPECIALLY Nirvana. Both ""Break on Through"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" have helped me to make since of the world during my periods of existential doubt.So any movie about the Doors - and one by Oliver Stone in particular - is one I am going to revere. Not only is the music great (I don't think the band ever wrote a bad song), but the movie itself is unforgettable. Oliver Stone is a showman on par with Phineas T. Barnum, and so it goes without saying that THE DOORS is nothing short of a three-ring circus. Jim Morrison is shown to be a sort of combination of the Pied Piper and the title character of the famous comic book V FOR VENDETTA, with hangers-on from every which where latching onto him and his entourage. They are a diverse, even (arguably) multicultural bunch: Venice Beach bohemians, New York art snobs, Navajo Indians (albeit in Jim's fevered imagination), bikers and rednecks, and (of course) lots and lots and LOTS of hippies and flower children, decked out in everything from Nehru jackets to flowered headbands to pilgrim hats to skeleton makeup to striped clown pants. Not to mention massive hordes of teenage girls who would regularly become active participants in the stage shows - and would often be wearing absolutely nothing. I'd rather watch this than your average Fourth of July parade.THE DOORS is not a good film in the ""classical"" sense, and it doesn't even look like a classic film. At the very least, the cinematography is one-of-a-kind: so razor-sharp that nearly the entire film looks like a documentary (and not one from the 1960s, either, but the '90s, so I almost feel that the Doors are from my time); it reminds me a bit of THIS IS SPINAL TAP (another rock movie I enjoy). And I'd wager that nearly half the scenes in the film (yes, I kept track) are so rich in detail that they handsomely reward repeat viewings. But all that said, as visual storytelling THE DOORS falls well short of being perfect. The first hour is terrific, steadily charting the band's rise to the height of their fame. Then comes the second half, which shifts from Los Angeles to New York and San Francisco and Miami and eventually Paris, France - and the movie turns into a ""leave-the-camera-running"" exercise in self-indulgence (reminiscent of Andy Warhol, who appears as a character here). The rock concert scenes go on for what seem like hours, and they become repetitive (look, there's another naked girl, another angry cop, etc.). They're so long, in fact, that various other scenes - even some key scenes - end up being intercut with them. THE DOORS is approximately two and a half hours long, but it seems much longer.But after all's said and done, would I recommend THE DOORS to just about anyone? Heck, yes. The movie is a big mess, but it's endlessly colorful and never dull. Val Kilmer was all but born to play Morrison, and most of the other actors are hardly slouches themselves. And despite having been filmed in the '90s and depicting the '60s and early '70s, it all feels remarkably timeless. The ""Age of Aquarius"" counterculture is something we are still (and very confusedly) grappling with, and the questions Jim asks himself about where he is going and about life in general are ones that are worth pondering by every human being on earth.So hurrah for THE DOORS! To paraphrase the William Blake poem that inspired the bands name, Stone's opus allows us to see reality as it really is - infinite.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

He was incredibly sexy and as far as I can tell, he seemed to play the part well and he sounded a lot like him.It is a shame that the portrayal put me off the iconic Jim though. I'm not stupid, I know they were all a bit crazy back then, but it didn't show him as much of a gentleman and made him seem like a very selfish person who abused his spouse in more than just the physical way.The band have said that it wasn't a true representation of Jim as an artist and sensitive poet, but I wonder if it's because all of the hedonism was concentrated in to just over 2 hours. They wouldn't have bothered showing the boring quieter moments, would they? I'd like to believe that a lot of it was exaggerated and that's what the band said, but I can imagine that a lot of it was actually very real indeed. The band may also have been bitter, because they wanted the film to be more about all of them?It was also probably the only time I've seen Kyle Maclachlan and appreciated his performance. There's always been something off about him for me, but I think he did really well in this film and stood out amongst a lot of other 'Supporting' characters alongside Val.Based on this production Jim was not someone I could have empathised with or be passionate about. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the likes of 'Rocketman' (2019) and 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018) which probably polish away a lot of the harsher elements and show the artists we love in a way that keeps us walking away and still feeling that way about them, but it almost feels like someone was out to prove what a crazy sociopath Jim Morrison was and didn't care how that would reflect on him as an individual or the band as a whole.The stoned poetry at the start was a bit trippy to follow and I actually wish that I'd turned it off then. It really wasn't my thing, after all, there was so much sex and we only got a glimpse of Val's butt! What was that all about?210.11/1000.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
KATA TO DAIMONA EAYTOY,"If one watches the first half of the film, he will think it is a psychedelic epic (e.g. Zabriskie Point, Full Metal Jacket, The Last Temptation of Christ, Easy Rider, Apocalypse Now). And it's not far from that. Oliver Stone started it in a rather beautiful and nostalgic way, creating the requisite atmosphere.However, this motion picture is so long that it lulls you to sleep and makes you want to quit from viewing. Despite of the songs being very good, adequate and well-timed, the plot revolves around personal demons, drugs and eutrapellas during the concerts. More time could be spent on unknown aspects of the band members' lives, moments from the group's tours and its founding. Although I cannot change the ending of the film, I would like it to be presented to the viewer in a smoother way. More movie time should have been devoted to it in order to create a stronger climactic final scene. Anyway, it should have been made more carefully. Pity. Also the disguises of the remarkable-performer Val Kilmer seem to create a vicious cycle and have not a particular order.In conclusion, it's a movie worth taking a look, but make sure you get some rest before doing so. I choose not to rate the film now, as I do with almost any other title, due to not being quite happy with the overall viewing experience. Maybe I will do so next time I check it out. We all deserve a second chance anyway. Off the record, let's just say I give it a 6.5/10. Till we meet again!",,Anonymous,Music
Oliver Stone's version of history,"I was puzzled at the end of this movie--why did Oliver Stone call this film ""The Doors"" when it was basically about Jim Morrison getting inebriated and having sex?  Oh, sure, there were scenes of the band, songs by the band, scenes with the band...  But wasn't the entire point of the movie centered around seeing ""Jim"" (if that WAS his real name, being nothing like the REAL Morrison) getting head in an elevator, or having a blood-and-coke sex-fest with his wife Patricia (which she says never even happened!)  This movie was all too dependent upon the legend that have sprung up around Morrison following his death.  ""Ooh, look, drugs and sex!  This will make me some money!""  I can just picture Oliver's face.  The part I especially hated was at the very end, when it says how Jim dies and Pam ""joined him"" later.  Like they were meeting up at a coffeehouse or something.  She was a dead junkie hooker, he was a dead alcoholic rock-and-roll prostitute.  What a great relationship.  It makes you wonder why Jim ever went to Paris in the first place, when he could've lived with his wife in NYC and been a washed-up poet.  But then, we would've never got this great cinematic experience...",,Anonymous,Music
Loathsome,"""The Doors"" is the epitome of a trashy movie; it is not worth watching. I'm sorry I watched the whole thing. I don't know how fair it is either or true to life. It paints Jim in a terrible light. It's like the director tries to take the audience on a bad trip. And the constant substance abuse, erratic behavior, and occultism make this film unwatchable. My rating: 1/10. It's sad too cause I like some of their songs.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
No one else could have do it better,"This movie had everything done exactly right.  Val Kilmer has a voice that is 99% like Jim Morrison's.  People could not even believe that Val Kilmer sang everything.  Val Kilmer is extremely talented.  For all those that like Jim Morrison, no other movies comes anywhere close to this.  Also, if you like Val Kilmer, check out Thunderheart.",,Anonymous,Music
If it wasn't for the soundtrack...,"First off, this review comes about 20 years too late. Yep! That's how much time has passed since this movie was released. At the time, Val Kilmer was actually popular. I wonder how many teenagers have actually heard of him nowThe Doors is one of my favorite bands of all time, and the opening song of the movie, Riders on the storm still remains my favorite song. So, when the movie started with this tune, I really thought there could not be a better start. Regrettably, everything was less and less interesting after that. I get that Jim Morrison was a unique, crazy, and incomprehensible person. A man who seemed to lead a life with one only goal: to find death sooner rather than later. But not being able to understand this man doesn't mean that I should not be able to make sense of the movie. Yes, we get to see what Jim Morrison was probably like. But the movie is called ""The Doors"", and I would have wanted to find out a lot more about the other members of the band who were also unique musicians. They composed one of the greatest albums in the history of music in 6 days, and that part of their story, is what I really wanted to hear about. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone thought that dedicating 6 minutes to this subject was more than enough. Shame!As a Doors fan, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the concert parts and listening to what is obviously an amazing soundtrack, but as for the story telling, I thought it was mediocre at best.There's a reason why this movie is completely forgotten. Because, it just wasn't good enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
one psychedelic experience,"A hell of a movie.  Val Kilmer did a great part playing Jim Morrison, but over did the immaturity that Morrison really was. Very good screen plays and a good plot.  A great movie to watch especially if your'e a Doors fan. ~THE END~",,Anonymous,Music
"not exactly the Doors, and not exactly Jim either","I watched this film before I knew anything about the Doors. After reading various books about the Doors including ""Light My Fire"" by Ray Manzarek, I felt differently about this movie. Oliver (for some odd reason) decided to put the main focus on Jimbo (Jim when he's not his sober self), and made him out to be a total p***k. Even the way that Ray, John & Robby were portrayed painted them in a bad light. There were also important (and not so) events that were altered. What for? I know that due to legal reasons there were some things that could not be put on screen exactly, but Oliver messed up this story BIG TIME.Alternate title should be ""Oliver Stone's JIMBO""(Another thing that has always annoyed me is that whenever I hear/see someone's comments about the Doors, it's mostly about Jim. Even when I see pictures the Doors, they're of Jim with ""The Doors"" logo. HELLO, there were 4 people in the group who were all very talented!)",,Anonymous,Music
this movie changed my life!,"this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream ""FUCK IT MOVE TO France"" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.",,Anonymous,Music
Unfocused garbage,"The Doors is probably the least focused and uninteresting films I have ever seen. The film doesn't go anywhere and doesn't seem to know what it wants to say. In it's few lucid moments it makes some interesting points(backstage at the Ed Sullivan show is one example) but the rest of the time it is like being part of a bad drug trip. Nothing makes sense and you aren't having any fun. If you are in the mood for an Oliver Stone movie, see Platoon. It actually knows what it's trying to say.",,Anonymous,Music
impressive,"many motifs defines it as special. the performance of Val Kilmer, the signature of Oliver Stone, the feeling to be more than viewer but part from a cultural phenomenon. each in same measure important. but significant remains the final emotions. because, for the public from East it is not only a precise homage to a memorable artist but a portrait of recent freedom. the songs, the poems, the fight against him of a young man looking for the sense of his art and life and science to be exactly himself, honest to him and to the others are the pillars of a fascinating way to discover ""The Doors"" as a support for reflection more than as show. so, impressive work.",,Anonymous,Music
Crap,"Passionate but overlong and incompetent biographical picture about Jim Morrison, the infamous lead singer of the Doors, played with fire powered gusto by Val Kilmer. Film stumbles and bumbles along the pinpoints of Morrison's young adult life (he died at 27) from meeting his girlfriend played by Meg Ryan, to quitting film school, to forming the Doors with his friend, to playing in concerts and the infamous Ed Sullivan show incident, and of course, Jim's various outbursts of uncontrolled frenzy, Jim's unfaithfulness to his girlfriend, before showing his death in France.As I said, Val is great as Jim and is also an uncanny look a like and also did his own singing (the real band said they couldn't tell Val's singing apart from Jim's) but the film is just an excessive pile of crap that doesn't really tell you anything about Jim Morrison except that he was a drug addict and a self-destructive psychopathic freak. Still, the real tragedy is that such an obviously gifted and talented man wasted his life so badly. I guess the old saying goes that the light that burns twice is bright burns half as long.",,Anonymous,Music
Couldn't finish it,"I listen to the Doors on occasion whenever they're on the radio. I like some of their music but I wouldn't classify myself as a fan. I'm also not a big fan of the 60's-70's. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be either a Doors fanatic or someone totally enamoured of the 60s & early 70s.Watching this movie was quite a snoozer for me. Couldn't make it past the candle-lit witch meeting. The scenes seemed to go on forever. The antics of Morrison (Kilmer) made me think this guy was a self-absorbed, selfish, pitiful guy who took it out on everyone else and thus destroyed himself.Maybe that was the point, but I didn't want to sit for 2+ hours watching it being relentlessly shown on screen from different angles. I guess Bart Simpson was right about showbizness. ""Repetitiveness is my job... my job... repetitiveness is my job!""",,Anonymous,Music
As deep as pond scum and about as interesting,"This has to be one of the most boring biographies ever made about such a famous person. Stone seems to have been completely uninterested in getting ""inside the head"" of his subject, Jim Morrison (despite the film's title, the other three bandmembers are strictly supporting cast) and instead simply presents re-creations of various events in his life without the slightest attempt at getting beyond the public persona. Stone seems to accept (and parrot) Morrison's mythology and public image and one comes away from the movie with no insight beyond ""He was this, like, shaman kind of guy, and he was, like, really cool. And stuff.""",,Anonymous,Music
"A good insight, but reportedly inaccurate!","The Doors movie in my mind is a good insight into a very interesting subject for me. I am a huge fan of The Doors and enjoyed watching the movie to see exactly what went on all those years ago. The problem is that the surviving Doors' members and Danny Sugerman (Manager / Biographer) claim that the film is inaccurate and realising their situation they should know what went on!Besides this, Val Kilmer plays Morrison better than anyone else could have hoped. He is very similar in looks and in those live scenes where Kilmer is singing, he sounds like him aswell.The film can get a bit boring in parts but most Doors' fans will see this through to get to see what Oliver Stone's perception of those famous Doors' incidents were like.If you aren't a fan of The Doors and their lives you probably won't be interested in this film. If you are, rent it out and make your own judgement!",,Anonymous,Music
Not a great movie but at least a tribute to the great Jim Morrison,"It wasn't as great as I thought it'd be but it was not as bad as the critics made it out to be. Finally a tribute to the greatest idol in rock.. The Doors were without a doubt the best rock band.. their music wasn't the type that you would get sick of after listening to for a couple of months.. their music was the type that defined life and the world. And I guess if a movie was to be made after the doors Oliver Stone did one hell of a job at it. But still, the movie should have given a bit more attention to the turmoil in the band itself than Morrison's personal life and that's the way it was in real life too.. The fellow band members got overlooked while Morrison got the name",,Anonymous,Music
The Doors(stand-alone),"By stand-alone I mean the following..my review of the movie is my review of the movie The Doors, and especially the singer who is by now in American history nearly a myth, a modern Dionysus. Yet, Jim Morrison was a little too close to the present in terms of events, his life as a part of and outside of The Doors, to be a myth. A legend, yes, depending on your point of view about rock icons. There are many books about Jim and The Doors none I have not read, and I should, since I like their CD's. And because I like the movie so much. Yet the last part of the statement I just made invites an incredible amount of criticism, so much that the beliefs of other Doors fans become practically catechisms. The church of The Doors that has stoned the director of the film so much is angry, or was at a time. Ray Manzarek is a very good example. I don't think I saw him on video in the 15th year reissue. I don't see Manzarek in any of the special features. Although I love the movie, so much that I've seen it 20 times or more, I have to have respect for a man that was the closest member to Jim Morrison. They all loved Morrison, everyone in the band I mean, even John Densmore. I believe the drummer served to balance out the emotions. After all, the group was not Jim Morrison and The Doors. So, the movie begins with The Lizard Kind in his later days, a little heavier, enjoying the alcohol possibly more than ever, and accompanied by the spirit of the Indian played by Red Floyd Crow Westerman. The native American plays a crucial part of the movie. The spirit is watching Morrison, looking after him it seems. But not able to do anything to help. The movie shows Jim Morrison in a downward spiral. Like I said, this is a stand-alone review of the movie. A lot of things did happen, yet a lot of events and feelings were not explained. This was really a major motion picture, with Hollywood cinema attire, and obviously there are people still alive(or were) connected with The Doors who were offended. There have been many famous people, whether they were actors, musicians, comedians, politicians, poets and writers who have been the subject of movies. But those people, like Jackson Pollock or Nixon or Andy Kaufman were all, to my knowledge, never in docudramas until after their death. This is the big difference between Morrison and those I just named. Apparently, the surviving members of The Doors with the exception of Manzarek were for the movie. Maybe they changed their minds later. The movie The Doors blew my mind, because it was a major motion picture. What is ironically humorous about that fact is that the movie was garnered and placed under Paramount and now belongs to Lionsgate. It was hugely successful...one never knows what movie entities have on their mind. Didn't fit into their library. The uniqueness of the L.A. band in movie terms is that, after seeing a film about The Doors, it's an act that no other band can really top. To see a movie about The Byrds or The Airplane or The Grateful Dead...that might never happen. The reason could be each did not have such a wild poet/singer with so much going on in his life...or those other Cali bands may have just said no to the idea, for any number of reasons. I'm just not one who is angry about the Doors movie. It's too different, and did not make me feel like an idiot. There are so few major pictures about American rock bands.",,Anonymous,Music
Not all it's cracked up to be...,"Oliver Stone is a masterful storyteller, and with The Doors, he is doing just that: telling stories.  Anyone who has read the number of books written about The Doors and Jim Morrison understands that Stone wove together several different accounts about the ""real Jim,"" and it seems that there is not much truth to his characters.  Val Kilmer is fantastic in his characterization of Jim, but it is so far from the true Jim, that viewers must realize that this film is primarily fiction.  Meg Ryan's innocent, sweet Pam Courson is another fictionalization of a real person that widely misses the mark.  While the film is visually stunning and the music intense, the events that take place in the movie did not necessarily take place in real life.  True fans of Jim Morrison and The Doors will hopefully view the film for what it is: the Hollywood-Oliver Stone version of the real life of a poet and artist.  Read the books, listen to the music, and don't take the film at face value.",,Anonymous,Music
"Bad Movie, Good Band","Val Kilmer is the reason this movie is even possible to sit through.  Oliver Stone really came up with a clunker with ""The Doors"".  It's a pretty boring movie and you find yourself getting sick of Jim Morrison getting drunk, using drugs, and being abusive.  I was hoping for a little more insight into the band and into the music, not into the ""mystique"" (or drunken haze) of the frontman Morrison.  Not that he isn't interesting or talented, but the music of the Doors supercedes his downward spiraling life.  Go read a book or something, but don't see this movie if you can avoid it.  Also stay away from Stone's ""any given sunday"" as it is a HUGE stinker.",,Anonymous,Music
shot in the dark,"My sister said this movie portrayed the 60's as too depressing. It's not really about the 60's it's about Jim's testing of the boundaries. I wasn't a fan of the Doors because they were dealing with the dark side and Rock and Roll was still producing some great music. When the 60's ended the Grateful Dead exploded like a supernova and carried enough fun to get people through the strange 70's. But when that southern liberal phony Jimmy Carter (JC) was roundly beat by the Republicans dark side boss Ronald Reagan the Doors music came back with ""Absolutely Live"" results. They were originally going to cast John Travolta as Jim. It's a good thing they didn't even though it may have been funny to see him go from Saturday Night Fever to Sunday morning resurrection.",,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't really tell the truth about the band,"Oliver Stone's The Doors is a very silly film.  I don't believe much of what occurs in the film, but it is pretty funny at times, although I don't think humor is what the director was ultimately going for.  Not a bad film, but obviously more false than true.  If you would like to learn more about the actual Doors, then I suppose you should go on a book hunt, as many titles about the band and lead singer Jim Morrison can be found at your local library.",,Anonymous,Music
Watch it for the great leading performances,"Oliver Stone decides to give the political theories a rest and dives into the biography of a rock band's leading man. This is a biographical take on Jim Morrison and you'd be hard pressed to find a lot of faults here- Kilmer is literally the photo copy of the real Jim and Meg Ryan is adorable as his girlfriend. The film itself wasn't such a hit because, well to be frank it is vague and goes off on many tangents but this is a valiant effort to show a true rock star. Even if you aren't a fan of the Doors I suggest you check this one out.",,Anonymous,Music
