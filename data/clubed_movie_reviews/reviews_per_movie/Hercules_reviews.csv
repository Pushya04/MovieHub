Disney's funniest,"I'm shocked to see this movie with a rating below 7.  As a big Disney fan, I'll go out on a limb and say this is one Disney's top 5.  There isn't a Disney movie out there with wit as sharp as this one's with much of it probably lost on the audience guessing by the rating given to this movie.""Meg"" definitely emerges as my all-time favorite female Disney role. Breaking from tradition, her character is not all that lady-like in her biting wit and sarcasm, but it works, serving to make the movie funny and her character lovable despite working with questionable motives.The set-up and plot is typical for the movie but the script, animation, and music are most original AND good.  IF I had to register a complaint, I would say that it's perpetual humor kept the movie from being emotionally wrenching.  However, this movie remains one of the most entertaining I've seen.  8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hey mythology lovers, get a grip!","I have seen many Disney movies, animated and not, and this one has more action than most, has no cute animals and is more humorous (ala Aladdin) than a typical Disney movie--Pixar films not included. This one also has a male lead (no princesses). If you are looking for typical Disney fare, then you may not appreciate this one. We enjoyed it thoroughly--from 4 to 40 years of age, male and female.As for all the criticism regarding the liberties Disney took with Greek mythology, get a grip. I love Greek mythology too but hey, IT'S FICTION! It's not historical fact. Even the ancient tales themselves are not consistent, containing contradictions. There were many authors. But the characters are interesting, and Disney used some of them to create a good story for kids about an outcast looking for his place in life. It also explores what makes a hero a true hero (perhaps the more useful lesson of the movie). Yes, it's a shame they took so many liberties with this picture but it still encourages interest in Greek myth. Don't believe me? The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were not historically accurate either but they got kids interested in the Old Masters!8 / 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable, but not Disney's best!","First of all, there are a lot of things I like about this movie. The animation, in general, is very nice to look at, and Charlton Heston's narration is very satisfying. And it is one of the funnier Disney movies with a witty and funny script. More pluses are a genius turn from Danny DeVito as the hilarious Phil, and a wonderfully sleazy James Woods as the hot-headed villain Hades( a great villain, might I add?)Rip Torn also has fun as Zeus, especially when his statue came to life. The incidental music is lovely as well. However, there are a few negatives. Hercules himself, both child and adult, is a little bland, but Meg manages to establish herself as one of the best female Disney characters. Also, there isn't much of a story. The prove-you're- a-hero formula was a little unoriginal for me. The biggest minus was the rather dull songs by Alan Menken. The songs, especially ""Zero to Hero"" were a real disappointment, as Menken had so much better work before this, namely Beauty and the Beast. However, Michael Bolton's rendition of Go the Distance(the only song I had no problem with)was a joy to behold, as was ""I won't say I'm in love"". It wasn't a good idea turning gospel, should've stayed with the classical. However, despite the flaws, I did enjoy Hercules, which is a 7/10. Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hilarious, great fun for kids and adults.","I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!Overall - 8/10",,Anonymous,Animation
Short Sweet to the point,Alright so I've been meaning to sit and watch Hercules for a while now and I'm glad that I did. I mean hey it's cliche & kinda basic and meant for kids probably but it's sweet it's a story I enjoy it also has a lot of actually unexpectedly funny one liners and scenes that have fun character interaction it also doesn't over stay its welcome without credits it's about an hour 27 so goes by pretty quickly tbh and it's nice I think I'd be kinda sucky if it kept going cause it really doesn't need to keep going. Danny devito did a great job ofc hades was really funny and oh my god meg üòçüòç bro meg is such a baddie bro imma keep it a buck like this chick got me folding like fresh laundry.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Olympian achievement,"This is possibly my favorite Disney movie ever. With a razor-sharp wit, perfect comic timing and a fresh plot that transcends most other Disney fairy tales, this one's definitely a keeper.You'll be enchanted right from the first number, in which the five Muses (from Greek mythology) set the stage of ancient Greece in a powerhouse gospel number which gives a whole new meaning to a Greek chorus. Recalling the three ladies in Little Shop of Horrors or Motown groups like the Supremes, the Muses appear randomly throughout the movie to narrate the story of Hercules with jazzy musical numbers that you'll be humming for days. The songs (by Alan Menken) are certainly a twist from the classic Disney musical, but there's enough variety to create a great, well-rounded musical. The writing is the wittiest in any Disney movie ever, with constant in-jokes and hilarious references to Greek mythology to reward the amateur scholar. The lyrics, too, are witty and full of tricky rhyme schemes that must have been a doozy to write but play out perfectly on screen. (You'll be flat-out awed by how many things rhyme with the phrase ""gospel truth"".)Another of the highlights is the heroine, Megara or Meg. She's in no way a typical Disney princess. She's sassy, sexy, cynical and dangerous - and more winning by far than any warbling Cinderella or whiny little mermaid. The villain, Hades, is also a fun, witty character, although plenty dangerous in his own right.Of course liberties have been taken with Greek mythology. The dysfunctional Olympian family has been cleaned up (No more Zeus having affairs or Hera trying to kill people) and the story has little in it of the original Greek legend. Instead, it's really an archetype, a modern retelling of all the Greek legends at once. Appearances are made by the Muses, the Hydra, satyrs, the Fates, Pegasus, the Titans, Narcissus, and of course all of the Olympian gods. Scholars may take offense, but since legends evolve and are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway, I didn't have a problem with it.Yes, it's cheesy, just like other Disneys. But when nobody else is around, there's no resisting the corn. The third act is absolutely heart-wrenching, and even if it's over-the-top, it never truly goes over the top, and the constant bombarding of wit keeps things from getting too touchy-feely. Besides, tied together with a golden Disney score, who couldn't resist a dose of adventure, heartache, redeeming love, and most of all, heroism? Just let yourself be carried away to ancient Greece and you'll forget the movie's problems in a Pelyponnesian minute. As the Muses would say, that's the gospel truth.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Zeus! Your son has returned.,"Though 'Hercules (1997)' struggles to provide even one truly great song, the film is a colourful and enjoyable adaptation of Greek mythology. Its highlight is probably Hades, the easily enraged god of the underworld who's brilliantly voiced by a fast-talking and scene-chewing James Woods. The movie is mostly light-hearted entertainment; it has an underlying message, but it isn't as focused upon as in some of Disney's other fare. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Sometimes, you just want your animated musicals to be fun. After a somewhat slow start, the movie picks up the pace and is engaging right until its finish. It also features a few well-achieved and, even, exciting set-pieces. It's a solid entry in the Disney archives. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
God-like,"""Hercules"" is a cracking Disney film and for once it's not just for the kids. The animation is more like the ""old-school"" Disney, before the cute, big-eye syndrome and the characters are hugely entertaining. It has sly humour and in-jokes, but what sets it apart are the songs; soul, RNB, jazz and not a drippy sugar-song in sight. Quality entertainment!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A watered down Aladdin set in ancient Greece,"No, it's not accurate to the original Greek myth of Heracles, but that isn't what keeps this film from being much good.Hercules (1997) is a part of the second half of the oft-praised Disney Renaissance, a second golden age which ran from the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989 roughly until the release of Tarzan in 1999. Fans usually split this period into two parts: we have the Big Four from 1989 to 1994 (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King), called such because they not only innovated and revitalized Disney animation after the roughly two decade dark age following Walt Disney's death in 1966, but they were also major hits at the box office. The second half starts with the artistic misfire that was Pocahontas, a visually stunning but soulless film obviously made with the Academy Awards in mind. It was at this point that the ""renaissance formula"" began to become more obvious and stale. Yes, a few of the films were good (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan), but most were bland and safe wastes of time.Hercules is as safe as these films got. I think only Fantasia 2000 (1999) was more of a disappointment in taking chances. The main character, his ""I Want"" song, and the supporting characters are all dull. The color scheme is wretched, just a potpourri of clashing neon colors competing for your attention. The whole movie feels like a less entertaining version of Aladdin (1992) honestly. The only redeeming elements are the hilarious villain Hades and the love interest Meg's song, ""I Won't Say I'm in Love.""I'm glad others find merit in it, but for me, it's only a mildly pleasant mess.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An amazing movie if we don't count historical inaccuracies,"The movie was ahead of it's time in terms of production values for an animated movie (visual effects, art direction, action and most importantly humor and heart). The characters were also very interesting especially the amazing performance of Hades. My only grip was that we never saw Hades use his powers in a fight vs Hercules. He is in the top 3 Greek Gods along with Zeus and Poseidon. I remove one star for this and also because even though the film is its own creation the historical inaccuracies were so damn many (I am Greek btw). Nevertheless the movie is one of the best Disney animated movies for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The BEST Disney movie I have ever seen!!,"Oh my gosh I can't believe that people are complaining about this movie. It is amazing with great art, jazzy music and awesome characters. I am 14 and first saw this movie at 5. I liked the movie then and absolutely love it now.I love the songs and even though it is not true to mythology, so what?? It's a movie so get over it!! Shesh!! This movie has got heaps of bad reviews but has anybody looked at the good ones?? The characters in this movie are great. Hercules is great and Phil adds some laughs. The villains in this story add soo much humor. Hades, Pain and Panic add soo many laughs and James Woods is perfect for Hades who is one of the best villains yet!! Megara (or Meg) has to be the best heroine from all the Disney movies. For one she is not looking for love, is independent (she can tie her own sandals and everything) and can stand up to her boss. She doesn't let anyone push her around. I think that Susan Egan did Meg's voice perfectly.Honestly I just want to say that this movie is great for both adults and children and the songs are unforgettable.If you haven't seen go to the video shop and rent it! You wont be sorry!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Okay, but in a good way","It is certainly not the strongest movie of the Disney Renaissance (or of Disney movies in general.

Pathetic,"Now, I'll admit that the music is not half bad. But as for the people who say that it's not important that it be true to the mythology, that's not what us myth-lovers are complaining about. At least for me. I don't know about the rest of them. I am complaining that with this movie Disney took a great story and Christianized it. They corrupted it, they took all of the decency out of it. This movie is to the myth what saccharine is to sugar. And I say that not only because artificial sweetener will never be better than the real thing, but because this movie is in fact nauseatingly saccharine in its ""adaptation"". Just a few ways in which this movie was Christianized and had all of the punch taken out of the real story: for one, Hera is NOT Hercules' mother, she is the one trying to kill him. But of course, in a Disney movie we have to have the happy family, right? And since we need a new villain, hm, let's see...why not just pin it on the lord of the underworld? Who, I might add, has no demonic connotations in Greek myth and whose only appearance in the Hercules story is when Hercules is tasked to bring Cerberus from Hades and back to the king alive. In the end of the real story, Hercules is driven mad by Hera and kills his wife, ""Meg"", and his entire family. This kind of interpretation makes me sick because it's just another example of society thinking that children can't handle anything remotely serious. But, to end on an up note, the music was catchy.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The last of the new classics,"Although I know I have heaped praise on several other Disney films...Hercules stands out as my favourite among them all. After this movie the Disney features once again seemed to slip downhill. However I can watch this movie again and again, it has a spectacular Greek chorus, gospel type score, which will ring in your head for days (and you will like it!). The characters are all likeable, even the villain and it is absolutely hilarious!I have never understood the panning this film got from Disney fans, as I have never comprehended what there is to dislike. The animation is beautifully done, although it is done in the style of Greek art, which may not be to everyone's taste (very similar situation to Sleeping Beauty which was disliked by some because it was animated in the style of a medieval tapestry), but it works wonderfully for the film.Take a chance and watch it...and when you're done watching it for the sixteenth time, go out and buy the soundtrack!",,Anonymous,Animation
the best since Aladdin!,"wow! This movie was really a pleasant surprise!

"One of the best Disney movies, for sure","The plot of the movie was very interesting, a very innovative Disney movie. The storyline was well-written, so interesting. The characters were very interesting and well-developed. The location of the movie was amazing, they portrayed ancient Greece, really well. Also, the theme of the movie, ""Ancient Greek mythology"" was very interesting and it was portrayed really well. There were some funny and iconic scenes.

Moreover, the design of the movie and the effects were very well edited. Last but not least, I can't wait for the live adaption of the movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good Disney musical comedy,"Released in 1997, Hercules was Disney's animated (and very loose) take on Greek mythology, specifically the story of hero, and son of Zeus, Heracles. The film did well both at the box-office and with audiences, though it wasn't quite the Aladdin or Lion King-sized hit Disney was aiming for.After the relatively grown-up and sober The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, this was clearly an attempt by Disney to scale things back a tad and deliver a fun, light-hearted and colorful animated film with enough familiar tropes, catchy songs and pop culture references to keep younger viewers, in particular, entertained. The art style was inspired by Greek vase paintings and psychedelic caricatures from the 1960's and this gives the film its own unique look. Music-wise, the film attempts an Aladdin-esque eclectic stylistic clash: that movie mixed jazz with a Middle Eastern setting and this one brings gospel music to Ancient Greece.Plot-wise, we see Hercules (Tate Donovan) being brought into the world as a god on Mount Olympus before being denied his divinity by Hades (James Woods), god of the underworld, who turns him into a mortal so he can eventually bring back the Titans unchallenged and win the battle against Zeus. Hercules is raised by humans on Earth and, after he finds out his true identity, he gets the help of satyr Philoctetes (Danny DeVito) in order to master his significant strength and become a true hero worthy of being a god.Along the way, Hercules meets Megara (Susan Egan), who becomes his love interest while, at the same time, being bound by a deal she made with Hades, who is actively trying to render Hercules powerless for good. You would expect a Hercules film to focus primarily on the legendary 12 Tasks but these are thrown in there at random moments and, instead, everything is just one big build-up to Hades getting his way then facing off against Hercules. It works but it all feels a bit too familiar at times as the film follows the typical Disney template whereby a character feels he doesn't belong somewhere, sings about it, then somehow wins in the end.This is a visually appealing film, though the fully CGI Hydra hasn't aged particularly well. The cast is excellent (Woods' Hades steals every scene he's in) and the songs, while not too memorable save for one or two, are pleasant enough. It sometimes tries a little too hard to be cute or witty and it's missing one good villain song (see Hercules: The Animated Series for that one) but, overall, this is an enjoyable Disney outing.It may never reach the heights of Aladdin but Hercules manages to bring back an element of goofy fun after the lackluster Pocahontas, and that is definitely something to celebrate. While it would have been more interesting to see an actually faithful adaptation of the story, this is a harmless, entertaining animated feature the whole family can have a good time with.Likable stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hercules Hercules Hercules!,"I always feel like this is part of this small window of Disney animated movies that gets dropped from the public consciousness. There's that golden age of Lion King and Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast etc. Those early 90s movies that have earned legendary status. Pocahontas is problematic but then in comes Toy Story and the birth of Pixar and maybe that's what derailed these. But I just watched this and another from the same period and they're amazing and really going in fun new ways and I appreciate it. Meg is an amazing Disney ""Princess"" though that feels like the wrong thing for her. She's fiery and strong and I Loved it about her. Woods as Hades? Awesome. The music is great. The story about what it means to be a good person, to act in charity and not in hopes of reward is poignant and likely forever relevant.Absolutely worth watching and thank you Disney+ for making it easy to check out.

"It all depends on your perspective,...","Whether or not you like this movie really depends on your perspective. For the casual viewer, it's an entertaining film, though few would place it among Disney's best. For obsessive history teachers like myself, the film is so problematic that enjoying the film is next to impossible, as the film bears very little similarity to the Hercules myths. In fact, when the film debuted, I remember hearing about protests in Greece because many felt that Disney's ""fast and loose"" attitude towards the source material was cultural offensive. I can understand and appreciate this, though frankly, sometimes I wish I weren't as well-versed with history and could just turn off my brain and enjoy the film from a completely mindless perspective. Sorry, but if historical accuracy means anything stay away,...but at least the films are better than the Steve Reeves films or the god-awful Trans-lux cartoons of the 1960s!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the last Disney's great movies,"I think that no one wants to admit that this is a good movie because of it's unseriousness, and because of the fact that Hercules here is depicted more as a super-hero rather then a classic mythical hero.Don't listen to those who curse the movie because it doesn't stick to original myths. Does anyone really want to see Zeus as he is depicted in myths - as a horny geezer who f***ed everyone BUT Hera? Who really cares about the accuracy? The movie is fun, hilarious, and has a nice love story. Megara (or Meg if you want) is a great character. Nice change after all those fair princesses like Jasmin and Pocahontas (don't get me wrong, I like them). Hades is also a great villain (thanks to James Woods), and I also liked his two stooges (""Thirsty?"" -best scene).The movie's downfall was the music. I expected more from Menken. None of the songs are memorable like ''A Whole New World'' or ''Colors of The Wind''. While the songs sung by the Muses sound nice thanks to the singing voices and the song ''Go the distance'' has a catchy tune, the words are a crying shame. Lyrics in ''Go the distance'' are so shallow, obvious and soulless, and repetitive. It makes the song boring after certain time of listening. The only song I liked was Meg's ""I won't say I'm in love"".And to wrap it up - one of Disney's different projects, but fun nonetheless. It's got nice story, good humor all the way, and a teensy weensy bit of a tearful ending. So there's something for everyone.Oh, yeah! And watch it at least three times, to see it's full quality.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
No James Woods = No Good!,"If Disney were trying to keep their successful streak going then Hercules is a truly bizarre choice in trying to prolong that. On the surface a film based on Greek mythology could be very effective and if anybody could do an interesting take on it then it was probably Disney. However, the choices made in telling the story and shaping it are just so strange that I'm not sure what they were thinking. This very much feels like they were just throwing things at the wall and seeing what happened to stick. Almost everything clashes, from the animation to the music to comedy. This is one messy film and I don't think its good points are enough to redeem it.In a similar vein to Superman, Hercules is born to the Greek God Zeus on Mount Olympus and he happens to fall to Earth when a plan by Hades to dispose of him goes wrong. Hercules later discovers who he really is and sets out to earn his place back by being a hero, all while Hades tries to find out his weakness to complete a prophecy. This story has two big issues, the fact that we've seen this all before and that it is incredibly predictable. From the very beginning you know how the plot will develop, the motions that Hercules will go through and how it will all be resolved in the end. They try to add some different touches here and there, yet none of them really work and you're left with a tried plot line.The characters are pretty much cardboard cut-outs. Hercules (Tate Donovan) is the classic naive idiot who has a heart of gold and never gives up. Sadly he comes across as annoying instead of charming and he simply isn't interesting, he's a hero that you can't really get behind. His trainer Phil is the typical grumpy teacher, never satisfied and willing to give his student a hard time. Danny DeVito is a good fit, but he isn't given anything of note to do. Megara (Susan Egan) is enjoyably feisty and seems independent at first, but that is traded in so she becomes a damsel and the attempt to give her a solid backstory feels rushed. Hades' two servants Pain and Panic are much more irritating than they are funny too.The only thing that really works here is Hades with most of that coming from James Woods and his excellent delivery style. He talks like a salesman or a lawyer would, with very fluid snappy and frequently funny dialogue. He's enjoyably different from most Disney villains, mostly because he is a lot more charismatic and fast- talking. Not to mention he has a great design. On a similar point the rest of the animation, designed by Gerald Scarfe, is not that good. It all looks a little too soft and simplistic, with a lot of bright and rather in your face colours. I will say that some of the monster designs are quite creative, but I think they could have been even more imaginative. The action scenes weren't as good as they should have been either. There are a few moments of tension that are effective, but the fights are usually dull and not very engaging.I didn't enjoy the music at all. The main type of music used was Gospel and to me it didn't fit the film whatsoever. Seeing these images with a backdrop of Gospel was just so jarring, not to mention that the songs themselves were not very catchy. The Oscar-nominated 'Go the Distance' by Michael Bolton was weak too, the lyrics were rather clich√©d and again it just didn't have a good tune. The comedy really didn't work. I found the 'muses' who interrupt from time to time to be annoying and all they did was slow the story down. I didn't care for the characters so the situational comedy wasn't that funny, there were very few humorous lines and the pop culture references felt like they were forced in. Once again Hades is the only one who is consistently amusing.For me Hercules is something of a failure. It feels like they were trying to capture the tone of Aladdin, but missed the fact that that film had engaging characters and much better jokes. Almost everything about Hercules doesn't work as it should or badly clashes. Hercules himself is just such a dull lead, the support he gets is equally as dull and the story has been seen so many times that it's become too familiar. Disney are usually great with music and animation, but both are weak here. I'd have to say that James Woods' Hades is probably the only shining light and does provide the best moments. Hercules is just a confused and boring effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favourite Disney films of all time,"I've watched Disney's Hercules loads of times and it's absolutely amazing. It's one of my favourite Disney films of all time. My favourite songs are Go the Distance, One Last Hope, The Gospel Truth I/Main Titles as well. The voice acting is great especially from Danny DeVito and James Woods themselves. The animation looks beautiful and colourful.Back in December 1997, I went to see it at the Ormonde Stillorgan (then UCI, now Odeon Stillorgan in Dublin, Ireland) with my school in and I was seven years old in that year. I thought it was the first film I ever saw at cinemas. It was the only film I saw at cinemas in 1997 too.I always loved that Disney film.If you're fan of Greek myths and legends, you'll definitely love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hades shines brighter,"My God is this movie totally saved by James Wood interpretation of the excellent writing for the superb character, impossibly well animated and perfectly designed Hades. Every second he's onscreen, the movie is at the level of 10 out of 10 with nothing better ever created by Disney... but when he's not...The rest happens. And it's fine. Hercules and his story and arc is fine, although it does has clear and obvious mistakes/stupidities about Hercules powers and his arc, but overall, it's ok.What's not ok is the music. The songs are just impossibly bad and totally unnecessary. The movie would've been shorter and better without them. It's ok though, we got Hades and that made it all worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Looked at it in a vacuum it's great,"Let me preface this review by saying that I adored this movie as a kid and apart from the Iliad didn't know anything about Greek mythology back then.This movie has a lot of heart and even though it reuses a lot of the typical Disney tropes it deviates enough to deliver something fresh and time appropriate. There's criticism of star worshipping compared to Jordan. The characters are three dimensional and not just your typical story board cut outs.Coming to the details of this film. Danny DeVito is great but James Woods steals the show. His portrayal of Hades is phenomenal.The movie is very funny and gives a nice modern 90's spin to this Greek tragedy. The music is extraordinary. The muses were one of my favorite parts. Apart from I can go the distance I loved every song. The dynamic between Hercules and Meg feels natural and is very funny.Now to the part why this movie ranks so high for me in a subjective manner. I think I've been in love with Meg since I was 6 years old. She's funny, has a backstory and very believable motives and some human flaws. She ends up actually having a better character arc than Hercules himself.On a negative note the story of this movie only takes parts of the original tragedy and makes an own story out of it. If this rubs you the wrong way avoid this movie since taking liberties with the story would be quite an understatement.Overall a great movie and definitely and one that I hold very dearly. Compared to the original tragedy it's very different but looked at it in a vacuum it's great.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of the lesser Disney movies,"Of course, it was only a matter of time before Disney decided to take one of the Greek or Roman myths, tone down the seriousness, create a happier ending, and turn it into an animated feature for children. ""Hercules"", a Disney retelling of the myth of Heracles, is a film that has a good heart and probably good intentions. If it was meant to inspire children to learn more about mythology, it worked. I marginally enjoyed ""Hercules"" as a child. The key word is marginally, and now as an older audience member, I still marginally enjoy it, but I do see it as flawed and a little bit of a bore at times.If you want something completely faithful to the myth, definitely stray away. I wasn't planning on seeing something entirely faithful, still ""Hercules"" did not fully interest me. I did like the voice acting talents and I did very much enjoy how Danny DeVito did the voice of the half-human half-goat hero-trainer. But one thing I did not like was how the other characters were put on screen. And that's another problem I have with this film. I was not all for the animation style. I felt it was too vibrant, too shoddy, and I just didn't think it was eye candy. I felt Zeus looked a little preposterous among some others. And I know that many, including the Academy Awards, will disagree with me on the next point. But I did not like the main song ""Go the Distance"" that Hercules sings like three times in a row within twenty minutes. I'm sorry, but I just did not like it. I knew it was going to be there, but I was hoping for something better than what I got.Don't get me wrong. I did not HATE the film. There were some moments that were quite fun. Such as Hercules's legendary battle with the multi-headed Hydra. Although I felt the serpent needed better-looking heads, the scene were pretty exciting and cool to watch.Bottom line, ""Hercules"" will appeal to most audience viewers who like Disney movies. Again, I did marginally enjoy it, but I have seen much better films come out of Disney. I would recommend ""The Jungle Book"" or ""The Rescuers Down Under"" and for children, I would say ""Hercules"" is worth looking at.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Didn't keep my attention,"I'll start by saying that I love animated movies and have seen many. But for some reason, this one didn't do it for me. I tried watching it a year ago and completely stopped paying attention after the first 20 minutes - so much so I couldn't even tell you the plot. I just tried it again, and I was able to pay attention this time, but I couldn't engage with it. I didn't identify with Hercules or the other characters at all, and the plot wasn't interesting to me. I did get a fun surprise when I recognized Danny DeVito as the satyr, and he did the part well. But everything felt one-dimensional to me. I will say that it's not a poorly made movie, but I just didn't really like it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
the best animation film of disney,"One of, if not, the best Disney films ever made. The vocal talents of James Woods, Danny DeVito, Tate Donovan, and Rip Torn are all spot on. The music isn't the best work Disney has put out, but the movie itself is downright amazing. The tale of a son trying to regain his heroism to return home is one that has been told before. However, the way this one is told just feels fresh and new. James Woods as Hades is perfect casting. It is on the level as James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Hades. Great job Disney on this perfection. If anyone likes Greek mythology then this is a great, kid friendly, version of it.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A messy but amusing Disney animated mash-up of Superman, Rocky, and Michael Jordan.","In ancient Greece, Mount Olympus, the home of the Gods, celebrates the birth of Hercules (Josh Keaton: Teenager, Tate Donovan: Adult) the son of Zeus (Rip Torn) and Hera (Samantha Eggar) the king and queen of the Gods. Hades (James Woods), God of the dead and the underworld jealous of Zeus' power doesn't join in the celebration and plots to overthrow Zeus and the Gods in 18 years using the Titans, destructive beast Zeus imprisoned eons ago, as the means of their destruction. Hades is told by the Fate Sisters that should Hercules intervene his plan will fail so he sends his henchman Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Matt Frewer) to Olympus to abduct the infant Hercules and give him a potion to turn him mortal and kill him. The plan nearly succeeds but Pain and Panic are unable to give him the full potion when farmers Amphitryon (Hal Holbrook) and Alcmene (Barbara Barrie) find the baby and adopt him as their own. When Hercules comes of age having been an outcast due to his great but uncontrolled strength, his parents tell him of how they found him with a talisman bearing the symbol of the Gods. Hercules sets out to the temple of Zeus and upon learning his heritage and that he must prove himself a hero to regain his lost Godhood gets the help of burnt out trainer of heroes Philoctetes ""Phil"" (Danny DeVito) to become a hero. However unbeknownst to Hercules, Hades plan is moving towards execution with the reluctant help of Megara (Susan Egan) who Hercules falls in love with.1997's Hercules was the 25th Disney Animated feature released and yet another entry into the Disney Renaissance and loosely (very loosely) based on the Greek Myth of Hercules. Salvaged from a rejected pitch involving a comedic take on Homer's The Odyssey, animator Joe Haidar suggested reframing the focus to Hercules. Little Mermaid and Aladdin helmers Ron Clements and John Musker having unsuccessfully tried to greenlight their passion project of Treasure Island in Space (which would eventually become Treasure Planet) since the 80s were rejected once more by chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg despite the duo's success critically and commercially with Aladdin and the two turned down the opportunity to adapt Edgar Rice Burrough's A Princess of Mars. Katzenberg eventually struck a deal with Clements and Musker that if the two were to produce another ""commercially viable film"" he'd greenlight Treasure Planet and the two accepted the Hercules project out of other possibilities such as Don Quixote, The Odyssey, and Around the World in Eighty Days. The film's often considered one of the lesser films of the Disney Renaissance that while enjoyable didn't really tap into the level of cultural consciousness the same way films like Aladdin, Lion King, or Beauty and the Beast had. While Hercules may be slight, it is enjoyable and amusing.The movie takes a more exaggerated style this time around in comparison to the previous efforts of the studio with Hercules boasting a lighter more comic tone and also having cartoonist Gerald Scarfe as production/character designer. Hercules undeniably looks unlike most of the other Disney Renaissance films and if you were to show stills from Hercules alongside other stills from Disney Renaissance films of the era I'd wager most people would be able to identify this film strictly on art style alone. The movie thematically is more or less an expansion of Aladdin but with pretty much every character acting and animated as if they were The Genie. Much like Robin Williams' genie that boasted anachronisms and pop culture references at 60 miles per minute, Hercules has the Genie's DNA baked into other characters, set design, and even its core narrative which also deals with similar themes of the true core beneath the veneer. The movie's a very strange mixture of the Christopher Reeve Superman films, Sylvester Stallone's Rocky, and the 90s idolization of Michael Jordan and its pretty blatant about it with analogues for Brando's Jor-El, Burgess Meredith's Mickey, and the ""Air-Herc"" product placement and it ends up making this movie not just a weird mash-up of two iconic 70s films but also a weird time capsule of the 90s.There's a number of things I think do work in Hercules such as the animation while weird is still stylish and energized, and the voice performances from Tate Donovan as Hercules, Danny DeVito as Phil, and Rp Torn as Zeus have some great moments, but it's James Woods as Hades whose slick fast talking manipulator that periodically bursts into fits of (literally) explosive rage makes him not only intimidating but very funny as a villain and while not the best Disney villain he's certainly one of the funniest and most memorable. The movie isn't really as character based as prior Disney animated films and it's presented as more of a screwball comedy with a romantic subplot with Megara and I think that's probably why the movie didn't really endear itself to the same level other films from this era of Disney did. Even during the climax featuring Earth shattering stakes, it's still trying to be humorous and even a death scene doesn't carry the weight it should because the animation style and tone doesn't lend itself to drama as well as comedy. The music is one of the more middling aspects of the film. ""Go the Distance"" and ""I Won't Say (I'm in Love)"" are memorable if just okay, but most of the music in a strange creative choice is done in the form of Black Gospel and while it's a fine style on its own, the fact these songs are done by non-characters (the muses) talking about things we really should've seen makes them feel interchangeable and also very similar to each other so they just kind of blend together.Hercules is a bit of a mess as a movie and it's ironic that Katzenberg's desire to make a film of as much commercial viability as possible lead to one of the lower grossing films of this era of Disney. It didn't bomb or anything making $250 million against its $85 million budget, but considering that was down a good $100 million from the controversial Hunchback of Notre Dame not great all things considered. I do revisit Hercules on occasion but If I were to rank top 10 or 20 Disney animated films I'm not confidant this would even place.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not one of the best Disney movies, but...","Far form being one of my favorites Disney movies (and one of the best ones at all), I believe it's a nice movie, where humor, serious moments and Disney's main themes (friendship, love, loyalty,) are mixed up well, even if it has nothing to do with the original myth (but this doesn't ruin the film at all). However, the real reason I like this movie is Hades, a perfect villain in my own opinion: evil but also very funny, especially when he argues with Pain and Panic, his two followers. As for the soundtrack (which is really an important part of Disney productions), I have to say that it's not the best one I know: if you take other movies, such as ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" you will find better songs.

Entertaining but problematic movie,"It's only an animated movie, I keep telling myself.It isn't supposed to be accurate.And that is ultimately what prevents me from offering a higher rating. The movie deviates from the source material so very, very much it's too hard to ignore.On the positive side, the movie is okay extremely enjoyable, fun, and humorous. The songs are well done and, even better, well placed. James Wood absolutely steals the show in places as Hades, far more than the great Danny DeVito's little satyr. The story is entertaining and well paced.But it doesn't sit right if you know the stories of Heracles (the Greek) and Greek mythology generally.There are nice touches - including Megara, five of the nine muses, and so forth. But in the end the divergent elements are just annoying.Lots of others have created lists of these elsewhere but it's a good exercise to try and pick them out yourself.

OK Disney animated feature...,"1st watched 3/28/2009 ‚Äì 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Musker & Ron Clements): OK Disney animated feature about the son of the great Zeus and his silly adventures. This a kind of wannabe A-list Disney movie with it's attempts at songs, sidekicks and silly romances but it just doesn't quite hit the mark despite James Woods doing a good job with the Hades role. The movie is about the birth of the young boy to Zeus and his wife, his loss of his godly position at the hands of Hades, and his attempt to become a mortal hero to win back his spot with the other Gods at Olympus. His road to hero-dom isn't easy as he's a pretty clumsy goof at first, but he's given a hero trainer voiced by Danny Devito who's kind of a short devil-like character(why he trained hero's I don't know??). He becomes a hero but supposedly still misses the heart necessary to get back to Olympia. This is gained, of course, because he goes googly-eyed over a women who is one of Hades's helpers and does stuff to get her out of his clutches(yeah I know, this doesn't make sense but it's Disney not Shakespeare). The movie is narrated by a 60's like Gospel group, who end every song with ""the gospel truth."" I'm sure this didn't make the religious right very happy about this movie(but they never really made movies for them anyway‚Äîbut don't tell 'em).

"Good, but not well-researched","I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology, so even though I really liked this movie, I couldn't stop knit-picking all the little details that Disney screwed up. Here's just a short list:1) Hercules wasn't Hera's son.  In fact, she hated him!2) Amphitryon, Hercules's foster dad, wasn't alive.  Zeus came to Alcmene in the form of her dead husband's spirit.3) Hercules wasn't a god.  He was the son of a god (Zeus) and a mortal (Alcmene), making him a demigod. However, he did gain access to Mt. Olympus following his death.4) The titans were not the monsters depicted in the movie.  They were the Gods before the Greek Gods came on the scene, though it was after Zeus came along that they lost most of their power and got smaller jobs.5) Hades was never `sentenced' to be the God of the Underworld; he asked for the job.  Zeus even tried to persuade him not to do it.6) Hercules never rode Pegasus; that's a totally different legend.OK, I'll admit that I'm anal-retentive about the facts, but honestly, I really did like the movie.  James Woods was hilarious as Hades (I couldn't stop laughing, he obviously had a lot of fun doing his lines), and Megara has got to be my favorite Disney heroine ever.  This is definitely a movie for all ages; as long as you can get the Greek mythology fans to shut up for five seconds, you'll enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Very interesting, but with script failures.","This film tells the story of Hercules, a bastard son of the Greek god Zeus, whom immortality is stolen and, therefore, is given to humans to be created, becoming a hero thanks to his impressive strength. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who also ensure the writing of the script, the film has excellent designs, a good cast of voice actors and musical pieces by Alan Menken.Despite all the efforts in merchandising, this movie is not the best that Disney has presented. First, the script is nothing more than an adaptation, too free and imaginative, of a classic legend, much publicized in mythology. The film does not tell the whole tale, preferring to create a new story with some of the elements found in myth, ignoring everything that does not fit the intention of making a film for children. One of the most interesting and comical characters is Phil, a chubby faun who becomes coach and friend of Hercules. At times, he steals the attention of the Greek hero. The way the film puts the nine Muses (as Soul singers and narrators of the story) does not convinced nor pleased. More interesting was Meg, a character who exemplifies the way the ancient Greeks regarded the woman, a beautiful thing, but bad and that could be dangerous.In any case, this film is still good, deserve to be seen and appreciated for what it is",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Aesthetically amazing, great songs, good story","This movies is probably one the LEAST boring Disney movies. It is just so much fun. I love the character designs so much. The voice actors compliment these designs so well too. I wouldn't say it is Disney's funniest film, but it does have some great laughs. I do sometimes feel like they might try a little to hard for laughs though. Some of thee jokes just aren't that good sometimes. This also might just be a me thing, but I really don't like Phil. He kinda just annoys me sometimes. Some of his jokes aren't good, his song isn't my favorite, but they did put some emotion in his story that I do enjoy. But all of the other characters are just great. I love Meg. She is just so sassy and well designed. I love her song and her romance with Hercules. And do I even need to tell you that Hades is great. He is probably the funniest character in this movie. His line deliveries are amazing, his design is genius, and all of his comedic energy can also turn into him being actually threatening and menacing. The main song also just slaps. I love it's emotional weight and beauty. The plot is kinda unfocused sometimes though. I also don't really like how modern it can feel.

Fun,"This is the first Disney animated piece(save for that one segment of Fantasia... and yeah, they are pretty darn similar, in some ways) to be inspired by mythology, not fairy tale. As usual, liberties are taken, and history buffs may want to abstain from intake of liquids during their viewing, so as to prevent spit-takes. It is a fun film, however. Woods clearly has fun with the part, as confirmed by the Trivia page, and any moment his character is on-screen is enjoyable(which is not to say that the rest isn't). DeVito more or less plays himself, but his self ain't bad. Torn is marvelous. Goldthwait is not bad at all. The plot is good, as is the moral to the film. The pacing is great. The visual style is fitting, characters reminiscing the depictions from the time. The animation is well-done, and both it, and the design, hold plenty of energy and creativity. The 3D elements are nicely done, and the use of color is effective. Dialog is well-done. Characters are, as well. Music choices are... interesting, in some cases. There are some well-integrated references here and there, herein, for us fans of mythology(the Greek of it, mind you). Comedy leans towards the positive(what exactly *is* with all the Jewish stuff, though? Not that I mind, mind you). The DVD has some good special features, including two videos(in addition to a short making of), one consisting of artwork, the other of clips, as the actual myths, in reasonable detail, are explained.

adventure scores:  romance fails,"In general I liked Hercules, and don't mind repeat viewings.  As with all Disney fare, the animation is terrific.  This film worked better for me than the pointless Pocahantas, Tarzan, or utterly forgettable Hunchback of Notre Dame.  It's a shade below Mulan.  One thing it doesn't have is a memorable score, but the tunes are catchy enough.  There's nothing as good as 'colors of the wind' from Pocahantas, though.The approach is fresh and interesting - recasting the story of Hercules as if he was a modern day sports hero with his own 'Air-Herc' sandals and 'Herculade' soft-drink.  The Greek Chorus, a Dreamgirl-style lineup who move the plot along, was a wonderful touch.  Tate Donovan is effective, earnest and yet naive as Hercules.  James Wood's Hades is one of the best performances in any Disney film since Robin Williams as the genie in Aladdin and Robby Benson as the Beast in Beauty & The Beast.  He adds to every scene and is a terrific villain.  Kudos also to the animators of Pegasus - without being annoying he manages to be expressive, funny, and a terrific sidekick. They must have had a lot of fun doing him.The film does have quite a few failings, however.  The primary one is the romance between Megara and Herc.  It never felt real - there was no chemistry there.  I know it sounds strange for a cartoon, but she seemed to worldly, sarcastic and disinterested, they seemed to have nothing in common, and there was no moment when you could see their attraction unfolding. She isn't DRAWN that attractively either - a little shrewish and peckish. Without buying the romance, it felt like all of the moments involving that romance were simply plot points to move the film along.  And since the romance is central to the motivations of the characters and the movement of the plot, this is a major failing.  One scene emphasizes this:  Hercules runs off to spend the day with Megara, and instead of seeing their romance blossom, we get the old trick of the writer-who-doesn't-know-how-to-create-chemistry: a quick flash to a scene later in the evening when they talk about what a great time they had together.  Hey guys, Show Me Don't Tell Me.A second beef is Danny DeVito's Philoctetes.  It's not that the character is bad or badly done, it's just that the animators made the character LOOK like Danny DeVito.  I don't need clues like those - I can already hear his unmistakeable voice.  Animation lets you do anything - it's a major failing in imagination when you make the character look like the actor who voices him.  Then they did it again for Paul Shaffer's Hermes.The film doesn't follow the mythology of Hercules at all.  If you're a Greek or remember the tales, you will either be confused or annoyed.  Astute scholars of the myths will recognize that they have basically taken elements from almost all of the best known Greek myths and woven them around a concocted plot involving Hades freeing the Titans so he can rule on Olympus. Even Hercules' own origins are rewritten for the film.  In the original, he was the child of Alcmene, a Greek woman, and Zeus, who had lain with Alcmene.  Here he is the son of Zeus and Hera, stolen and turned mortal by Hades' magic potion.  If Hades has this potion, and hates Zeus so much, then why doesn't he trick Zeus into drinking the damn thing, and leave the baby alone.As expected with any Hollywood film about the Greek myths, a flying horse named Pegasus is involved.  In the original, Hercules never dealt with Pegasus.  Pegasus was the steed of Bellerophon.  As mentioned above, I'm glad Pegasus is in this one.  But if you want a more loyal version, the Kevin Sorbo series with Hera as the enemy is more on the mark (but not completely).I give it a seven out of ten.  It gets tens for Woods, Pegasus, the training montages with Phil and Herc, and the fights with monsters. It gets a 3 for the romance.  Add another point for the animation and divide by two.",,Anonymous,Animation

Pretty damned good - but there is this ONE problem ...,"The Ancient Greeks and Romans were twisting the Hercules legend out of shape long before Disney got hold of it.  So I'll skip the usual complaints about Hercules being Hera's son, there being a demon named `Panic' and so on.  I can understand people objecting on these grounds; I think such objections are often justified, but misguided in this particular case; but there are arguments on both sides I would need to present if I were to discuss the case here - and so I won't.  Let me just stipulate that fiddling around with classical mythology does not, in this case, matter.  If you disagree - well, you disagree.Alan Menken's music is hugely disappointing.  So is Musker and Clement's handling of it - they once showed a great flair for staging songs, but here they seem, for the most part, uncertain as to how to work the material in. (A notable exception is `One Last Hope'.)  On the plus side, animation has never been better.    Disney hasn't had a villain so well animated since 1967, possibly 1961.  (Look up the relevant villains, if you want.) Computer-rendering the hydra was I think a mistake, as computer rendering usually is, but that was a good scene, so I'll waive the objection.  -Oh, yes: I should also put in a word for the general look imparted by Gerald Scarfe.The story, really, was a strong one.  I have to say `really' because it's easy to come away with the impression that it was not, because of one tiny element: the big battle at the end.  Hercules defeated the bad guys with ludicrous ease in a weak and perfunctory scene - it lasts just seconds. This is a serious problem in the work of Musker and Clements.  If you look at `The Little Mermaid', `Aladdin' and `Hercules' you'll note that they all have a ridiculously large-scale set piece at the end which tends to prompt the reaction, `Yeah, yeah.'  They'll HAVE to do something about this.  For the story, was, as I say - look at it objectively and ignore the concluding battle - strong.  And AFTER the battle, when Hercules ...  Let's just say I found this smaller drama to be much more exciting, and certainly more creative.So it wasn't quite what it could have been.  Nonetheless I predict that `Hercules' will wear its years lightly; already, it is looking stronger, more muscular, and more likely to be immortal, than `Aladdin' ever did.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is fun.,"Genre: Based on Greek myths, animation, relationships.Actors: Famous ones are Danny DeVito (Phil) and James Woods (Hades).Main characters: Hercules, Zeus, Meg and Hades.What happens: Hercules is the son of the ALL POWERFUL Greek God Zeus. The day Hercules is born, he is captured and made mortal (only three of the characters know how this happens). Someone makes Hercules mortal and then he is adopted by mortal humans. This is only the beginningMessage: That you are a hero if you love as well as fight.My thoughts: I like this film. I think it has more of a potential of being liked to a 8-11 aged audience, as I liked it more than I do now at that age. I still like it because it is very fun, the animation is different, a little weird, but quite good! I also still like the characters, especially Meg and Phil and Hades is funny and I like funny baddies in Disney films. Of course I like all the good Greek Gods, they are somehow potentially likable. I used to like Pain and Panic (Hades's servants) a lot when I was younger, but I'm starting to like them less now because I'm growing up and they are growing a little too silly for my liking. Also this film has a good share of slapstick AND wit in it for my entertainment. I also really like the songs, especially ""Go The Distance"" and ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" or whatever it's called. My favourite character is Phil because I like his personality and he also looks kind of cute when he's excited and happy when to most people he's supposed to be quite UGLY (but I don't agree with that).

Skippable,"When I think about Disney films, Hercules doesn't come to my mind right away. Hercules is the one odd guy among the memorable classics of 90's Disney movies. I'm not really sure why, I mean, the film made well over 100 million USD and I saw it as a kid. Maybe it just misses that one feeling of nostalgia.There are things in Hercules that I like though; it has witty humor, the characters are imaginative and the animation is... well, something you could imagine for a 90's Disney classic (by that I mean amazing). Megara also serves as a great female lead alongside to the developing character of Hercules.I didn't really enjoy the long singing prologues sung by the muses, but I still think it was a better choice than some narrator telling about the Greek mythology for minutes. Otherwise, I think everything's just decent and good in this movie.Hercules is a great movie I'd love to love more. It just misses the unforgettable charm that makes it a classic for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great flick!,"I loved Hercules and not just cause my son did a voice in it (Kellen Hathaway.. little boy) it was fun, fast and bright! I loved the Muses and Meg.. and well Tate Donovan is hot!!! I thought using Charleston Heston as the narrator was brilliant, James Woods rocked as Hades and Danny DeVito couldn't have been better! The animation was great.. best Disney has put together in quite a while! I think that it was better than Little Mermaid musically and tho robin williams was a hoot as the genie in aladin I enjoyed Hercules all around much better. I smiled as the muses sang and laughed at Hades. Its a wonderful movie all around recommended to all!",,Anonymous,Animation
Unique visuals and a great villain steal the show.,"I must say that after watching this childhood time-stealer, I found it a little underdeveloped. Hades and his sidekicks pain and panic have become more entertaining over the years while Hercules, Zeus and Megara have worn out a little. Mostly Herc whose conflict is as generic as can be.The visual style is unique to put it neutrally. I personally think it is the ugliest of the Disney renaissance era, but that's not the main problem with this movie. Its uninteresting characters are the problem as I stated in the beginning. Hades makes this movie worth watching and he gets a laugh out of me every time he is on screen and that is great.Despite its problems it has spawned one of my favorite Disney songs, though. ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" is a really catchy tune and along with ""Go The Distance"" the most memorable songs in the movie.Maybe Hercules' unique visual style and the standout performance of James Woods as Hades serves in its favor to make it memorable. Just the weirdness of it in general.One of my least favorite movies from the Disney renaissance, but I can appreciate its existence.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Work of Heart,"I didn't know if there would be a Disney movie better than ""The Lion King"" and then we re-watched Hercules. This movie is brilliant and textbook storytelling.Every single character has clear motivations. What does Herc want? What does Phil want? Hades? Etc. There is no question why each individual acts a certain way because their motives are laid out.At 93 minutes, this movie is the perfect length for the story being told. The story beats are paced precisely with every twist and turn happening at just the right time.This is a Top 3 Disney soundtrack, with ""Go The Distance"" being the best Disney song ever written. I used to think that ""A Whole New World"" was that song, but I was wrong. ""Go the Distance"" is the GOAT.Ultimately, ""Hercules"" is a work of art and (no joke) should be used in film school to teach how to construct a screenplay.Best Character: Hercules (specifically young Herc)
Best Quote: ""A true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart."" - Zeus
Best Scene: Herc starting his journey.Best Song: ""Go the Distance""Note: Rhyming ""Impossible"" with ""Gospel"" is so smooth. It was the ""Sky's the limit"" and ""Eliza's in it"" of the 90's.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hercules movie, saved by Hades","It's absolutely criminal that Hades (James Wood), by a large margin the best part of the flick, has so little screen time. Every single one of his interventions and lines was either funny, great (or both). The character's design is strange, but it couldn't be better for this interpretation of Hades. The final act (in which one he participates a lot) is really good and completes a simplistic theme/message in the movie. With all of this, the movie gets a pass as a good film, even if not Disney's best.From the rest, there is little to nothing to praise. The animation and designs are questionable, the score and songs, poor. The voice actors, boring. The jokes, ok at best. The story basic and unremarkable. There is one line ""being famous is not the same as being heroic"" that sounds like social commentary (how we are obsessed with being famous/successful while the best thing is being heroic/morally better), but is not supported in the rest of script, so I'm not convinced it is more than a good line and nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The best of Disney's worst,"First, if you're a mythology fan forget everything you know and just enjoy the story.  Secondly, if you're an animation buff...give up now.  SIGH The story is nice.  The acting, adequate.  The music, fun.  But the film stands as an example of Disney's decline in animation quality.  It is one of the first crossings of animation and computer animations from Disney the latter standing so far out in superiority from the already bad artwork that it makes the rest of the imagery look out of place.  Disney films since have only refined on this ludicrous art of crossing breath-taking imagery with almost lampoonish artwork.It is clear that the artist's intent was to produce a film which attempted to reproduce and modernize the ancient Greecian style seen on ""vahzes"" (GRIN), frescoes, etc.,  This would have worked had they not chose to cross this with a pseudo-realistic computer generated hydra which almost looks like something from a sci-fi flick.  Briefly we witness, ""Hercules Meets The Hydra From Mars.""Furthermore, if you're of a Paganistic path you might be offended by the interpretations of the Olympians which look completely ridiculous and exaggerated.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One person's myth is another person's miracle...,"In the grand Disney tradition of making free with literature and history to create an irresistibly entertaining movie experience, we have the lively ""Hercules"". Rendering the Olympian pantheon in rainbow hues is certain to please children, where austere white draperies and beige complexions have long been the norm onscreen. The whole is set in modern terms easily absorbed by the contemporary American audience-- it's fun!One hopes that the younger set might be inspired to investigate the real mythology as recorded, and not assume they'd been adequately instructed in the subject by this highly revised version. Of course 'real' is relative, since any mythology deals with miraculous events that are not supported by the historic record. A good deal of Judeo-Christian biblical text falls under this designation; it must be taken on faith. But Judeo-Christian scriptures belong to active religions, and thus the events described are literally sacred. The religion of the ancient Greeks cannot be described as active, and thus is fair game for irreverent revisions that will offend very few beside Hellenist scholars.Animated and live-action films that illustrate current religions, however, must adhere to tradition. Only look at the wealth of Hindu devotional films, visualized scriptures that provide ample evidence of the present-day believer's faith in the miraculous. Animated versions make these treasured tales of the gods more accessible to children. This is a living religion, with about a billion followers worldwide, and the third largest faith today.But a 'dead' religion has virtually no one to protect its integrity, and so its miracles become myths, and its myths become infinitely flexible.I suppose it's best for the tender sensibilities of children to present Zeus as a nice monogamous papa-god, whose only son was borne by his wife Hera. Later on his many outrageous infidelities, committed in various interesting disguises, can be revealed. They're certainly entertaining! And so is the Disney ""Hercules"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Get real, people!","Wow. What a spiteful bunch of comments to read. There is WAY TOO MUCH hate in this world, eh? This movie is one of the few i clearly and joyfully remember as a childhood favorite. I even remember i had a computer game with Herc that i absolutely loved. So, watched it again today (thats a HUGE time gap), no intentions, random selection. I was less impressed, of course, the magic feeling i had then could not be repeated, but i still enjoyed it a lot. From today's point of view, the aesthetics are almost worthless, but i don't see why such a thing should cloud the viewer's judgment. The world has changed!As a kid who grew up with this particular movie and all of other Disneys adaptations, i am here to say WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS ENCHANTED WITH THIS MOVIE. So were all of the other kids i knew. Therefore, all of the 'concerned parents' commenting here, i can't believe you. People like YOU will find something treatening and offensive in anything! The world was such a better place when parents in general weren't paranoid freaks! No wonder your kids don't enjoy it today, they are used to all the modern crap the media feeds them.It is true that the facts aren't true. But who really cares? It is for children, right? For me, this was just enough to make me fall in love with Greek myths, and learn as much as i can about them as i grew up. That was the point. Everyone who wants to know the real story, can look up for it. This is a positive distortion of it, and it is the best way to present things in a kid's mind. You got the villain, the hero, the pretty girl, the helpers. You can't give children complex drama and bloody plot twists....i mean really?!I really don't think that this movie deserves all of this negative criticsm. A) It is FOR KIDS. Sc**w the facts, if they are a bit too much! B) We, the kids of that era, LOVED it. C) You cannot make a parallel between technology now and the one used 10+ ago.

"Among the best  ""classical"" Disney","A few years before the computer days, Disney sang the swan's song with Hercules. Although loosely based on Greek mythology (in which Hercules is Zeus' illegitimate son with a human, which obviously had to be surgically removed), and while the story of Hercules 12 Tasks is far from respected, the Disney studios managed to deliver a funny and entertaining adaptation of the myth.Most importantly, songs and musical bits are really good, especially the opening sequence with Charlton Heston's voice and the muses, the duet Meg / the muses and guess what ""Zero to Hero"" sung by... the muses.What I also liked very much are the second level humour (spot the spice girls if you can), such as ""Air-cules"" ads and references to Greek myths in general.This double-level reading makes it a nice and entertaining cartoon for kids and grown-ups. Even more enjoyable now these paper and celluloid days are over.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
All rubbish,"This animation is a big mockery of great Greek mythology. Even when I was about 10 years old, seems I knew about Greek mythology A LOT more than creators of this film. Almost every fact they give us is fake. Like - Musas were nine, not five, none of them was fat, Hercules died BEFORE Achilles, his mother was HUMAN woman, not god, so he born Human, not God and etc and etc without ending. They could have spent at least a weak reading Greek mythology before creating this rubbish. At least if they had added True ending of this myth - when Megera killed Hercules with poison - it would have been at least little bit more interesting, but now... I believe it was possible to create story, which one was not far away from myth and would be as interesting as this one had to be.

"Somewhat flawed and superfluous, but still has that Disney spark of magic","Disney's Hercules is an odd mix of elements. It takes Ancient Greek mythology, completely twists it around while still retaining enough to keep it recognizable, adds painfully bright pastel colour palette, throws in some CGI and simpering sidekicks, and crowns it all off with a soundtrack that takes all of its inspiration from American gospel music. Interesting choices, if nothing else.Now, some of that I'm completely okay with. I don't really care that there are only five muses, instead of nine like there are in the original mythology. I don't think nine would have been too much, seeing that they're usually the ones singing and gospel music is well-equipped to large crowds singing it, but it's okay. Though it is a bit strange that they dropped Euterpe, the muse of song and music (and elegiac poetry), from the lineup. The use of CGI is also a bit jarring nowadays, because it hasn't aged that well, but I can see that they wanted to experiment with a new technology. Disney has always done that, though usually with better results. What is a bit harder for me to understand is the fact that they made Hades the villain instead of Hera, who was Hercules's main nemesis in the original myths, seeing as she was jealous that her husband Zeus had slept with a mortal woman, siring Hercules in the process. Or Heracles, as he should be called, because this is the Greek version of the myth. Then again, Disney is all about family values, so it's not that surprising. And James Woods does brilliant as the voice actor of Hades.What really keeps me from liking this film more is the main hero, unfortunately. Hercules just isn't all that interesting of a guy, especially when compared to the ones that came just before him. Simba, Belle, Aladdin, Quasimodo, all of these deep, tragic main characters. And yeah, Hercules has his problems, but he still comes across as that perfect high school jock. You know, the nice one, who could have starred in any breakfast cereal commercial he wanted, was the homecoming king, went on to have a successful career in sports, founded a perfect family and died at the age of one hundred, surrounded by grandkids. You have nothing against the guy, but you're also not really all that interested in the details of his life.Then again, Megara is great, Hades is excellent, Zeus is enjoyably over the top and boisterous, Phil and Pegasus are alright and the rest of the cast do their jobs. The animation is also very nice, though personally I'm not a fan of the colour palette, but that's a pet peeve of mine and not a fault of the film in any way. And while the songs and the music style are not outright classics like so many other Disney soundtracks of the 90s, there are some decent songs in the mix. Though couldn't you have given Hades a villain song? It would have been glorious.Ultimately Hercules is one of the weaker Renaissance films, but still lands somewhere in the middle as far as the overall quality of Disney films is to be considered. It has its flaws, but is still an enjoyable experience for kids and adults alike. Give it a try if you haven't already.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Gods and Monsters: HERCULES is one of Disney's funniest.,"My Take: The typical masterpiece Disney is capable of. Pure magic!The gods must be funny in this hilarious animated smash from the ever-talented animation artists at Disney. HERCULES, which was released after the studio dared to venture into darker territory with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, returns to the kind of light, fun-loving musical adventure. Despite being a magnificent instant classic of its own, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME proved to be too dark for the usual Disney routine. If that case so, HERCULES is a good throwback to the days of ALADDIN and THE LITTLE MERMAID. It may just be their funniest yet.The movie is a twist on the tales of Greek Mythology, namely the story of the title character (voiced by Tate Donovan), who happens to be the son of the great god Zeus (voiced by Rip Torn) who is robbed of his godly powers and turned mortal... sort of by the evil Lord Hades (voiced with maniacal glee by James Woods). Unfortunate for the hot-headed, comical Lord of the Underworld, Hercules maintained his god-like strength, making him look like a freak in the eyes of everyone else. So young ""Herc"" set on a voyage to find his true identity and reclaim his destiny as a god on Mount Olympus. Aiding as his mentor is a tough-mouthed satyr named Phil (voiced by Danny DeVito) and his magical bird-brained Pegasus, while also tempted by a lovely maiden named Meg (voiced by Susan Egan), short for Megara, who may just have a weakness for his ""Wonder Boy""'s charms.The magic of Disney's timeless animation is still stirring and imaginative, but the voice cast have never been more appropriate. James Woods was born to play the villain Hades. He basically steals the scenes he's in, if not the whole movie. He may be the bad guy, but you'll like hims so much, he's good! Other than Woods is Danny DeVito, who imbues his familiar voice and personality to his character Phil and comes up with a character that even adults will love. Then there are the lovely singing muses, who tells the series of events through winning musical numbers (reminiscent to the Greek Chorus from LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS). The songs by the way are written none other than brilliant lyricist Alan Menken (ALADDIN), here whipping yet another magnificent strain of brilliant songs. Mythology fans, film fans and musical fans rejoice! Here's the gods to deliver all your requests. Gather the family together!Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I like the cast, but that's honestly about it","The definition of a meh film, at least for me.'Hercules' doesn't stick a connection, I felt very unfulfilled throughout. I have little negatives, yet there isn't much the other way either. I like the cast, but that's honestly about it.James Woods, Danny DeVito and Rip Torn all give noteworthy performances in the roles of Hades, Phil and Zeus. However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.Bart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments. The animation is actually OK, satisfactory for sure.I can see this is very well rated by others, which I respect. For me, though, it isn't any good.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney goes Greek,Hercules has never been considered one of Disney's best efforts but it is well worth adding to your collection as it is a fun and entertaining film that combines some basic Greek mythology with good story telling and the music of Alan Menken.The voice actors bring a particular spark to the film and this so often is what makes or breaks a Disney film.

A classic Disney animaited movie,"If there's a recipe of how to make a great animation movie that adults and kids can have fun from it, Hercules would be one of the best representative for this recipe.
It's a really good movie and everyone can enjoy it.For me the main theme of the movie was finding home, as the movie journey was how to back home after he cursed living with the people.
Also there's a lot of sub themes like (Good vs. Evil) and our villain was great and he was a terrifying villain unlike the villains of other Disney movies such as (Frozen,Beauty and the beast,Zootopia) as their villains were not a big threat for our main character.
And of course there was the theme of love.I got the superhero movies vibes in the second act as Hercules is a kind of a superhero.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just pretty decent, and an enjoyable enough watch. It didn't really resonate with me, it wasn't something I loved, it was just a fun watch to pass the time.While this doesn't necessarily affect my review score, I did find that this movie abridged or left out a lot of events in Greek mythology to fit with the pacing.

In 20 years this film will seem 40 years old.,"Technically, and given the financial constraints of modern animation, this is a good movie.  Of course the Disney people fiddled with the story line and the character names, but name me the last Disney film that stayed ""true"" to its origins.Production values were up to Disney standards (which means a lot), and the story is guaranteed not to offend anyone's sense of PC.  You can feel safe tossing this into the VCR and plunking the kids in front of it for a hour or so.  They'll enjoy it, even if they miss a lot of the ""adult""-level humor.My biggest gripe is with the topical references.  Sure, we get the humor of ""Air Herc"" sandals and the other merchandising tie-ins (""Herculade"" and the action figures) NOW, but what happens ten years down the line?  I mean, Michael Jordan is already retired; will there even BE ""Air Jordans"" then? The same goes for the cynical ""Hades"" character.  This kind of humor is trendy and hip NOW, but I'm afraid it just hasn't got the legs to ""go the distance"".And that's the problem with films that depend on references to current events, stars, situations, or product placement.  They come off looking like a polyester leisure suit -- great in its day, but ridiculous if not downright incomprehensible after the fad has passed.  As proof, check out the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" video tapes.  Unless you were there in the 60s, a lot of the inside jokes (like the ""Kirwood Derby"") are missed.  And how about the ""PanAm"" logo on the spacecraft in ""2001""?My rating?  Two stars out of five, for now; and probably dropping to 1-and-a-half within five years.",,Anonymous,Animation
"""I'm a big though girl, I tie my own sandals and everything""","Is ""Herakles"" one of Disney's most underrated movies?

And not only does the straightforward Superman story while receiving enough surprising twists to remain interesting, it also gives us Meg with an ""innocent boy and the savvy female"" romance plot.She's a breath of fresh air! Joining the more mature Esmeralda and Pocahontas. By being the woman sent to do a woman's job. A more complex romance, that isn't particularly smooth and ends up feeling deserved from all sides. As only someone good can see the goodness of others.. a Heroine, not a Princess. Broken and cynical, and beyond charming with that voice of hers (Susan Egan is a dish and a doll)!

Excellant But Wrong,"I'm a big fan of Mythology Movies, even cartoon versions, and Disney has made some very wonderful movies, but this movie gets one thing wrong after another. Hercules's mother was Alcmene, not Hera, and his main antagonist for his whole life was Hera not Hades. There were also seven Muses, not five. Philoctetes was the son of his best friend, Poeas, one of the Argonauts whose boat the Argo is shown in peices thirty years too early. Phil, the goat man, though, may be a substitute for Chiron the centaur, but he mentions Odysseus and Achilles (not born yet) and Perseus, Hercules' great grandfather. Theseus, though, is a contemporary. Hercules never rode Pegasus (neither did Perseus fot that matter). There is a scene with a Gorgon, the only creature Hercules never killed.The likenesses of Hermes and Ares are rather insulting, but several of the others are rather splendid and augmented by various voices if but colored rather egregiously (only the Hindu gods had a significantly colored pantheon). Meg was the daughter of King Creon of Thebes, not a lackey of Hades, but she is a part of Hercules' history as his first wife. She was probably placed in the script to avoid parallels with the Legendary Journeys TV series.Depicted as if Teri Hatcher would play her in a live action version, she is one of the truly wonderful characters in the film behind Zeus, Hades and Hercules. Pain and Panic are unnecessary if not inserted for the comic relief and two extra Happy Meal toys.

James Woods is the standout here, in the comedic role of his career.  Tate Donovan is kinda bland (like most Disney male heroes).  I wasn't that impressed by Danny DeVito doing...well, Danny DeVito.  Everyone else is competent or a bit better.There are a few plot holes: why does Zeus have trouble defeating the Titans the second time around - how'd he do it originally?  Doesn't Hades _ever_ check up on his (obviously incompetent) henchmen?  Hades seems rather...Satan-like, what with the soul-trading and deals and stuff.I thoroughly enjoyed the musical score is enjoyable throughout, though. The Muses struck me as a bit over the top (and why do they keep talking about the 'gospel' truth? - that's a Biblical reference.).  I'd rather have heard the characters sing (and shouldn't Hades have got a number?), then hear the (literal) Greek Chorus chipping in from time to time.Generally, though, it's an enjoyable flick, somewhat of a return to form for Disney after Pocahontas and Hunchback.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
More cookie cutter than should be legally possible,"Sometimes modern Disney and I don't get along. They're too musical, too hokey, and more often than not have cookie cutter formulas. Despite all this, many modern Disney movies are still quite good and have strong stories. Hercules is something different. While the characters are no more worse than usual, the story is Disney's most shallow and unsatisfying yet. It is occasionally funny, and it tries to be a comedy like Aladdin. Aladdin, however, was inspired, had a refreshing story, and was a technical marvel. Hercules just comes off as being no more than an extended Saturday morning cartoon.

Hercules,"Undoubtedly one of the better 1990s Disney films. The story and animation are very much centre stage with the music much less important - no big power ballads! It is a fun take on the Herculean mythology of ancient Greece. Beginning with a suitably grand opening narrative from Charlton Heston, no less, we learn that Hades is desperate to avenge himself on Zeus - who tricked him into ruling the underworld after he and his brothers defeated the Titans. Meantime Zeus is celebrating the birth of a baby boy. Hades decides to strike back, but his augurs (the ""Fates"" but think more ""Stygian witches"") advise that this little boy - Hercules - is the fly in the ointment who must be neutralised if his grand design is to succeed. Hades tricks him firstly into mortality and then cons him out of his great strength - but will that be enough to defeat the determination of our hero? It is a bit of a slow starter; but once it gets into the swing there are some good performances from James Woods (superb as Hades), Rip Torn (Zeus) and Danny DeVito as the long-suffering demi-god trainer ""Phil"" that keep this fantasy adventure moving along nicely. Don't expect to see any of his twelve labours...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The charming parody of the world of Greek myths,"Hercules is one of the mythological figures that has transcended over time and cinema has portrayed many of the different versions and adventures of this character. Disney has not been left behind in making its own reimagining of this Greek hero. The animated film tells a story that is different from the original myth. It is well known that the original story of Hercules is full of mature themes and tragic events. Although each film that has been made tells a different version, they all share the same epic and tragic vision that surrounds this character. The 2005 version that was directed by Roger Young is perhaps the one that clings most closely to the original myth. What Disney did was use the same formula that it uses in most of its adaptations of classic stories in order to target it at a family audience. The end result makes the animated Hercules movie a parody of the world of Greek mythology that works quite well.The differences are obvious between the myth and the movie. The origin of Hercules as a demigod is different, since in this version he was born as a pure god who, after being kidnapped, ends up being raised by Amphitryon and Alcmene. Instead of Hera being the antagonist as in the original myth, they decided to give that role to Hades. Although Hades is not a threat in the original myth, making him a villain was a success. The result was a Hades with quite a bit of personality thanks to the voice of James Woods. Having Hades occupy the antagonistic role is something that would later be used in the Percy Jackson and Clash Of The Titans sagas, although it was also used in the Saint Seiya manga. What the film narrates would be the rise of Hercules as a hero and that is easy to deduce because we are presented with Hercules as a young man who, after finishing his training, begins his journey of self-discovery as a hero. He is a rather innocent and naive young man, but with a big heart. What helps him discover his role as a hero is Megara, who has a tough story of love and disappointment. In Greek myth, Megara's marriage to Hercules ends in a tragic ending that begins the adventures and misadventures that Hercules must undertake to find redemption. So what the animated film tells is only the first part of the story and although it does not present a Megara very different from that of the myth, her participation becomes just as essential. If you think about it in a certain way, the tragedy of Megara becomes crucial in both the myth and the film.The film shows 4 of the 12 challenges that Hercules had to complete after the tragedy that occurs in the myth, but here they occur before. We see the fight against the Lernaean hydra that was executed in a wonderful way and is one of the best scenes in the film. Also included are the fight against the Erinmanthus boar, the confrontation against one of the Stymphalian birds, a minotaur that refers to the Cretan bull and the Nemean lion, but summarized in seconds. It is worth mentioning that the last confrontation between Hades and Hercules comes with a reference to the capture of Cerberus and said moment is also a reference to when Hercules had to travel to the underworld and face Hades himself to rescue the soul of Alcestis.The suspenders and the prophecy about Hercules were taken from the original myth, but told differently. The scene where Hercules meets Megara and saves her is a reimagining of one of the events of the myth when Hercules saves his second wife Deianira from the centaur Nessus and also a reference to the moment in which Hercules had to face the river god Achelous for Deianira's hand. It can be said that the animated film is a mixture of several elements of the original myth with some references and discards dark moments so that it is liked by family audiences. Although knowing the original myth, it is easy to understand some double meaning jokes that the film has. This version of Hercules is clearly not very faithful to the original myth, but it maintains that heroic symbolism for which Hercules is always remembered.Furthermore, taking into account that Disney initially wanted to make its own version of The Odyssey and The Trojan War, it is notable that there are references to other Greek myths in the film. Phil's lair has many objects that make references to other myths such as Jason And The Argonauts, The Labyrinth Of The Minotaur, Perseus vs. Medusa or Achilles of Troy. Hercules' companion Pegasus and the witches of Styx are clearly drawn from the myth of Perseus. There's even a brief cameo from Medusa. One of the titans is a cyclops who could clearly be Polyphemus from The Odyssey. In Thebes there is a statue of Atlas. The dialogues even have a couple of references when Hades mentions Pandora or the Trojan horse and when Hercules says that Megara is more beautiful than Aphrodite, referring to Andromeda in the myth of Perseus. All these references and the level of comedy applied make this film work as a parody of the world of Greek myths. That was something that, at the time of the film's release, was not well accepted by the inhabitants of Greece. A very similar case with the animated film Mulan that was not well received in China.Despite the changes, Hercules is an animated film that maintains a certain charm and that at least served to introduce younger people to this figure. It is a film that manages to remain intact and remains enjoyable thanks to its animation, humor, endearing characters and soundtrack. It is thanks to this that Hercules remains a beloved and unforgettable animated film. It is one of those adaptations that manage to be good films without the need to be as faithful to the source material as Stanley Kubrick's The Shinning or Jim Henson's The Witches. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Despite the flaws...,"Hercules is a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.  It has some groundbreaking animation (for its time), absolutely lovable characters, hilarious tie-ins with other movies, and great hidden meanings and wisecracks.First of all, I would like to say that Pegasus is a rare character, one of the best ever designed by Disney.  He is such a unique, funny, and playful character that one almost wishes he is real.  He truly brings the movie to life, for without him it would have been pretty dull.The animation I mentioned was the lighting effects.  This, I believe, was one of Disney's first true accomplishments in lighting effects, especially with the characters.  They can have normal, somewhat bright faces of a mortal, the shining aura of light that represents a god, and the pale skin of death.The characters are what one will remember after seeing this movie.  It is too hard to dislike the villain (""I must have gotten some brimstone in my ear""), his cronies Pain and Panic perform great comic antics (""Yeah, get the goods, sister!""), Pegasus has a mind of his own, Meg is sarcastically funny, and Phil is a little overbearing and too serious at times.  The whole group makes the movie.The tie-ins I mentioned are very small things.  Like, for instance, Phil has an uncanny resemblance of Aladdin's Genie.  Look at his ears, eyes, nose, and mouth.  And when Hercules is posing for the vase painter, guess whose skin he's wearing.  It's a lion, with a Scar above the eye... (He'd make a very handsome throw rug)If you watch closely, you can see some really funny stuff happening to the characters while they're talking or doing other things.  For instance, Meg and Hercules are falling in love and Meg steps back, only to be poked in the back by a statue of Cupid.  There are lots of these things that happen in the movie... just little, nearly hidden jokes that are hilarious if you find them.The action is great, and the plot is well thought out.  There are some flaws with this movie, however, and some big mistakes.  I think the Muses are the biggest mistake.  Not only are the songs on this movie low for even Disney standards (besides ""I Can Go The Distance""), one will wish the Muses were shot before they could continue singing because their songs are the ABSOLUTE WORST!  And there are some goofs, such as Hercules puts his hands into the river of death one minute, then the next he has to dive down fifteen feet to reach it.  Just little things like that.  They don't really hurt the movie.This is a great movie.  If one overlooks the flaws, it is one of Disney's best, nearly getting as high as maybe The Emperor's New Groove or Aladdin. Watch it if you get the chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's all about the Hades,"Hercules is a good Disney movie with a great villain. Hades really is the reason this film is a cut above average. There are also some memorable songs and some fun moments. I can't put my finger exactly on why this movie doesn't ascend to the Mount Olympus of Disney classics, but it's an entertaining introduction to Greek folklore, nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonder Boy Went The Distance.,"This may just be the most fun movie to rewatch in the Disney renaissance for me. Truthfully I'm a huge sucker for Greek mythology, but this movie also has my favorite ""I Want"" song, as well as my favorite Disney princess.Let's begin with the ""I Want"" song Go The Distance. The reason this is my favorite ""I Want"" song, is because of its universality. Certain songs such as I Just Can't Wait to be King. While this is an excellent song objectively, subjectively I find it very hard to relate too.And while Hercules is obviously the son of Zeus. His simple dream of wanting to be able to help others and be accepted is extremely relatable. Which is the main reason why the song is so uplifting.While Herc maybe a little too naive, he's better half begins the film as jaded. Meg is a not only a great love interest, but also a great character. Since she starts off as extremely self-serving, due to be wronged by a former lover. And forced to be in a pact with Hades.Meg exemplifies how the most interesting characters are often not the best people. However Hercules's honesty and purity was able to melt her heart of stone. And I'll never say to a listen of I Won't Say I'm In Love.This movie works on pretty much every level for me, but there is one element that has made it a favorite of mine. The element being the depiction of heroism, since children's media should strive to teach something important. Hercules shows not only how to be a noble hero, but also is a reminder that even heroes aren't perfect.",,Anonymous,Animation
Semi-good Disney about Semi-God Hercules...,"After 19 years, I have finally watched ""Hercules"". Why such a long wait? Well, let's just say in 1997, and I had other priorities in mind.See, I was 7 when ""The Little Mermaid"" was made and 12 when ""The Lion King"" came to the screens, I guess this put me in the demographic category that most benefited from Disney Renaissance. We didn't call it Renaissance back then but I remember each new Disney was an event by itself, and ""The Lion King"" was the culmination. Then came ""Pocahontas"" and at 13, I didn't think she was worth my attention; Disney princesses weren't my cup of tea anymore. At 14, I didn't care about Quasimodo's romance with Esmeralda either. Still, ""Hercules"" should have tickled my curiosity. He was obviously a character in the same vein than Aladdin: young, cool and funky and the film felt laid-back and catching¬Ö but I had more personal and bitter reasons to snub the semi-God.Number one, I studied Latin in class and naturally, Greek and Roman mythology were parts of the learning. Number two, Hercules was one of my favorite characters ever since I saw ""The Twelve Tasks of Asterix"" and I knew all of the tasks by heart, and once I got deeper on the subject thanks to Latin, I thought the journey of Hercules was the perfect material for a spoof comic. And I draw a story of Hercules in January 1997, one that combined the caricature with the real myth, I called him Hercules, but his father was Jupiter, not Zeus, the Disney film uses the Greek names, except for the hero, of course Heracles is less cool-sounding. So, I made the story and believe it or not, one of the gags involved Hercules becoming a super star and passing by a dozens of girls screaming and getting hysterical at him (a take on the then current boys band's phenomenon).And a few weeks later, I bump into an ad announcing the next Disney movie, and I see the exact picture. Seems like the God of inspiration tricked us, or made great minds think alike or maybe that it's just an unfortunate coincidence. Still, after that, I couldn't show my comic story without hearing a comment implying that I got the inspiration from Walt Disney. My hype was gone and I was angry at the film. No matter how promising and fun it was, I always felt it as the one that stole my idea. It took me years to finally watch it and now that it's done, I guess I can 'forgive' it, that the film didn't do as well as the other Disney movies prove that maybe the concept wasn't terrific enough to appeal to the masses, or maybe the film came in that period of uncertainty that transitioned between the Renaissance and Pixar era, the second half of the 90's.Face it, ""Pocahontas"" and ""Hunchback"" aren't the most talked about film when we reminisce about the nineties, and it's a shame for ""Hercules"" that it didn't even make it in the Box Office Top 10 (unlike the others). The film deserved better, it was entertaining, the hero was a cool and gentle guy who tried to blend in a society by being a hero in the 'literal' meaning of the word, his existential quest also cleverly questions what a hero is supposed to represent, is it just a bland name defining the protagonist, the source of merchandising and advertisement, or is there more that he's supposed to find out? The characters aren't undeserving, the sidekick is a satyr and an exciting coach voiced by Danny De Vito, the love interest Meg is perhaps the sexiest Disney female character, and James Woods plays a good villain, as a blue looking Hades. If his blue flame-like hair have a tendency to turn into real reddish ones when he's angry, he's as cool as ice when he handles the situation with Zeus, Meg and Hercules, well, he's James Woods.The movie plays it cool and low-key and I guess this is what allows the film to emerge as a nice little oddity with cult-like appeal, it's obviously meant to be one of these feel-good Disney films and not a heavy loaded drama with Shakespearian undertones √† la ""Lion King"", the songs are upbeat, the Greek chorus chanting the hero like the Gospel gives the film a certain edge and overall, it's enjoyable, fun and entertaining in the same spirit than most Dreamworks' movies. So maybe the best compliment to Hercules is that it was ahead of its time. Even 1997 with ""Titanic"" and ""Men in Black"" was quite a tough year to compete in.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Humor Saves It,"This is one of those movies I would never watch on my own but as a substitute teacher I keep having to sit through it in different classroom.What really jumps out at me every time is how funny this movie is. Danny DeVito is famous for being funny, but James Woods is more like a serious dramatic actor. It's amazing how funny Danny DeVito is as the trainer of heroes, but what's even more incredible is that James Woods takes a very ugly, sinister villain, Hades, and makes him really funny. His dialogue and personality made the movie for me.I also thought Samantha Egan was incredible as Meg, the bad girl who falls for Hercules in spite of herself. Was I the only one who noticed the way the writers kept referencing Robert Redford's baseball classic THE NATURAL? Meg keeps calling Hercules ""Wonderboy"" and her relationship with him is just like Memo's with Roy Hobbs. And just like Memo is controlled by sinister bookie Gus Sands, Meg is being controlled by Hades and forced to ruin Hercules against her will!The humor and romance made this a great movie for me.

Hercules - quirkyles,"I shall confess that I was disappointed when I saw ""Hercules"" first time, maybe because of the expectations, especially when it was made from the creators of ""Aladdin"". Disney had shown progression with their previous films (of the 90's) and ""Hercules"" felt rather as a throwback, a really lame one. I didn't find the film magic and engaging enough and it had some darker visual moments, while the emotional moments were too sentimental.So, ""Hercules"" was on my blacklist for a long time.After nine months I got the movie from my aunt and seeing it again I were ashamed on my self for don't liking this movie. So, in other words, you must see ""Hercules"" several times before it can really be enjoyed.""Hercules"" is one of Disney's more quirky movies and there's a huge probability that kids won't understand the irony and the parody that's going on. Although the film is funny, it's like it's tries too hard to be hilarious all the time, so it feels rather importunate at times.Which is something to make ""Hercules"" unstable as an whole. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this film several years later, but it's not on my top list. It has some great moments, but the film itself wants to go many directions; being funny, emotional, exciting, etc. But comparing to previous Disney films, this mix doesn't goes well as a whole on this film.The unstableness also transmits some of the characters: Meg is an untypical Disney heroine and quite sarcastic, but at least she goes true a struggle that is identifiable and grows as a character. The same with our hero Hercules, but I didn't really connect with him emotionally. I liked him better when he was younger, though.You can easy tell that's the directors John Musker and Ron Clements put their hands of the script, cause it has the same structure than their previous scripts (""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin""). It's not necessarily a bad thing, but you know what to expect, right?OK, enough nonsense. It seems like I still hate this movie, which I don't. My favorite characters are Zeus (who looks like King Triton in ""The Little Mermaid""), Hades, the Muses, Hermes, Phil and Pegasus. I used to think that Pain and Panic were annoying, but not anymore.Liked mentioned before, the film is funny. The animation is most of the time good looking (even it's look kinda quirky too because of the Greek influence and Gerald Scarfe style). I liked the songs performed by the Muses (the lyrics are funny) and ""Go The Distance"", which I actually hated at the beginning, but now I find it a decent song. Alan Menken's score is more quirkier and unstable than his usual score, but when he hits you with the score, he hits you really deep and wonderfully.Despite it's quirkiness, there's a lot to enjoy with ""Hercules""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing Disney movie FOR KIDS,"The music was great and. of course, the animation superb. I do not look to Disney to teach my child morals or any life lessons (Mom's on the job) but I do expect fun entertainment. This was my daughter's first movie to see on the big screen. It taught me to go see Disney films first by myself. I was very disappointed with the sophistication of the Hydra scene. Did we really need the green goo spewing everywhere? This had my child covering her eyes and wanting to go home. You can certainly believe that this did not transfer to my burning up the wallet on Hercules merchandise. Many adults LIKED the movie but the Disney machine needs to be mindful that pleasing the KIDS is where the money is. I'm off to see Tarzan.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
second tier Disney,"After imprisoning the Titans, Zeus and Hera have their son Hercules. Zeus' brother Hades in the underworld plans to overthrow Zeus by freeing the Titans. However, he must stop Hercules before growing up and his fate to stop the release. He sends his evil minions Pain and Panic to steal baby Hercules and feed him a potion to make him mortal. The baby fails to drink every last drop and he's adopted by a kindly farmer couple. Hercules grows up to be a bumbling part-mortal trying to control his powers. After yet another accident, he is banished from his home. Along the way, he is befriended by Pegasus sent by Zeus and recruits trainer Phil. He is joined by femme fatale Meg who had actually sold her soul to Hades. With Pain and Panic, she sets Hercules to Hades' impossible labors.This is second tier Disney animation. It is really a referential cartoon at heart. It tries very hard to be irreverent. I'm not sure about making young Hercules a bumbling teen. Setting him young does detract from any chemistry with Meg. He's a child while she's all woman. The movie mixes the origins of Superman with the classic Greek. Seeing how Superman steals from Hercules, it's par for the course. The only truly great character is Hades. He is deliciously evil. The songs are relatively forgettable. Despite being second tier, it is still very much Disney and has an overall competence.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hercules is indeed a good Disney musical but does have some stumbling blocks that prevents it from being great.,"During Disney's Renaissance era, they pretty much covered a variety of different cultures past and present. With Hercules, they portrayed Greek mythology and made it accessible for younger audiences. Taking elements from multiple myths and putting it into one story, Hercules follows the titular character as he is kidnapped and placed on Earth. With his godly powers nearly diminished, Hercules must find a way to become a God again before the sinister Hades destroys him. It is essentially the animated version of Clash of the Titans, but with cutesy musical numbers and that typical feel good Disney plot that we've all learnt to adore. Highlighting the importance of love, inner strength and...love again? Children will leave the film wanting to find a partner and fall endlessly in love (good job Disney...). Plenty of memorable characters including Hades, Meg, Pegasus and a Satyr voiced by Danny DeVito who just about has the best lines. ""Rule number 95 kid: concentrate."", ""What are you doing!? Get your swooooord!"" (gosh I love that line). Only DeVito could pull that line off and make it utterly unforgettable. The animation was decent on the whole, I've always admired the hand-drawn technique. However, I found thin weak Hercules to be badly drawn and the mixture of 3D rendered effects such as the Hydra battle with hand drawings looks extremely outdated and takes you out of the narrative. The songs are mostly sung by five women (who are everywhere, much like The Little Shop of Horrors) who appear on pottery, sculptures and pretty much anything else. From 'Zero to Hero' and my personal favourite 'Go The Distance', Hercules is filled with some damn catchy songs, just not Disney's strongest. Like with most animations, the ending was rushed and everything is neatly tied up with a glitzy ribbon. Which is fine, but there really isn't any emotional impact in the story. So whilst this may still be a decent Disney animated musical that captures Greek mythology, it's not their best.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One hell of a good time,"Hercules is just a great time inside and out. The songs are all awesome and the characters are all hilarious (everyone can dish out the shadiest burns like it's nobody's business). The CG used for the Hydra is extremely dated and the animation in general isn't on par with other movies around the same time, but the characters more than make up for it. It also explores the theme of self-identity, which is always important for kids to learn. It's not the most thought-provoking movie that Disney has made, but it doesn't need to be. It's thing is a hilarious and sweet coming-of-age story featuring greek gods and Danny Devito. It does it's thing and does it amazingly.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great Entertainment, but not by Disney's standards.","""Hercules"" was a return by the Disney directing team of Ron Clements and John Musker (of ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" fame) to the animated feature after two very sombre entries in the Disney canon, ""Pocahontas"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", and they pretty much continued from where they left off with the aforementioned ""Aladdin"". Both of these films share common traits; both are extremely loose adaptations of established legend; they have an obvious contemporary feel, peppered with pop references (not saturated like Dreamwork's, or for that matter, many resent animated movies); both have an aspiring male protagonist and finally, both films have at least one immaculate, albeit hilarious voice acting performance. Plus the animation is given a stylish and very caricaturist form to it.Similarities aside then, ""Hercules"" was the first venture for Disney into Greek myth, providing a retelling of the story about the titular hero of how he was born a God, stolen and turned mortal by Hades Lord of the Underworld (to get him out of the way for a hostile take over of Mount Olympus which Herc is destined to intervene with) and the hero, after been told by daddy Zeus that, to get back, he must prove himself a true hero on Earth.A far cry from what was established in the myths to a lot of you in the know on these things, although Disney's always had a gift for making this work despite. And as it turned out accuracy wasn't a problem here either (to some). The story's pretty standard, like ""Aladdin"", and the main protagonist, while a little more layered than the former with subtexts of discrimination for his clumsiness and strength, is still on the boring side. Once again though, it's the supporting roles, the animation and the music that steal the show. Alan Menken once again saddled up for the score and together with David Zippel produced the songs, which take on a Greek chorus delivered by the quintet of Muses in a Gospel choir style. This makes for a few rousing tunes and a good intro, plus it ties in with the whole soulful, hero story they got going down. The Oscar nominee this time was an aspiring hero ballad of hopes and dreams, typically sappy stuff and does the job. The score itself melds all these tunes together here and there, plus goes other places too, but overall is not up to the stellar work of the past. Still fun though.Animation is once again of the top draw sort. Gerald Scarfe was the artistic adviser on this one, a political cartoonist of the UK and he brings a unique style to the Disney art. It's still very colourful, using a lot of luminescent colours, but the characters are all very sharp edged and heavily caricatured to resemble Greek art. There's also a fantastic sense of scale at times in the settings, especially in the city of Thebes with its towering Marbelesque architecture and an abundance of other beautiful Greek art. It's a nice move and another example of Disney's ever curious endeavours in cultural variety at the time. CGI is used widely for one particularly great action sequence, plus for some intriguing morphing techniques utilised in Olympus.Voice acting is of uniform good quality here with all actors acquitting themselves well with their role, especially Danny De Vito as Herc's trainer satyr Phil and Susan Egan as a very curvaceous and very tough Damsel named Megara (friends call her Meg). But the aforementioned show stealer is James Woods' Hades, who comes across as the slimiest, most charismatic movie producer slash real estate salesman type you've ever seen, motoring his mouth all over the script with ad libs aplenty. Doesn't topple William's Genie for pure comic madness, but he makes it his own character and revels in it to our fortune.This movie is as much a comedy as ""Aladdin"" was, meaning that it's lighting fast with a sharp edge on the cultural references and on the Greek myths themselves. Most of the comedy comes courtesy of Hades and Phil, who get great lines, but also comes from some serious hits taken at Disney's own patented merchandising routine, used here for Herc's sake. It's well implemented and makes for good satire at times. But other than comedy, the film does the romantic angle too, plus the main moral of knowing what it really takes to be a true hero. Once again, like the former movie, it's the weaker element. Actually for most of the midsection of the film (the most entertaining part) the romance is quite touching, but eventually it gets rushed and doesn't feel as genuine. The main message isn't hammered into us and is a good one, but still isn't anything to swoon over. While comedy's a strong suite for both ""Hercules"" and ""Aladdin"", the latter had itself backed with a slightly more magical feel to it's dramatic subtext, leaving ""Hercules"" a little shallow.One final point before i clean up. While the movie is a mere shadow of the myth in terms of story, it has an abundance of homages to Greek myth, including Hercules himself. I counted references to about 7 of Hercules' 12 labours (one been very prominent), plus a twist of a similar situation Hercules had with a River Guardian Centaur and his girl. Actually, the more you know about Greek myth, the more you'll find and it actually turns out to be quite a nice touch, even though none of it coheres in the order originally wrote.""Hercules"" is fine entertainment for all ages, as in the good Disney tradition. But this time, away from that tradition, it lacks a little something that Disney seemed to have mastered before and almost reacquainted itself with a few times more afterwards before sinking below the depths. Just as well, this is better animated entertainment you'll get than most non-Disney, non-Pixar and non-anime companies produce regularly.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney goes modern,"This film is the point where Disney's renaissance starts to peter out.

Hercules - Zero or Hero,"Hercules is a spectacular Disney Classic with a fun, action story mixed with a tale of love and betrayal. It has some great musical numbers such as, 'Go the Distance', 'Won't say I'm in Love' and 'Zero to Hero'. These things make it seem like a fantastic film that all Disney lovers must see. And that is how I see it but many people don't; they find the movie very inaccurate and dislike the pop culture references or think the score and story are poor. To be honest, I don't understand, much, why these people don't like this classic tale. Yes, the plot is not much like the real story of Hercules but this is a children's movie - it wasn't made to be historically correct or educational. I agree, the pop culture references (action figures, other modern day merchandise, erc.) are a bit annoying and don't fit in hugely but fantastic Disney Movies such as Aladdin were full of these references and nobody trashes them in reviews. I found the plot and score really good and they worked well together to make the overall outcome even better. The film has interesting characters that are humorous (Hades and Pain and Panic) and very heroic ( Hercules and Meg) who all have a back-story which is referred to, often rather subtly, somewhere in the movie. This makes you feel for the characters more. All in all, Hercules is a really good Disney movie that many children (especially boys) will want to see. It is no Beauty and the Beast or Lion King or Aladdin but it is absolutely splendid with its story, music and characters. Disney's Hercules is definitely a HERO not a zero!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"While not a masterpiece, Hercules is still a lot of fun after 25 years","When I was a kid growing up in the late 90's and early 2000's, I've watched this movie dozens of times on video and loved every moment of it. As time went by, I've seen plenty of other Disney films that are hit and miss (the recent Strange World included) and looking back at this film, it's a little bit underrated than I thought.Now, this film isn't without it's problems, but when you look up the recent news that Disney's gonna remake this into a Tik Tok version which in turn isn't a good sign for the studio, you can tell that at least there was some effort put into this upon it's release back in 1997.Like I said, it's not without it's problems. It isn't very accurate to the Greek Mythology and while the main character Hercules isn't awful, he's just a bland carbon copy of Aladdin from that movie.That being said, everything else is good. The animation style is very unique for a comedic take on the Greek Mythology. Yes it may not be on par with the epic visuals of the other Disney films of the Renaissance, but the designs had some creativity and don't feel like Saturday morning cartoons (looking at you, The Magic Voyage). Even the visuals are stunning to look at.The pacing is very nice and doesn't have a dull moment, and the music from Alan Menken, while not on par with Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, is still good in it's own right as are the songs especially Go The Distance. The voice acting from everyone involved is very entertaining especially Susan Egan, Danny Devito, and James Woods who shines as the sly hilarious Hades, Lord of the Underworld. Also, while the story has certain cliches we've seen in other films, it makes up for it with some good comedy especially with Hades who's also terrifying with his temper tantrums.Overall, Hercules may not be a masterpiece, but it's one of Disney's most underrated animated movies next to Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Treasure Planet. Plus I'm glad it already turned 25 this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good, but far from great","Good, but far from greatFirst, I must emphasize that I watched the version dubbed into Serbian, so I cannot comment on the original voice actors, nor did they affect my impression of the film. On the other hand, since the iconic Warner cartoons I grew up with in the eighties, I can't remember seeing a better domestic dub. It is not the level of Nikola Simic and Predrag Ejdus, but it is far above anything I have had the opportunity to hear with my children in recent years.The story is only tentatively based on the myth of Hercules, but I can't take that as a bad thing, because after all, this is a Disney cartoon, not a lesson in Greek mythology. Although cliched, it's not a bad story. The humor is quite sharp and in my opinion, is the strongest asset of this production. However, ""Hercules"" left a hollow impression on me, it draws too much on the recycling of ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid"", and at the same time, it lacks the main feature of Disney cartoons - a catchy and impressive song that gets etched in the brain and stays with us even when the film itself is long forgotten. I'm not saying that the music in the film is bad, it's just forgettable. ""Hercules"" doesn't have its ""Under the Sea,"" ""The Bare Necessities"" or ""Hakuna Matata.""6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney Strikes (out) again,What can I say? Disney hasn't had a real good hit since Zeus knows when. I only watched half this movie because it was not good.

Bland animation, bad music (the Muses need to shut up - oh yeah, and that song ""I Won't Say"" - oh God I think I need a vomit bag!), and, aside from James Woods, ho-hum voice acting.  Funny parts here and there (mostly with Woods) but aside from the self-referential merchandising jabs, nothing to write home about.

Watered Down Hercules,"I was a little disappointed that Disney studios didn't look a little more closely at the Greek myth of Hercules. I know it's for kids, but there was so much that could have been added to the legend. He had the 12 labors, you know. Instead, it gets down to having a battle with Hades. Once again we have a terrifying villain (most are interchangeable) who actually serves a real purpose in the underworld. The confrontations are well done. As usual, the animation is spot on, but the sophistication of the story just isn't there. It ends up big lunk versus bad guy. We've seen it all a hundred times. Actually just about every movie, including those Sword and Sandal things in the sixties have the same basic plot. They used to give jobs to big time weight lifters.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I still think the titans (especially when I was younger) are quite neat in this 1997 flick.

A Great Adult Disney Cartoon,"I've been a Disney fan my whole life and I like many of the cartoon movies that have been made. This movie, however, is one of my favorites. It is a cartoon for adults. The jokes in it, my 3 year old doesn't get yet (""Somebody call IXII!"" or Hercules saying that ""I'm an action figure!"" in an obvious attempt to make fun of the Disney Store), but he loves the action and the songs. It's nice that there's a Disney movie that entertains us both. Hades and Meg make the film though. Without those characters and the incredible depth given to them by the voice talents of James Woods and Susan Egan, the film would be too fluffy. Wouldn't it be cool to have Cinderella be as sarcastic as Meg? The sad part about it is that she will never be included in the Disney marketing scheme. Seems to me young girls could use a sassy, sarcastic, strong-willed role model. The only part about the movie I never understood is doing gospel singers for a mythological theme. The two seem to clash, but who wants to over-analyze a Disney flick? Megs song stands out anyways as one of the best ""love songs"" of Disney movies, so I'm fine with the conflict.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's best,"""Hercules"" is one more triumph from directors Clements and Musker. Perfectly reproducing ancient Greece's time and culture, they produce an uninterested animation and fill it with gags without being ridiculous. But they had another advantage, which was the team that they worked with. The mix with gospel music was great, and Alan Menken songs were even greater, giving you a smile in your face and all the gospel power, combined with David Zippel happy lyrics. Voice workers were just perfect for their roles, giving the film a special life. DeVitto is a natural Phil, Susan Egan is a sexy Meg, James Woods is a delicious Hades. Animators really made a great work, not beautiful as ""Beauty and the Beast"" but rich in movements and valuing the essential body lines. The story adaptation is another thing that they did very well. The muses are the best narrators and probably the best Disney characters ever. You don't need to care about those stupid commenters that complain about errors and disagreements with the original legend, because this film is just a new version of the legend, an even better version of the legend. The only complain I agree with is that the joker spirit of Clements and Musker is something that has to be careful. Sometimes in this movie there are moments of tension that are almost (i said almost) broken because of unnecessary jokes or interventions. But it does not destroy the movie's spirit. It's great stuff, for children and adults, and Disney's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The perfect example of superhero storytelling,"The idea has been buzzing around in my head for quite a while, and I have finally realized- This movie is still, and probably always will be the greatest Superman movie since Superman (1978). The basic story of an unlikely child raised by honest people. He learns he has extraordinary capabilities and starts a quest to discover himself and where he belongs in the world. He is noble and arrogant to a degree but learns to develop his abilities because he truly wants to help people in need. This simple story is so compelling and fantastic that I couldn't understand why we can't find it in modern films. There is so much more to offer your imagination than mindless non-stop violence. So instead of distorting your children's intelligence by showing them The Man of Steel. Show them Hercules, and I guarantee they will get so much more out of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The most underrated Disney movie, and one of the greatest","For some people when people think of the best Disney animated movies they generally over look Hercules. I find this odd because Hercules is without a doubt in my mind one of the best animated movies Disney has ever made. From the characters, to the songs, the animation and just everything about this movie is good.Hercules is not accurate to Mythology, but then again how many Disney movies are accurate to their stories? One of the reasons why Hercules is good is because it doesn't try to hide violence, it doesn't try to tame the underworld, it doesn't try to be absolutely kid friendly. The monsters can be slightly goofy, but generally they are creepy. The Hydra ranks as one of the coolest monsters ever in a Disney movie, because while it is CGI, it is animated to look more like a traditionally animated monster. The underworld is exceptionally dark for a Disney movie, but it is wonderful just how much detail they put into it to make it dark.The characters are probably the main reason why this movie is so good. None of the characters are your average Disney characters. Hercules is the brave, slightly arrogant, but a bit awkward hero. Pegasus (yes I know Hercules in mythology never rode Pegasus) is a good horse character though a lot of Disney movies have horse side characters. Meg is a unique female character because unlike most Disney Princesses who are near perfect and beautiful and everything, Meg is quite the opposite. She is sarcastic, a brunette, and doesn't seem to take anything too seriously.While there are plenty of more interesting characters, Hades is a fantastic villain. While at first he seems kind of wimpy for being the Lord of the Underworld, later you start to realize just how dark and evil he can be. He seems almost like a lawyer at times in just how well he phrases things and how well he plans.Overall Hercules is a much better Disney movie than the average animated movie because it actually focuses on action, unique characters, a beautiful art style, and a good soundtrack. The art style in this movie is good because it tries to be similar to Greek art style. Again, great movie that was actually original and had great dialogue. A great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Diminishing returns, redeeming features, deeply disjointed","The familiar package, with added interest for students of mythology, with which Disney plays fast and loose (though no more so than Ovid in first-century Rome, whose 'Metamorphoses' did some pretty outrageous things to Greek legend).Though standard issue Disney in the main, and often seeming pretty weary, there's some food for thought. Leaving aside the tidying-up of Olympus's somewhat irregular sexual politics, Disney also adds an implicit but insistent christianisation of the pagan story in the closing stages. Hercules is re-read as Orpheus crossed with Christ, proving his divinity by sacrificing himself for his Eurydice [or rather his Megaera; the Greek names were mostly chosen to provide English diminutives, hence Philoctetes ('Phil') instead of Chiron, trainer of heroes. Philoctetes is the maimed hero in Sophocles's play of that name.]  There's something of the same in Aladdin, incidentally: the leitmotif of biting into apples is always associated there with knowledge, recognition and of course sex - it's straight out of Genesis.Disney being Disney, the sacrifice here is of the sort that doesn't in fact entail any sacrifice, so the Christianity is skin deep.  Herc doesn't really give up his life, Meg doesn't give up her unblemished complexion or neatly arranged costume despite being squished by a whopping great column, and not becoming an Olympian god frankly doesn't seem much of a sacrifice at all, given that the place is a dull, self-congratulatory cocktail party.  But Disney has always asserted the right of successful cultural imperialists to appropriate other people's cultures - rather like them ancient Romans again. They often do it pretty well.Cinematically there's not a lot of inventiveness on show on the large scale, though there's the usual teeming ingenuity in the details. Also present and correct are well-staged songs with poor lyrics and forgettable tunes (Alan Menken writes excellent orchestral scores but he's rarely a big tune writer, he's a motivic composer like Sondheim - and Howard Ashman was irreplaceable).  Most of the principal characters are drawn entirely from an increasingly depleted looking stock.An honourable exception is James Woods's interesting Hades, a wheeler-dealer demon with a barely controlled undercurrent of rage. The portrayal of death and the underworld is pretty dark by Disney standards, so that the film (like the studio) seems torn between increasingly edgy material in some scenes, and increasingly gooey, bog-standard sentimental moralising in others - as though each is somehow meant to compensate for the other. It's oddly unstable for such a commercialised package.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Creative, action-packed, great colours and a pointless mission!","I believe that more people dislike this than those who do like it. Although HERCULES cannot stand against the previous Disney smash hits I see nothing wrong with it at all.The animation is still as good as the recent Disney hits and I think you'll find that the songs are memorable. A lot of thought went into all the gods, all the centaurs and all the mortals. It's full of heart-stopping action and adventure though I wouldn't recommend it for children aged 9 and under due to moderate gory violence, death images, peril and mild language. Certificate U seems wrong - either a PG or a 12+ would've been better. Hercules, a handsome, super-strong young man, learns that he was once a god and he dreams of having his life as a god restored. Though first he must fight off baddies such as big, tough centaurs, the dangerous Hydra (despite my 17 and three quarter years, he still absolutely petrifies me), the titans who were imprisoned for years, this movie's villain Hades and his henchmen Pain and Panic and even the girl he loves Meg, a devious young lady who has been forced for a long time to work for Hades, Hercules's enemy and, with this woman, it looks as if Herc's VERY hot-tempered trainer Phil has got a rival. Herc doesn't have to love just Him alone! He can love Meg if he wants to (even though he'll regret it) so as well as fighting off those villains he's caught in the centre of rivalry. Yet, after all this, when his dream of being a god again comes true, he makes a quick decision to stay on earth as a Mortal! WHAT?! After all he went through down on earth!

The animation is very cartoony but realistic as well with each character drawn the best it could possibly be drawn. The script is another amazing part of the movie! Even though the story-line was not created by Disney themselves the script had many emotional and humorous parts to it.

"""Hero to zero!""","I was afraid. As you would all know, Greek mythology has been twisted and turned by loads of people. So much, in fact, their original origins are unknown, because so many ""remakes"" were made. Worse, this was a Disney production. Disney surely has some great films, but others are cringe-worthy. So what would it be? I watched the film as a class study of Greek mythology, and I'm proud to say the source material hasn't been tampered with THAT much..First things first: great animation. For a 1997 film, the landscapes were beautiful to see, and this is a person who's seen all the CGI-made films nowadays. My favorite design was the hydra, who seemed 3D-like. They did a great job visualizing the characters and their designs, almost making us forget the fact they were, in fact, animated. Second things second: the music. At first glance, you would never know this is an adventure slash musical film. I really enjoyed the gospel singers and the songs snipped in from Hercules and Meg. They were nice to hear, and the gospel singers enhanced the stories by adding a new form of narration. Third things third: the plot. This is where the film falls apart, for me, because the writers obviously try to lean towards their initial audience. They stripped away some of the Greek mythology by trying to make it a family film, but they end up stripping too much away. There was some clever jokes packed in, especially dozens of pop- culture references, but none of them made up for the fact that they took too much away.Bad things stop there. Hercules was a very fun film that doesn't take too much away from becoming a fraud. It packs in clever references to Greek mythology, packs in lush animation, and packs in a key item in animations: heart. I recommend for anybody wanting to see a film that can still be enjoyable albeit forgetting some of it's source material.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's Worst Animated Film of the 90's,"Hercules, sounds like it would make a great idea for an animated adventure, its got everything, from adventure for the guys, to a love story for the girls, to monsters and magical gods for children, and adults , so how is it that Disney messed this one up?I don't have the answer, and I've never ran into anybody that does, part of the problem may lie in that Disney decided to mix up the Hercules' story we remember from high school, and instead give us a family friendly version (but hey this is Disney what did you expect)?  This new version almost works, but it's still not effective because rather then give us something new it mainly rips off aspects from the Superman films, as well as Empire strikes back.On the plus side, the animation is wonderful, and the voice talent is good. Tate Donovan is sub-par as Hercules, but Danny Devito and James Woods are excellent as Philoctetes and Hades, and Rip Torn is pretty funny as Zues.Now don't get me wrong, Hercules is not Disney's worst movie of all time, it just that with the studio's huge resurgence in the 1990's, with the likes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, hunchback of Notre Dame etc...

Machine within the god,"I laugh when I read most of the reviews here because they are so concerned about accuracy to story.  As any real film viewer knows, movies aren't about story or the intricateness of the plot.  They help, but aren't necessary.This gets the dubious honor of being the most interesting of Disney's Phase III releases.  I'm not saying it's worth watching, but you should notice a few ironies if you do.Disney has, since the start, found something where they invest themselves in their work.  In 'Beauty and the Beast' it was in Belle.  In 'Pocahantas' it was in the ""New World"" concept.  They also find interesting ways of skewing perspectives (e.g. in 'Dumbo' the elephants are both the Axis powers and the Republicans.  One symbol is obvious, the other isn't).  Here it is not a character or a place, but an idea.  Consider:--The modernization of Hercules with the endorsement machine.  Not since 'Dumbo' have we seen a similar portrayal.  Disney flaunts the very process that makes their marketing campaigns so huge.  Since 'Little Mermaid', Disney has relied on flooding the market with hyperhype (is that a word?) to guarantee success.--Gerald Scarfe as designer.  I would have loved to see Scarfe's original ideas implemented since he knows about mix of real and cartoon in his art. Too bad that many of his ideas fell victim to Disney's ""cutesy"" machine.  It would be great seeing an animated version of this reminiscent to his art in 'Pink Floyd'.--James Woods.  One of our best characters actors left, is it any wonder that Disney chose him?  Dreamworks felt threatened by this talent so they grabbed as many ""high name"" starts as they could for their equally mythical 'Prince of Egypt'.

Excellent!Although the movie was first played in 1997, dialogues and screenplay are really good. Humour is great, can't stop laughing! This movie is my boyfriend's favourite animated, so he persisted on watching it together. I couldn't believe that i would like it, but i loved it! I laughed a lot, i remembered my childhood and i think that kids should watch this movie. Of course, Disney continues to make fantastic movies, like Frozen and Inside Out, but Hercules is a classic animation that every kid should watch and i am sure that they will enjoy it!

"""So did they give you a name along with all those rippling pectorals?""","Lackluster Disney movie that tells the story of Hercules. The whole thing lacks creativity, calculatedly following the Disney formula to the letter. We have stupid comic relief sidekicks, cheesy songs, a clich√©d story, and lots of dumb in-jokes and references. It's moderately well-made for what it is but 'what it is' is the problem. I thought the voice work was fine and the animation not bad (but nothing terribly impressive). The songs are really lame, including the insufferably corny ""Go the Distance."" Of the films that came out during Disney's Renaissance period, this is one of the worst. Not a terrible watch when viewed in a bubble but, if you've seen even a few Disney animated films before, this will seem very tired and unoriginal. The worst part of it all is that, despite all the action and comedy, it's incredibly dull.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney can do a much better job than this,"One of the worst Disney animation movies ever; the animation is horrible. Disney can do much better than that.The music wasn't really good too. This movie is great for small children to watch, not for teens and adults.**",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best!,"I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

My Favourite film of 1997,"I Enjoyed Disney films ever since i was a child, now that Greek mythology has put my effort to how realistic Disney is, it's a general honour that this is proclaimed my film of 1997 - Year of Princess Diana's Death and Tony Blair becoming Prime Minister ^^ - And to be quite honest, this was the first film i actually saw in the cinema, back when i was 3-4. John Musker & Ron Clements make a great team and as for 2009's Princess and the Frog, It's romantic and funny to see such good people of Disney get away with fun Greek Excitement for young children, it's a sophisticating classic and i eagerly hope there'll be a diamond edition on this in a few years or so...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining for a free thinker, but the creators made me sick","Alright, I really really cannot help but bring up the reminder if respect for beliefs and cultures and religions of others. This Disney's Hercules movie is a total disrespect for the ancient religion. Sure, ancient, but religion and belief nonetheless and let us not forget that there are still some who follow and believe in it. They made Zeus, King of the Gods, act like a total fool and a clown and Hermes, the God of Messengers, act like a total dumb DJ who can't shut up. And they disrespect the other Greek heroes by giving all their credits to Hercules alone. Sure, to the kids and atheists, it is an entertaining movie worth watching again and laugh about. But the fact that the creators made the Greek Gods a laughing stock with this movie is simply disgusting and I really hope they're reading this. Why was The Prince of Egypt not distorted and taken so seriously? Why was that godly tree not dancing about making stupid noises trying to be funny? Why was Moses not falling on his head or get totally whacked by the enemy? And sticks which turn into snakes which can swallow two snakes its size whole at the same time and dividing an entire sea and turning a river into blood can be taken seriously but a child who becomes a God can't? Utterly despicable. And worst, they cast one of the Gods as the villain! Hades, though he is the God of the Underworld, is not evil. And the Underworld is not bad, depends on which part you go to: misty Asphodel, hellish Tartarus, or heavenly peaceful Elysium. Not only do these people distort the legend of a son of a God, they also disgrace the Gods themselves! If you are a strong believer in the Greek religion as I am, seriously, don't watch this movie unless you want to be put off by it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Vidiot Reviews...,"HerculesIf you went solely on Greek statues, then you could assume that all Grecians have no arms.Fortunately, the Greek demigod rendered in this animated-adventure has both limbs.Orphaned from his parents, Zeus (Rip Torn) and Hera, thanks to Hades (James Woods), Hercules (Tate Donovan) is raised by humans, with no knowledge of his birthright.It's not until he visits the Temple of Zeus that he learns of his true bloodline. As well as his purpose: to reclaim his position on Mount Olympus through gallantry on Earth.And to do that, he needs renowned hero-maker/satyr Phil (Danny DeVito) and his winged- mount Pegasus.Elsewhere, Hades plans to usurp his brother by releasing the Titans.One of the few Disney movies geared towards young males, Hercules is an action-packed party of mythological proportions.Furthermore, it may inspire a few fatties out there to go kill themselves a lion with their bare hands.

A step down from previous Disney animated films,"The worst thing you can do when watching Disney's ""Hercules"" is to compare it to its predecessors. Not because it's impossible (it's not), but because it makes ""Hercules"" look a lot worse than it probably deserves.When it comes to adapting material for children's movies (especially the animated ones), Disney has always been known to change some of the darker aspects of the original story to make it more kid-friendly. Never has it been more apparent than in this film, though considering the source material, it's understandable...to a point. But Disney reworked the whole story, making only passing mentions at the original myth (similar to the fairy tale references to fairy tales in the ""Shrek"" movies).Hades (James Woods) is pretty peeved at Zeus (Rip Torn) that he was assigned to govern the underworld. But according to a prophecy, he will have a chance to take over Mount Olympus and rule the world. However, the prophecy also says that there is one person who stands in his way, Zeus' newborn son, Hercules (Josh Keaton/Roger Bart as Young Hercules). So Hades sends his two monster henchmen, Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Matt Frewer) to off the kid. The plan almost works, and Hercules ends up living as a mortal, though his god-like strength makes him an outcast. Then Zeus tells him that the only way to become a god again is to become a true hero. So with the help of Phil (Danny DeVito), a hero-trainer, Hercules (played by Tate Donovan as an adult), sets out to become one. Meanwhile, Hades has his own agenda in motion.The problem with Hercules isn't the story, but that it's lazy film-making. It seems as though the filmmakers just wanted to make the quickest movie they could. The drama doesn't work very well, the characters are half-developed, and the energy level is low. There are only a few songs in the film (none of which is especially memorable), unlike in previous Disney features. The animation seems to be inspired by Greek art, but it's not as crisp or beautiful as in other films (and sometimes the merging of hand-drawn and computer animation is inadequately done).Most surprising is the lack of effective humor. Much of the jokes fall flat, and what works is merely amusing. The scenery-chewing sarcasm of Woods' Hades and DeVito's Phil are worth a few grins, but they're not laugh-out-loud hilarious.The other voice talents are uninspired. Tate Donovan is flat as Hercules, and he fails to provide the emotional anchor that the film desperately needs. Susan Egan is a good voice-over actress, and her later work in Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" proves it. But her talents are not adequately used here, and it makes her less effective (though she still manages to inject some sass into Meg). Rip Torn does what he can with Zeus, but his dialogue is so weak that there isn't much he can do.""Hercules"" is better than ""Pocahontas,"" but it's still a far cry from the other Disney features.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very underrated Disney entry.,"So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured ""eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it.""My daughter had worn the DVDs for ""SLEEPING BEAUTY"" and ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves ""HERCULES""! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all.I also have to say that ""I won't say I'm in Love"" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it.If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again.Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A weird and highly mixed Disney film.,"In light of the two recent Hercules films, I have decided to revisit this little Klein bottle of confusion. I have always been baffled by this film, and I feel the need to talk about it here.For a start, the animation (a microcosm for the entire film) is highly mixed, and confusing. The art direction was headed by Gerald Scarfe.... why was he chosen? He is known for his surrealist, political satirical work. Greek legend and Disney animation do not come to mind when he is mentioned. As such, the art design of the film (whilst creative and unique) feels very confused, baring little resemblance to the iconic imagery of ancient Greece. The only real exception to this is in the landscapes, and the underworld, these both look very pretty and, in the case of the underworld, interestingly surreal. Overall, whilst colourful and distinct, the animation seems out of place and it mostly falls flat.The voice cast is mostly forgettable and range between average to slightly sub-par . The only real exceptions are James Woods and Danny DeVito, both of whom are highly entertaining and get the best lines. They also voice the most interesting characters, Hades and Phil, in a similar sea of mediocrity. Hades, whilst hardly a standout classic, is a strong villain, both in terms of design and humour. Phil is a likable mentor, who actually has a more entertaining ac than the hero (a bad sign). These glimmers of hope a few in the dim void of the other characters, I truly cannot stress how little impact the other ""characters"" leave.The music......is probably the most forgettable in Disney's history.The plot is weird and jumbled, the pacing is broken. It sometimes skips large pieces (for example the majority of Herc's training) and is often rather slow (the intro is shockingly lengthy). This adds to the choppiness of the whole film.Overall, it's surprising that the illustrious studio made something this....amateurish. It isn't bad per-se, as the good elements are entertaining enough, however I wouldn't really recommend it either. It's a mixed bag.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great film, not a good adaption of the original myths.",Then again what did you expect from Disney? At the end of the day what happened in the original myths this was based on would not be appropriate for young children and naturally enough Disney would have to tone it down because there was no way they could include Hercules being conceived out of Zeus raping a mortal woman named Alcmene. When you watch it don't expect it to be a faithful adaption of the Hercules Myths as it's not directly based on them and has major changes such as Hades being a Villain as well as Pegasus meeting Hercules (whereas he didn't in the original Myths). At the end of the day this was made to appeal to Children too and let's not forget while The Black Cauldron was good it would barely appeal to any Children at all because of it's dark story and if this film had followed every last detail in the original Myths; it would only cause a large amount of controversy because Disney Films are expected to be suitable for young viewers as well as older viewers. Like most Disney films such as the lion king which is based on Hamlet; this is not by any means an original story but nevertheless it turned out great and does have a solid story that's suitable for older and younger viewers; give it a chance and if you can't tolerate it not being faithful to the original Myths do not watch it because it won't appeal to you. The music score in this film is great and it doesn't get much more epic than Hercules regaining his Godhood; the music at that point gave me chills; personally I don't really care for Disney Songs but the songs in this did prove to be quite enjoyable especially Go The Distance; another job well done by Disney.8/10,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The movie that made me want to be a Disney  fan again!,"I remember back when I was a big kid and going through an anti-Disney phase, because I thought all of the movies (even the classic animated ones) were just for little kids. But then one day, around my 14th birthday in September of 2009, my autistic twin brother bought this movie on a DVD and I decided to let him watch it in our bedroom one night. At first the movie didn't keep my attention, because I was thinking a Disney movie would hardly grab my attention, and I was sort of tired that night. Until the amazing song ""Zero to Hero"" played and the movie instantly grabbed my attention, since I thought the song was so cool and fun. After watching the whole movie, I thought to myself 'What have I done?! I actually was trying to avoid these songs for all these years?! I should watch more of the classic Disney movies as soon as possible!' I did watch most of the great Disney movies on Youtube, and I saw that this movie had some songs that made it to the Top 100 Disney songs of all time (I Can Go the Distance, Zero to Hero, I Won't Say I'm In Love, and A Star Is Born).

Totally Underrated,"As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard.

Entertaining movie but too many mistakes,"I liked this movie for everything in it except for the countless mistakes and inconsistencies.  Heracles (the Greek spelling; Hercules is Roman) is the son of Zeus and a mortal woman, Alcmene (said to be the foster mother), not Hera.  Pegasus and Heracles are never near each other in every Greek myth.  Heracles does date and eventually marry Megara.  He also kills her, too.  I've not seen it in a while, but I remember only four or five Titans. There were really between seven and twelve Titans.  Cronus, the oldest of these Titans, is the father of Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hera, Hestin, and Demeter.  Having only a few Titans that represent fire, wind, earth, and water (ice) is being entirely too inconsistent.  Earth is the mother of the Sky and the Titans, anyway. More problems exist but I can't remember them off hand.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Disney magic,"HERCULES, in my opinion, is pure Disney magic. If you ask me, Hades (voice of James Woods) was truly diabolical. On the other hand, Hercules (voice of Tate Donovan) and Meg (voice of Susan Egan) were truly meant to be friends. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""Go The Distance,"" by Michael Bolton. ""One Last Hope"" was good, too. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Phil's (voice of Danny DeVito) singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it.

Clash of the Cartoons,"There's very little you can do to influence Disney artists. Or Disney fans. They're always going to harp on horrid failures that they praise as innovations (Hunchback, Pocohontas, Mulan). And they will never admit that the light-hearted, comedic Hercules was the big step in Disney's revolution concerning style and storyboarding in the past twenty years.Big deal; it's true.Herc was the first time Disney decided to run on fast, colorful frenzy and coy shots at the material instead of cutesy sidekicks alone for comedy. A direct predecessor to Emporor's New Groove? You better believe it.With a ""grecian"" style and a gospel swing, this film comes on strong with guns blazing and hardly stops for air. A little strong is the Oscar-winning song, ""Go the Distance,"" but I guess Micheal Bolton was flavor of the week then. What can't be ignored is how repeatedly watchable this film is, and that's important with kiddie fare, since parents must endure multiple viewings.This film does butcher its subject matter in a way nothing short of savage, it's true. No myth remains intact as the storyboard scrambles to include every monster ancient Greece had to offer, and it's sad to see Medusa, the minotaur and other greats fly by without so much as a by-line.Still in all, the mainstay of the film is the wry humor, and some very fun wordplay. If you want the myths straight, never go to Hollywood; even Harryhausen (otherwise known as The Man) cut-and-pasted mythology to suit his films.If there are spots where Herc lacks polish it's probably because the artists were rushing to finish it and work on Mulan, which is unthinkable when you see the products. Still that's the word I get directly from a former member of Disney. I met him in 2001, when he was working for dreamworks on ""Ice Age."" He explained that Disney artists were awed by the ""deep, original ideas in Mulan,"" and considered Herc ""just another cartoon."" Well, what can you say?

It didn't even appear like much effort was put into it, but to just make another animated Disney movie. Watching this was like watching another 3 episode of a animated TV show on Saturday. Everything is just so darn narrow and predictable that it really does take away from the experience.

What the story lacks in tradition it makes up in songs and laughs. The songs from this movie are up there with the songs from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.

"""Two words. I am retired!"" Phil steals the movie,not Hades.",Phil is one of my favourite Disney characters and Danny is one of my favourite actors. He is a true friend to Hercules and deserves to have his dream come true. His irascibility conceals a kind heart but most of the time Herc deserves to be yelled at. Herc was cute as a baby and likeable as a teenager but dumb and arrogant after he got muscular. What's worse he fell in love with a really obnoxious woman. Phil and Peg treated her like she deserved until the unsatisfactory ending. (Apart from Phil's dream.) I hated Hades too and the rest of the gods. Hades got irritating lines and the other gods were made out to be good when in greek mythology they're vengeful and promiscuous. But enough has been said in previous comments. The only songs I liked were Go the Distance and One Last Hope. The Muses grated a little. Pain and Panic were the usual dumb henchmen. (Why don't villains employ anyone capable?) I liked Panic best. It's Hades who's annoying. And as for that woman! So as far as I'm concerned the true hero is Phil. 5/10,5.0,Anonymous,Animation

From hate to love,"A little bit of backstory is needed for this one. I have known Hercules all of my life, I knew the original myth, I played the PS1 game and I played Kingdom Hearts, but I had no interest in him, I will go as far as to say that I didn't like him at all, I found him obnoxious in KH. This changed after I watched his movie; it is true it doesn't have the greatest animation, story, character or themes, but it is great at all of them. The animation is supposed to be basic, it was a stylistic choice that I loved, it doesn't need the great amount of details of The Hunchback, it is unique in its own right. Here we have a young Hercules, not sure of who he is, not sure of his future and not sure of what he is supposed to do. He is lost, like all of us. The whole movie is about identity, it is a great shout-out to all adopted kids and want to find their roots, to all (adoptive) parents to let their children free to find their way, and to all people that is fine being lost and search for a place to belong. It also teaches that not always what you wanted is what you needed, that feeling different is fine, feeling lonely is normal even you apparently have no reason to be.However, Hercules is not a drama, it is a comedy, and its style is what I loved most. It has modern elements that make it hilarious, the song ""Zero to Hero"" is a good example, but the movie really shines with Hades and his fast-paced speech.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hercules,"Hay!

Which has been executed in away that doesn't actually confuse the younger audience. Instead it allows them to become quite involved with the story line and join in with the action as the story progresses as well as the finger clapping, toe tapping songs!

Has Some Herculean Problems,"This movie has some really great stuff in it. But it keeps being held back by some really bad stuff. It is a real mixed bag to say the least.Starting with the positives, I really enjoy the songs, specifically two of them. ""I Won't Say I'm in Love"" is an overlooked Disney love song. And ""I can go the Distance"" is a terrific triumphant ""I Want Song"". The Michael Bolton cover has made its way into my workout playlist.Hades is also a very entertaining villain. James Woods plays him well and is able to keep the balance of threatening and entertaining.On the negative side, the story and tone are all over the place in this film. The movie has references to ""The Karate Kid"", Michael Jordan and Oedipus Rex. Danny DeVito has a hilarious voice, but his presence proves to be more distracting than endearing. I don't see Phil, I see DeVito. The story has the tired liar reveal cliche that I can't stand. Not only that, but they double down on it. They have two different people tell Hercules about the lie, and he burns the bridge with both of them. The henchmen of Fear and Panic are more annoying than they are funny. The underdog story doesn't work when our hero is born with godly super strength. The final two points that drive me crazy would be spoilers but suffice it to say that I HATE the ending.I can't say that I despise the whole film, but it does have some of my least favorite stuff in any Disney animated film, and unfortunately, they all seem to happen at the end, so it leaves me with that frustration. Given the source material, the movie could have ended up a whole lot stranger.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Below Musker and Clements standards, but still one of Disney's best.","Ah, Ron Clements and John Musker...Their 1989 flick The Little Mermaid saved Disney's motion picture franchise, and it was no surprise: the film boasted delightful characters, a feel-good story, gorgeous art, catchy tunes, and a heart to shame everything Disney had done since 1967.Surely they couldn't top Mermaid, could they? Wrong, they could! And they did, in 1992, with Aladdin, a film that I still consider the greatest, most perfect motion picture ever created, animated or otherwise.Musker's and Clements' next film for Disney didn't come till five years later, when they put a spin on Greek Mythology with this film, Hercules. While Hercules doesn't quite measure up to The Little Mermaid, and certainly won't challenge Aladdin, it is still my favorite of the modern Disney films save Aladdin, Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.The film is one of the funniest and most energetic that Disney has ever done. Phil is a riot, but the real showstopper is Hades, who ranks as one of my top 5 Disney villains in history. There are gags, wisecracks, and all sorts of comical scenes. Arguably the cleverest script of Disney.The story isn't the hottest of modern Disney, but that's okay because it's merely an excuse to put together one gigantic laughfest after another.The music isn't too shabby. I like the score and the songs (especially The Gospel Truth) are catchy enough. It deserves more respect than what it's getting.Unfortunately, since the film is on a caffiene spurge the first 2/3rds of the film, the character development that made Mermaid, Beauty, and Aladdin outstanding films is severely hindered. You really don't know too much about the personalities of the characters. Nevertheless, the characters are great fun.Certainly not Disney's best, but definitely one of the best and maybe the most entertaining.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Hercules...Hercules...Jerk-ules...""","BTW, that was from the trailer (Hades called him Jerk-ules, LOL)Disney's 1997 animated feature ""Hercules"" puts the excitement in Greek mythology. Yes, I am very familiar with Greek myths, and although we don't care much about this film anymore because it doesn't really follow the original myths of Hercules, I still really like this movie!!!!! Yes, there are characters other than Hercules, Zeus, Athena, Hades, etc. that have been added on for enjoyment, but it's still very exciting, indeed.Some of the characters that I have liked the most included Hades; here, because it's a Disney film, he is bad, but not really bad like in the myths. He is a funny little demon; he is an extremely fast talker: ""You kiss, you snooze, etc."" (Try saying that 5 times fast!!!!!)""Hercules"" is the movie to watch for big time fun!!!!!10 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's best,"Walt himself said: ""I believe the best learning happens when something is presented in an entertaining way."" Walt was right of course, and Hercules teaches a little while it entertains a lot. The opening gives kids a window into ancient Greece and it's fables designed to impart lessons to the masses.The movie itself has some A-list entertainers and is fun and well written. Obviously it's aimed at kids, but the grown-ups will find plenty of laughs and lots of tender smiles. The thing that has always captured the publics imagination regarding Disney classics is the power of the heart and the struggle between good and bad (or righteousness and evil in this case). I won't be redundant and share the plot with you. Quite frankly if you don't know the story of Hercules this movie is a pleasant primer. Maybe it will inspire you to go to the library and learn more about Hercules and Greek Tragedies in general. The Tragedies predate many spiritual works and probably provided much of the motivation for theological and philosophical works to follow.Just sit back with your kids or someone you luv and enjoy 90 plus minutes of light hearted fun with a timeless message. It's better than anything on TV or cable if you need a justification, but you wont.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I have never really liked this movie but can understand why other people do it.,"This movie tries to pack a lot of stuff.
However, for a proper parody of The Hercules story, the movie is not radical enough.
For a true divine comedy, this is simply not funny enough for a new staging of Greek mythology, it deviates too much from the original story and the world.
And for a real fantasy film adaptation, he has too many pop culture references and modernity inside. All this could not be a problem if they had gone completely out of the way like the Flintstones. Or if you pack a little more excitement but all the things that really made the movie are just a short cut.The visual drawing style is just not my taste, all look like background characters from other films and although I prefer the message, is very much the representation and the danger and the fights I used here are just wrong.
I would prefer Meg to hurt herself to give Hercules his powers back. If we had really seen Hercules solve his 12 chores and fight against the monsters, if we had seen Hercules try to fight without his powers and put more emphasis on his mind and his training ect.
And if the mix between fun and danger was more balanced.I like James Woods as Hades, but wonder how he could not know if Hercules is dead, I like the reinterpretation of the gods a lot but they do not do enough to take them seriously as powerful beings, I hardly remember the passages in the they have been singing since it distracts from the story narration every time and I liked the fight against the Hydra that was all.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Slow start, great finish","It took a little while to get going, but once it did, this film is on a par with any of the recent Disney animated greats.  The animation, although not nearly on the level of most recent efforts, did grow on me after some time, and did seem to fit the movie fairly well.  The humour was certainly hit-and-miss, but the story was generally fine and the ending was particularly enjoyable.  So even with a relatively lackluster beginning, this film eventually did display the terrific animated storytelling that Disney does so very well, and so I can heartily endorse this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not great","Hercules is Disney's approach on this ancient Greek tale. If you want accuracy, you better look elsewhere. Just like a ""based on a true story"" movie they've made quite some changes. Are they bad? No. The movie's very enjoyable. In fact, the best Hercules movie I've seen this far.Singing? Yes, some few songs are in there. Now, don't roll with your eyes! They're really good and are used to tell the story in a clever way, not to add some meaningless minutes. Whoever had the idea to make gospel singers out of the muses... well done. That's just brilliant.Disney has done nothing wrong with this movie, still.. something is just not working. I don't know what it is. But it's just a good movie, not great. If you like animated features and haven't seen it yet, go and see it. You won't regret. Just, don't see it with young kids.... they might get nightmares, because the movie has a kinda dark theme. Ugly monsters, violence and Hades looks just horrifying.My rating: 7.5 out of ten.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
surprisingly witty,"I first saw this as a child and didn't remember much. After I saw it for the second time with fellow college freshmen, I realized that Disney put so many puns and references in its version of the Greek myth we know as Hercules. Of course my mind screamed out at me all of the contradictions with the actual mythology -- like there were more than just 4 Titans and they weren't elemental creatures that could easily take down the Olympians. Anyways, the movie is very funny, I laughed a lot, like when some character says ""call IXII"" and you realize that it's 911 in Roman numerals. I feel like many Disney movies, in the same way, make modern references that are anachronistic with their settings; like especially for Hades, who does not talk like an ancient god of the underworld but is very sardonic and speaks like we modern folk. As a whole, Hercules is not a super well-made film, it's a clich√© love at first sight story and a journey to find oneself. After all, so much of fiction is about finding one's identity. It's also about heroism. What does it mean to be a hero? If you've read the Percy Jackson series, which by the way is a great way to learn about the Greek myths, then most likely you'll see so many flaws in this movie but still, it's hilarious, the soundtrack (kudos to Alan Menken) is amazing and nice to sing along to if you know the words, and you leave with a nice warm feeling.

One of my least favorite Disney movies.,"This is Disney's 35th full-length animated film, a story about Hercules, son of Zeus, who was turned into a half-god, half-mortal by the evil Hades, who plans to overthrow Zeus. Hercules must become a hero if he is to return to Mt. Olympus and, along the way, his friend Pegasus and his personal trainer, Phil the satyr, try to help him.Like most Disney movies, the animation is vibrant. However, the overall story and plot wasn't entertaining and the movie's pace dragged. There is no suspense built-up and I thought the film was trying to be just one, huge laugh-fest, but resulted in overzealous characters with poor slapstick comedy and jokes.I know this is a cartoon movie but, in earlier Disney films, especially ones given Walt's personal touch, the filmmakers at least gave the movies realistic and believable treatment. ""Hercules"" doesn't attempt to do that, as evident with parts such as Hercules uttering, ""Look, I'm an action figure!"" It's a movie set with a Greek mythology theme, so, I wished it was treated at least a little more seriously. To top if off, the music was unremarkable; songs had no substance.Overall, if you're looking for a Disney movie to watch with the kids or to just pass the time, watch for ones prior to Aladdin, especially those made before 1980.Grade D-",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
An awesome flick for those who love Disney.,"Well, after The Hunchback of Notre Dame (which I absolutely love) got well with the critics and audience so Disney decides to do a movie which is in Roman Empire about a hero called Hercules. I absolutely love this film! It's just everything. You know the rest, the songs, the characters, the music and the animation which you can't really go wrong. From the creators of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid. It's the one, the only, by the famous name of all, Hercules! I actually like the song which is sung by Michael Bolton, Go The Distance. I love the characters. Oh god, I can say it all the time while I'm doing reviews by Disney. I can't explain this much enough. The characters from every Disney movie is just Nostalgic and fun to like. I especially like Philoctetes played by Danny DeVito and James Woods playing Hades, Lord of the Underworld. There's also other characters like the female damsel in distress Megara. Zeus, Hercules's father, Pegasus, Hercules's pet, Pain and Panic, Hades Henchmen and then wonder boy ( which Meg called him) Hercules. I love the songs in it, I can't remember what they're called apart from Go The Distance, Zero to Hero sung by black people and One Last Hope which I love. The animation, what can I say? It's by the same guys who did Aladdin and The Little Mermaid which they wanted to make it so smooth and colourful like the other Disney films. I can't say more about the story because you know the story already from years so I'm gonna have to leave it there. Yes! Disney has done it again making the movies go to renaissance to brilliance.

Absolutely fantastic,"This is by far one of the best Disney films of the bunch. What can you expect from a film created by the same geniuses who did The Little Mermaid and Aladdin? Although there are a few errors in terms of the mythology it's based on, it's a fantastic watch. The comedy is flawless for all ages- I saw it for the first time when I was 9 years old and nine years later I'm still finding the jokes hilarious and discovering more gags that I hadn't spotted before. The songs are brilliant- the composer is a complete genius. I watched Hercules on DVD two days ago and I'm still singing the songs at random. They're catchy and just... wow. I love ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" (Megara's solo). I'm still impressed with Susan Egan's singing voice to this day. The Muses... wow. I love the choral touch they add to the songs. And the fact that they're actually telling the story is really unique- it's kind of an advance from Aladdin where the stall owner is telling the story, except the Muses appear throughout the film whereas the stall owner only appears at the beginning of the first film and the end of the third. My favourite character is definitely Megara- what's not to love about her? She's tough, she's funny, she's sarcastic and she has a heart of gold. A classic Disney girl.

Hercules okay for Disney,"HerculesHercules was a great movie with a lot of things to offer. It taught many things to its viewers and went in a fantastic direction. Hercules a baby boy who is thrown out of Mount Olympus and ends up being raised by mortal human beings. His father is the Greek god Zeus so Hercules is also a good. He has super strength and needs to learn how to control this special power. This part really teaches people to me. It really teaches people that they need control and guidance and to learn how to be patient. Because if you do then good things will happen. Later on in this movie he meets a girls named Meg. He rescues this girl from a monster or so he thinks. Later on in the movie it is revealed that Meg sold her soul and now works for the Greek god of the underworld ""Hades."" The now man named Hercules starts to become a hero and thinks he earns his title but later learns from his father that just by killing beasts and becoming famous this doesn't prove you are a hero.

A Disney film for Mythology fans,"I have a nack for the Greek myths, and Hercules is another enjoyable Disney movie because of the amazing music by Alan Menken (composer of The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, etc.) and colourful animation. So despite the 9 out of 10 rating, I still like this movie.The film is based on the myth of the Greek hero Hercules, who must become a true hero in order to reclaim immortality and entry to Mt. Olympus. In the original myth, Zeus had an affair with a mortal woman named Alcmene, who would later become Hercules' mortal foster mother in the movie. Hercules is not the son of Zeus and his wife Hera, as the Disney twist has changed the story. And the only time Hades appears in the story is when Hercules goes to Tartarus, or the underworld, to get his pet Cerberus. He was Tartarus's diligent guardian, not a ""devil figure."" Thus, this movie may ""cheese-off"" mythology enthusiasts like me a little.I find the film to be quite enjoyable, yet there are certain aspects that I find problematic, including the New York-inspired city that needs saving all the time and the excessive use of celebrity product endorsements, which I find to be a cliche trend. I really appreciate what Disney and the animation team are trying to accomplish, even though I am aware that it is a family-friendly film. So I am not going to complain about it.""I Won't Say"" is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. Also the ""Go the Distance"" musical sequence, and when Herc and Megara go up to Mt. Olympus. I therefore suggest that you ignore the shortcomings and savor this exquisitely animated Disney classic for mythology, movie, and music lovers alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A great movie; One of the best from Disney,"While breezy, and obviously not following EVERY detail of the classic mythos, it does a nice job of humanizing a rather cold and often cruel character.  It's made for kids.  That said, it's a wonderful film about trust, love, faith, and the true nature of being a hero as opposed to being popular and rich.  Add to that, there are these great Broadway-style songs that really help expression the emotions of the characters.  Megara is brash and modern, as are the Muses who add class and beat to the story.  Danny DeVito is at his slimy best.  And the guy playing Hercules sounds and delivers the kind of innocence that Christopher Reeve portrayed in Superman. No Disney film is going to deal with the adult themes that take place in the various legends they portray.  This one uses that legend well, though, and builds an enjoyable and unique story for the whole family.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very enjoyable entry in the Disney animation canon.,"Hercules went through many iterations before finally landing on the big screen in 1997: Kevin Spacey was originally considered to voice Hades and the project almost came to being an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey, but was promptly cancelled after that story was deemed too weak for an animated comedy and so Hercules was chosen when that pitch fell through.This is a very entertaining film that's self aware of when it was made (during the 90s) and its liberties with the source material are perfectly natural choices for the story and happy-go-lucky direction it takes. Sure some of the choices haven't aged well (Disney's in-joke about merchandising and franchising is used in the film at points) but the animation is gorgeous and still very sharp in its distinction from the rest of the Disney movies at the time. I know there were critics who took issue with this aspect of the film at the time, but come on guys: it could've been those Beatles cartoons from the 60s for Pete's sake; or jeez, it could have been one of those straight-to-dvd knock-off films made to 'cash in' on Disney releases that were popular back then.Hercules is energetic, fast-paced and vibrant fun for film-goers everywhere.

Does not hold up so well,"This is one of the few Disney 90s era movies I dont recall ever actually watching and having now seen it I dont feel like I missed out. Its just fine. The story feels very condensed, the acting is a mixed bag and the animation feels like they cut corners. The biggest offender is the musical numbers. Some of it is dull and some of it is pain inducing. Its very by-the-numbers told in short 5 minute periods accompanied by a song. hercules childhood is told in 5 minutes ""no one likes him because hes superhumanly strong"" eehh ok. Then he finds out hes has to earn being a god so he finds a satyr played by danny devito who feels like hes phoning it in. They then go on adventures to prove hes a hero. This is where the writing falls apart because its kind of aimless and he doesnt fight anyone or anything interesting. I think the movie could have been vastly improved by him actually doing the 12 tasks etc. For each of the yadda yadda scenes they have a song but its just them descrbing what theyre doing, its very stilted. Theres no oo-de-lally or hakuna matata to make hercules memorable. The highlight of the film is Meg and Hades played by susan egan and james woods respectively. Their back and forth is entertaining and lively as snidely villain and reluctant hench woman. The rest of the movie unfortunately is ugly and forgettable. Sadly my review points went down as Im writing because everything I look back on in this film feels like yet another misfire. A real missed opportunity in this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tons of fun!!,"I had the privilege of watching this movie just a few hours ago, and I really wanted to watch it again!! This yet another great Disney which hasn't received as much recognition as it should have.I'm not a mythology fan; reading Greek mythology in school makes me gag. Disney's representation of the myths and gods was, while cartoony, highly entertaining. I liked the characters a lot. Hercules and Meg made an adorable couple and their chemistry was definitely there. Phil was funny and a really nice guy. Zeus was portrayed as a kind, fatherly character, though in mythology they make him sound like a bad-tempered jerk. Hades was entertaining, and one of my favorite Disney villains along with Maleficent and Shan-Yu. I loved the effect of him bursting into flames when he was angry. I also laughed at his two brainless minions, Pain and Panic.The animation was slightly cartoony, but at the same time it was incredible and it in a way individualized the movie. The landscapes, Mount Olympus, and the Underworld were truly breath-taking. What particularly wowed me was the Underworld. I looked a lot like what I imagine the Underworld to look like, with it's towering, spiky stalactites and stalagmites, greenish smoke, and terrifying pit of dead souls swirling around endlessly. A chilling yet detailed masterpiece. In addition, I noticed in the scene when Hercules fights the Hydra, it was animated in an almost 3D style. It looked really cool!This movie has a whole lot of action in it, possibly more than any other Disney movie. I loved to watching Hercules battle the Hydra, or the Titans try to take over Mount Olympus, or Hades send out horrible monsters to defeat Hercules. Every moment is a thrill!The music is very interesting. The five or six girls who sing all throughout the movie sing in a weird gospel style, which is an interesting choice of theme for this particular movie. I don't have a problem with it though, I thought it was creative. I also enjoyed Hercules' song about ""going the distance"" and finding where he really belongs in the world. I found it quite inspiring.Hercules is a great movie. Mythology fan or not, this movie will entertain you and help you discover what a true hero really is. Watch it!

"Could've been one of Disney's best, but ends up problematic","I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic.First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as ""The Muses"". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. ""Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!"" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic.I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here.This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the ""Zero to Hero"" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like ""Herculade"" and ""Air-Herc"". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the ""Friend Like Me"" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't.But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny.Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not Disney's best, but still a wonderful film.","Although it's not as good as ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I'd say ""Hercules"" is still an excellent film, probably the last great Disney film that didn't involve Pixar. I'm just sorry I didn't see it while it was in theaters. There's so much to love about this movie, I don't know where to begin. OK, first, the story. The writers did a great job with Hercules. Most of the past movies about Hercules made him a macho, invincible brute, but Disney's ""Hercules"" actually injects some soul into the character, and makes him a very deep, rather insecure, unlikely hero. The story of his quest to become a true hero is really moving and well- done. Next, I'll certainly need to discuss the equally great supporting characters. Danny DeVito is funny and likable as the grumpy Phil. Megara, played excellently by Susan Egan, is a very good female lead. She could have easily been just a flaky love interest for Hercules, but instead, they made her a strong, independent character. However, the character who really steals the show has to be Hades. He is one of the best Disney villains I've ever seen. He is unmistakeably evil, yet rather calm about it (Other than the few occasions when he loses his temper), and also very funny. The character design for him was quite well- done (Though my mom said he reminded her too much of Ursula from ""The Little Mermaid""), and James Woods is incredible at doing his voice, going from calm to menacing to completely enraged effortlessly. Next, I must talk about the songs. I loved all of the songs in it. The Muses add a sweet, Gospel feel to their songs, and my favorite song, ""Go the Distance,"" is really beautiful. It should have won an Oscar. My favorite scene in the film would probably be when Hercules fights the Hydra. The computer animation for the Hydra works very well, it looks great. The fight itself is really exciting, too. Please, go see ""Hercules."" You won't be sorry that you did.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Your child won't cry!,"I've been looking at the comments that aren't for this movie (Mind you, there aren't many) and found the main reason why people didn't go for it. It seems the people that disliked this movie are the people who are too uptight about Greek mythology and how this film was wrong in that base. They wrote how this was wrong or how this Greek never did this, never did that, but seriously people....THIS IS A MOVIE!!! Movies aren't real! None the less do they have to make sense! Not to mention this is a children's movie! I also read a comment by a parent on how their little girl cried during this movie or something? Well, do you think it's because of the movie or it's just her? Millions of kids saw this and didn't cry, there's just something wrong with THAT kid. Anyways, this movie is one of the best Disney films out there. It's one of my personal favorites of all time and is a true Disney classic. I guarantee you, your child has a very little chance of actually crying during this movie and wanting to turn it off. The songs are good, the plot of wonderful, it's a great ending, and the bad guy kicks much butt. Seriously, out of all the Disney bad guys Hades takes the cake. That is all. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ultimately Confusing,"Disney's Hercules is a curious movie that seeks to entertain but instead managed to provoke a lot of questions. I watched the movie on Netflix one night with my 6 and 12 year old sons, and got a reaction that was pretty typical for them with Disney movies--my 6 year old was scared of the violence and had to leave, and my 12 year old thought it was moderately entertaining. I was intrigued because the movie has gotten a lot of bad press for butchering the myths, but I got to wondering whether this had any effect on how you would judge the movie. Based on a lot of the online reviews I read, the answer seemed to be ""no"", but enough people were offended that it got me thinking. What is the real effect of this infidelity on how we should judge the movie?In the end, I concluded that the lack of faithfulness to the myths is a serious problem, but not for the reasons that everyone is raising. Most of the objectors are doing so out of a love of the myths--they appreciate the original stories, and believe Disney has no right to mess with them.On the other hand, I think the problem is more subtle. The fact is that Disney movies generally follow a formula, are targeted at a specific age, and perform a sort of cultural work that is very consistent. Specifically, they are made for late elementary or middle-schoolers (note that my 6-year-old was afraid) and they basically are designed to instruct the age in certain moral lessons that are necessary for a child's development. The lessons are generally the power of love, friendship, self-sacrifice, hard work, etc.Now, the problem with Disney's Hercules is not that it does not do this effectively; in fact, it has the usual menu of good animation, good songs, morally aligned characters, etc. The problem is that the original myth is actually rather potent in our culture, and a kids' movie based on Hercules is simply disconcerting. The original Hercules is a character that murdered his family (wife and kids!) and performed labors to atone for his sins. His family was dysfunctional and his step-mom hated him and tried to do him in. He came into existence because his dad, the king of the Gods, was philandering. We know these facts too well--that fact makes this movie just too weird to really conceive of.And yet, here it is, with Hercules transformed into Superman or Beaver Cleaver or whatever. If you are the type who can successfully ignore all of this context, you might be able to watch this movie and enjoy the Gospel-Motown soundtrack. Maybe you can enjoy it like you might take in an episode of the Twilight Zone. I think, however, this was not the producers' intention.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
good family film,"The film Hercules was a film which the whole family will enjoy, featuring mysterical creatures such as Pegasus Hercules's magnificent flying horse among others.The viewer sees the life of Hercules starting from birth to his teen training with Phil the half horse half human; i feel it would be very good to show in a primary school class who are learning about Hercules and what people thought and believed in in those times as it portrays the Gods (Zeus) , Godesses (Athena) and other Creatures people believed existed in a comical enjoyable way which the whole family would enjoy. filled with music and laughter, as the teen hero battles against mythical creatures in order to save his ""love"" but will his battles against Hadees pay off?",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Thin acting, inconsistent plot, good animation","The animation is up to full Disney standards, but the writers and director need to be upbraided for not following through.  The plot departs critically from Greek legend in most respects, but assumes that the viewer knows the legend in enough detail to recognize the Seven Labours.  The music and the one-liners were excellent, but they merely made the flick worth watching -- they couldn't make up for the criminal lack of central action.  James Woods did an excellent job as Hades, and Danny DeVito did credit to Phil, but the other voices needed more motivation from the director.  Hercules came off as a clone of Aladdin between scenes.When a writer violates The World As We Know It (real or legendary), the audience has reason to expect proper remuneration for our suspension of belief.  This is true with Science Fiction, superheroes, or slapstick.  In this coin, ""Hercules"" returns about ten cents on the dollar.  There is rarely later justification for most of the changes.  The Fates, for instance, could have been left complex and ominous instead of a frivolous interjection.Finally, I was personally and generally offended by the rotten parent-child development in the movie.  A ""family movie"" shouldn't show such frivolous disregard for any sort of family stability.  I can hear someone crying ""But we're dealing with Greek Gods here, by Jupiter!"".  No, we aren't: Herc's biological parents are shown as a stable couple in Olympus.  Once Herc discovers he's not a regular mortal, he drops his adoptive parents out of the movie (except for a walk-on appearance in the final scene), and goes ladder-climbing after the parents who give him little to no guidance.  I am a Disney fan, a step-child, and an adoptive parent myself -- and I was offended by the lack of treatment in the name of entertaining my kids.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

An average Disneymovie,"With Hercules Disney enters the world of Greek mythology, but Hercules is not really worth seeing, since there in my opinion are many other far better Disneymovies(Mulan, Lion King, Pinocchio etc.) The story is about Hercules, the son of Zeus, who is kidnapped and grows up on Earth instead of in the resident of the Greek Gods. When he grows up,  Hercules wants to be a God, but first he has to show that he is a true hero, by doing several tasks. The animation in Hercules is certainly not up to Disney`s usual standard but ok nevertheless.  All the songs are very bad, and in my opinion completely pointless.  The film is sometimes entertaining but I felt bored at many points in this film. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
not the strongest,"Hercules is solid fun for all the family. Whilst never reaching the heights of The Lion King or Tarzan. The animation also looks a bit dated now with the arrival of Shrek and Toy Story etc, but Disney has always prided itself on glossy colors and emotional stories. The usual mix of heroic characters and show stealing sidekicks make this a firm entry in Disney's portfolio, but it probably wont live long in the memory.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not Accurate to the myth,"Similar in vein to Disney's The Jungle Book released 30 years prior, the main issue is that movie takes some liberties from the original Hercules' myth to the point of being somewhat unfaithful to it (but that can be forgiven due to it being made by Disney, and to be fair, the original Hercules' myth contains a lot of adult-oriented material which is considered inappropriate for family audiences.)And His name is Heracles not Hercules that's the Romans name and he never rode Pegasus and hera is the actual villain not Hades and Hades is a neutral God and first of all Heracles never fights the Minotaur.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

get him to the Greek,"I should admit that I've never read the original Greek myth. It was obvious that Disney was going to take more than a few liberties with their adaptation. What I liked more than anything were the pop culture references (i.e., Midnight Cowboy). I guess that like a lot of Disney's movies from the past 20 to 25 years, ""Hercules"" is all about giving the tykes something to find cool while the adults can laugh at the pop culture references. Having the muses narrate the story like a gospel song gave it an interesting dimension, as did the depiction of Megara as a femme fatale. And you gotta love Danny DeVito's over-the-top performance as a manic Philoctetes.Anyway, it's not any sort of masterpiece, but enjoyable enough for its length. Among the other cast members are Paul Shaffer (David Letterman's bandleader), Frank Welker (Fred on ""Scooby Doo"" and Ray on ""The Real Ghostbusters""), Amanda Plummer (Honeybunch in ""Pulp Fiction"") and Charlton Heston (who else but the king of sword-and-sandal epics could give the opening narration?).",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not one of Disney's best, but watchable","I never had a massive interest in mythology, but I certainly had some vague knowledge of Hercules before I ever saw this film. It is an odd story for Disney to adapt, and they needed to bring a boatload of bleach just to clean it up enough for it to be a kids movie. Knowing a bit more about the actual myths now, it's kind of funny to see this sanitized version of the tale that manages to make so many of these characters seem righteous. Perhaps the funniest aspect is the perfect relationship between Zeus and Hera. The other odd choice with this film was the decision to turn the muses (the narrators of the story) into gospel singers. Utilizing a genre of music that is traditionally Christian in its roots to tell the story of a Roman demigod is so weird it makes my brain hurt. Of course, I can't deny that the tunes are catchy. In fact, the best part of this film is the music. That's not a big surprise since Alan Menken is still the song writer, and he knows how to make great music.The story they write for this interpretation of Hercules is not all that interesting. It kind of feels like a retread of Superman, and frankly I'd just rather watch that film instead. I guess this movie has Danny DeVito shoved in there for something different, and for some people that might be a benefit. Personally, I found the character he plays to be a bit annoying. Although he is infinitely better than Pain and Panic, the little demons voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer. I guess these guys are in there because every Disney movie needs their goofy little creatures that are thrown in entirely for comedic effect (perhaps to win over young children.) The saving grace of the film is James Woods as Hades. He is entertaining and fun, with a sense of humor that actually works for adults as well. I don't have any active hatred for Hercules as a film, it's an acceptable way to pass 90 minutes. But considering the glut of amazing Disney animated films, I'm more likely to just listen to this soundtrack than watch the movie again.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alright Disney Animation Film,This is a fine enough Disney animation film for all viewers to watch. There were some parts throughout this entire Disney animation film that did not make any real sense at all. The crew could have added some extra effort and strength to create this Disney animation film a whole lot better and stronger. The storyline of this Disney animation film did not have any real direction at all. The cast selection was alright enough but could have been a whole lot better and stronger. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry displayed throughout this entire Disney animation film between the cast members.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Solid Disney Offering,"Just saw Hercules on video and found it to be quality entertainment.  The Disney take on Greek mythology was creative, with James Woods as Hades a definite highlight.  An example of a creative touch:  Hades' hair is always operating at a slow burn, but when he gets mad, the flame turns from blue to orange.  Hercules as the protagonist is likeable and earnest, so that you really want him to win.  Of course in the Greek myth Hercules was the child of Zeus and a mortal.  Since Disney won't tolerate adultery among its animated deities, of course Hera is presented as his mother here.   A minor detail, I figure if you want the real Greek myth then read the original.  Meg as the love interest is a contrast to the usual lily white Disney heroine, a little hard edged but still likeable enough in the end.  Danny Devito voices Phil, the trainer to the hero (shades of Rocky), and is very effective and amusingly animated.  Several of the action sequences are outstanding, including one where the hero battles a multiheaded beast.  I was quite dazzled by this sequence.  Also loved the metaphor of the Fates cutting the string of life to send another soul to the underworld (was that from Greek mythology or a Disney touch?)I cannot help but reflect upon how animated features have changed over the years.  Characters are voiced by recognizable stars, which becomes a bit distracting.  They have quick cuts like an MTV video, cultural references that will mean nothing in twenty years.  The timelessness just isn't there anymore, but I nonetheless enjoyed this film a great deal. Disney still has the magic, and no one else can touch them in this area.  Compared to the average film showing at your local movie house, even an average Disney offering is a clear winner.",,Anonymous,Animation
OK for a children's movie,"When I saw Hercules I thought it was very cute-cute characters, funny lines said by some of the characters, nice songs with a lot of beat! The only problem is that is was cute-but not normal Disney flick standards. The animation looked more like Saturday morning comics drawings than drawings for an animated Disney movie. And some of the songs(not all, but some)-BLECH! It's a cute movie if you like humor(or James Woods), or are a kid who doesn't care the quality of the animation. 3 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Animation
Hercules,"Hercules is a half god half man who is the son of Zeus. He was put onto earth by Hades and does not know that he is half god. He has a human body but godly strength.

Hades try to stop Hercules from becoming a hero because if Hercules gets back to Mount Olympus it would ruin his plan of taking it over.

Nothing will top what goes down with the Hydra however.Think of this as a sequel to Aladdin in ways, same kinda outlook, same kinda sensibility.

"EXTREMELY inaccurate, but a fine piece of artwork from Scarfe.","I heard about the making of this movie while vacationing in Scotland and when I found out that Gerald Scarfe, one of my favourite modern artists, was the production designer, I literally flipped.  Ever since seeing ""The Wall"" several years ago, I was convinced that Scarfe needed his own animated movie to design or make.Years later, it's a Disney film and I was irate, maybe even a bit confused. I was so afraid that it was going to be a waste of his talent.  Thank the gods I was wrong.One thing I've been seeing over and over again in the reviews, other than the poor retelling of the Heracles myth which I agree with, are people either loving or hating the design.  Olympus is too bright and colourful, Hades is too dark and scary, or what have you.  I will admit that the combination of Scarfe and Disney to be a most unusual one, but it does work on many levels.  When Walt was still alive, he experimented with different styles of animation, and apart from the music and the inaccuracy of the storyline, I believe he would have been impressed with this piece of work. One thing I adore about the design is that Scarfe's style is not downplayed. For those familiar with ""The Wall"", they already know how disturbing his work can be.  I even saw bits of ""The Wall"" incorporated into ""Hercules"", from Hades eating worms, a constant theme in ""The Wall"" album, to shadowplay of the hydra approaching Herc that reminded me of Pink being confronted by his wife who becomes a monster.  Although I'm Wiccan, the comical look of the gods and goddesses didn't strike me as insulting in the least, as one reviewer suggested.  If you forget the story and music (verse, oy) to look at this film as a piece of moving art, you'll do yourself great justice.And to the parents upset about Scarfe's dark and scary design, here's a thought for you: at least they didn't decide on Ralph Steadman.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Good Watch...,"No, it's not Disney's greatest movie, by any sort of way. That's (In my opinion) ""The Lion King"". Nor is the most entertaining, or most musical. But I'd put it in the Top 10 of any of their movies.This film, from the look of most postings about it, seems to polarize viewers. It's a ""love it', or ""hate it"" film, it seems.For me, I like it.I'm not an expert in Greek mythology, so the flaws that I've read in other postings does not bother me.The talents involved are top notch. James Woods as ""Hades"" is outstanding. Tate Donovan as ""Hercules"" is great. Add Danny Devito as ""Phil"", Susan Egan as ""Meg"" and Rip Torn,and Hal Holbrook, too! I sat thru the movie the first time and was SURE that ""Meg"" was voiced by Bebe Neuwirth was the voice talent!It does the usual Disney-fication of events in the movie. Poking fun at (then-topical)phrases, and items. Such modern sayings as ""Get a grip"", ""Well DUH"", and ""Read my lips!"" turn up. They parody their own Disney Store chain with ""The Hercules Store"". And even toss in a reference to an old bad guy, ""Scar"" from ""The Lion King"".Grab the DVD, if you can find it, and enjoy it in wide screen format.",,Anonymous,Animation
The weirdest Disney movie ever made,"Despite the gracefully stylish art created for the background as well as some truly amazing animation and pretty amusing cultural references and visual gags, I found this movie to be quite loud and rather bawdy for my liking. Instead of a straightforward adaptation of the ancient Greek legend, this Disney version turns out to be a comically caricatured, rainbow color-sodden cartoony take-off with a great deal of very creepy gothical fantasy thrown in.The story takes place when Hercules was a fat little baby in the queenly Hera's arms (the irony is that Disney made Zeus and Hera out to be such proud, doting parents when the original version actually protrayed Zeus as a philandering womanizer while Hera, while a wife to him, was REALLY his sister and a vengeful, fire-breathing one to boot.) Hades, the big bad old villain with blue fire for hair decided that he wants to take over the whole Olympus kingdom (which looks just like a big, fluffy sculpture of marshmallow and whipped cream), so he had his wacky sidekicks, Pain and Panic swipe the kid and depose of him so he wouldn't grow up to overthrow the bad guy. But he did and he turned out to be such a gawky, awkward urchin with too-big hands and feet. So poor Hercules turned to the pot-bellied satyr, who would be his personal trainer to make him into the most perfect hero you will ever clap your eyes on. Thus he became rich and famous - a pretty ridiculous protrayal of today's pop culture, especially Disney itself. But the evil Hades had a few more sly tricks up his toga sleeve...including Megan, the very svelte auburn-tressed temptress with a smart-aleck mouth.This movie is just like a big bowl of colorful, juicy lip-smackin' eye-candy - but bewarned, parents...it will also have TALL, SHARP TEETH with its very scary monsters and some creepy moments that would make some really sensitive viewers shudder and shudder long after the credits begin rolling. But at least the kids will get the message that heroism just isn't everything after all.",,Anonymous,Animation
Another Disney disappointment.,"Ever since Walt Disney pictures released ""Pocahontas"", it seems that all of their films following it have gone downhill.  The last great Disney film was ""The Lion King"".  After that, the last few Disney films have never managed to recapture the awesome might of ""The Lion King"".  I refused to see this film when it first came out, and I also avoided it on video.  I finally sat down and watched it with my niece, who owns every Disney movie.  My overall impression of the film was, well, it could've been better.  The villain reminded me of the genie in ""Aladdin"", and he wasn't evil enough.  The songs are forgettable, and the usual comic relief was washed up.  There's nothing really to say about this.  The animation could've been better.  The CGI creature with all the heads(I don't remember what it's called) was about the only cool thing in the movie.  It reminded me of Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences in ""Pink Floyd The Wall""(maybe it was Gerald himself who designed the creature in ""Hercules"").  The love story(which is part of Disney's recycled formula) was slapped in the film, as was the comic relief and all the rest of what's included in the film.  It was decent, but not great. There was nothing new.  And the villain's final curtain was quickly done and overwith, which was very unsatisfying.  It's hard for me to like Disney films anymore.  They lack the power of ""The Lion King"", and the brilliant lyricism of ""Beauty and the Beast"".  Kids might like it though, little kids. Don't watch it if you've already become fed up with Walt Disney Pictures' lack of delivering a good film to it's audiences.",,Anonymous,Animation
