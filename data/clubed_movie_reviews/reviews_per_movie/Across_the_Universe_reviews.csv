"Flawed movie, but nevertheless breathtaking","I saw a sold-out opening night screening of ""Across the Universe"" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor's self-indulgence. That's nothing new to her movies, ""Frida"" and ""Titus"" have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.For the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.""Across the Universe"" is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of ""Revolver"" onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I'm constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that's incredibly rare.In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, ""I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled."" I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely na√Øve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe should be seen and seen again across the universe.,"The response to this movie is a clear evidence that people have a stupid low tolerance level for musicals. Across the Universe works amazingly, and surprisingly as a great musical, it has some of the most the daring, balls out attitudes towards the genre, that we have not seen since probably Fosse's revolution of the musical back in the 70s with Cabaret and All that Jazz. And even though most of what you hear people praising is the production values of the movie, like cinematography, production design, costume design, I think that Julie Taymor is underrated in a very unfair manner. The movie is fantastic, it was such a pleasing film experience.Julie Taymor has always been a very visual director, since Titus, I praised her as a director with extremely rich visual ideas, and compared her to the likes of Baz Luhrmann, which is funny now, cause when the film started, I realize Julie Taymor had a very similar intention with Across the Universe, to that of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge!, however, I'm of the opinion that Luhrmann was modestly effective, while Taymor hits the nail with absolute precision and perfection.Even though I was a Musical Lover Freak, that I'll admit to, I had a hard time accepting Moulin Rouge!, I enjoyed it visually, as well as the performances, but I don't know, I was sort of a put off with the messy use of music, which really distracted me from the movie, which was supposed to take place in Pre WW1 Paris, but felt like some weird, annoying place, a musical version of a bad Three Stooges Episode, which I know sounds a little too tough on the film, but that's what I though. It was off putting seeing such a comedic portrayal of Toulouse Lautrec, pretending to co-write the score of The Sound of Music with a clumsy 21st Century version of Michael York, only in 1900s Paris.I'm dwelling over Moulin Rouge! a little too much, I know, but it's just that people have complained in a similar way about this particular film. Beatles fans are put off by the almost exclusive use of Beatles songs in the soundtrack. I'm not a die hard Beatles fan, but I certainly like them, as pretty much most people, and I though that Julie Taymor's concept was amazing. Across the Universe is a Roseate Stone of the 60s, and because it is from the 60s, takes place in the 60s, and is all about the 60s, the Beatles soundtrack is a match made in heaven. The opening scene, is a perfect example of just how effective the use of the Beatles was, the comparison of late 50s, early 60s Americana Life Style, with a very industrial and rough Liverpool Life Style, from there on, the movie becomes a fantastic musical in all the classical sense, it's so classic that the film could be easily translated to Broadway.People have said the most inane things like ""the film has no plot""...no plot? Are you kidding me, the film not only has a wonderful array of characters that not only represent some of the most iconic figures of music in the 60s, but all of those characters are explored, developed, some to a larger extent than others, just like any movie, and on top of that, most of the characters are resonant in today's society with today's socio-political situation.That is the other interesting element of the film, not only is it a good story, but it is also a politically conscious movie with extremely poignant images about the 60s and today. Not only does it have poignant images, but also, most of the songs have highly imaginative numbers, that are very technically proficient, in the classic sprawling Broadway musical tradition. And regarding the visual and special effects, I think Taymor was a bit gratuitous with the effects back in Frida, but here, they are all in service of the plot, even if some of the scenes seem like scenes that would go great with a little LSD, they are all used for the effect of creating that 60s feel and look in which the movie moves about with a delicious comedic overtone.All of these praises go to the master behind the film, Julie Taymor, she deserves more credit than what she has been getting, the incredibly imaginative and exciting musical sequences are excellent. Who cares if it's music from the Beatles, the Beatles are pretty much the official soundtrack of the 60s, and it's not like the film is just a big bloated Beatles tribute, it's a tribute to the decade, and the whole music scene of the decade, aside from the numerous Beatles references, there are references to Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Morrison.I wanted to focus my review on Julie Taymor's work, but, the whole film is amazing, the cinematography, the production design , Albert Wolsky proves he is still champ of the musical genre. And the cast, aside from Evan Rachel Wood, most of them are young, fresh faces, which works wonders, since you are not ever wondering about who dubbed that song, you take all the stuff in, without having second thoughts or reservations.I recommend you see the film, it's great, and if you have a beef about it using Beatles music, well, I only have one thing to say, DEAL WITH IT, it's not like the film is abusing the Beatles legacy, if anything, it's giving it a standing ovation, and it's fitting for the period, and the tone of the picture, so...that's pretty much it, just...""let it be, let it be, let it be"".",8.0,Anonymous,History
All We Needed Was Love,"A phenomenal feature length video clip with the Beatles songs and Julie Taymor's eye at the helm. The story, of course, is wafer thin but who cares, right? We're not here for intellectual enlightenment but for the forceful, visionary, smart ass style of one of the female filmmakers that has already revolutionize the Broadway stage without, really, changing anything. I believe that's the kind of revolution that leaves a sign. The kind that reassures rather than confuse and ""Accross the Universe"" does just that. The Beatles are reassuring their message is reassuring. Little did that generation know that things were going to take a terrifying turn. Love! Love! Love! All You need is love. Still true but we've never been, as a society, so far apart. It was great to see teen agers humming the Beatles tunes coming out of the theater. The lyrics are like Gospel or lullabies. Was it only yesterday? It feels like centuries ago. The innocence seems foreign and at the same time so real. It will be nice to go back with the experience of hindsight. It doesn't work like that, does it? No, I'm afraid not. In the meantime the great Julie Taymor gives as a beautiful reminder. And a lovely evening out at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Moments of sheer brilliance. Moments of sheer stupid.,"This film is one of the most bipolar cinematic experiences I've had since George Lucas's 1971 minimalist masterpiece THX-1138 was recut with goofy CGI inserts.First let's talk about the main gimmick of ""Across the Universe"": it's a musical using modern remakes of Beatles songs. Some of these new versions, along with very compelling, bold and surreal visuals, are sheer poetry which I'm sure the fab 4 themselves would applaud. But then suddenly get a random toe tapper, full of melodramatic yet sterile vocals (you can hear the auto-tune working overtime) that have no place in the story but for some hastily contrived subplot to serve as a setup for a Beatles crowd pleaser. Yes, I'm talking about the cringeworthy ""Dear Prudence"" where a minor character with only 10 lines in the whole film randomly locks herself in a bathroom until everyone sings her to come out because the character's name is? Prudence.On the other hand, I loved Bono's bizarre, humorous and wittily fitting appearance as ""Doctor Robert"", a self-proclaimed electric messiah who apparently comes to parties with his own personal PA system (or is it a Mr. Microphone cranked to 11?) as he sings to the crowd's orgasmic oohs, ""I Am the Walrus"".Another highlight is a very simple, touching and heart-rending version of ""Let It Be"" sung by a young African-American boy in the middle of the violent race riots and police brutality of Detroit 1960s.If these last 2 examples are any indication (and there are many more), the talented director Julie Taymor gave some of these songs the red carpet treatment and put them in the most provocative, social and historical context.But then suddenly there's a really sappy and unnecessary 5 minutes of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" that has no bearing on culture, history or even the plot.The plot itself is nothing special, but set against the backdrop of the 60s and the domestic unrest over the Vietnam War, it becomes powerful. It's a simple boy-meets-girl story but with tons of quirky characters in the mix (one for every song, and I believe there are 33 songs). My gripe with the plot is that it flirts with making powerful statements about the 60s peace movement, but just when you think it's something you can sink your teeth into, it falls to an inane, predictable romcom clich√©, like a misunderstanding because they don't spend enough time together, blah blah blah. (This is one of the moments of ""sheer stupid"".)But then, lo and behold, the story shifts to a brilliantly satirical hospital scene with (Vietnam vet) Joe Anderson and (buxom nurse) Salma Hayek singing ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun."" Thus the needle tips back to ""sheer brilliance"".Ultimately I enjoyed this film. It's a worthwhile ride, and the talents of the actors and filmmakers are unquestionable. I just found myself periodically irritated by cheap gimmicks to sell a song or two, and I wish those parts could have been edited out, because otherwise I would've raved about what a great film this would've been.As it stands, my favorite Beatles remake musical remains ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" featuring the excellent music of The Bee Gees (pre-disco) as well as other fantastic musicians (Earth Wind & Fire, Alice Cooper, Peter Frampton, and who can forget the awesome finale by the 5th Beatle himself, the late great Billy Preston).",,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe,"This movie was released in 2007 and is 133 minutes. In my opinion, this is too long for a film of this nature. The movie has an extremely incoherent story, that is just an excuse to showcase some young actors singing Beatles songs. I love the Beatles, but I don't really like this movie. On the positive side, the cinematography is dazzling, and the actors can sing. The movie's main problem is lack of a story that makes sense and is easy to follow. When the movie has songs, it is entertaining, but when it goes for plot, it fails. This movie is like watching lots of music videos and watching commercials in between. Overall, this movie feels more like an experience than an actual, quality film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Let's say Hair and Moulin Rouge had a baby...,"... and it's nanny was Julie Taymor ...This probably sounds like I hated the film, but I actually loved it.It has the time line and self-consciously-culture-smart soundtrack of Hair, yet the campy fun and karaoke stylings of Moulin Rouge. Julie Taymor takes this combination and makes it fun, instead of extra cheesy, and it is visually fascinating instead of the obnoxious MTV-video nightmare it could have been.I cared about the characters - and the cast of 'unknowns' have great star power and voices. Even though I knew exactly what would happen, the journey there was great. The cameos were fun. The lead was sufficiently hot. The soundtrack is stuck in my head as I write this (the new versions, not even the original songs) All corny jokes and references, and lapses in plot are forgiven, because Ms. Taymor manages to take a movie chock full of things that have been done a million times before and makes it as fresh and exciting as if it were all done for the first time. You may know exactly what's going to happen but you never know how. This is the director's movie!Definitely a movie journey worth taking.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Why, and how much?","I am not a fan of mashed up song movies using actors to sing parts of pop tunes that are slotted to formulate a story whose strengths are the songs. The fact of the actual shoehorning of a story into a soundtrack by movie makers another musical blasphemy.An Amazon Prime membership allowed me to reconsider this prejudice....I NEED TO TRUIST MY GUT.While I did like 3 imaginative scenes where the song was turned around for story' sake and it worked or the visual added something to the story as opposed to the story setting up the song.. The Paul, Janis and Jimmy lookalikes were varied out of context and then Joe Cocker and Bono cameos become all out confusion. Cocker did cover Beatles tunes, as does U2, so how should we see their star presence, especially with Cocker, as Bono has a role, albeit played to and for the audience.I'll know better in the future. If it walks like a pop money grab and talks like a pop money grab, be glad you have discernment of taste.The last piece is that despite Across The Universe being properly described as Hair meets Moulon Rouge, it is the time period captured for those that were affected as impressionable at the time that appears to have enamored the recommendations of those I respect. I was 6, am knowledgeable, but don't romanticize such times.I remember the TV as bringing a reality into my home that didn't need such horror reinvented for a psychedelic romantic excursion especially seen in times where our reality (at least in America) is heading back to a similar lying governmental state.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I count myself lucky...,"... to have been able to see this film in the beautiful Elgin Theatre with Julie Taymor there to answer questions / talk about the film afterwards (at the Toronto International Film Festival).Wow!!!I was carried away, I was moved to tears, I stood up and cheered.For those who commented about the singing - the actors sang all the songs themselves. What's more, though they did record the songs in studio first as part of the rehearsal process, most of the song performances used in the film were recorded live as they played out the scenes. Perhaps that's why - for me - the songs worked so well; it actually felt like the characters were just moved to sing. Amazing performances from - mainly - unknown actors.And I felt the story had a strong narrative line, aided / supported by the songs. It used the background of history, not just as a painted backdrop, but to add meaning and depth to the characters and the story they were living. Made me wish I'd been there (born in '65, too young to remember the 60's); I'll have to content myself with living vicariously through Jude and Lucy and the others.Add to everything else Julie Taymor's glorious visuals, and I was truly swept away. I saw 36 films at the festival, but this was head and shoulders my favourite.I fell in love with this film, and look forward to sharing it with friends and family who didn't have the luck to see it as I did. It's a film that will, I'm sure, reward repeated viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Julie Taymor's musical or modern Beatles music videos,"Julie Taymor intrigued me with her visceral adaption of Shakespeare's Titus (1999), dazzled me by putting Frida's canvasses to life over Salma Hayek's brilliant performance in Frida (2002), and I was hoping that her keen visual style would make this musical magical. I was hoping for Moulin Rouge! (2001); I was hoping too much.Tying this to Frida, the beautiful Hayek is back (without the unibrow) for a visual feast of a cameo in a well choreographed and edited scene. In fact, as whole, the visual aspects works very well and even if Rodrigo Prieto (one of the best cinematographers of the decade) went on to do bigger and better things after Frida, Bruno Delbonnel, which did Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain (2001), is a well-abled replacement. The compositions are artsy, refined, innovative and give life to the movie more than the music or the story. Unfortunately, the main problem of the movie is that beyond that visual prowess, the movie is disjointed and often feels more like a collection of successive music videos-- a sort of more refined typical Bollywood musical. The story is lacking and the adventure is not propelled in the way that say a ""Big Fish (2003) was able to while remaining far-out and visually over-the-top. As such, many 'videos' are well-worth the watch ('Strawberry Fields' and 'Let it Be' to name two), but some do not really work like the rooftop finally.Musically, first off, I am not a big Beattles fan so that did not help and I much preferred the music of Rent(2005), which the rebellious mood of the story reminded me of, Chicago (2002) and Dreamgirls (2006). The other problem with using Beatles song is that they do not work as well as songs that were conceived to move the narrative along as in a real musical. Also, when i comes to musical editing there is only one song that has has a strong musical dialogue with another song. Overall, I was very disappointed with the musical aspect in terms of music and lyrics. I don't think that even using Lennon's 'Imagine'-that was not used-could have saved it in my eyes, but Beatles fan may like it more or be even more critical, I'm not sure.Still, quite a few nice directing choices and great execution can be seen. The scene where Sadie and Jojo fight on stage is great, Bono's appearance and the following funkadelic bus ride is interesting, the water sequences and the circle in the grass are memorable... A few breathtaking strokes of Taymor's artistry, but no strong backbone like the tale of Hayek's Frida. Keep at it Taymor, but I hope for a more complete piece next time.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Go see it with an open mind,"I have been anticipating this movie ever since I saw the trailer on IMDb like everyone else. When I first saw the trailer, I said to myself, I'm either going to consider this my favorite movies of all-time, or it's going to be trash. Being a huge Beatles fan and owning all their albums on CD, I had huge expectations about the covers of the songs. I saw it with my friend, who is also a huge Beatles fan but not a huge musical fan. Both of us saw it on opening night to the public and to our surprise it was really good! The covers of the songs were actually really good! Now don't get me wrong, the original Beatles songs will always be the best versions but for what they did, they did a pretty decent job. One of my favorite scenes was the ""I've Just Seen a Face"" bowling alley scene. So creative and fun! Also the ""I Want You (She So Heavy) scene was¬Öinteresting¬Öbut fun to watch. Eddie Izzard's scene as Mr. Kite was hilarious! Both me and my friend where on the floor laughing. Also Bono's scene singing ""I Am the Walrus"" was great. Don't listen to the critics that say that ""it doesn't do the Beatles justice"". Actually, it's the opposite. Any hardcore Beatles fan will appreciate all the jokes that were thrown in there. Even if you're not a hardcore Beatles fan, you will appreciate the fantastic love story.Just one word of advice, go to this with an open mind. Don't expect Oscar-worthy script and dialogue, expect clich√©s, not a whole lot of character development from the supporting cast but don't let that ruin the movie for you. Appreciate the artistic mind of the director. I mean who cares if they threw in a character like Prudence just to sing Dear Prudence? It's a great song! For all you ""I hate every movie that comes out"" critics don't see this. It's too artsy for you. Go see this with an open mind not expecting it to win Best Picture for the Oscar. This is one of the best experiences you will have watching a movie. I'm buying the DVD as soon as it comes out. See this movie Beatles fans!!! It does them justice!!!

Great tribute to Beatles,"Set in America during the Vietnam War, Across the Universe is a powerful love story set against a backdrop of political and social unrest: it's a story of soul-searching, self-doubt, and individual powerlessness cleverly conveyed through a multitude of Beatles songs. Like young adults all across America during the 1960's, Jude (Jim Sturgess), Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), Max (Joe Anderson), Sadie (Dana Fuchs), Prudence (T.V. Carpio), and JoJo (Martin Luther) are in turmoil over the war; questioning their individual roles in the war effort and struggling to find a way to hold true to their beliefs while making a difference in the world. While love proves a powerful uniting force, its limitations become clear as relationships are strained and broken over individual perceptions of responsibility to cause and country. A fairly bizarre juxtaposition of extremely stylized, almost hallucinogenic scenes of swirling colors and reflections, highly choreographed dance segments, seemingly commonplace character interaction, and emotionally packed close-up footage of characters lost in contemplative song, this film imparts a good sense of the confusion and passion of the time and is at once powerful, invigorating, and disturbing. The film runs a bit long at 2-hours 11-minutes and several segments drag noticeably thanks to some incredibly slow song tempos. Warning: this production may change how you think about a favorite Beatles song forever.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An incredible experience,"Pure emotion. No one can mix theater with film like Julie Taymor. From beginning to end the film takes you on a psychedelic beatle ride that grips you by the ears, the heart and the soul and never lets go. Even now. Hours after the projector was shut off. Every song adaptation interpretation and setting is spot on, fans of the Beatles will recognize that every detail in Taymor's images recall an instance, a photograph, a line or a quote from the band. Even the girl that comes in through the bathroom window. Nothing is left to chance, everything is on purpose. Amazing. Easily the best film of the year. And in regards to people saying it's a two hour music video.. well... yeah, what the heck were you expecting???",9.0,Anonymous,History
Entering the Mask,"I'll say up front that this film will almost certainly go on my list of films to see before you die, only one of two that I allow from each year.Let's get the problems out of the way first.The overall container of this is a date movie. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl back by professing love in a public venue. Its about as tired a formula as there is.The songs are produced by T-Bone Burnett, a sort of reliable movieworld musical handyman. He's probably a nice man who once knew what it meant to have soul, but now he's a factory man. These songs are performed by the actors you see, and while admirable, it further diminishes the power compared to the originals. Also, I saw this in a multicinema, and they tend to turn the speakers down because of leakage into other spaces. So the songs here don't have the power we know they do.Neither does the girl. In other date movies, we are supposed to fall in love a little ourselves, or at least see why she's the object at the center of everything. This actress doesn't have what it takes, and I suppose that's a result of the filmmaker being a woman and openly against objectifying women in this way. So its a bit schizo in that the form the woman chose demands something the woman won't give.The thing gets off to a slow start. Its probably necessary for the strategy for most of the movie, which depends on growing extremes in cinematic fantasy. But you will probably go through what I did, think during the first 25-20 minutes that I had made a great mistake.Additionally, there's some bad history in here. Its probably excusable if you consider it all just a shorthand to indicate context. But if you were there and depending on that real context to enrich your experience, you'll be a bit annoyed.But with those shortcomings (and I'll mention some others), even in spite of them, you'll find this to be one of your deepest cinematic experiences.Taymor isn't quite old enough to have experienced all this first hand. But she and her team do seem to have gotten the tone right. The world was turning against its inhabitants in a way completely unknown. The youth in the US responded in a way that was deeply moral and committed in a way unknown before or sadly since. This truly was the greatest generation. Think of it: we got rid of a lying scoundrel of a president, despite his best use of unconstitutional force!Everything was up for re-examination and reinvention. Sure some of this -- most perhaps -- was stupid, opportunistic and damaging. But the imperative to re-invent wholesale was there, however colored by idealism. And this was led by the Beatles. If it hadn't been in the context of reinvention -- if religion in its old form wasn't part of what was tossed -- then surely these guys would have been the core of a new religion. One of their hangers on actually is.What Taymor is about is a similar reinvention of cinema. She's a risk-taker. She knows her stuff, and she's willing to place it right in that sweet spot between the commercially viable and the imaginatively provocative.Her tools are derived from Japanese and Indonesian masks, outsized intrusions and a notion of space that prefers enveloping. These three combine to create some amazing achievements in stagecraft. That's what this is all about, stagecraft and the yearning of characters to place themselves in context at the same time the filmmaker (and explicit external world forces) set context boundaries, mostly denoted by uniforms.The first of these is the most apparent, the first time you'll see this. There are some absolutely amazing experiences in store for you just on this score. The large and small are manipulated and bent to an extreme I have only seen in small bits of Tarkovsky. She knows how and when to combine this with confinement and openness, and often when she does you'll have play with matters of scale that are unique. And its not just one device, but many, never repeated. Its as if a whole life of imagining what to do were collected in one place.If these were songs by the Mamas and Papas, I'd still be blown away. If it were Robert Stigwood's script maybe even. But those Beatles songs....With ""Rubber Soul,"" the Beatles started their program to actually write songs that collectively built narratives. John and Paul were obsessed with the power of words that aggregate, and some of their projects really do have a narrative coherence similar to what we can read here, but much deeper than a date movie and a sketch of oppression. So in a way, its a weakness of what she's done to mix songs before that commitment (1966) with those done within it. It fights the DNA of what they created.And some of the songs carry immediate narrative. ""Sexy Sadie"" was about the falsity of religion. Here, Sadie is a redheaded Janis Joplin gal. What?But still, its the stagecraft, and the cosmic placing she's found. See it and have your spatial reasoning ability either broken or enhanced.See it, and either feel bad about your life or empowered to be.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",,Anonymous,History
"TIFF07, review 2: Either learn French or die¬ÖAcross the Universe","Julie Taymor's film Across the Universe has been high up on my most anticipated list for a year now. Taking classic and lesser-known Beatles' tunes, she has crafted a contemporary musical about a group of young adults at the turning point of life during the start of the Vietnam War. While highly ambitious and oftentimes gorgeous to behold, the film ultimately ends up being a failed attempt at genius. Visually stunning, almost every sequence assaults your eyes with beauty and unique splendor. Unfortunately, Taymor may have fallen victim to excess. Trying to jampack every character ever used in their music becomes overkill, adding scenes that add nothing to the story but a way to add more songs.By gleaning each name she could use as a character, Taymor finishes with mixed results. While it worked for Lucy, an effective Evan Rachel Wood; Jude, relative newcomer Jim Sturgess in a great turn as our lead; and Max, Joe Anderson with the best performance of the film, it was too strained for others like Mr. Kite and Dr. Roberts. Sure Bono is fantastic as the psychedelic Roberts, but his sole purpose in the movie is to get the crew over to Kite, who, while played nicely by Eddie Izzard, is totally unnecessary in the grand scheme of things. Along with these moments is a scene that introduces Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo, a guitar player getting away from the tragedies at home. A perfect example of how uneven the film is, this sequence involves a pimp and his whores singing along to ""Come Together."" Sure the choreography is great, but the pimp is just plain awkward staring into the camera with a stoic face as JoJo keeps walking away. It isn't all a waste, though, because the moment when he walks down the street, through a mob of clone-like worker bees, is fantastic to behold. How she could ruin moments of shear brilliance with those of gaudy frivolities is beyond me. Even when taking the lyrics literally with ""I Want You (She's so Heavy)"" comes a number that is truly stunning. Having Uncle Sam hijack Max's life, culminating into the troops carrying the Statue of Liberty is somewhat breathtaking if not entirely heavy-handed.It is also this anti-war imagery that causes a bit of a problem. If Taymor kept with the strict stance throughout, I wouldn't have minded so much. A film can go against my beliefs on subjects as long as it is honest with it's own motives. What goes wrong here is the fact that we are allowed a glimpse into a single moment with Lucy and her reactionary boss that completely subverts the peace over violence mantra. By allowing such an easy scene just squeeze in so that the story can smoothly transition into the eventual climax is both lazy and hypocritical. The emotions and viewpoints that Lucy and Jude hold so close to their hearts are too easily changed, but I guess all you need is love.Right from the start we experience what is in store. After our entry-point with Jude on the beach, introducing Lucy's character¬óvery reminiscent of Ewan MacGregor's opening from Moulin Rouge!¬ócomes a lovely collaged montage of waves rumbling over scenes to occur later on in the film. These waves are layered with newspaper clippings helping to give an overview of the political barometer of the time period. After this is a nice juxtaposition of Lucy, Jude, and Prudence's lives as they start their journey in their hometowns, ultimately bringing them together in New York City. It is the event that begins JoJo's trek that solidified my enthrallment into the film and eased me into a wondering at what could happen next. Unfortunately, the scene of prostitutes follows and jarred me out of my trance, making me conscious of the horrible along with the beautiful.All the acting is above average, if not superb, and the set pieces meticulously orchestrated. Despite the seemingly shoddy CGI work at times, especially during an underwater/above the water sequence, the visuals are spectacular. Julie Taymor needs credit for the imagination and fearless mentality to even attempt what she has. Before the film, she spoke about how Evan Rachel Wood was 17 at the time they filmed. Turning 20 a few days ago, the movie finally sees the light of day. A lot of work went into the final project and it shows. It is just a shame that the film's ambitions outweigh what actually shows up on screen¬óa whole that doesn't succeed past the sum of its parts. In the end, even though a disappointment in overall execution, those parts that work are a sight to behold and highly worth experiencing on the big screen, especially having the opportunity to see the world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Taymor does it again!,"I absolutely loved it.It's very hard to describe, because I wouldn't classify it as a traditional musical. It's not set up so that there's a scene, then a song, then a scene again; everything just flows seamlessly. Wonderful acting from all of the cast,with some great improv from Bono and Eddie Izzard. Definitely standout performances from Dana Fuchs (who has the most AMAZING voice), Martin Luther, and TV Carpio. Also a nice cameo by Salma Hayek, who apparently asked Julie Taymor if there was a part for her in the movie, and when Julie told her that she could be one of the nurses, Salma replied ""ONE of the nurses, Julie?""Overall an excellent film. Taymor fans will definitely appreciate it (it has a lot of her traditional colorful imagery, masks, and puppets). I'm planning on seeing it a few more times just to take it all in. It's certainly going to be a film you have to see more than once to really appreciate.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"ACROSS THE UNIVERSE (Julie Taymor, 2007) ***","One of my (many) pet peeves with modern movies is their penchant for including redundant cover versions of classic rock songs by today's would-be superstars so as to make them more palatable to mainstream i.e. teenage audiences too young to remember the originals or those who performed them. Needless to say, I was very sarcastic about the potentially disastrous ¬ñ not to mention blasphemous ¬ñ idea of making a musical film with the immortal songs of The Beatles (mostly) sung by a group of anonymous young actors. Even if, in hindsight, the film is not without its flaws, I must applaud veteran screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais and director Julie Taymor ¬ñ not just for their bravery in making this almost impossible task work but because, more often than not, the results are brilliant and occasionally dazzling.To begin with, 33 songs from The Beatles' repertoire are redressed to suit the actors who perform them and the characters they portray are also named after famous Beatles creations: the main protagonists are British dockyard-worker Jude (Jim Sturgess) who goes to America to look for his janitor father whom he has never met; along the way, he makes friends with spoiled rich kid Max (Joe Anderson) and soon falls for his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood); meanwhile, their sluttish landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs) is silently lusted after by Asian misfit Prudence (T.V. Carpio) but the former has set her own sights on colored guitarist Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy) whom she engages in her own rock band. The narrative takes on some of the most important events in late-1960s American history ¬ñ the Civil Rights protests, the Vietnam War, etc. ¬ñ as Max is enrolled in the Army, Lucy becomes a political radical, Sadie's band are stopped by the police while playing a rooftop concert (recalling The Beatles' own famous farewell performance!), they all ramble through America in a bus and Prudence joins a traveling circus show...Some of the song numbers are ambitious and inventively realized: it's hard not to love seeing Joe Cocker playing a vagrant in a train station as he twitches himself into the first bars of ""Come Together"" or having Bono as the eccentric Dr. Robert bursting into ""I Am The Walrus"" during a psychedelia-tinged party sequence but it's the partly-animated ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" army-recruiting sequence which impresses the most; still, the more pastoral passages like ""Because"" (sung by the stoned group of friends as they lie carefree on the village green) and Evan Rachel Wood's solo ""If I Fell"" are quietly remarkable in their own right. However, not every song revisit is a success: circus barker Eddie Izzard's ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite"" is surprisingly dreadful, Sturgess' low-key rendition of ""Revolution"" is ineffective and, unfortunately, ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun"" (one of my favorite Beatles album tracks) is marred by some uncalled for choreographic gymnastics! Still as a cinematic collage based on The Beatles' Songbook as performed by other people, it's far more successful than it has a right to be and clearly light years ahead of the notoriously abysmal SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1978) and, consequently, essential viewing for long-time Beatles fans of all persuasions.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I'm not one for the musicals but I can't wait to watch this again,"Wow I didn't think I would like this since I'm not really a Beatles fan but it kinda blew my mind. Just awesome. A really good story set in the turbulent 1960's, with a satisfying romance between an American named Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and Jude from Liverpool (Jim Sturgess). The movie also traces a small group of friends and musicians who are swept up into the emerging anti-war and counterculture movements, along with the star-crossed lovers, Jude and Lucy.Interesting versions of more than 30 Beatles songs preformed by the cast, complete with cool cameos (Bono, Joe Cocker) and musical numbers with amazingly trippy choreographed dance routines. This was just so good.A couple numbers stood out for me: ""Come Together"" with Joe Cocker, just wow, the business people dancing and shuffling on the busy New York street and ""I want You(?)"" with the brother getting inducted into the army was downright scary with a very Pink Floyd, Another Brick In The Wall feel to it.I'm not one for the musicals but I can't wait to watch this again. 06.13",10.0,Anonymous,History
far from perfect but not a disaster either,"I'm pleased to report that ""Across the Universe"" isn't nearly as insufferable as I had expected it to be. As a die-hard Beatles fan, my initial trepidation was not entirely unwarranted, given that the one previous attempt at crafting a movie around the Fab Four's oeuvre was the kitschy, lamentable ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" as bad a film as has ever stunk up the inside of a movie theater. Faced with such an appalling precedent, I certainly did not have high hopes for this latest endeavor, which, from its previews, looked to be another Beatles-inspired travesty in the making.The good news is that ""Across the Universe,"" written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Julie Taymor (""Titus""), never sinks to the level of that earlier fiasco, although it does come perilously close a few times - mainly in the second half of the film when it lapses into pseudo-psychedelia of the worst kind. But, luckily, that doesn't happen very often, and much of the film is surprisingly sweet and charming in its intentions and approach.It's the early 1960's, and a scruffy Paul McCartney look-alike named Jude (Jim Sturgess) leaves his home in Liverpool to find meaning, adventure and purpose in America. While there, he falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Ward), a beautiful young blond who becomes actively involved in the antiwar movement when her fianc√© is killed in battle and her brother is shipped off to fight in Vietnam. Their love story is played out against the backdrop of the turbulent '60's, a time of free love, flower-power fashions, peace demonstrations, drug use, and anti-establishment radicalism, all of which find their way into the fabric of the film.The Beatles' canon, which served as the perfect soundtrack for that extraordinary era, is so uniquely rich in songwriting material that each fan is sure to find something to carp about regarding which songs the filmmakers have chosen to put into their film and which they've opted to leave out. I would have preferred more selections from the band's earlier period and slightly fewer from their later, even though I realize that the latter provide the kind of narrative richness and thematic depth around which a group of filmmakers can more easily construct a full-bodied story.Most of the songs are seamlessly sewn into the narrative, although there are times when we can sense the scenarists stretching the material to make a certain song fit. For instance, there's a character named Prudence who serves no real function in the story other than to give the other characters a chance to sing ""Dear Prudence"" to her (""Jude"" and ""Lucy"" are marginally more forgivable since they are at least the names of the main characters in the movie). ""Across the Universe"" works best when it keeps its vision simple and close to everyday life. Conversely, it runs into the most trouble when it edges towards surrealism and stylization, often slipping over into pretentiousness and self-indulgence when it does so. Taymor exploits her trademark fascination with puppetry and masks, but the visions she creates with them often feel outdated, cheesy and campy. Particularly egregious is an ill-conceived scene featuring Eddie Izzard as a Timothy Leary-inspired Mr. Kite, a sequence that has the ""Sgt. Pepper"" movie imprimatur stamped all over it. Bono doesn't fare much better as Dr. Robert, trapped as he is in one of the most poorly shot psychedelic nightmares since the Beatles' own ""Magical Mystery Tour"" movie from 1967.Still, these are minor lapses in a movie that is often funny, touching and captivating in its own right. Most of the credit, of course, goes to the Beatles themselves whose songs are so musically rich and lyrically resonant that they can both define a specific era and literally reach out across the universe at one and the same time. With their film, Taymor and her crew have captured a good deal of that timelessness.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Tragical Misery Tour,"Oh, have you seen ""Across the Universe""? (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/) Are we the only ones to find it bad, bad, REALLY bad? I think there's an odd syndrome--I've seen it before, can't remember where--of 60s-and-Beatles-infatuation among people who were born post-60s-and-Beatles, and they seem to take ownership of the 60s and Beatles music in a way that is often extremely distasteful to me. Besides the codification of the 60s into convenient chewy clusters (one character drafted, another one black, a girl ""too"" involved in the anti-war protest movement , another in the club scene trying to sing like Janis Joplin...), in this movie, it appears they tried to build an entire plot around the 60s and most of the dialog out of (sung) Beatles songs. To me, as soon as you start naming characters ""Jude,"" ""Max(well),"" ""Prudence,"" ""Sadie,"" ""Lucy,"" you're already losin' me, kid. When half of those characters are ONLY there to support an occurrence of one person or another breaking into song (i.e. ""Prudence's"" whole raisin-bran d'etre in the ENTIRE movie was to have a scene where she's shut herself in a closet pouting and everyone outside the closet sings ""Dear Prudence,"" now THAT's just stupid. They shoehorned songs into the plot, and plot lines into song-ops. The one English guy always sings with a smile on his face and everyone has these pure, clear (let's call it ""plear"") voices fresh out of ""Fame"" (they were born after THAT, too, I think). WAY too many telegraphed references to well-known Beatles and 60s trivia, like the use of apples and strawberries and the comment to Max about killing grandma with a hammer. There are a few cool animation bits (well, one, really), but ALL of that might not be too bad, but they ALSO had to bring my man Jimi into it! Now they're making me mad. The characters are zero-dimensional. The acting is out of Junior High, rising only occasionally to Sophomore level. The writing is just execrable. I had to watch it through because these are my heroes from, and this is the soundtrack of, my youth, and frankly I couldn't tear myself away, just like that reporter and the Hindenberg--""Oh the humanity!""",1.0,Anonymous,History
The 1960's Counterculture In All Its Glory!,"As someone who was literally a child of the mid - late 60's & and a student of the time period, I first want to thank everyone who had anything to do with the making of this film! Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor, passion and idealism that made up the mid-late 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist, you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor!I also feel so very, very sorry for all the critics of this movie who don't have a clue about what it all this means, or whose hearts have grown so hard with such bitterness, cynicism or despair; or have just simply sold-out; or plain no longer care! All your ranting and raving and nay saying won't do a thing to take away one moment of the adventure, creativity, experimentation, excitement or passion that made this time in history so great!I also what to thank the brilliant filmmakers for paying homage to so many great cultural icons, organizations and events of the period: Walter Cronkite, the greatest broadcaster of the 20th century. Baba Olatunji, the Nigerian Drummer and social activist, his double looked like he came right off the Drums of Passion album cover! I can now see him smiling from heaven! The tremendous scene with Bread and Puppets, a living, breathing, direct link to 1960's radicalism, warmed my heart! You even went up to their stronghold in Glover, Vermont, to film part of the scene! Bravo! The SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), which did not advocate violence, and the much smaller splinter-group that morphed into an organization advocating extreme measures, called the Weather Underground. The brave Martin Luther King, Jr. and his intervention in a labor dispute, which cost him his life. The historic occupation of the Ivy League, Columbia University by its students protesting both the Vietnam war and the intense poverty that surrounded the school. Ken Kesey and his legendary bus. The Jimi Hendrix & Janice Jopplin characters who show such dignity, and a passion for music. And, of course, the Beatles! Their music reaches deep into my soul. You gave me insights into the meaning of their tunes that after all these years never crossed my mind!I also enjoyed being bathed in all the very colorful special affects. The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Something brilliantly portrayed in Across the Universe!

Ham-handed and vapid.,"I'm tempted to spill my credentials when it comes to Beatles music, but it's not exactly material in reviewing this movie purely on its own merits, so I'll resist.There's good and there's bad, but if my score is any indication, the bad greatly outweighs the good.The good: Some decent song renditions, and a misplaced Joe Cocker. If this movie wasn't attempting to have a consistent plot, it'd be a fun collection of mediocre music videos, and I'd be less strict about judging it, but alas...The bad: ...there is an attempt to portray a story. It's vapid to say the least, and inexistent if you're truly critical. As a result, the characters are two-dimensional and uninteresting. The movie flows along at an astoundingly disjointed pace, creating any and every excuse to have a musical segment possible - usually falling flat on its face in the process - with the most literal interpretations of the songs possible and some truly poor imagery and symbolism.As if the audience didn't have enough of being slapped in the face with giant Uncle Sam poster singing ""I want you,"" the movie depicts just about every 60's clich√© you can imagine. There's a clone for Janis and a clone for Jimi, a naked, scant Vietnam War subplot, Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey (Bono is just a giant turd after all) references, Greenwich Village; it's as if they just stuck as many 60's events as they could into a bowl, randomly arranged them in a line, and decided to order the movie as such. The whole affair is a mess, but in the end the events just resolve themselves with no real actions taken by the characters.The worst part about this movie is that there will be people that absolutely love it. They'll call it ""sweet,"" or ""pretty,"" or ""fun."" It's safe to say that, if they do, you can go ahead and null their opinion on movies from here on out, because this overlong, self-righteous, 60's-for-the-cell-phone-generation trash heap is none of the above.",3.0,Anonymous,History

I was lucky enough to see this recently at the historic Elgin theater in Toronto. Julie Taymor is one of the most eloquent directors I've heard to date.

A Beautiful Silent Movie,"If you are not a fan of musicals, this is not the film that will change your heart. The singing and the faces of the actors is just so thoroughly ""stage-y"", it's hard for me to put it any other way. It is close, but not so bad, to how I feel about how inauthentic kids are in shows like ""Barney."" Mix in choreographed scenes of football, fighting, army enlistment and even bowling may also cause a twinge for some, like me, who are skeptical of musicals.Of course, going in you sort of expect these things will happen. It's just that after ""Frida"" and ""Titus"" (which by the way I think is her current and still reigning magnum opus to date), I was really looking forward to Julie Taymor's new film. But by the time this was released, I knew I could wait for video. Alas.That being said, this is a fantastic film from a point of view of set design. I'm kidding with the subject of this post, but not by much. And some of the dancing at times was interesting (the flippy-floppy salesmen, the careening doctor before Nurse Hayek is injected into the film). I also enjoyed the Butoh-like scenes of Vietnamese women, the Bread and Puppet Theater escapades, and them thar' Blue Meanies. But even the background shots of stores in pseudo-Greenwhich Village...and Jude's sketches in the apartment, deep kudos to Don Nace whom I believe did much if not all of that work. The psychedelic effects do a mild overdose, in fitting with the period.As for the ""cleverness"" of the songs worked into a story. I don't want to pooh-pooh it, but my loose impression is that it would not be so hard to do. It was interesting how open some of the Beatles' lyrics are, and yet they do have enough spot-on love songs to rely upon as a staple in this film. It's not like Taymor is constructing a film out of the lyrics of Jon Anderson from Yes. Anyways, while I'm not a phoney Beatlemaniac, most of the renditions here were far from innovative, and far too close the the Muzak-ified trauma encountered in elevators and grocery stores through-out the 80s (till whenever they stopped that horrible mind-control experiment).Ultimately I didn't find this film so polarizing, just a solid 6 in my book. One small stage step for the fans of ""true"" theater, despite others citing Bono here, I think Eddy Izzard danced rings around the former Mr Hewson. Izzard's high-flying Mr. Kite was worth watching in the bonus takes on the DVD, he takes the inauthenticity of a musical and outlandishly expands upon it, while it appears riffing the lyrics off the top of his costumed hat.6/10 Thurston Hunger",6.0,Anonymous,History
Exceptional and Exquisite,"I'm a sucker for musicals. I grew up on the classics like Camelot and Show Boat, My Fair Lady and Oliver so the musical aspect of this film is what intrigued, despite my lack of affection for The Beatles.Across the Universe blew my mind! The way the story is woven around the themes of Beatles songs, borrowing not only lyrics for dialog but characters from the songs was pure genius.Aside from the clever and multi-layered story line, this film delivers exquisite scene after exquisite scene particularly once we head in the more psychedelic segments of the film. The cinematography impressed and enthralled me throughout - the strawberry fields sequence is particularly noteworthy! The guest stars featured in certain sequences were also a great treat and lent the film that little something extra.The performances here blew me away. I've liked Evan Rachel Wood since I saw her in Thirteen, but I never imagined she could sing and sing well. Another surprise was Joe Anderson who had little to no voice training prior to doing this film. Jim Sturgess though, steals the show as scruffy Jude. His voice is raw and honest and just right for the style of music.Sure, some of the plot was contrived and tropes abounded, but ultimately this film captured the essence of the Beatles as well as the spirit of the era in a movie that dazzles the eyes as it ensorcells the ears.

"Broadly enjoyable and satisfying, though flawed","There's no arguing that musicals are a niche genre, kind of hit or miss. Jukebox musicals are even more so as they often double down on the ham-handedness, and the common problem of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole in terms of dialogue and plot development being reshaped (commendably or not) into song structures. In addition, while I grew up familiar with the many hits of The Beatles, I don't have any strong opinion or especial relationship with them or their music. If anything, with all due respect their ubiquity in culture is tiresome, not least as it's usually the same songs that are revisited over and over (I really sympathize with artists who, appearing live, want to perform new or little known material, but are expected to constantly play ""fan favorites""). And to read even a little about the film, from the outside it sounds like a less comprehensive nostalgia trip a la 'Forrest Gump' or 'Ready Player One,' sincere or otherwise, and the prospect isn't super appealing. To be frank, I greeted this movie's release with considerable doubt and skepticism - so, while ultimately I don't think this is perfect or absolutely essential, I'm pleased to say 'Across the universe' is more robust and enjoyable than I assumed sights unseen. This is actually pretty good!The uncertain expectations I had met with mixed results, as is true of the picture at large. Some songs and sequences come off better than others, both in terms of the cover and of swirling together verse, chorus, and story or dialogue; even a single number can oscillate on a spectrum of quality within the span of a few minutes. Brilliant and imaginative, or forced and questionable: as examples, ""I want you (she's so heavy)"" and ""Strawberry fields"" are all this at one time or another over the course of their inclusion, in different proportions, while ""Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite!"" is fine in concept but seems out of place as it presents. Others, like ""If I fell"" or ""Why don't we do it in the road?"" are altogether excellent. With this said, firstly, I'm happy that this feature does actually make use of some Beatles songs that are a tad more off the beaten track. Secondly, no matter what else is true of 'Across the universe,' as a Beatles jukebox musical it's certainly more well-considered than 1978 curiosity 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' not least as song and narrative are blended more smoothly (if not always flawlessly). It's also nice just to have a slightly different perspective on song material that is tried and true and sometimes downright overdone.Meanwhile, though the narrative is nothing remarkable or uncommon, in and of itself it's gratifyingly solid and compelling. The characters are relatable (to varying degrees), the scene writing is rich with detail and conveys big emotions, and the overall plot nicely balances emphatic retrospective and earnest beats, broadly avoiding getting bogged down in a push for reminiscence. Were the film a straightforward drama, sans musical styling, it would still stand well on its own feet, despite needing to push through some story ideas that are so familiar as to come off as marginally maudlin (e.g. The eventual discord between the principles, and its nature). Mind you, that's not to say that the storytelling is without fault, either. Some facets feel like a distinct stretch to squeeze into the tale, or as though they're written in not with the attentiveness of a scribe but with the impulsion to make room for another Beatles song, for another big star to have a role - or maybe are just an effort to pad out the length. (To wit: sorry, Bono and Eddie Izzard, but I'm not convinced your parts really needed to be in here.) The picture's portraiture of the 60s is less than complete; Jo-Jo and Prudence, as prime examples, are heavily emphasized in their introductions, and in relationship to other characters, yet feel like discrete token nods rather than honest representation, and the saga just kind of forgets about them after a time. Furthermore, while engaging and satisfying generally, there are notable peaks and valleys in the feature in the tone it maintains, with some middling plateaus in the mix. In some instances (heading into the last act not least) the movie struggles to let song, character drama, story beat, and historical reference all ring out with equal and simultaneous resonance. All told the result is very good, yes; unremittingly grabbing and wholly demanding of viewership, no.For any ways in which 'Across the universe' is uneven or imperfect, however, still there's much to admire here. The production design and art direction are reliably terrific, as is the costume design. Even when they're a tad gauche or ill-fitting, I appreciate the choreography, and the rearrangement or reimagination of classic songs. Similarly, the use of visual effects ranges from ingenious to a smidgen overbearing, but there's no disputing the excellence of the craftsmanship. Everyone who sings in the picture really does a fantastic job, with Dana Fuchs especially standing out for the power of her voice, and Evan Rachel Wood just for the simple cleanness in her tone. Just as much to the point, the cast is swell with what they bring as actors; there are quite a few recognizable names and faces involved, and even those who are less so imbue the proceedings with welcome personality and heart, such that it's a pleasure to watch them ply their trade. Francoise Bonnot's editing carefully and fastidiously orders the assemblage, while Julie Taymor's direction and Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography work in concert to impart an esoteric sense of spaciousness, and in turn expansiveness, as though plainly inviting the viewer to insert themselves into the story to take from it what we will.At no time and in no way is this outright impeccable, or unblemished. Some bits are very ordinary, or overcooked; others are underwhelming, or not entirely well suited, or weakly woven in. The last act sort of loses steam, and as much as I might enjoy the songs in and of themselves that start to conclude the film, their deployment here is much too On The Nose and heavy-handed, even as the sequences are orchestrated well. Yet at its worst my reaction is ""I don't know if this was the best choice,"" and at its best the result is meaningfully absorbing, impactful, and rewarding. It's worth reiterating that I entered the title with expectations that were mixed to low; any marketing I had seen prior to its release didn't impress. Ever the cynic, even having now watched it I can't help but wonder if high popular opinion has more to do with the enduring popularity of The Beatles more than the quality of the film itself. Yet all the most hard-nosed criticism doesn't diminish the fact that more than not, 'Across the universe' truly is a splendid, deserving movie. It has its problems, but fewer and less severe than I anticipated - and anyway, few are those features that are genuinely irreproachable. Moreover, one can't mistake that this was, after all, made with sincere intent to tell a story that meant something, and to do so through tunes that have largely stood the test of time. That sincerity helps to lock in my favor, and keeps the picture from sliding even when it loses its footing. Once more: at length this may not be a huge must-see, unless perhaps you're a diehard fan of the band or someone involved. I'm happy at just how sharp and smart the end product really is, however. Take it from someone who rather consciously avoided it for sixteen years - if you have the chance to watch 'Across the universe,' and don't mind a few smudges in your viewing experience, this is worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Characters like Prudence were horribly underdeveloped; you could've taken her out altogether, and the only thing that would have REALLY changed would that you couldn't include ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" or ""Dear Prudence,"" and speaking of the former, that number was just one of the many examples where in the movie, you'd think they were trying to lead up to something, and then they'd drop it altogether. They included random and stupid things just so they could use a few more songs, and why do people buy into this crap? Because they're too distracted by the music to care.The ""cutting edge graphics"" as Ebert called them were among some of the worst I've seen in years. They were quite obviously fake and cheesy, and you could argue that it's meant to be as such because it's a hallucination or whatever BS you want to throw at me, but if it really was a hallucination, it should at least be believable! After a while all of the garish colors and pompous, ""pseudo-artsy"" camera angles made me nauseous.That's not even half of it, and I haven't even gotten to the music yet. I know nothing compares to the Beatles, but they didn't even TRY - the music was so halfhearted, and some of the ""spins"" they put on them? Just back off! ""Helter Skelter"" was ridiculous, and I wanted to slap that actor for ruining ""Revolution."" There isn't a single song I enjoyed.In all, I wish I had never gone to see it.

More than enjoyable,"I saw this movie at an early age, and was immediately bewitched. Though it may not have that effect on most (especially since I was so young), I think this movie is extremely well done. The attention to detail is laudable, and the cinematography is so painstakingly historically accurate. The music itself is beautiful (but obviously not comparable to the original versions), and the acting is also very convincing. The dialogue falls short at some points, but is also filled with sly allusions to Beatles lyrics which makes the movie all the more enjoyable for any fan. I love the spirit captured within the film; not only the spirit of each unique and vibrant character, but the ecstatic mood of Greenwich village in the 60's. This movie is not perfect, but god, it is beautiful, and I love it unceasingly.",7.0,Anonymous,History
excellent  and artistic film,"This film is extraordinary. It is extremely artistic, thought provoking, and has substance. It may not be for everyone. If you have no sense of over laying, or collage, or recognizing parallel stories from history repeating themselves, you may not connect with it. But I found this film to be over the top creative and entertaining. Since I grew up in the 60's, and I appreciate the music of the Beatles, there was a personal connection to all of it. A lot of fun yet deep emotions were brought to the surface. I know a creative mind when I see one and Taymor and her collaborators are a ""10"" in this regard.

It is a good kind of musical for teenager all over generation,"""Across the Universe"" is truly across the teenage-world of the United States during the Vietnam War. The idea of movie is very good and extra ordinary. When other studios make teenage movie in the twenty-first-century, however, Revolution Studios make the unique teenage-point-of-view in twentieth century. Teen is just a teen, with their labile emotion and their curiosity they can make colorful friendship or love yet ironic life of separation also disloyalty. Of course, because I watched this movie when I am a teen, I love this movie very much.It is musical and musical usually a boring genre of movie. But, with combination of teen drama, the movie actually is a great one. In other hand, just like other teen romance, this movie message is too shallow. There are few of humanity moral value and any other message. It can be a masterpiece if they give it ""moral-value-seasoning"", so that the movie is more meaningful.",7.0,Anonymous,History
All you need is Love.,"I adored the movie, it was so good. Very imaginative and psychedelic in a sense if you like that sort of thing. Although the movie is really long, it was so worth watching. The trailers do not do it justice. I would compare it too Moulin Rouge or any Baz Lurhman movie. The soundtrack was awesome too. Really great renditions of Beatles songs,.. and and all star cast, outstanding. The sixties vibe was well pronounced throughout, not only in the characters but also as a time line of changes in music produced from the Beatles. It went above and beyond all of my expectations. There are many Beatle references within the movie without having the story line be about the Beatles themselves. Each scene is extremely different,...Some scenes are more dark and weary and then liven up in the following scene with bright colors and extravagant dancing. Also references to other popular musicians from the sixties like Jimmy Hendrix and Janis Joplin are somewhat ""represented"" within the cast but not playing that particular person in the film. A really great time period flick.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"This is abuse of music. If you want to see a socio-political musical watch ""WestSide Story-1961"" .","The first time I watched Across The Universe, was in Toronto International Film Festival. It had emphasized the effectiveness of music at the times of political wilderness and hotchpotch of ideologies through a teenage view. Yes, the use of music was mind-blowing; though in a radical -and so wrong- way.It is the same idea of a serial killer killing his victims by playing classical music, that a teenager group rises in rebellion against government by singing. And I just can't believe how people abuse the meaning of music. I mean neither Tchaikovsky composed his opera suites to turn someone into a serial killer, nor Paul McCartney wrote his lyrics to make adolescents rebels. Being radical-minded never corrects a mistake, nor arranges disorder.The story is based on a love story got through a strawberry crucified on an artist's drafting board. Yet, we only get melodrama when we're looking to find a story of love. Actors are somewhat harmonic among each other and are related within the screenplay, though sadly none really can portray a character at all. Moreover, there is not an adequate bearing between the screenplay and the story line, which is a true matter of directing. No bearings between the subject(happenings) and the object(consigning messages), either.Optimistically, it's a pretty good movie for relaxing and forgetting about the issues of life, as long as you don't focus into it.>:-(( 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Moulin Rouge Meets the Late 60s: Very Different and Fun,"The late Sixties was a complicated time. This film's strengths and weakness mirror the complexity of that period's highly-charged issues, many of which are still unresolved. I'm not sure if director Taymor intended that or not, but in any case, the film is uneven. You're bound to like some scenes/numbers better than others. (My favorites: I Want You (She's So Heavy) and Strawberry Fields.) However, if you're curious, I would say go and see it, mainly because it's imaginative and entertaining (and the music's good too). A bonus: the film is adept at drawing contemporary parallels. You'll wonder: When is THIS war gonna end???",7.0,Anonymous,History
I Loved It! :),"As an American, I came of age in the late 60's, and when it comes to this film, I will cut to the chase: It was a touching, beautiful film. Of all the films that I have ever seen, and I have seen thousands, this one went by the fastest. Toward the very end, I looked at my watch and thought, ""Yikes!"" this will end any minute, and 3 minutes later it was over. It left me wanting more.......a lot more. I wanted to see more sequences, about the horror that was Vietnam, and more about the raw, confusing, and slightly naive politics of the young people who thought that they could change the world. Those two issues are very complex, but this film was much more about the love affair between it's two lead characters. I honestly think that if it was thirty minutes longer, with about 15 minutes devoted to each of those topics, and with a few seconds devoted to man's first walk on the moon, (I can't believe they left that out.) it would have been a masterpiece. Obviously, that is not what Julie Tamor, or the writers had in mind.In most films when they re-do famous songs it always leaves me cold. Not with this film. I am trying to find out who sang for the actors during the dance numbers. (Was it the actors themselves?) If not, there were some truly superb, powerful, clear, honest, on key, melisma free singers who sang for some of the cast. (I kept thinking how they sounded like Ewan McGregor, and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge - they shocked the producers, who let them try their own singing in that film.) I thought the re-do of the Beetles songs sounded fantastic, except for ""Mr. Kite"" which I hated. Also the way they synched the songs with what was going on in the story, and the way they synched certain lyrics with a few things on screen here and there was very clever, and refreshing.I have always remembered the 60's with the Dickens quote from A Tale Of Two Cities ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times......."" If you are too young to have lived the 60's, look that entire opening sentence up, and see this film, because it so perfectly captures the awe and turbulence, the artistry and combustion, and more than anything the wonderment and beauty of that controversial time in American history.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Thewriters have been around for donkeys years and are responsible for two of my all time favourites from UK TV Porridge and The Likely Lads.Best thing to do is just sit back and let the story unfold and listen to the music and enjoy the movie.

Do You Want to Know a Secret?,"Wow. My teen-aged son recommended this movie to me. I expected crap, but this went far beyond my expectation. The oh-so-pitiful storyline. How to tell you? Trying to tie Beatles lyrics together, like a concept album, with some clown who looks like Paul McCartney...and the most ludicrous symbolism I've ever seen. ""She's So Heavy/Carry That Weight""... astounding. See, a team of US soldiers walks the jungles of Viet Nam carrying The Statue of Liberty. The soldiers reminded me of Egyptian slaves, building the pyramids (in Hollywood movies, anyway), which my mind received as The United Slaves of America. Surely, that's not what the film-maker intended. Surely, we were being prompted to remember that 'Freedom isn't free'.Anyway, Princeton is a shot location...a student drops out and is drafted. A rich kid gets drafted. Yeah, right. Anyway, an English kid is in the movie. So is a blonde American girl. And an Asian girl who is, by musical necessity, a lesbian? Her name's Prudence, and she locks herself in the closet (get it??), and is chided by her friends to 'Come out and play"".There's also a Peggy Lee-type aging rock singer who tries to belt out songs big, a la Janis Joplin...but she's run-of-the-mill American Idol material, at best...but with a LOT of hair.

Intriguing:  Need to Watch It Again,"Like so many of my contemporaries, I am a lifelong Beatles fan. Like Moulin Rouge and Tommy, or any of the Beatles' movies, this drags us into their milieu. It also has elements of A Clockwork Orange. It is certainly provocative and seems to escaped from the late sixties or early seventies. The anti-war message introduces a group of characters who find they have been reconditioned for combat. There is the embedded love story, and, for the most part, pretty cool renditions of the Beatles' songs. There was a little too much White Album for me, but these songs show a kind of nihilism and sadness that the early ones didn't have. It's a movie that went too fast for me and I will have to rent again. It never came near my home in its theater debut. It's a little gem that bears watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A perfect blend,"""Who can protest and does not, is an accomplice in the act."" The TalmudToo long I have been waiting for an heir to the creative energy of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, but I found it in Julie Taymor's Across the Universe. Both use already established music to fit the book of classic stories about love and loss. Taymor's equals the visual virtuosity but doesn't have the emotional range of Luhrmann's. However, it uses more effectively the music to further the story, in this case the Beatles' canon to reflect the story of '60's era lyrical love and violent protest. It is simply a perfect blend of an era with its music.The '60's and the Beatles are inseparable as the group sang sweet songs of love that also protested adult suppression and the slaughter of thousands in an unjustifiable war in Vietnam. Jude (as in Hey) (Jim Sturgess) is a bloke from Liverpool looking for his natural father in maintenance at Princeton.Better than his limited dad, he finds Lucy (as in diamonds) (Evan Rachel Wood), falls in love, and at one point loses her to the war protest movement, inspiring one of the most imaginative sequences with Strawberry Fields Forever and bleeding berries. Not every song works this well, but at the least they feel organic to the story, much like the songs in the recent eccentric, endearing musical Once.The songs in Across the Universe are variously integrated into the story and introduced softly and naturally. From ""Let it Be"" as a lament for fallen soldiers in Nam and citizens in the '67 Detroit riots to simply gorgeous nudes slithering and smooching underwater to ""Because,"" it all works.Having spent some time in mid-twentieth century America, I can attest to this film's fidelity to the spirits of revolt and love. The contrast with today is that while love retains iconic status in the culture, the spirit of protest, so worthy of the current illegitimate war in Iraq, is not visible except in the hands of Maureen Dowd and Jon Stewart. The idealists who dominate this vigorous and occasionally languorous musical don't seem to go out much anymore.",,Anonymous,History
The Beatles songs fit in perfectly (for the most part) in this otherwise mediocre film.,"""Across the Universe"" is a brilliantly directed film that wants to be more than a typical love story, but has a hard time. The fantasy musical numbers are really half and half with wonderful and strange. Even the strange ones are enjoyable, though confusing.The film deals with a young man from Liverpool, Jude, who's in America to meet his dad, and Lucy, a well to do American girl. They fall in love, while the Vietnam war is still raging. Lucy's brother Max has to go in. Subplots from characters named after Beatles songs like Sadie the aging rocker, and Prudence the closeted homosexual come into play. It's really pretty standard fare material. The musical numbers make this a fun movie. With that said, ""Across the Universe"" does have a good sense of humor for a drama/musical. Though the characters aren't overly developed, they are all still likable.I enjoyed this film very much, but it did have it's problems. Sometimes it felt like a surrealistic masterpiece, and sometimes it felt like ""Blues Brothers 2000"". Luckily the surrealistic masterpiece won over the other.My rating: *** out of ****. 126 mins.

Julie Taymor has directed what will probably go down in history as her magnum opus,"Aside from ""Across the Universe"", the other Julie Taymor movie that comes to my mind is her biopic ""Frida"", about Frida Kahlo. Taymor has now shown that when focusing on cultural heritage, one needn't limit oneself to straightforward biopics, but can also look at the sorts of things that happened in a certain era, while fictionalizing events. And that's exactly what she has done with this one. Opening with two vastly dissimilar settings - one shows the seedy Cavern Club in Liverpool, the other shows an upper middle class high school in the United States - the film tells the story of a working class Brit named Jude (Jim Sturgess), who journeys across the pond to find his father. Although he accomplishes this, his trip takes on a new purpose: falling in love with American girl Lucy (Rachel Evan Wood), and participating in everything that took place in the sixties.If absolutely nothing else, it would be beyond amazing how they incorporate the Beatles' songs into the movie and use them to tell the story. To be certain, every major character has a name from a Beatles song (plus a few actions referencing Beatles songs). But the psychedelic/mystical approach that they take, all the while keeping everything very political, transcends even that. Taymor has created a nearly indescribable experience here, much like the Cirque du Soleil spectacle ""Love"" that I saw in Las Vegas. It's like Chuck Jones's ""What's Opera, Doc?"" (although I understand that some people will object to me comparing the two).All in all, this one that I will recommend to everyone for all time. An absolute masterpiece. Also starring Dylan Baker, Bono, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Some Dazzling Intervals With The Fab Four; Mediocre Plot,"With Julie Taymor's name on the film, one expects an imaginative and colorfully individual treatment, and the Beatles songs provide just that--ranging from tender to trippy, and sometimes even to bizarre; the musical sections of this film are often an unmitigated delight, especially to anyone who grew up with The Beatles--rather refreshing to see how each familiar song is dovetailed into the plot--which, sadly, is the weak point of the film, an all-too-familiar rehash of the musical Hair in many ways, but without Hair's cutting-edge satire. One can see how the scriptwriters thought that transporting an English lad named Jude to the U.S. during the Vietnam conflict and having him meet Lucy, might make for an amusing meet-cute narrative, but in contrast to what's been done with the songs, the plot is far too predictable and unsurprising. Still, a sweet film in many ways, well worth watching as a collection of fascinating MTV-style videos",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not a musical fan but still loved this movie,"Musicals have never been my thing with the smal exceptions here and there. Across the Universe falls into those small exceptions. The Beatles are before my time as well but love the music in the filmThe cast is just phenomenal as well as the directing. I've watched this movie many times over the years and enjoy it every single time. The 60s setting is perfect with all that was going on. The songs fit in naturally with the film and story. My favorite song scenes would have to be ""I Want You"", ""Don't Let Me Down / All You Need Is Love"" and the great Bowling Alley scene.Overall character development was great for Lucy and Jude. The rest of the cast didn't seem to develop near as much but the story really revolves around Jude and Lucy so its too be expected.If they made this movie into a Broadway Musical I would have to check it out even though it's not my thing. I don't think it would work nearly as well without Evan Rachel Wood and James Sturgess though. They really did a phenomenal job in this.Would definitely recommend even if you aren't a fan of musicals.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"While the film can certainly drive my car, the writing and characters don't seem to have that same driving quality.","The critics across the nation, as indecisive and inagreeable as they are, seem to have come to the conclusion that it's a visual fest with a story and music that fall in different categories. I certainly can agree with that categorization, because all three of the film's elements are vastly different to each other, and the film had quite a task to blend them together into what it is: a hippie-revolution era Beatles music musical with acid-trip visuals.The film opens on Jude, an Irish dock worker in his 20s, singing ""Babe"" to the camera. If that doesn't establish what you're getting into, nothing else will. We see his departure into America and meeting anti-war activists Max and his sister Lucy, whom Jude falls in love with.While the film's theme is all about the '60s anti-war movement and the idea of revolution in the modern age for years to come afterward, the film has a hard time getting a grip on this smart idea. The most obvious thing to talk about is the choice of music. In case you weren't informed (by the film's marketing or title), all the song and musical numbers are cinematic re-workings of The Beatles. This has caused the biggest line-separation of the film's viewers. With the die-hard fans of the band, half say the re-workings are bastardizations of the original work, while other fans feel they were made with great respect to the original work. Another population of the critics say The Beatles' should not have had any part in the music of the film and original music would have suited it better. As for me? My only complaint is that, while the Beatles were indeed an important and influential band of the era and suit it well, they were not the only band that did so. What if the film had musical numbers by the works of the Rolling Stones? The Doors? Bob Dylan? Different musical influences would have most likely added diversity to the music.But that isn't to say the numbers are boring or dull at all! The music is well orchestrated and suits what happens on screen perfectly. Which brings me to the next element of Across the Universe: the visuals. To call the visual effects ""eye candy"" is an insult. An ""eye feast"" would be a little more appropriate. Your eyes never want to wander away from the screen in some truly amazing scenes. Even the dark scenes are bright and joyous, and don't even get me started on the hippie trip-out scenes. So if you're one of the many who don't want to hear The Beatles ""bastardized"", you can take your iPod to the film and enjoy the insane effects and beautiful visuals.And, like any musical, the visuals and songs are selected to fit in with the plot and story, which brings us to the final element of the film: the story. This is, without a doubt, the film's true ""flaw"". While it has a great spark, focusing on revolution in the '60s in the anti-war movement, it has no real drive to bring the characters into the movement itself. Jude merely seems like a follower of the movement simply to stay with Lucy, the girl he loves. He never seems to feel the revolution and movement into his own life, sticking with the ""misunderstood artist"" attitude throughout. Lucy stubbornly sticks to the group of anti-war activists for no real reason except that she lost a family member from the war some month's prior. While the reason is strong, it doesn't seem to inflict onto what she's doing and why she's doing it. All in all, the characters follow through the personality stronghold, but are beautifully portrayed nonetheless.But if for nothing else, the film must be seen for it's marvelous diversity from everything else that's come out lately. Though far from original (you can't really call a musical that uses songs from another band 'original') it sticks out more than even musicals like Chicago and Rent by a milestone.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A melodramatic sad excuse for a musical,"This movie had little to no transitions, was extremely melodramatic, contained mediocre at best Beatles covers that sound like they should be on a two dollar Christmas album at Wal-Mart.

In most films fake British accents don't bother me all that much but after twenty minutes of ""Across The Universe"" I was ready to burst into tears.

Psychedelic but inconsistent,"Across the Universe is a sensory musical that uses songs from The Beatles to tell a story about America in the tumultuous decade of the 60s. It is about a young man named Jude, who travels to the United States from his native home of Liverpool. Once there, he meets a dropout student named Max and they quickly become friends. They move to a building in New York City, where a relationship builds up between Jude and Max's sister, Lucy. They also meet a number of peculiar people from the city, widening the friendship circle. Alas, Max's departure to fight for the war and the differing stances between the remaining friends soon gets in the way.Across the Universe is basically a bunch of neat music videos, tied together by a mediocre plot. The only reason the plot is not a complete mess is that the characters hold it together (although at some points the characters have rather impractical motives). Some parts of the film are downright silly, but I guess that stems from it being a musical. It gets more serious toward the middle, when the Vietnam War and protests play a greater role. All in all, the plot left me unsatisfied.The music parts were certainly interesting. There were a couple of abstract segments, but it was very artistic and beautiful. The special effects are excellent. The use of colors (especially when Jude creates a ""strawberry farm"") is thoughtful. Depending on viewer tastes, the music might start to take a toll toward the end (although that is where the best songs come in). The music selection was a definite draw for me.The acting and dialog was pretty much standard. There are cameos by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, and Salma Hayek, which adds to the musical flavor.The main problem I had was that the whole film was plagued by inconsistencies. It felt like the writers attempted too much to fit the songs into the story, which leads to problems. It presses for an emotional response, but often I disagreed with the messages.I should note that I am not a fan of musicals. Someone who likes musicals will probably enjoy the film more and be able to ignore the problems. If you like the Beatles, then the film is definitely worth watching.

Just Awful,"I had high hopes for this film. I love Julie Taymor's work--Frida is great, Titus is simply magnificent. Across the Universe, however, is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. The reworked Beatles tunes are bad. Just bad. I cringed every time a song started. Their use does not translate as clever to any degree. Instead, the application of the songs feels terribly contrived. The plot is utterly uninteresting. I felt in now way personally invested. Perhaps because the characters are not well written. Perhaps because they are empty clich√©s, testament to a watered-down, unimaginative impression of the time--an endless stream of iconic clowns. There were two good scenes, the draft scene and the trip scene. These were classic Taymor moments, beautifully and grotesquely designed.

She developed the Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" style of adapting popular songs, with the psychedelic direction of Rafael Fracacio's ""Julia's Journal"", to improve a new way of making musicals.All that magic feeling of the sixties is combined into this great masterpiece of pop culture, that, in my humble opinion, is the best picture of 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Finally! (Money well spent),"I'm a teenage girl and you could correctly say that I dislike many things. This movie is definitely not on my hate list. I bought the soundtrack with the last of my babysitting money the minute it came out.It was truly witty how the plot, and the names of the characters tied into the songs.I was extremely lucky to see this movie. Although my best friend an I were planning on seeing some cheesy blockbuster, it sold out and we decided to take a chance and see Across the Universe. It was a piece of art but unlike many artsy movies, it wasn't confusing. It was the FIRST TIME I've ever agreed with one of the reviews on the preview for this movie ...""A Visual Masterpiece"".I'm usually not one at loss for words but this movie has the potential to leave you speechless.",,Anonymous,History
A+ for Visual Effects and Musical Interpretation.  The Rest?  Eh . . .,"This being a movie about the music of the Beatles, and me being a big Beatles fan, it's unforgettable in terms of it's music and the visual effects. One strength this movie had was it's different interpretations of Beatles songs. I especially liked Prudence's version of ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" near the beginning of the movie. The set design and choreography were also very impressive.But unfortunately, for every strength this movie had, it's accurate to say that there were at least three hang-ups. This is where I'm at odds with other friends of mine who have seen the movie. It's not that I hated ""Across the Universe"", it's just that I didn't love it because it had some very evident flaws. And I just remember leaving the movie feeling very disappointed about the movie's weaknesses, since they were so big.For one, the movie came off to me as too preachy, especially towards the end. The characters in the film, particularly Lucy and Max Carrigan, came off less as children of the '60's, and more as people I knew from college who smoked weed all the time and said, ""Man, I wished I lived in the '60's!"" over and over again. I thought Jim Sturgess, who played Jude, was probably the best-developed and most believable character of everyone, but the rest of them felt like archetypes ripped and Xeroxed from Oliver Stone movies and Milos Forman's ""Hair"". You were supposed to feel bad for Max Carrigan (I think) for being drafted into Vietnam, but his character was such an asshole I found myself not really caring. Plus, the Vietnam scenes were so underdeveloped (Compared to other Vietnam War films such as ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"") and Max's character so forgotten by the end that I really felt the movie didn't have a message.Continuing on the subject of characters, I thought the characters of Jojo (played by Martin Luther McCoy) and Sadie (played by Joan Osbourne lookalike Dana Fuchs) were almost unnecessary. Even though Jojo's introduction via the very cool sequence with Joe Cocker singing ""Come Together"" added some real light to this movie, I still didn't see the significance of characters that echoed Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin respectively. Sure, these two singers were huge influences of the 1960's, but this is a movie about Beatles music, right? I was especially lost when the Sadie character started off with Jojo's band, then went solo and got hooked on alcohol. Her successful recovery from all this was never explained in the end, which had me feeling a bit cheated when I turned off the movie.The characters of Jojo and Sadie really show what this movie's big flaw is: the movie makers tried to cram too much into a two hour movie. Too many characters, too many subplots, too many radical messages, and (sadly) too many Beatles songs. As a result, some Beatles songs that may have been powerful in another context tended to fall flat. One such example is the section of the movie beginning with Bono singing ""I Am The Walrus"", and ending with Eddie Izzard's turn as Mr. Kite. That section of the movie was the exact moment where the movie lost it's message and said, ""Let's demonstrate the message of the '60's by having the main characters go on an acid trip"". It may have worked as a music video, but as a section of the movie it felt way too self-indulgent.Above all, the biggest problem I had with this movie was the idea that the main characters wrote the songs themselves. I would have liked to have seen even a cameo by Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr (perhaps not Yoko Ono), or even see the characters watching a live broadcast of one of their concerts. That would have made the movie feel a little more authentic to me, but of course, that is just my opinion.I reiterate when I say that this movie tried to bite off more than it could actually chew. It wasn't as bad as the Bee Gees' disastrous ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", which is why I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 after very careful consideration. I was debating whether to give this movie a 4 out of 10. I'll admit that it was a very ambitious movie, but at times it seemed so ambitious to the point of being haughty and arrogant. Like many big budget science fiction hits of the 1990's, this movie was great on visual effects, but not so great on a coherent storyline and characters you actually cared about. I'll definitely buy the soundtrack, because the different versions of the Beatles songs were indeed awe-inspiring. The rest of the movie, I'm sorry to say, just didn't do it for me. I know other people will like it, though, and I respect their decisions.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Here Comes The Sun... right into the cinema,"Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful motion picture this is! It didn't even start out that well. An awfully polished version of ""Helter Skelter"" and then some dancing and I thought this was the ""Sgt. Pepper's"" movie all over again. Thankfully, though, the movie got better with time. Much better.A great part of it has to do with the fact that the whole thing is built around the immortal music of The Beatles, of course. The weird thing is that none of the versions of the songs done by the actors is really any good all by itself (so DON'T get the soundtrack), but they were enhanced drastically by the beautiful and mind-blowing imagery and the charming story.""Across The Universe"" tells of the coming of age of a group of flower-power kids. The main storyline concerns a young couple that's torn apart by the Anti-War movement during the 70's. The whole thing is actually told very innocently. There's no explicit sex or excessive violence. The story may be a bit clich√©d and not a hundred percent believable (how could it be with people starting to dance and sing all the time?). However, that's not the point, because the movie does bring across the spirit of the time period during which it is set in a fashion that reminded me a lot of ""Forrest Gump"".""Across The Universe"" is very entertaining, appealing to the eye and the ear and it introduces a whole cast of new, talented faces. If there's one beef I have it's that my favorite Beatles song, the one I mentioned in the headline, is not used in the movie. Apart from that I can only recommend all of you - even those of you who don't like Musicals - do go see this brilliant tribute to the Fab Four and the 60's.",8.0,Anonymous,History
To be honest,"I don't think this movie was very good. Don't get me wrong, I love The Beatles, but this movie is not tied to them in my mind. They were Beatles songs, preformed in a way that wasn't as good as the original. In fact I found most of the songs to be pretty bad. They were the best part of the movie, but I would have preferred to just listen to the albums. Other than the music this movie really had nothing going for it. The plot was the worst of any film to be this popular. Plus, the second I found out the main character was name Jude I almost cried. I liked the Beatles references, but a like subtlety would have been nice. Overall it was just a bunch of under average Beatles cover songs, strung together in a loose plot, hardly a great film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it!!!,"I watched this because I saw Evan Rachel Wood was in and it was Beatles themed. I feared it might be to cheesy, but it wasn't. It was awesome. I grew up listening to the Beatles. I own every album, but admit I haven't listened to them much in recent years. I even saw them live on TV when I was very, very young. I even got to see Hendrix open up for the Monkees at Forest Hills. My uncle took me to see the Monkees, if I only knew what I know now.... I was only six.I liked the song selection of popular and obscure tracks. (if there's such a thing as an obscure Beatles song) I was hoping they would play my favorite, I Want You, She's So Heavy. I remember hearing that song when it first came out and was like this is cool!! I didn't think it would be in the movie, but it was!! Great scene for that song as well. That was one of the very first heavy metal songs. I think a few Beatles songs qualify for that title as well.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting Diversion,"Let me start by saying: I was prepared to hate this. How can you mess with perfection? Who would dare take classic Beatles tunes and repeatedly rearrange them? And just how coherent a plot could/would be fashioned to string them together?What I was met with was a likable cast ""reimagining"" the cultural highlights of the 1960s. Granted, it's ridiculous how the main characters keep showing up at every significant hippie event, but this isn't (obviously) about plotting. My concerns were well founded in that regard. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE desperately tries to connect these events and the characters (who are all pretty one dimensional). And the happy ending is pretty tacked on.But I found myself being compelled to watch it. And to enjoy it. For every ridiculous plot development (and there are many) comes a moment of audacity. The reimagined songs even work well, excepting the occasional clunker like ""Let It Be."" And Eddie Izzard provides a hilarious turn.Don't look too hard for content. Just go with the flow.

"'Hair was bad enough, but this is a load of dandruff.'","I can't better Philip French's dismissal (above) of this film (from his 'Observer' column). I am embarrassed for Ms Taymor, who - on the evidence of 'Titus' and 'Frida' - is a hugely talented filmmaker.But here the director's talents are only intermittently diverting, and cannot save what is an utterly pointless project.As 'versions' of the originals the songs are often attractively delivered, though too often with a bland professionalism that entirely lacks any edge. The Gospel choir, and perhaps some of 'Sadie''s numbers, are quite powerful in themselves, but even these positive examples hardly rate a notice in the context of what heights cinema musicals have already hit. The song-and-dance routines - though fanatically well disciplined (as if that would subdue all opposition!) - are uniformly appalling, and would have instantly bombed on the stage of any professional theatre. They are all manic energy without real engagement.It does not help that all the characters are annoyingly and rather dishonestly tangential to historical reality - like a reminiscence of the great originals ('Jude' = 'Paul Macartney', 'Sadie' = 'Janis Joplin' for instance), or merely inserted as an incarnation of a song (the otherwise pointless 'Prudence'), or of something wildly trippy in a cartoonish way (a brilliant Eddie Izzard completely wasted in a misfiring farrago entirely bereft of any identification with the hippy ethos - to call it 'pastiche' would be to wildly over-praise it).Even the more 'down-to-earth' scenes back in Liverpool lack any substance at all: Even the Albert Docks location looks as gentrified here as it has become in reality, at the hands of the property developers. (One would have expected the well-known team of British writers to have got this right, at least.) In fact the whole picture suffers from a total failure to identify with the time and culture it is feverishly and showily pursuing.And the more it pursues, the further off is that authentic psychedelic rainbow.Perhaps Julie Taymor is in pursuit of her own lost girlhood, which would explain the self-indulgence in the unspeakably trite American family clich√©s ... But surely better, in such a case, that she should have created or commissioned a more focused screenplay: This one seems hopelessly hung-up on squeezing in the absolute max. of Beatles songs.And we don't even get a decent pastiche of Dick Lester's witty style of early Beatles' music-video, for God's sake! Humour is indeed direly lacking - how the team of Clement and la Frenais, the writers of the gloriously funny and characterful 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet' saga, could ever agree to pen this flat, bland, po-faced, Americanisation of a major part of their own popular cultural heritage from the industrial North of England is beyond me! And the hyper-Hollywood style of 'musical number' sits very ill with the naivety at the heart of the subject. The truth is, I am afraid, that the film is ludicrously over-ambitious in terms of mere personal grandstanding by the director at her most showy: 'Look at me, isn't this brilliant?' Actually, 'No, Ms Taymor.' As director she neither reveals nor evokes any love for her subject. It is indeed a really stupid movie, whose ambition is all for the perfection of the surfaces, but which possesses not one spark of inspiration whatsoever.But the biggest mistake of all was to portray the whole era as some kind of alternative reality, existing 'Across the Universe,' which actually lacks inspiration and magic in direct proportion to its distance from the original milieu that inspired the songs (a kind of Anti-Oz one might say). Crucially, since the film's entire mise en scene is set neither in any convincing 'then' nor in any engaging 'now' it is difficult to see what possible relevance or attraction it possesses for any audience.Taymor has been lost in this No-Man's-Land, which is the result of exposing the inadequate simplicities of the sketchy plot to the whole industrial panoply of Hollywood: She wanders through a scene of artistic devastation, amongst groves of burnt-out and songless trees. And were that (or something like) a defining image of her own creation, we might at least have had a half-decent anti-war movie! As it is, even Cliff Richard's safe old 'Summer Holiday' vehicle seems more relevant and punchy.And what sublime madness could a Ken Russell in his reprobate heyday have wrought with such a subject ....! But we torment ourselves with such 'might-have-beens.' Or rather, these things have been before, and far better done, and there was absolutely no reason for this film to exist in the first place. It is a completely misbegotten enterprise and will be utterly forgotten by next week, if not sooner.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Credit due to Daniel Ezralow for choreography,"Credit should be given here for Daniel Ezralow. He choreographed all the great dance sequences. The best being especially the Army ""recruiting"" office. Then the excellent puppets Taymor is so great at--Juan Darien--and the lion king. A great uncredited nod to Bread and Puppet theater, in the protest march. And especially on the farm in Vermont, a very direct reference. Eddie Izard and Bono lend a poignant touch in reference to the Beatles themselves. Many special details. This was a surprise when it came out for how close it stayed to the New York art scene. They maintained their artistic control overall. Really surprising to see Salma Hayak as a nurse with special drugs.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but very close to it","It was one of those movies that couldn't be over with fast enough for me. It was utterly boring and I kept hoping that something profound would happen to change my mind. That doesn't happen.I must agree with another comment that I read. This is more or less a dumbing down of history during the 60's. The feel of the 60's just wasn't there at all. I was born in 1950, so I did experience the period. I joined the Army reserves to avoid being drafted (not a good move today) and staying out of Vietnam. I listened to a little transistor radio in bed every night to song requests from young girls nearly in tears who had boyfriends or husbands that were in Vietnam. Sometimes the requests for dead soldiers or sailors. After the requests they always played ""Mister Lonely"" by Bobby Vinton. Nearly 60,000 Americans were killed in the Vietnam war. We saw it on the 6 o'clock news every night. This movie doesn't capture any of this. It was a dark period in American history, not a musical.The singing was okay but the entire ""story"" was so contrived just to fit Beatle songs to it. The attempt is really lame. Most of the characters had names that are in the lyrics of Beatle songs, that were eventually sung during the course of the movie (no surprise there).I don't make too many comments about movies, but if this help people take notice of how bad this movie really is, then I feel like I'm doing my part. This is a really bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
without doubt the best movie of 2007!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"totally captivating and an enthralling experience. the only film to really move me this past year! brilliantly conceived and executed with imagination that is refreshing! it took some stones to come with this structure, re-envision the iconic characters of the 1960 and then to weave the Beatles song catalog into a vibrate narrative. that alone was impressive, but add to the some truly inspired voices and performances and it makes for a grand journey. that said it suffers slightly from the standard musical problem in that the exposition gets redundant when spoken vs. songs scenes are used. for me the musical number were far more engaging, due in no small part the genius of the Beatles.

"Imagine There's No Heaven, Just People Loving One Another Here on Earth","A fresh breeze sweeping away the cloud of gloom that has descended on Hollywood this fall, ""Across the Universe"" is a nice antidote to all of those grimy, dour films currently filling movie theatres. The point of all of those seems to be that we live in a crappy world. The point of ""Across the Universe"" is that sure, things may be crappy now, but they've been crappy before, and as long as the important things -- like love -- remain, the world we live in can always get better.A simplistic message? Perhaps. But no less welcome for that. Stage veteran Julie Taymor, most known for her revolutionary staging of the Broadway musical ""The Lion King,"" sets her movie in the turbulent 60s, when anti-Vietnam sentiments and racial discord were reaching a boiling point, but there's no doubt that the criticism of American foreign policy is aimed squarely at the leadership of today who currently have us embroiled in another potential Vietnam, Iraq. The movie unfolds in bursts of song and color (the score is comprised completely of Beatles tunes), and even though the movie is far too long given its wisp of a plot, it mostly manages to sustain an infectious energy.The Beatles songs mostly sound great, and they're used creatively. I already knew I liked the Beatles, but hearing their songs performed here in a different context reawakened an appreciation for them. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" for example, originally a perky pop anthem, becomes here a heartbreaking ballad performed by a young girl in love whose object of affection doesn't return the favor. ""Come Together"" plays over a dazzling montage juxtaposing New York's Wall Street elite (represented by a troupe of suited business men dancing in unison) to its disenfranchised. And ""Let It Be"" becomes a gospel anthem underscoring the Detroit riots. Other songs fare less well, like ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" which feels awkwardly shoe-horned into the film.The young cast of mostly unknowns is attractive and engaging, even if the film doesn't demand much from them. The standout for me was Dana Fuchs, playing a singer obviously modeled after Janis Joplin.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,History
I saw it twice!  Strange but fun,"This takes place in the late 60s-early 70s. A British man named Jude (Jim Sturgess) goes to America to find his father. He ends up buddies with Max (Joe Anderson) who goes to Columbia. He falls in love with Joe's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). They all end up in NYC--Max is sent off to the war and Jude and Lucy fall in love--but her obsession with stopping the war starts to tear them apart. And characters break into song at any given moment--and they sing Beatles songs!The story is VERY familiar but no one is here for the story. You're seeing this for the imagery and to see HOW they fit 33 Beatles songs into this. The last time Beatles songs were used was in 1978 in the camp ""classic"" ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"". This is nowhere near as bad. The songs work in seamlessly--they just flow out of the characters and it never seems forced. The songs are done very well--everybody on board can sing and the imagery is just incredible. The first song--Sturgees singing the first two stanzas to ""Girl"" with no music and a dismal setting just won't leave me. The view of a bunch of men being drafted and carrying the Statue of Liberty to ""She's So Heavy"" is both funny and a slap in the face to the Bush administration. And wait till you see Bono (from U2) singing ""I Am the Walrus""! It really blew me away--most of the time I sat there just slack-jawed at what I was seeing. I did enjoy it but there were problems.It was far too long--133 minutes. Also they give characters names from Beatle songs (Lucy, Sadie, Max and JoJo) and then don't even use the songs! Strange. Also one character is introduced coming in through the bathroom window (Get it?). Also there are glaring gaps in the story and characterization--I'm assuming there were cuts in the script or the movie. And Sturgees is OK but doesn't have the charisma to carry the whole film. Still, I saw this film twice in a theatre (I never do that) and liked it even better the second time. I had forgotten some of it. Turning ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" into a frat house song is LOTS of fun!So--I did like it but the length and story lapses might bother some people. I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Great tribute to the Beatles,"Before seeing this movie, I knew very little about it. I knew the soundtrack was comprised of only Beatles song, and that was about it. So I decided to give it a shot, and quickly fell in love with the creativity, and uniqueness this movie offered. For the first musical with an all Beatles soundtrack, this movie paid great justice to the band. The songs were not rearranged, or edited so much that the music becomes hard to recognize; rather each singer sung the song their own style, but kept the flow and rhythm the Beatles originally created.The coolest part about this movie, was the way the plot developed around the songs. For example many of the characters names were taken straight out of the Beatles songs, and then in different situations songs would be used to express emotion, or want. It was one of the most creative movies i have ever seen, and the choreography made it phenomenal. Two scenes in particular were exception, the bowling alley seen has amazing choreography, and the Benefits of Mr. Kite song display the creatively of this film. Overall I quickly appreciated the film for its distinct artistic style, and it was very easy to see how much more artistic it is from other movies.As well as being creative and artistic, the movie is driven by events happening during the era in which the Beatles lived(60s) with events such as the Vietnam war, race riots, and political problems. The movie seemed real in every event, and it was amazing to see what Beatles songs would the situation that was occurring.This movie is a must see, the characters are great, the singing is great, and the overall creativity was amazing to watch. This movie is one that I wanted to go on for a couple more hours, and was sad to see it end. In the end, a great tribute to the Beatles, and a very intriguing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"When It Works, It's Magical (And When it Doesn't, It's Still Cool)","Across the Universe does several things gloriously. First and foremost, it tells an archetypal love story (that is, a love story that is intended to be familiar and universal, not novel and quirky) and makes it incredibly moving by doing it as a musical using many of the best Beatles songs (more about that later). It's visually stunning and features some of the most audacious, jaw-dropping choreography to come out of Hollywood in years. And it paints a very solid picture of the political unrest and psychedelic exploration that fueled the 60's.It's in the latter sequences where the movie sometimes misfires slightly. The straightforward Beatles love songs are almost always complete successes. The problem comes when the script tries to incorporate the tripper songs from their psychedelic period (""Strawberry Fields,"" ""I am the Walrus,"" ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite""). These lyrics aren't really about anything the way ""It Won't Be Long"" or ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" are, and the scenes built around them (while wildly inventive and entertaining if regarded in isolation) come across as slightly forced and/or bring the plot to a halt.The music? I'm a former rock critic who owns nearly 2000 CDs, none by the Beatles. It's not that I don't think they're great, it's just that these songs have been so overplayed, I really feel no need to hear them again. The versions here are almost uniformly terrific and serve as incredible reminders of just how great these songs are. If you're someone of my generation who acknowledges that ""Hey Jude"" is a brilliant song but is just plain bored by it after the 1000th listening, run to the theater, because hearing it here is like hearing it for the first time (maybe better, since it's embedded in a love story that, by this point in the film, has really grabbed you). And if you want to know whether a film critic can be trusted with movie music, see if they hated the music here but loved the music in ""Dreamgirls"": if so, they're musically illiterate.8/10 (and I'm a tough grader: that means I loved it and endorse it without reservation).",7.0,Anonymous,History
A bad movie with no story to tell.,"I'm not a Beatles fan, I never was and never will be. However, the impact they had on world music is undeniable, and it continues to this day, with influences on different singers and composers, from Pop universe to the most erudite authors. For a band that only lasted ten years, it is very significant. Therefore, this film will certainly be to the liking of the fans of the band, but I confess that, for me, it was not that interesting.Let's start with the obvious: the film is a musical where the band's songs are the structural point. So far, so good. The problem is that everything revolves around the songs, including the script, which is an extraordinarily confusing romantic story between an American girl and a boy from Liverpool. From a certain point, it becomes evident that the film does not work and does not have a story to tell, and all of this is a mere excuse for a musical film that had the Beatles as its theme. And a movie, no matter how bad, has to have a story to tell, and that story has to justify the movie and its length. For the story told in this film, a short film of half an hour would be enough.The cast has some well-known names, starting with Jim Sturgess, who brought with him a solid career made in British TV. The actor is good, and he works hard, making a good match with Evan Rachel Wood, who also does everything she can to improve the quality of the film. Unfortunately, they don't have the material to do much more than they did, and the supporting cast does nothing more than show up and sing when they need it. The characters are terrible, boring and one-dimensional.Technically, it is an animated, vibrant, colorful and cheerful film, and this will surely attract the audience. Visually, it's a pleasant film, with cinematography full of bright colors and light, and a solid and consistent film work. The sets and costumes fulfill their role. Being a musical film, songs and choreography are essential but even that didn't go well: the Beatles' songs, sung almost in a religious, formal way, without great emotion or commitment from the singers, are accompanied by a set of choreographies that have nothing special or cinematic, seeming more thought for the TV than for the big screen.",1.0,Anonymous,History
An EPIC Film.. Must see for everyone over 35!!,"When I first saw the previews, I knew this movie would be a cornerstone film in many ways. The modern song arrangements and the modern visuals took the Beatles music to a new level. Music and Lyrics such as these were never more relevant, and I doubt we will ever see music as relevant again. I was just a young boy in this era (I,m 44 now), but this movie transports the viewer back in time and slices into the hearts and minds of the generation that changed a world. Julie Taymor's vision and the choreography and special effects brought the surrealistic 60's into a sharper focus. As someone who missed Beatle Mania, but clung to their music in later years, this movie answered so many questions about the songs and the songwriting of these musical geniuses. Their music will always be the standard of what musicians should be, the voice of the masses. The performances of this young group of actors should be revered.",10.0,Anonymous,History

There are characters that exist purely as an excuse to sing certain songs.

I want to retain my good memories of the Beatles songs, so I had to walk out. I was just unbearable. The music didn't quite fit the scene or the way the scene was depicted just didn't seem to match anything. There was no real plot, I couldn't care less about the Characters. There's nothing redeemable about this movie. It's as if it was thrown together by people that don't understand the essence of the music except from the lyrics,..in a mechanical sense. The problem with todays movie writers, is that they're a bunch of young insignificant plagarists with no real experience in life. So, they try to emulate the ""60""s for what it was and instead created a big shlop of phoniness. Come on people, if you're going to make a movie, you better find a writer that lived and breathed that Era. Even Bono's part seemed so plastic and badly written. I got know feeling from this movie. Okay I downloaded it to finish what I started and still couldn't bear to see it through. I had to skip around just to bear watching what happened at the end which was quite stupid. I'm surprised this movie got a high score. I bet a bunch of Timberlake fans gave it a high score. I read an article in the Times magazine that the X generation and E generation ( today's youth ) are some of the dumbest group of kids this planet has ever known.

I had heard only good things about it and came out a little disappointed.Although the cinematography and overall visual of the film was edgy the plot left much to be desired. It was the typical 1960s struggle and din't bring anything new to the table.The music was what kept intrigued throughout the film. Without it I don't think this film would have been a success at all. The singing and choreography was wonderful but did not do enough to keep me fully intrigued.It was definitely a good film to watch on a snowy afternoon but It isn't something I would watch over and over again. The cookie cutter plot did not do enough to warrant a second or third watching.,7.0,Anonymous,History
"A great, almost excellent film.","This movie is my favorite musical of all times, including the nostalgic Disney movies such as ""Snow White,"" which I watched as a small child. The coregraphics are fun, and the covers are sure to enchant youngsters into loving the Beatles.On the negative side, the editing was not that great. The whole thing with Bono and Eddie Izzard could have cut out. There was no real point, the characters went around, pursuing their music dreams and enjoying life. The only real things this movie has going for it is the characters and music. Thankfully, that is going well enough to carry the film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"If you are a child of the sixties, see this movie.","I wrote in the present tense, because you still have to be in touch with that child to enjoy this movie. Julie Traymor has really captured the feel of that decade with this production. To those youngsters who don't get it, I cannot apologize, because, to quote Walter Cronkite, ""That's the way it was."" I wondered at one point if Ms. Traymor had been one of my college girlfriends. It seemed she was writing the movie about me. My wife kept elbowing me at points in the film where we had been together in a particular scene. It was an amazing journey; it was written about my youth, and it captured the mixture of ecstasy and agony that was the 1960s.Obviously the movie has its flaws. Some of them are part of the story, however. The 1960s were a flawed decade. To those of us who remember, it is a time we look back on with both a yearning and a dread. The remarkable thing is how well the movie recreates both, and all at the same time. If you want to remember, go see it. If you want to take a stab at understanding the sixties, then go see it too, but pay attention because it's a complicated lesson.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This movie musical experiment proves mostly positive,"Julie Taymor's Beatles movie musical ""Across the Universe"" has multiple personalities. At one point you're watching a drama--then a music video--then an art piece--then an actual stage musical--then a raging acid trip--and back to a drama again. The good news is the film leaves you with its strongest form: drama musical, and it leaves you feeling good.The music is awesome. The arrangements of these Beatles songs are great, modern and given beautiful, fresh voices. It's a definite soundtrack buy. The only problem is that sometimes the songs are portrayed in the film in ways that don't work or that simply detract from what the viewer really wants to see and cares most about--the characters, specifically Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and their relationship. It gets cheated a lot in the film for characters that really don't matter in the end, yet we still care about them, so I guess that's what matters most.Basically, everything but the really ""out there"" musical-like sequences and the psychedelic scenes works. It's a constant guessing game and a fight as to which you're going to get with each song. The film can go for 20 minutes or so as a drama musical and then all of a sudden you get a scene like when Max (Lucy's brother played by Joe Anderson) goes to the army and you have dancing recruitment officers with abstract faces. Other scenes like ""Strawberry Fields"" gives a very emotional music video type feel that contrasts Jude's art with scenes of the Vietnam War. It is awesome and beautifully done by Taymor.""Across the Universe"" only suffers in this inconsistency. It could also use about 30 min shaved off. Otherwise it is a truly heartfelt love story with some of the best music of the 20th century. Fortunately, in the end, its best stuff comes out on top and leaves you with a generally if not overwhelmingly satisfying feeling. Without the excellent ending, you'd be left wondering what exactly the movie was trying to be. I'm still wondering just a bit, but I'm content with the general outcome.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing Movie that is Worth Eight Dollars,"I thought that this movie was amazing!! My friends and I are only 14 years old, but we could relate to this movie. As my friend commented about the summery: they did drugs and fell in love, stopped drugs and broke up, did drugs again and got back together. I thought this was a funny but true summery. I absolutely loved the cinematography and all of the different camera angles. It truly helped the movie be creative.I loved all of the songs in the movie. In fact, they're all on my iPod. Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, and Joe Anderson have amazing voices! My favorite song is ""Blackbird"". It surprised me how much of the Beatles were in the movie, even though the people themselves weren't.I will admit, the ending kind of dragged along, but I still think the movie is definitely worth the eight dollars my friends and I spent.

Too much Beatlemania here but not bad!,"Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Like a flying Lennonball, another Beatle homage musical has crossed the cinematic universe that has a familiar ringo to it. It is Director Julie Taymor's love-story jingle narrative ""Across The Universe"". A plethora of Beatle tunes are incorporated within the plot of a young Liverpool lad named Jude who crosses the pond to America and meets a gorgeous born-into-wealth ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"". Jude travels to America primarily to meet his estranged father who is an Ivy League university janitor so they can ""Come Together"". There, Jude meets a ""Day Tripper"" college student named Max and with ""A Little Help From His Friend"", Jude meets Max's sister none other than Lucy herself. Mad Max is exhausted by his family demands on striving to succeed so he rebels and consequently Jude & Max move to America Beatleland, New York. In that ""Apple City Field Forever"", they meet a group of bohemians including a sexy cougar singer/landlord Sadie, a Jimi Hendriexian guitar player Jo-Jo, and an Asian lesbian Prudence. Not before long, Lucy joins them in New York after her boyfriend is killed in combat. ""Hey Jude"" now Lucy is available and before you can say ""I Love Lucy"", they fall for each other and all ""They Need Is Love"" now to exist joyously in this universe. ""Across The Universe"" then dwells into 60's themes such as war, democracy, violence, sex, drugs, an of course rock n roll. Cutesy for a 60's themed film but all too familiar; but I ""Let It Be"" since it is a film of the ""hippie hippie hooray"" era. I do commend the actors for their theatrical efforts in taking on such challenging characters, but none of the performances caused me to ""Shout"" with exhilaration for their thespian contributions. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais are the ""Paperback Writers"" of the screenplay of ""Across The Universe"", but their film paper should have screamed ""Help"" because it lacked originality and authenticity. Director Taymor tames it well with the visuals in the musical sequences but has a ""Ticket to Override"" by inserting an overabundance of Beatle tunes which take away the realism of the film's romantic plot line. ""Across The Universe"" is not out of this universe, but not bad to check out after a ""Hard Day's Night"". *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,History
Ridiculous,"This movie starts out pretty good for the first 20 minutes or so. The first hint of strangeness is when the cheerleader begins singing I wanna hold your hand' sung from a distance where she longingly sings about the head cheerleader.

"Oh, the 60's...","Don't listen to the mixed reviews: ""Across the Universe"" is a gorgeous, psychedelic musical, and easily my favourite film of 2007 so far. Julie Taymor (a Broadway veteran owner of a stunning visual style, as you can see in her previous features, ""Titus"" and ""Frida"") has created a breathtaking masterpiece that's even comparable to Baz Luhrmann's unique ""Moulin Rouge!"" (I'm biased, though, since ""Moulin Rouge!"" is my personal favourite musical ever).Yes, the movie is just a ""2-hour music video"", but a fantastic one at that. The Beatles' songs are more than enough material for a great musical, and Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais (""The Commitments"") know that. You can call some of the plot elements cheesy, but they work as fun stereotypes of the 60's. I was born in the late 80's and enjoyed the film with a ""nostalgic"" feel... you don't need to have lived in the 60's to know it was a time like no other: for music and the world itself; a time of change and war, but also of fun and passion. Maybe it's because today's popular songs are about umbrellas and putting *it* into your mouth, maybe it's because The Beatles were just plain great, but ""Across the Universe"" arrives at the right time, introducing Paul, John, George & Ringo to a new generation. It's the kind of movie you should go watch with your parents and/or grandparents, and all of you will enjoy it equally (I promise:). The young cast (Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson and the revelation Dana Fuchs - what a voice that woman has!) does a fine job, and there are fun cameos by Bono, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek (sexiest singing nurse ever? I think so!), it's the only movie I've ever gone to see twice in theaters (and maybe I'll go see it again, if I have time while it's still playing). Generally, even if I love a film I've just seen in theaters, I wait for the DVD to see it again; but ""Across the Universe"" is one of those that deserves to be seen on a big screen, for the experience. Watch it on a double feature with the classic ""A Hard Day's Night"" (1964), and be prepared for a fun time celebrating an era like no other. 10/10.",,Anonymous,History
"Aims High, Falls Short.","This heartfelt homage to the music and turbulent era of The Beatles certainly doesn't lack ambition, but it probably wasn't such a great idea to begin with. Knitting together a cohesive narrative from a random song selection is overreaching, and it shows. Unfortunately, the creators got carried away with themselves and let this thing go on far too long. Would have been better as a string of lively musical numbers without any of the boring dialog, which failed to tie it all together anyway. And ditch those pseudo-soul-searching renditions of the ballads ¬ñ The Beatles never let themselves become so maudlin. The cast is good, except for Evan Rachel Wood, who is one-dimensional. Enjoyed the Maurice Binder/James Bond-style closing credits best, but like the songs themselves, I would have preferred seeing the original James Bond title sequences instead.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Best film of 2007,"Though still unreleased in the Netherlands, I was fortunate to see it at a special screening of Oscar nominated movies. This was the only film shown for which the audience actually applauded at the end. Yes, it's that good.Creating a story which encompasses the gamut of '60s era experiences, the film uses 32 Beatles songs to tell its story. At once a moving love story and a stunning exploration of the counter culture emerging in reaction to the Vietnam war, the film grabs from the beginning and doesn't release you until the last credits have rolled off the screen.I saw every major film last year, and was one of the few who thought 2007a weak year. So many of the film released left me both disillusioned and depressed at the state of the world. This one gave me hope....hope not only that the world can actually be a place of beauty, but also hope that film is not a dying art. I was totally engaged throughout the movie, and didn't want it to end.I am amazed that it is already out on DVD in America, and am ordering it today.

The colors and the dream-like sequences make for an amazing movie-going experience and well, the music speaks for itself.

Uneven...at times brilliant...many times over-indulgent and,"Uneven...at times brilliant...many times over-indulgent and overwrought. Weak on storytelling most of the time, this film relies on its one overpowering asset, the Beatles' music, which is undeniably compelling. Shamelessly evoking iconographic images of the time, the film has little to say about them. A light entertainment that doesn't, in the end, amount to much. Really just a longish music video. OK for that. There are definitely worse ways to spend an hour and a half. To a new generation unfamiliar with the Beatles' music it maintains the integrity of the songs while adding images that vary from poetic to silly.

Nice,"Across the Universe (2007)*** (out of 4)Much like Paul McCartney's marriages, this film is rather hit and miss but you have to give the director credit for trying something like this. I've always wondered what would happen if you tries to make a movie using nothing but songs as well as using song lyrics as dialogue. I really don't think the story here matters too much so I won't go into it. The film at least can make Beatles fans forgotten the God-awful Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I thought the music selections were very good with a few of the songs coming pretty close to matching the original recordings. I've always preferred Joe Cocker's version of ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" but I think the version here is just as great. The scene here comes off very fun as does other numbers including ""Strawberry Fields Forever"". I thought the climatic ""Hey Jude"" was pretty awful though. I also thought the film was too ambitious in that it tries to be cute but then turns pretty dark at the end. The political nonsense started to get rather boring and I thought the film went on for way too long.",,Anonymous,History

"The Perfect Incarnation of a Song, a Testament of Love Surviving So Much","Because this film lingered in my mind because of its brandished originality and progressive contribution to the movie-going experience, I looked through a little bit of history behind the subject matter. As nearly everyone aware of this film knows, it's a musical with a story outlined and directed by a selection of Beatles songs, one of them sharing a title with the movie. In the song, there is a lyric that expresses an overbearing accost of creativity and ideas, ""words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup."" It came to Lennon after the minuscule matter of hearing his wife talking up a storm. That night, he kept hearing those words over and over and took advantage of the indefinite streak of thought, developing it into something of a song. When he was done, he apparently went to bed and forgot about them and in the morning, he found them and brought them to his piano, where he began to play chords, and find pitches to match the words.This process can be assumed about the way in which this film was made, as its style, spirit, and flow all suggest. The perfect incarnation of a song, an idea very tough to execute but intensely, brilliantly, enthusiastically, very imaginatively, and boldly so by Taymor, and as anarchically as the studio's PG-13 limitations would allow her to. The idea of the premise is something that is hard to imagine sitting down and brainstorming out and rather something that accosts you at any given time, convenient or not, and you can only record what has spilled from your mind at that given moment. The film executes the concept by finding themes, subject, and feelings that match the skeleton that is the outline of all of the songs. One of the most telling keys to the aforementioned is how the story opens with the allegory of an Englishman coming to the US, then proceeding to affect and inspire the lives of a diverse range of Americans he comes into contact with.Perhaps my favorite part of the film is the Hey Jude sequence. To me, what is portrayed is all that that wonderfully uplifting and energizing song can be about, and consequently a imaginative personification of how it can make you feel.The film's story, revolving around the arching transformations of our culture throughout the 1960s seen with the focus upon a group of people who become affiliated with each other and drift in and out of each other's lives like the tempests and flights of fancy that were very much what the Beatles' music was for people's lives in that era, which is the central reason why Taymor's vision is so wonderfully ablaze with the true meaning of the word ""brilliant."" Not just because the premise sounds unfamiliar compared to what we normally see. To me, a director like her is yearned for in the cinema when it comes to giving tangibly emotional identity to feelings and meanings that are hardly thought to be possible to express in movies. Aside from the uniqueness in the importance of the film's axis concept, an important example is the character of Prudence being depressed because of the impulsive heterosexual attractions of Lucy, played by the stunning Evan Rachel Wood, and Jude, played by the potential rather than kinetic energy of Jim Sturgess, and of Sadie (Fuchs) and Jojo (McCoy) and how much more complicated her own sexuality is and how difficult it is to express it even in a time of such sexual freedom and change, and how painful that must be. It's a small part of the story, just like it was a small part of one's attention during that era.This film goes with its own flow with absolutely no regard for a judgmental view, thus you are forced to go with the flow, take its chances, and accept its rambling taking of license. I admire any film that does so.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A magical mystery faux pas, but pleasant enough until it strays beyond its superficial remit","Rarely have I fallen in love with a picture so much in the first half, yet been utterly bored by the second. But every viewer is different. I will explain my reservations about Across the Universe in the hope that the information might help you decide to like it.It is a musical based entirely on songs by the Beatles. As it has a nominal story of its own, it would be unfair to call it an extended music video. Just be prepared for a story predicated on the songs, not vice versa.The first thing you notice is the songs are sung well. Exceedingly well. They even ¬ñ dare I say ¬ñ improve on the originals quite often. It reminds me of Eva Cassidy singing a classic like Somewhere Over the Rainbow. She found depths of beauty of her own and discovered the song in a whole new way. This is possible in Across the Universe because, instead of using actors that can sing a bit (a particular bugbear of mine), they use singers who can act a bit. Pretty young things with voices that could sweep to victory in any X-Factor sing-off.For anyone who loved the originals of I Want to Hold Your Hand and Hold Me Tight, this is the best homage imaginable. Simple boy-meets-girl kicks off a standard 3-part plot and your emotions can soar to the fullness of Lennon-McCartney lyrics.One of the best ever films to make use of popular songs in this way was Singing in the Rain. In those days, there was a ready stable of stars that could sing, dance and act ¬ñ and usually all three at once. The film used a fairly topical story (the advent of sound in movies) and barrel-loads of charisma and humour. It is a formula that was easier for studios of old than ones of today.But Across the Universe falls down not because it doesn't have a good story. It falls down because of two major errors in plot development. Dock worker Jude travels to America to find estranged dad. A few subplots later he falls for Lucy. Lucy's brother is drafted into the (VietNam) war and this is where it all starts to go horribly wrong.The love songs have gone terribly well with attractive leads that make no great demands on their acting skills. But launch the film into extended tragedy and their inexperience sadly shows. The second mistake is the choice of plot focus. We are in the 'Summer of Love' ¬ñ the 60s era of Flower Power, psychedelic drugs, and disillusionment with society (especially the war). The message was to turn on, tune in, drop out. (I know - I grew up in the tail end of flower power.) But to make a musical that focuses on the horrors of war is a very major undertaking, and well beyond the otherwise exemplary grasp of these filmmakers. They miss almost any reference to drugs (smoking hash and dropping LSD ¬ñ acid ¬ñ was a central part of the flower power era) and Jude and his friends seem to sidestep the philosophy completely. Which also seems a bit untrue to the Beatles. If they had to miss drugs for the censors, a few references to meditation, for instance, would not have gone amiss. Consequently, when Jude triumphs with All You Need is Love, it sounds hollow and unconvincing.The film is worth watching for the superb interpretation of most of the songs, especially in the first half. Surprisingly, the two well-known celebrities perform worst in terms of singing. They should have been omitted from the trailer. Bono is a great performer, but cannot compete vocally with more classically trained voices. Likewise Eddie Izzard might be a great comedian but his rendering of Mr Kite is at odds with the original tone of the song and his singing is variety show shouting. Producers would have done well to study the Beatles' ""Magical Mystery Tour"" for this section.Across the Universe starts well but ends sanitised and unsatisfying. Excellent symbolism ¬ñ for instance, soldiers tramping VietNamese jungle underfoot merely to carry a gigantic Statue of Liberty ¬ñ is wasted by a story that stays in the mud rather than soars. The only turn on is fairly shallow. The only psychedelics are in the well-worn photo-effects. And the meticulous costumes fail to re-create an era that was more liberal than today.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe is Wonderful,"""Across the Universe"" is a radiant, artistic, psychedelic and excellent experience that evokes a great period where peace, love, war and music walked side by side. With a story set between 1967 and 1968 and filled with musical and cultural references this is a fantastic film that really takes you back to that period, making you sing along with The Beatles classics performed by the great ensemble cast and singers like Bono and Joe Cocker.The story follows the love story between Jude (Jim Sturgess), a poor English in America and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) an upper class American girl. We also see the circle of friends of both characters such as Lucy's brother Max (Joe Anderson), the singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), the guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Prudence (T.V.Carpio). We join their reactions towards the many turbulent events around them such as the Vietnam war, the discovery of love, rock n'roll, art and many others. And they sing The Beatles songs.I won't explain too much of the story and I'm only gonna write why it was a great film. Director Julie Taymor made a very captivating film about an era very similar like ""Almost Famous"" or ""Hair"". The way The Beatles's songs were used, or better saying, the context in which it was used was beautiful, magical, intelligent and worked very well. For instance when Jude is introduced to Max's friends and they sang ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" (great funny moment) or when the Max was enlisted by the Amry it starts to play ""I Want You"" and the Uncle Sam poster pointing at him. And of course the Beatles references (many songs couldn't been introduced here so there are cases when a character's name reminds you of a song or something said by a character like Jude's boss saying that things would look different when he was 64 years old) and rock references such as Jimi Hendrix (JoJo) and Janis Joplin (Sadie). It was a great mix of things.In the beginning I thought the movie was becoming one of those musicals where you almost laugh at it, many of the songs wasn't good performed by the actors but when Joe Cocker appeared singing ""Come Together"" I was really in the mood of the film, and after that it was delightful to follow and at many times sing along almost all the songs. And I changed my mind about the whole thing (except for the performance of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", that really bothers me, the girl sings too much).It is like a 2 hour video clip but it's a very good video clip. All actors are great, dramatically and performing the songs. Jim Sturgess what an inspiration...Great leading actor here and the chemistry between he and Evan Rachel Wood was amazing. There are few special appearances of Eddie Izzard (Mr. Kite), Dylan Baker, Bill Irwin, Logan Marshall-Green (unrecognizable as a protest leader) and Salma Hayek (who worked with Julie Taymor in ""Frida"", she plays a nurse in a musical scene).Best moments: Bono singing ""I am the Walrus""; the whole cast singing ""Because""; the performance on the rooftop reminder of Abbey Road; Jude throwing Strawberries on the wall and the result of one of his art works; JoJo and Sadie electrifying performances on stage; Max's jokes; anyway everything was excellent here. Definitely a memorable film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the more hit or miss films in recent memory,"The incomparable Julie Taymor strikes again with her vastly ambitious musical set to alternate versions of Beatles songs. Certainly with it's share of misfires, some a little embarrassing, Across the Universe is still a wildly creative and sometimes stirring roller-coaster ride down the interpretative lens of some of the world's most successful pop song lyrics.What Taymor sets out to accomplish in her film is nothing short of miraculous. By organizing her so-so plot about two lovers and a myriad of supporting characters around many of the groups most popular songs, and in fact synchronizing scene after scene so the lyrics often literally translate out on screen at that moment within the context of her story, she is obviously going to have some sequencing not fit in the most intuitive way, as the film's slow beginning hints.When this restless director is firing on all cylinders however, Across the Universe becomes a marvel of beauty, an exquisite mixture of sight and sound no less powerful then when Pink Floyd's The Wall film debuted. Never mind the slight controversy of remaking these classic songs by different artists-although a few seem misinterpreted or just flat out butchered, I feel any true Beatle fan will feel like justice has been done to paint their visionary music along the skyline of consciousness.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Violently painful Beatles Karaoke by talentless singers instead of a script.,"What a wretchedly annoying plot gimmick that makes this whole movie agony to watch.

Reminded me that Cinema is indeed an art form,"Remember? Cinema is an art form. Somewhere between the hollywoodish sky high explosions and walking talking 3D animals it seems we forgot about this. Movie-magic was somehow just limited to entertainment, rarely transcending into art. ""Across the universe"" makes this journey. And completes it in style.The movie is beautiful. The lives and times of a bunch of young new yorkers living in a troubled era in American history is beautifully captured on canvas and then pulled on the movie screen. The colors liven up the psychedelic images that so truly defines an era that I've only read about. The music makes the time period come alive in a way that - well only Beatles could.A young lad named Jude from across the Atlantic searching for his dad. A beautiful teenager named Lucy who loses her first love to a war that few understood (Bonus points if you made the connections on the names with the lyrics of those boys from Liverpool). A Princeton dropout. An up and coming singer. A troubled guitarist whose music is fueled by angst. The characters are rich and deep. The interconnections that happen between these individuals seems magical and real at the same time. Music is mastered and voiced adding a layer of beauty of the Beatles' tunes that defined a generation. In many ways the movie is reflective of current reality of war and violence, and in some ways vastly different than the world we live in today - somehow the energy of the grassroots power that existed back then (both in good and bad elements of society) seems to be lacking today.Epochal events like Vietnam, Dr. King's death, Hippie movement are all so beautifully presented, that sometimes I felt it is almost a shame that those kids didn't change the world. Or maybe they did.The only wiggling question I had at the end of the movie: was it a tad too long? At times, imagery became too abstract and livid to effectively contribute to the narrative. But it's just a brushing thought that in no way dilutes the beauty of the final product.The movie was a delightful treat. It's a perfect movie for one of those lukewarm afternoons when it's raining outside and normally you'd grab a CD to listen to some good ol' rock n' roll. Pop this DVD in. You just might be pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I had a terrible 'across the universe' flashback (no drugs involved!),"I saw this movie's screening about a month ago and had completely blocked the experience from my mind this morning until i was listening to Abbey Road.It would be cruel to call ""Across the Universe"" a two hour music video because it tries so hard to be more than that, but it wouldn't be entirely inaccurate either. The movie can be summed up as a series of punctuated scenes and characters each represented by a Beatles song and strung together by a boilerplate love story.Of course, these criteria don't preclude the movie from being a true gem. But the real failing of any music video is the inability to explore beyond the literal meaning of a song. Of course, in an ideal world all directors re-imagine an established song or leverage both its nuance and cultural weight. In the best of cases, a movie allows music to transcend its established history. In the worst of cases, music is exploited for its most superficial meaning. Sadly, too often, Across the Universe is guilty of the latter.Unfortunately, any negative review of this movie may seem like a 'book' vs 'movie' comparison. Surely if ""the movie's never as great as the book,"" a movie that utilizes culturally loaded music is equally likely to disappoint. My complaint isn't that ""Across the Universe"" is unable to explore the depths of Beatles universe because the movie never tries. If you could distill any Beatles song to its most literal meaning, while ignoring all subtlety, then you'd probably make this movie too. Accordingly, the best scenes in the movie were detached from the story and simply indulgent celebrations of the music, full of Taymor's aesthetic.Which brings me back to the summary of this review -- while listening to Abbey Road this morning, Across the Universe all came rushing back and I felt half the album being taken from me. In listening to half of the songs on the album, I was reminded of the predictable and superficial renditions of angsty teens bemoaning lost love, while the other unused half remained as a reminder of the depth of the Beatles' music.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Hugely enjoyable,"What a delight this was. I'd never heard of this movie before it was recommended by a Beatles fan on YouTube. This was a great film. Spot on period recreation, great performances, great vocals and innovative and experimental movie making by the director. Plus a few cameo appearances by some very well known actors and singers. The use of the songs to tell the story never feels forced or awkward and some of it is downright inspired. I have no idea why this bombed at the box office. I guess it just wasn't the right time. But if you love the Beatles' music watch this. It's a tribute to the enduring power of those songs.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Despite visual invention, it lacks heart and ends up coming off like an expensive piece of pretentious amateur dramatics","Liverpudlian dock worker Jude travels to the US in the 1960's to find his estranged father. Once there he meets Max, which in turn leads him to fall for his sister Lucy. While Lucy and Jude move through the 1960's involved in the peace movement, Max is drafted and ends up in Vietnam.So let me get this straight. I cannot buy The Beatles' music on iTunes but yet somehow permission was given to use that music in this film? If I'm right in that then the message from the owners of the rights is this: access to the original music = bad, music used in corny amateur dramatics = good. I know that is a bit of a simplification but it is difficult to see how this film came about in regards getting the rights to the music it so heavily uses. I can understand why some people love this film because it is visually creative and it aspires to create a large musical and artistic experience in charting America during the 60's and 70's all via the central love story of Jude and Lucy ¬ñ few would deny that the film lacks ambition. However ambition is not the making of a film and the problem is here that it is not enough to carry it through all the problems.The film lacks heart. I know many will disagree having been caught up in the creativity of it all but then some people cry and corny school plays so disagreement should not be taken as fact. The characters are one-dimensional and they get lost in the grand sweep of the film. So, OK, perhaps the film is carried on the grand sweep of history and the bigger picture? Well no, because this history is simplified down to Broadway song and dance numbers and none of it has resonance in the way one knows it should. As a result of this the cast are mostly left without anything to work with other than making sure they hit their musical cues and stand in the right spot for the camera. What this ends up meaning is that the entire film feels like high school amateur dramatics where everyone is slightly cheesy but very sincere, the songs are familiar but not as good as the original and the numbers all have a ""lots of teeth and glad-hands"" feel to them.The film is visually creative in its imagination and its reference points but without heart this again makes it feel am-dram and, in combination with the treatment of the subject, all a bit pretentious. By the end of the film I was grateful for release because it had offered me nothing. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't get drawn into the musical numbers, the sweep of history was delivered with too little meaning and only the pretty pictures distracted me ¬ñ but they were hollow as a result of the other failures. Across the Universe is generally well-liked on this site, I genuinely have no idea why because, visuals aside, the film plays like an expensive and pretentious piece of amateur dramatics.",,Anonymous,History
"A baroque phantasmagoria in music, dance and flower power era nostalgia","I saw this film with mixed feelings. Of course, it sparkles with virtuosity all the way, and the lyrics and music of the Beatles shine all the way, the actors are good, even the story is good, returning to the roaring 60s with the Vietnam controversy, the hippie explosion, the political turbulence under Johnson with chaos demonstrations going constantly from bad to worse, and so on, all this is good, but this film has received so much positive acclaim, that someone also should have some objections.It's like a gigantic cinematic patchwork, many ideas put together inspired by Richard Lester (of the first Beatles films), Monty Python, Hair (of 1979, which this film could be seen as an update and modern version of), and even a bit of Apocalypse Now and Catherine Bigelow. There are outstanding scenes, especially all the ballet scenes, even Salma Hayek appearing as a number of nurses, but the music gets a bit screamy sometimes, it is overdone, the psychedlic explosions get repetitive, and the film is too long. Technically it's expertly made all the way, it's a marathon feast to the eyes, but the dialogue is lost in mumbling, articulation is missing, they speak neither clearly nor intelligently, since they don't need to, since there is the music, the colours, the parties, the demonstrations and even action at war. It's a grandiose film but suffers from some degree of superficiality - splendid firerworks that just blow over, and after the party there is nothing left.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Romance Enhanced by Great Music,"13 October 2007. A brilliant, exhilarating fusion of Beatles music and lyrics that is enhanced by the romance and political statement of the sixties and cross-cultural perspectives. An exciting musical, art, and solid script that allows the Beatles to resurrect themselves to a new generation. Each word of the Beatles' music comes reverberates with intensity as the characters sing their musical numbers acting out their lives on screen. The seamless, almost timeless universal phrases ring so true, creating a multi-media, multi-dimensional musical sensation. The hallucinatory, music video echoes to the early Beatles movies, ""It's A Hard Days Night"" and a ""Yellow Submarine"" but now the music has been transformed into a much more personal and intimate manner. 5/21/12: The biggest problem or weakness of the movie is that the movie can't be described as a masterpiece, perhaps because of the impossibility of integrating every individual Beatles' song into a universally connected movie script on every level. While Across The Universe does interconnect the love story well, there are filaments of the movie that seem to drift off and become tangent to the movie and the overall impact by the end seems to collapse somewhat on upon itself. The fault, of this movie, if any, was it attempted to be a complex classic, putting more effort and ambition then necessary. The producers and scriptwriters, ironically tried too hard, unlike Chicago (2002) or Moulin Rouge (2001), keep it simple or attempt the near impossible by fusing The Beatles with epic romance drama of Dr. Zhivago (1965).",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Sweet, imaginative, uneven musical","One of the most surprising things about this lavish musical epic is the identity of the screenwriters: Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, the dynamic duo responsible for classic 1970s British sitcoms such as ""The Likely Lads"" and ""Porridge"". Their latest effort ""Across the Universe"" is a homage to the music of The Beatles that is breathtakingly ambitious and epic in scale. The plot is predictably threadbare, plucky young Liverpudlian dock worker Jude travels to America and is smitten by apple-pie-cute Lucy. But the path of true love never runs smoothly. Along the way we meet characters named JoJo, Sadie, Maxwell (is anyone noticing a theme here?), and...well, you get the idea.Visually, this film is plain gorgeous. The screen positively glows thanks to the use of a massive color palette that makes even grimy Liverpool look like it's covered in diamonds (sorry!). Frame by frame, much of ""Across the Universe"" simply bursts with imagination. Ditto for the set design, choreography, and cinematography.However, there are downsides. At times the plot drags and some stretches of the film are somewhat dull. All the numbingly over-familiar totems of the 1960s (Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, MLK etc.)are once again hauled out of the dusty closet of Boomer history and put through their tired paces- lest we forget that this overexposed decade is really the center of all recorded history as we know it. Only die-hard Beatles fans will likely appreciate the two-plus hour running time, as the extra musical bloat makes the whole affair seem agonizingly slow at times (though not often in fairness).All that having been said, ""Across the Universe"" tries very hard to be liked and is mostly successful. It's best moments are really outstanding , such as the set pieces constructed around renditions of ""I am the Walrus"" and ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"". The film also succeeds in letting the audience feel the sense of hope, happiness, and adventure that the main characters are clearly supposed to embody. The cast appear genuinely spirited and spontaneous. Also, the cameos by Joe Cocker and Bono are fun.In conclusion, this is definitely a must-see for people who appreciate deeply beautiful visuals and knockout choreography. Obviously, Beatles fans are likely to adore this film. Otherwise, go see ""Across the Universe"" for a sweet, if hackneyed, love story about youthful characters living in a youthful time.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I was sure I wasn't going to like this movie,"And I didn't feel that way because I don't like musicals, rather I generally don't like movie makers playing around with Beatles music.That said I think this movie is brilliant. Think of it as a movie plot built around Beatles songs. Not literally, just loosely and to create music behind the plot.Watching this I found myself intrigued, moved, inspired, happy, sad, and touched. It's much more than just another musical. It's story of kids and musicians in the 60's trying to navigate through life and watching their world change for both good and bad. And that can be both happy and amazingly sad.As a bonus you get Incredible music and voices from the leading actors.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"do I want what Julie Taymor is smoking? overlong, visually stunning work of pop art","It's easy to love the Beatles. They're almost the apex of what British rock/pop music was in the 1960s, and their legacy will remain long after Paul and Ringo join John and George. The songs were of love, and other wild and crazy things, and from everyone 2 to 22 to 64 to 100 can find appeal in the melodies, the harmonies, the experimental usage of sound effects and other tools at the time. Now comes Across the Universe, adapted from the stage musical, and it's like a half lovey-dovey goofy romantic drama, half mind-warp commercial for classic Beatles songs, not to mention a kind of condensation of infamous moments in Beatles pop-culture (sans the Ed Sullivan Show for some reason).At the least, it intrigues one to think how this could ever be executed on a stage- or if it is somewhat less ambitious- though on its own it seems to cast an impression that should be taken on its own. This is mostly due to director Julie Taymor making this a kaleidescope of 60s socio-political fever ala Hair, only unlike Forman's film Taymor weaves in and out of making something of a crazy exploitation film, and it's in these moments that a break from 'conventional' musical film-making can be seen.But in a way the experience of seeing Across the Universe reminded me of what I thought of Pirates of the Caribeean: At Worlds End; both films are overlong, at least by a few (if not more) minutes, tend to not make much sense at times, and also contain some chunks of tastefully tasteless acts of brazen, hilarious surrealism (where Verbinski had Jack Sparrow in Davey Jones's locker, this time we get Bono as Dr. Robert, and Eddie Izzard performing 'Benefit of Mr. Kite' in sequences that would've thrown the AIP people for a loop with their psychedelic product).The story is meant to be simple, as many musicals tend to shoot for, and anyone who's seen a few melodramas will know what's going on in plot turns: Jude and Lucy are a British kid and an American girl respectively who meet when Jude comes to America looking for an estranged father (only seen in two scenes, by the way), and Lucy meets Jude by way of brother Max (as in Maxwell Silver Hammer, there's more in-references).Soon Jude and Max decide to split the college area, go rent out an apartment in New York City thanks to (Sexy) Sadie, who soon meets Jo-Jo (come on flat-top) right out of Detroit and can play a mean guitar for her singing group, and then there's also Prudence who ""came in through the bathroom window."" Then there's love, a good chunk of drama, horrors of war and protesting as backdrops for the wishy-washy love-affair between Jude (who doesn't see the reason to go all-out with the protesting) and Lucy (who doesn't seem to realize until her bosses at the Democratic-action headquarters are making bombs something is fishy). If this sounds like it's getting not as simple, I neglected to mention the throwaway psychedelia scenes, making up a good twenty minutes in the mid-section of the flick.What ends up distinguishing this flawed film- and it's hard not to have at least some criticism even if you go into this a die-hard Beatles fan, as more or less forty years has made playing on a roof-top old hat, or just in the putridly conventional turns the story makes in the last fifteen minutes (including a version of 'Hey Jude' that makes an already overrated hit even more unbearable)- is really the vision behind it, the verve to make many scenes at least have the feeling of vibrancy and intimacy, and the guts to take theatricality into the realm of camera compositions, deranged lighting set-ups, production design out of underground paintings, et all.A scene like at the bowling alley is taken as far as it can, playing with all the space and as the actors (including the guy who played Jude, can't recall his name) make it fun times with the palette of colors used. But then when looking at 'Mr. Kite' or 'I Am the Walrus' (with the guest stars Bono and Izzard bringing their own weird quirks to the process), or even 'Because', all logic is cut-off, not even little bits like in other portions of the film (i.e. Prudence in the movie) and suddenly it's imagination incarnate.This all being said, I'm not sure when I would want to see this film again. It's not like one of the Beatles movies from the original era, where Help! or Hard Days Night or Yellow Submarine carried unique comic and cinematic charms as well as a level of rewatchability that's unparalleled in rock movies. It also becomes something of a nitpicky affair to go from one segment to another and have it jarring to find one excellent or touching and the next shrill or just stupid (despite them both being great performers, I couldn't stand the 'arc' given to Jo-Jo and Sadie).But the singing and performances, for what they're worth, are at the least fantastic covers (far and away better than those for I Am Sam), are quite accomplished and, for the 'kids' as it were spot-on for what's needed. And there's a balance that Taymor tries to keep in scenes like 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' where there's the aftermath of war and veterans in hospital beds, and at the same time six Salma Hayek nurses all doing dances, that are all her own. It's all nothing great, but I was glad I saw it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Couldn't be more wrong...,"I cannot find words to explain the awfulness, craziness, and ridiculousness of this movie. It seemed to me, that the creators of this movie spent more time on the soundtrack, than the actually story and characters themselves. The movie had no sense of plot, suspense, character building at all. All it was, was a very shallow and very, very empty love story trying to mix in a war drama and basically everything that happened in the sixties. The movie dragged on, for what reason? I don't know! I couldn't care about the ending of the movie because I couldn't care what happened to the bland characters in the movie. Especially Prudence, i thought she did a horrible job acting and her character was very insignificant to the story. It had me wondering, why is she here? why is she in this movie? is she supposed to symbolize the gay population?

Lucy Carrigan (Evan Rachel Wood) is worried about her boyfriend Daniel going into the Vietnam war. Jude finds his father as a janitor at Princeton University, and befriends Lucy's brother Max (Joe Anderson).The best part of this movie is the abundance of great Beatles' music. The worst part is the rambling disjointed story. In between, there are the admirable efforts by most of the actors who are usually not the song and dance types.

The greatest movie ever conceived by man!!!!,"I have been waiting for this film ever since I heard this was being made a year ago. I am a musical fan and a fan of The Beatles, so I just fell in love with the whole idea of it. I went to see it and..............it exceeded every expectation that i had about his film!!!!!Words cannot describe this film. It's a love story. It's a musical. It's hip, bohemian, completely original, and...... uses the music of The Beatles to tell the story!!!!!! Julie Taymor has created a masterpiece. The songs fit perfectly into the narrative. Jim Sturgess & Evan Rachel Wood are perfect for the roles of Jude and Lucy. Their love for each cannot be described with words, so music takes place instead. This movie makes you feel as if you are going along this journey of Beatles songs.It's not like a normal musical in which characters just burst in to songs, they do it subtly and with a kind of seamless flow. It's a very realistic story (with a couple of fantasy moments thrown in) and surprisingly, it's very political as well. This is truly a musical about sex, drugs and rock & roll.Do not believe anyone when tell you this film is rubbish.

"By far, the best musical in this very young century","After you've done with this movie, you've got to ask yourself that, how one can chose 34 from 200+ The Beatles's songs, and still create such a brilliant songs compilation and coherent motion picture. I mean, you gotta see the mess behind this production and wonder how the hell it wasn't a complete failure. ""Across the Universe"" is simply, by far, the best movie musical in this very young century.As you can read my preview at here, I'm gonna skip the whole plot thing and focus on what made it so perfect. And, on the other hand, what made it so flawed in many critic's eyes.So first thing first, what made it so flawed? Easy answer, the plot. It was mediocre at best. Story of Vietnam's war the time of 60's? Hippy? An acid trip? Psychedelic pop? Yeah sure, we've been there a thousand times before. And there are stories of second tier characters which were left unexplained (so that, movie can spend time more with the lead). We never knew what will happened with Prudence, or how Sadie and Jo-Jo got back together again.True, those are undeniable flawed. The movie is not a masterpiece in the world of silver screen. But, hey guys, can we not look it as a movie? Can we see it as a tribute? A tribute to such an amazing era. It is a music-driven story which wrote by one of the most influential musician in our history. It represents what we love and hate. Jo-Jo represents our greatest guitarist, Jimi Hendrix. Sadie represents our greatest female rock & roll, Janis Joplin. Jude and Lucy represents young ignorance people back then. Max represents young man involuntary joined the army in the 60's, etc. I knows, I am babbling here, but what I've said is really happened, wasn't it? I don't know how difficult or pain in the arse of the director, Julie Taymor, really is. But I do know one thing that she is indeed talented filmmaker. Her visionary is really one major thing that made this trip worthwhile. A Bowling scene, Journey with Mr. Kite, Underwater ballet, enrolled army, Vietnam scene. Those are all visual & sounding inventive scenes. And it's not just she used the absolutely right song for the scene, she sometime also re-interpreted the whole meaning that songs for us. Like ""I wanna whole your hand"" which is a great, fun and happy song. But in the scene, Prudence sang in a ballad tone. Longing for her true love to hold her hand. I made me realized that no matter how wishful of this song is, it's heartbreaking when you can't hold somebody's hand that you desired.I never thought that they can find a right cast in term of appearance and vocal. But they did it. Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood indeed left me surprised. But what made me cheer with joy is Sadie which played by Dana Fuchs. She is simply astonishing in Janis Joplin's persona. And there's a final rooftop concert that I think is one of the great tribute to the last concert of The Beatles in 1970's.Someone might said ""Wasn't it a suicide to made the Beatles's musical set in the 60's? Haven't you seen Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?"". I think they're taking risk by doing this movie. I'm glad that did it and, by that, did it REAL worth trying for.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Painstakingly researched but out of touch,"As the final credits for this rolled at the Aspen Film Festival tonight, I had to wonder how many people recovering from substance abuse were watching this to relive their glory days of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. While I've loved all of Taymor's previous projects, particularly the under-appreciated ""Titus,"" ""Universe"" for me suffers from a very thorough study of the high points and styles of the 1965 - 1969 period without the benefit of much depth. She also samples extremely intelligently (and therefore extremely derivatively) from ""Rent,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" Monty Python (her animation leans far more towards MP than her usual excellent work), late '80s-era MTV, and even ""Forrest Gump."" The actors are all terrific, the design and colors are fantastic, but the end result is one more plasticized remnant of a handed-down '60s experience. And why in the world the songs picked rely so heavily on ""Abbey Road"" and ""The White Album,"" and without a single nod to ""Revolver"" or all that many to ""Sgt. Pepper"" is beyond me. Thank God the climax is a NYC-transfered re-enactment of The Beatles' famous rooftop performance and not our long lost lovers finding themselves at Woodstock. I would have been forced to watch the Rolling Stones 1970 documentary ""Gimme Shelter"" until that poisonous '60s saccharine had been flushed away.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Misconceived homage ends up being a travesty that should be avoided by all Beatles or movie fans,"I have to admit, I went into this much against my better judgment, and probably saw it for one of the shallowest of all reasons: the title. The title song might be my favorite Beatles song, certainly it's high on the list, and I thought, any film that makes a big deal out of one of the Fab Four's most musically innovative songs can't be all bad...Boy was I wrong. I really have no idea how much the theatrical version of the film that I saw was tinkered with against Taymor's wishes, how ""compromised"" it was, but from my perspective this was a horribly misconceived idea right from the get-go. Graft songs by the mostly apolitical, rather surreal and very British Beatles onto a story involving mostly American characters fighting the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement; have most of the songs integrated into the film in a completely literal and obvious way; don't reference the musical nature of the 60s at all otherwise except by showing a Janis Joplin and a Jim Hendrix clone, thrown together with the English hero Jude (a poor working-class lad from Liverpool doncha know) and the love of his life, Lucy (in the Sky with Diamonds, of course). Throw in some Bay area psychedelia, obvious Grateful Dead/Furthur/Ken Kesey references, and you've got yourself a movie guaranteed to puzzle anybody even remotely acquainted with the era or the music, if not infuriate them.It's not entirely terrible; I'm actually quite thankful that the filmmakers chose to use actors that could actually sing, and allow them to perform the music rather than post-dub actual Beatles performances (probably impossible) or covers by better-known musicians; and for the most part they do a credible job. None of the performances seems on its own a disaster, if none seem like brilliant interpretations either. And the cinematography was excellent throughout, though the dirty old England/bright and colorful USA seemed a bit of a ""Wizard of Oz"" metaphor to me which I don't think was intended.But ultimately, this is an incredibly stupid film that insults its audience and insults the music of the most important cultural force of the last century, by dumbing it down to the point where the average 5-year-old will make the connections. Throughout the film music is used, not as a counterpoint or an impressionistic addition to the plot, but as the plot itself; the storyline is built around the songs, and thus seems utterly trite and phony, and simple. Great as the Beatles were, their lyrics if just read on paper aren't always masterful, and they weren't primarily storytellers. I could imagine someone constructing a movie-world from the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen, or possibly Dylan, but Lennon-McCartney's vision isn't terribly cinematic and the film paints nearly every scene with such blunt strokes as ""She came in through the bathroom window"" -- just after a major character has done so. Shortly afterward the down and miserable Prudence is called upon to ""come out and play""; when Jude's girlfriend takes up with an antiwar activist and Jude gets upset, he storms the hippies' offices with ""You Say You Want a Revolution."" There are a few songs that seem to fit better, to offer more of an aside to the action or to just express the inner thoughts of a character in repose -- ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" sung while Jude is in exile back in England, worked pretty well. On the whole though, this is shallow, foolish and simpleminded, and the enthusiasm of the actors/singers just can't carry the day. Theatrical viewing.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A Totally New Movie Experience!,"For anyone who knows anything about the imagery or music of the 60's, this film is a pure delight. The dialogue is filled with Beatle's lyrics, and each character's name is from a Beatles song, which was later playfully used in context with the story.I was SHOCKED to find out that each actor sang his or her own soundtrack! Unlike most movie/ musicals, which tend to cast the biggest Hollywood names they can find and then teach them to ""sing"", these people actually could sing - and quite well. And they each rendered wonderfully simplistic and soulful Beatles' covers. The only exception I would take to this was the character of ""Sadie"", played by Dana Fuchs. She was indeed ""sexy"" and beautiful, and a fine actress. She definitely fit the Janis Joplin image, and had a similar rustic-like voice. However, her covers did not suit the music well. And her strange changes to the melodies often sounded like a bad mistake.This was not true with the other singers, such as Jim Sturguess, whose gritty and beautiful voice lended itself well to the Beatles. With his McCartney-like look, he was able to change the tonality in Revolution from major to minor with assuredness and beauty. Martin Luther and Jo Jo also possessed a warn, smooth and gorgeous voice. And hats off to whomever arranged the music.Its hard to imagine just how many talented people were involved in making this movie. But Julie Taymor is just brilliant! Not only are the images and artistic flow sheer genius, but the active direction from dialog into song and dance was utterly natural and always loads of fun.Surprising and delightful cameos were made by Joe Cocker (who sang the crap out of Come Together), Bono (the trippy Dr. Robert), and Eddie Izzard as the wonderfully funny Mr. Kite.This movie will visually and musically rock you and move you to tears.

"A Surreal, War-Torn Love Story Bridges 33 Beatles Songs in a Most Erratic Manner","When I saw the eye-popping clips of this 2007 movie in a preview earlier this year, it became readily apparent that director Julie Taymor has lost none of the visual invention that informs her vivid staging of The Lion King and her Baroque-level approach to 1999's Titus. What I feared most from what I saw was that it would be more like an extended fantasy-laden musical video with the classic Beatles songbook basically providing most of the dialogue. It turns out I am mostly right, though there is a somewhat trite and rather predictable narrative, provided by Taymor and co-screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, at the core of the movie. Building a story around thirty-three unrelated Beatles songs is no easy task, and the contrivances are gratefully not as exaggerated as one would expect. At the same time, the characters feel hastily developed to fit the contours of the diverse songs, and most of the resulting performances are not compelling enough to bring it all together in a cohesive manner.Set in the 1960's, the plot revolves around Jude, a working-class bloke from Liverpool going stateside to visit the father he's never met, and Lucy, a product of East Coast privilege who becomes increasingly radicalized after her high school sweetheart dies overseas as the Vietnam War keeps raging on. Jude and Lucy meet through her brother Max, a Princeton undergrad who drops out to live in bohemian style in Greenwich Village but then gets drafted into the military. No surprise that a romance between Jude and Lucy evolves amid the anti-war countercultural movement, including a bus trip through psychedelia. There are other characters in the mix with equally familiar names - Sadie, a raspy-voiced Janis Joplin doppelganger about to break big on the rock music scene; Jo-Jo, her lover and competitor who evokes Jimi Hendrix's looks and individualistic guitar style; and Prudence, a sexually confused Ohio cheerleader who literally comes in through the bathroom window.The love story is strictly by the numbers, but the musical performances can be infectious. Evan Rachel Wood continues to impress even in a role as self-contained as Lucy, and her plaintive rendition of ""If I Fell"" is surprisingly affecting. The rest are definitely more singers than actors. Jim Sturgess appears to have been cast for his vocal resemblance to Paul McCartney, not a bad reason though he does manage to capture Jude's plot-driven angst with convincing abandon. He gets the lion's share of the classic ballads - ""Girl"", ""I've Just Seen a Face"", ""Something"", ""All My Loving"", ""All You Need Is Love"". Joe Anderson delivers a party-hearty ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" with his Princeton frat brothers and later a somber ""Hey Jude"" as a postwar-traumatized Max. As budding lesbian Prudence, T.V. Carpio does a doleful version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" crossing through acrobatic football players during practice. Dana Fuchs brings a soulful thrust to ""Helter Skelter"", ""Why Don't We Do It in the Road?"", and ""Don't Let Me Down"", while Martin Luther McCoy poignantly covers ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"".A few of the sequences don't work as well as others, for example, Jude's extended trashing of the protesters' office to the strains of ""Revolution"", the pin-cushioned strawberries transforming into bombs during the dual-perspective montage of ""Strawberry Fields"", and the drug-hazed antics of Bono as a Timothy Leary figure on ""I Am the Walrus"". Some of the more interesting performances come from the surprise guest appearances, such as Eddie Izzard as the ringmaster of a weirdly psychedelic ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"", Carol Woods and Timothy T. Mitchum delivering a powerful ""Let It Be"" set against the 1967 Detroit riots, and Joe Cocker showing his unmistakable vocal style under three different guises on a rollicking ""Come Together"". Even Salma Hayek shows up as a coterie of nurses in a roulette-style hospital during ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"". There is a very defined audience for this type of confection, and there are more definitive performances of these classic songs elsewhere. At the same time, Taymor has an audacious visual sense well worth experiencing. Proceed with caution.",6.0,Anonymous,History
makes me want to hate beatles,"I remember catching the title scene ages ago and thinking , pass.This time I gave this film an actual chance. Tried watching till end, my patience is done.such a mishmash of surface level crap that it doesn't actually have a decent plot. the plot is the filler more like. if the director wanted to make a music video she should've done it. instead of this 'movie'the characters don't have any transitions with their actions. everyone moves on from situations as if they weren't related to them previously. honestly, so bad, made me want to hate Beatles.save time, watch something else.",1.0,Anonymous,History
All This And World War Two Meets Hair,"A love story set against the backdrop of cultural change and turmoil in late 1960's New York city. Although the plot is at times predictable, it is well acted with solid performances throughout the cast. Song selection, placement and performance are very good, the visuals are even better, dare I say stunning? Worth seeing just for the music sequences which are interwoven very well with the story development. Some of the cultural references may be obscure for those who did not come of age in this era but missing them will not detract from enjoying the movie. I know this will spark interest and the entire Beatles record catalogue will sell more briskly for a while, I wonder if anyone will pick up a copy of The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test after seeing this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Uncomfortable,"I love Taymor's work. Frida was amazing. This had it's moments too. But it was quite distracting when ever someone would start singing on screen, and everyone around me in the audience would start squirming. It never failed. Over and over again. Except for the Janis Joplin type character. She was great. And of course, the man, Joe Cocker. People jumped when they saw him! Me too! The young girl singers drudged along, taking, it seemed like forever to sing they're song. It was strange using a Beatle song as a narrative. It was just all those Beatle songs. Like Micheal Jackson needs more money. God forbid Paul write something new and original for the film. It had this Broadway overtone. I hate Broadway. People jumping over stuff, and doing high kicks. I didn't know it was a musical. I wish someone had told me. The trailer implied none of that. I was glad when it was over. As I was walking out of the theater, I kept hearing people say, ""What a piece of crap."" I didn't feel that, I just felt uncomfortable.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"""Music's the only thing that makes sense anymore""","It's sufficient to say that I wasn't Julie Taymor's most enthusiastic advocate when I caught word of her most recent film, a story built around an anthology of Beatles tracks. On paper, the idea sounds both brilliant and terrible: I certainly don't consider myself a Beatles aficionado, but, like most of the world, I greatly enjoy listening to their music, and a ""re-imagining"" of their most famous work could just as easily be interpreted as a desecration of their legacy; after all, how could we possibly envisage anybody but Paul McCartney singing ""Hey Jude?"" Likewise, it seems a rather odd proposition to employ distinctly-British music as an exploration of 1960s American history, but all things considered, the end result isn't all that bad. Despite superficially being an ""extended music video,"" screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have done a wonderful job at fitting a narrative framework around an extensive selection of songs from the band, and the resultant love story is suitably epic in scope to linger in the memory for some time afterwards.Young Liverpudlian, Jude (Jim Sturgess), has lived an uneventful childhood in the cold, dreary backdrop of Britain. After he ships off to the United States in search of his American father, he befriends a Princeton dropout named Max (Joe Anderson), subsequently falling in love with Max's younger sister, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). If these names are already striking you as vaguely familiar, then you wouldn't be incorrect in guessing that almost every character derived their moniker from a Beatles lyric. The three main characters are very good in their respective roles; Sturgess is the most successful, and, sporting a genuine Liverpool accent, his song renditions come closest to their original versions, and so, by implication, are the best. Evan Rachel Wood brings a graceful beauty to the screen, and Joe Anderson provides the necessary comic relief, though his character sobers up considerably following a stint in Vietnam. Martin Luther McCoy's Jimi Hendrix derivative is also entertaining to watch, but the characters of Prudence (T.V. Carpio) and Sadie (Dana Fuchs) are an annoying distraction, and the latter ruins more than a few perfectly-good Beatles tracks.There's no doubting that Julie Taymor, working with cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, has an incredible visual style, and the film's musical numbers are an extraordinary stage-show of lights and colours. Narrative-wise, 'Across the Universe' works most effectively when it avoids straying into spells of inane surrealism, though I was terribly partial to Eddie Izzard's nonsensical spoken rendition of ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,"" which is a supreme piece of random nuttiness. As far as the films of 2007 are concerned, I'd consider Todd Haynes' Bob Dylan biopic, 'I'm Not There,' to be a superior piece of music-based cinema, and my preferred musical would certainly be Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.' Taymor's film loses much of its steam after the first hour, and runs at least thirty minutes too long, but it's such an ambitious piece of film-making that one can only recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An Acid Trip Plus One,"The main reason I went to see this movie was, well, The Beatles. I am a long time fan of them. The covers of The Beatles songs are pretty good, although I still like the originals more. Additionally, the movie does have nice song sequences and nice integration of the songs and Beatle themes. However, on the downside, during the movie I found myself going ""WTF?"" often, with seemingly too random things, it was like an acid trip plus one. Another downside was the lack of character-development of the main characters, where as more time was spent of the second-rate characters. Overall though, the movie was enjoyable, the songs, and visuals were both good as well.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible,"This movie was absolutely horrid. It was a terrible waste of time and money. Nearly 2.5 hours of an painful attempt to create art that only produced an embarrassment. The only storyline was about a bunch of self-indulgent hippies complaining that they can't get what they want. Nothing but crying and whining set to no-talent performers singing horrifically bad covers of mediocre Beatles songs that made me want to jab a pencil in my ears. If it wasn't for the fact I was with my fianc√©e, I would have left the movie after the first hour. I would rather spent that time watching paint dry than even consider watching this movie again. The sad part was that I really had high hopes for this movie, but it just failed to produce in any category.",1.0,Anonymous,History

The vision of the director is way beyond the ordinary. Have watched it twice so far and plan to do so again in the near future. The show brings back so many memories of the Beatles era as well as that of the Vietnam war and combines them in a way that is truly unique.

Stupid abomination.,"Michael Jackson must need money again (he co owns the publishing rights to the Beatles catalog, along with the films distributor Sony to whom he sold a percentage to - hence those Target commercials) This pos also has the nerve to have a ""soundtrack album"" available.

If your interested in the other historical people in this film, go read the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test by Ken Keesey, and buy some Hendrix albums. Why this even got the green light is beyond me. Oh yea, maybe because music fans today grew up on MTV and need to be shown how to experience music with videos. That and greed. Kill me please.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Yes, I have fallen, back and back again.","Simply breath taking. At first, I was extremely hesitant to see this movie. I'm not going to lie, I was actually kind of scared. The previews made it seem well, how can I say, aimed at hardcore hippies and drug users. The voice of young Jim Sturgess still rings in my ears throughout the day. Amazing casting for this film, each voice had its own personality that added strength and diversity to the film. Some scenes did make me question a few things, such as the 'field circus' and ""I Want You"" scene. A very different type of movie, but the music is phenomenal. Almost all of the songs are from the Beatles, but the new day and age technology make them sound a lot better (in my opinion at least).I give this film 9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Strawberry Fields,"This is one of those movies where I find myself enjoying it less each time I watch it. Originally, I was super into this weird and creative musical about Vietnam era kids/young adults as they try to navigate the socio-political climate of the time all set to the music of the Beatles. This most recent viewing though I kept getting distracted by the number of times it felt like things just didn't fit. Songs wedged into places that they don't really belong, story making leaps and non-sensical moves just to allow for the songs narrative. It feels less like a cohesive, planned out narrative than a flimsy excuse to pump out more music.That said, I still like the music, I still like the artistic choices made and I think the story is interesting and does a good enough job, most of the time, at creating a cogent through line, but there is definite splintering and fraying around the edges. If nothing else it might just be worth hitting up youtube and checking out some of these renditions of the classic songs.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing Beatles Collaboration on Screen,"I will be the first to admit, as a long time fan of the Beatles, I was quite skeptical as to whether or not I would actually enjoy this movie.

I adored it. Bravo to you Across the Universe. This music is used beautifully and fits perfectly into the plot. The beatles would be proud of this film in their prime. Their very music was well understood and used to express the full gamut of emotions on screen. Jim Sturgess and Even Rachel Wood come together with amazing chemistry to draw the viewer into their relationship as well. Just another 10/10 aspect to this feature.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe (2007) ***,"Step back into retro 1968 for a very colorful and wondrous musical trip featuring today's young performers saluting The Beatles through their music. I must give credit to screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, as well as the director Julie Taymor for having more success in producing glowing results, especially when one recalls the disaster that was 1978's SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.This is a loose and meandering story of a young Liverpool artist named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who goes off to search for a father he never known somewhere in the U.S.A. He meets various characters named after certain Beatles songs and befriends them as they all go about their lives together amidst the outrage of the Vietnam war, ""flower power"" psychedelia trips, and love.I just watched this myself on DVD last night along with my wife, my sister and her husband, and my 16-year-old nephew and his young girlfriend. Other than the sad fact that the kids first cringed at the sight of the movie being letterboxed and that they wanted it to be ""the Full Screen"" (sigh) it went over very well. Except for my 12-year-old niece, however, who kept retreating to her room and is at this point in her life a lost cause who prefers cRap and Britney Spears to good music. Well, I guess she'll see if anyone makes a movie featuring their stuff in 40 years time. I am a die-hard Beatles collector/freak, and yet I have never managed to sit through all of the SGT. PEPPER movie. I must admit that I went into ACROSS THE UNIVERSE with much trepidation, but I came out of it very exhilarated and with the satisfaction of feeling that there might be young teens out there in the modern world who were now made more aware of The Beatles' music where they wouldn't have thought they were cool enough before.It's pretty much a futile exercise to attempt a whole coherent film and any sort of linear plot line when the whole idea of a movie is to tell a story using songs by a music group and characters conspicuously named after classic songs (like Jude, Jo Jo, Prudence, Sadie, Lucy, Max, etc.). There were some curious missed opportunities -- I kept wondering what the point was of having a character named Maxwell who was angry at his parents and was seen wielding a silver hammer, if not to use the song? Same thing with Sadie (who I wrongly presumed was going to be serenaded for being ""sexy"" and for ""making a fool of everyone"") and Jo-Jo was never told to ""Get Back""!But with ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, whatever must be found lacking in story is much more than made up for with creative cinematography and some great music at every other turn. I liked just about all of the new renditions of the classic old tunes and it was actually invigorating to hear them freshly sung by new (and some old) faces. I found myself eagerly anticipating what the next chestnut to be attempted was going to be and who would get to sing it. The vocalist who really hit me especially was the character Sadie's (Dana Fuch's) Janis Joplinesque rocking on songs like ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road"" and ""Oh, Darling!"" (even though the latter was sometimes hindered by the interruptions of Martin Luther McCoy). A couple of weak singing moments that stood out for me were the embarrassingly silly ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite"", by Eddie Izzard, as well as leading boy Jim Sturgess' softcore blabbering for ""Revolution"". Still, even these didn't hurt the movie as a whole. Oh, I might nitpick that a seasoned Beatles devotee like U2's Bono ought to be aware that the sounds which are barked in the classic ""I Am the Walrus"" are not the commonly misheard ""Koo Koo Kachoo"", but rather ""Goo Goo G'joob"", but this is desperate criticism. It was great to see him perform this psychedelic tune, and ditto for Joe Cocker croaking out the opening lines of ""Come Together"".The memory of The Beatles is alive and well and made fresher than ever for a new youthful audience thanks to ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant film making! It's bouncing around in my Top Ten List..,"Here's what I have to say after watching Across The Universe for the first time on DVD tonight...Growing up in the entertainment industry of Los Angeles and coming from a family involved in the entertainment biz and having been involved in the entertainment making process myself in a minor way and having not missed an Academy Awards ceremony in the last 41 years and knowing how movies are made and the intricateness of the film making process and being highly picky and critical of every piece of film editing, lighting, set decoration, set design, art direction, production design, costuming, casting, shot and blocking angles, location backgrounds, special effects times ten, 2nd unit work, dialogue, script writing and screenplay composition, music background and major score, surreal ""Pony Boy"" Coppola scenes and ""Arty"" shots, etc... I found the film Across The Universe...A Masterpiece! One of the best movies I've ever experienced and now one of my top 10 movies of all times!...bouncing between 1 and 10 all the while I think about it. Brilliant! Well crafted!... and unique.I've NEVER been a fan of movie ""Musicals"", although Grease is in my Top 20 list. I've never liked music, singing, and dancing mixed in with a story and dialogue. It's always been cheesy stuff for me. ""I love you darling""... break into loud corny song... Sheesh! BUT...For the first time in all my life's film watching, I discovered that Across The Universe was a musical film made to be viewed in a completely different way from my normal assumptions about ""Musicals"".I had heard all the BUZZ about this movie so I sat down to watch the DVD at home with a new open mind. This ""Musical"" film set me straight in a very profound way! Some brief viewing notes...I'm suggesting a new category for an Academy Award for Best Location Scout. Watch the backgrounds of the outside scenes! Watch the set decoration and props used very carefully... The interior/studio shots are flawless in their set decoration and layout! Too much to see in one viewing so here's one of many reasons to watch this film again, or ten times more.Watching again will also sort out your feelings from seeing it the first time and all the wonderings it brings up.Don't miss what I call ""The Strawberry Statement"" references/visuals. Activist people from the late 60's will get this.The several scenes where the songs and themes take off in cinematic surrealism are right out of a Fellini written movie with Picasso directing. Brilliant work! The Benefit of Mister Kite and ""I Want You"" army scenes are beyond brilliant and are just two of the numerous musical and visually delicious chapters to not avoid, but to repeat again and again.I especially liked the voicing and appearance of Joe Cocker as the homeless man. You'll never recognize U2's Bono if you're not paying attention, even though he has a long and serious role in a masterful psychedelic chapter.... Good stuff Bono!The Beatles music of course is the subtle backbone that cements this movie's story together and I was completely refreshed by the new arrangements and new voices that were presented. When you buy the movie, buy the soundtrack as well!And don't turn the movie off after the final scene or you'll miss out on the little gem at the end of the road. As the credits roll, the bright and vivid visuals and music background are a much watched follow-up that will leave you in the dust with your ending thoughts about this movie.-END-",10.0,Anonymous,History
A thoroughly entertaining portrayal of 60's culture in America,"Firstly, this film is NOT about The Beatles, so if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere. It is about the social/political events and structures in 1960's America regarding the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement which are shown through The Beatles music. Overall I considered it thoroughly entertaining and informative. The music lifted what can be a 'heavy' subject as did the multiple romances within the film. It explored the Hippie Culture, political activists and most of the major issues of the 60's. Overall very well directed and usually straight to the point, never overly long winded. The acting was very natural, I can only think of one account that it could be described as 'wooden'. I have to give a 'shout out' to Jim Sturgess for the Character of Jude. He captured his romantic yet daring and deeply troubled personality astonishingly. Also Dana Fuchs singing gave a hole new edge to each song she took on, she was truly a pleasure to listen too.If you have an appreciation for The Beatles, know abit about the Civil Right's movement and Vietnam and also have an appreciation for history I would strongly recommend this film to you.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Fortunately there is pretty much non stop beatles tunes set against backdrops both show businessy and psychedelic.The plot is subpar (when it is not non-existent) and the two lead romantic characters dont have much chemistry together, and the weighty subjects of anti-war protest and drug use never find firm footing in the rambling story.If you would like to see beatles tunes performed in imaginative ways you might like it, if you need a story to go with it dont bother.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Travesty,"I've got an idea. Let's take some of the greatest songs ever written, suck all of the wit, irony and originality out of them, have them performed by second rate performers, create some cardboard ""characters"" to ""sing"" these songs and act out a ""plot"" cobbled together by the original songs' supposed ""meanings."" Brilliant!When I first began playing music as a teenager, I began with songs from bands like the Eagles, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, etc. It was only after I had been playing for about five years that I truly attempted to learn the Beatles' music, and, when I did, their timeless songs opened up whole new musical horizons for me that I am still exploring to this day. I am convinced that the Beatles' music will still be widely shared and enjoyed 200 years from now. Their songs were of a certain time in history, but their meaning is timeless.This movie is horrible. It's an outrage. It's the film equivalent of taking all of Picasso's work, hacking it to little bits and having those pieces rearranged by a far lesser artist into some hackneyed ""interpretation"" of what someone thinks Picasso was trying to ""say."" Now, one might argue that the Beatles' music are pop songs, not great art, and therefore are game for this kind of ""homage."" Fair enough. But if you truly love the Beatles like I do, forgo this bomb of a movie, and, instead, pop on some headphones and listen to their music. Close your eyes and let your own imagination paint a picture of the songs' meaning.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Fun,"Across the Universe is a conventional love story linked together by Beatles songs. It's good fun but ultimately a little disappointing. The story provides a cue for a greatest hits compilation. The plot is predictable and the characters, usually named after a famous song, are underwritten. Being set in the psychedelic '60s it almost feels like you are watching an Austen Powers movie. But, if you like the Beatles there is plenty to enjoy.The Vietnam War protests and the hippie sub-culture culture provide much of the backdrop. Jude is a Liverpool dock worker and a brilliant artist who arrives in Princeton to locate his father who served with the American army during World War II. Jude befriends Max, a student from a wealthy family who subsequently drops out of college and is later drafted. Max's beautiful sister Lucy becomes Jude's girlfriend. Max and Jude live in Sadie's loft in New York with Prudence and Lucy. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl but it all ends happily.The film's writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais wrote two classic '70s British sitcoms ""Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads"" and ""Porridge"". In both shows the writing was smart and funny and featured a cynical central character. Unfortunately the quality of their writing in this film is simply adequate and the characters are bland stereotypes.

"A Film For People With ADD, Who Want To Go On An Acid Trip","Across The Universe is a musical that tells the story of multiple people living in the time of the Vietnam war. A young man travels from Liverpool to find his father, but ends up falling in love with a young American.Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was a a technical and artistically remarkable film, but it lacked a story, had a long running time and had very little entertainment qualities about it, which ended up hurting the film. Julie Taymor's Across The Universe runs down the same path, it's visually beautiful and full of life, but the lack of story and long running time does more damage then one would imagine.Across The Universe is many things, but above all it is ambitious. It's a musical set to Beatles songs. In a time when the musical is pretty much dead, Taymor relies on visuals and the popularity of the Beatles to bring in the audience. It's a shame that that is all she relied on because the film is severely lacking many things. What it excels in, it does so beautifully, what it fails at is key to what connects the audience to the film. You can't simply have a character sing a verse of a song and expect people to connect just because it's the Beatles.Across The Universe is for people with ADD and who want to go on an acid trip. The film has no real set course, it jumps from one song to the next and from one bizarre and beautiful image to the next. One minute you're with Bono on a bus, the next you're underwater naked. If you're able to keep up with the bombastic images thrown on the screen then you will really enjoy yourself. Every image that is shown on the screen is ripped straight out of a Beatles song. When you hear Strawberry Fields Forever, you see Strawberry Fields. This could ruin some imagery you might have while listening to those songs.The film changes it's direction, from the journey of this young man, named Jude, to the anti war movement with Lucy. Yup, those are their names, along with Max and Prudence and Sadie. All the character names are taken out of the songs as well. Also, it doesn't take a genius to know that the song Hey Jude would inspire this character to do something. The characters, who all are modeled after icons in the music industry, such as Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain, have very little are no arc. With the exception of the two leads, Lucy and Jude, both acted very well by Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess, everyone seems to be one noted. Sadie has one conflict in the film, it is never explored, Prudence has lots of conflict, that is never explored. Prudence even disappears half way through the film, only to show up again at a hallucinating sequences.A lot of the images are beautiful and you will without a doubt encompass it all, but there are still some that are too bizarre to connect to the story. One scene we see Asian woman naked, with their bodies painted white who stand on water, then they dive backwards under it. What does this, and many other symbolic elements mean? We are never told and can't sit and think because the next image is thrown at us right after.You will be tapping your toes to the music and singing along as well, if you know the lyrics. There were two or three songs I didn't quite know, but I'm sure the hardcore Beatles fans will know them all. Although, not all the songs are happy dance numbers. Some of them are poorly done, surprisingly I Am The Walrus from Bono is one of them. Jor Cockers take on Come Together is a highlight as well as the army sequences performed to She's So Heavy.Across The Universe is ambitious, beautiful and will have you singing along to the tunes. It's about thirty minutes too long and has very little character development and plot, but the story is there. It's just sung aloud in song and not really performed. If you can get pass a lot of the obvious film images and metaphors, like Prudence coming out of the closet, then Across the Universe is a film for you.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: Across the Universe,"Viva la Beatles! We're familiar with the many musicals that have come out of late, either being remade from stage to screen, or updated for today's era, the latest being Hairspray. And a musical made up entirely of songs by the Beatles, but not sung by the Beatles themselves? While it is easy to make a movie based on songs by the ""it"" group of the time (Spice World anyone?) and starring the singers themselves so that there won't be a nightmare in casting actors who can sing, or worse, start to mutilate the lyrics, how about throwing that mantra out of the window?Across the Universe does exactly that. Who would've thought that the discography of the Beatles, diverse as they may be, could have a multitude of songs chosen, and strung together so nicely that it makes for a coherent musical all through 130 odd minutes of the story? I thought it worked, and worked perfectly, and what came out of it are pretty kooky song and dance sequences that had everything thrown in from slick editing to psychedelic animation. Best of all, the cast members themselves lend their vocals, albeit having the music tweaked a little so that it doesn't sound exactly the same as having a collection of the Beatles' greatest hits being popped into a CD and played ad nauseum.Set during the era of the Beatles themselves, Across the Universe is set mainly across the Atlantic in 60s USA, where the Vietnam War is abound. We're introduced to Jude (convenient name to make you wait up for the inevitable song, as with the other names), played by Jim Sturgess, a Liverpool (heh) dock worker who gets himself to the USA in search of his long lost dad. He meets Max Carrigan (Joe Anderson) with whom he becomes fast friends with, and falls in love with his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a schoolgirl who had just lost her first boyfriend to the war.The movie is a simple tale of romance between two lovebirds, and you'd come to expect the usual boy-meets-girl-loses-girl-gets-girl-back routine, but what works is of course, the music by the Beatles. Adding texture and layer to the movie were the various subplots which had another relationship running parallel to that of Jude and Lucy's - their landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs), who is a rock musician, and her guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy), as they call Come Together under one big roof, settling in a Bohemien lifestyle, which suits Jude's artistic talents just so nicely. It had plenty of loving, but conspicuously absent, and for the better, is drugs, except for a surreal underwater scene, and some really insane moments inside a big top, complete with wacky animation.What I thought the movie had taken a leaf out of Citizen Dog's was how love progressed and reached the doldrums, against the backdrop of the opposition to the War. While films like Born on the Fourth of July had very powerful statements to make, Across the Universe sort of adopted the stance that Forrest Gump had, with the love of Jude's life joining the opposition cause, much to his displeasure and becomes a barrier, but can't do anything much about it anyway, allowing unnecessary jealousy to come in between them, which became ""I told you so"".Director Julie Taymor had an excellent cast to work with, not only do they sing well, but they brought out their characters perfectly. Evan Rachel Wood excelled as the teenage wide-eyed schoolgirl to whom we were introduced, who slowly turns to one with steely resolve, Jim Sturgess as the likable English bloke who stands witness to the tumultuous era that the US goes through, and microscopically, turns from a bastardly Dong Juan back home to monogamous Romeo in the US, but the one who takes the cake, is Joe Anderson's Max, who lives life with an immortal, youthful idealism, who goes where the wind takes him, until his dropping out of an ivy league college meant receiving the Draft, in one really hilarious sequence with Uncle Sam.All in, I can't vouch that the story will set to wow, but the songs, thank goodness for the Beatles, more than makes up for the clich√© which goes straight through to the end. True Beatles fans will find tons of references not only from the songs, but from the various easter eggs scattered everywhere in the movie. They are really going to have a field day with this one. Viva la Beatles!",8.0,Anonymous,History
The best parts were in the previews,"Visually this movie was amazing, but I had to give it a lower rating because every other element was lacking. The story was thin, and the various characters' journeys barely held together. There was so little character development that I didn't care at all what was going to happen to them. I'm a big fan of musicals, and I love The Beatles, but the story should come first. Several of the songs didn't seem to fit. It felt like they were just plopped in there and connected to the plot by the thinnest thread possible. They didn't flow well either. In a good musical, you aren't jarred by the fact that a song just started. Here, they would pause, then the intro music would start, and I would immediately think, ""Oh, they're going to sing another song now."" Also, for a musical, I didn't like most of the singing. There were only two voices that I really liked. This, however, is personal preference, and I'm sure others will debate which singers they preferred.On the plus side, as I said at the beginning, the visuals were amazing. If you've seen the previews, you've already seen the best of them. Watching the full sequences is fun, though. Each sequence has a completely different style, so you're bound to find at least a few that will blow you away.In summary, if you're looking for a creative and artistic movie, look no further. If you're looking for a movie with compelling characters and a story line that will draw you in, you might want to go elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A complete work,"I saw five movies this weekend; (Silk, Hairspray, Rocket Science, In the Valley of Elah, and Across the Universe) and I have to say Across the Universe blew me away. I wasn't expecting it to be as penetrating or as beautifully executed as it was. Quell Surprise! As musicals go; it made Hairspray (which i also enjoyed) look a little campy and dated. It totally rocked the spirit, the soul and the eyes. Talk about bubblegum to the eyes, those animations from Kyle Sacs were beautiful. I didn't know Kyle did that sort of work, I just thought he was a titles guy. But, it makes sense. Like ""Once"" which I saw twice, I am sure I will be seeing this movie again. I am not in the industry, but if I were I would be very proud to have made this movie.PS. Though the room burst into applause when the movie was over i noticed the younger kids sitting around me (I grew up in the 60's) weren't unconsciously tapping their legs, or anything else, to the amazing music, as was I. They were just sitting there politely watching it. I felt sorry for them, though they demonstrated their enthusiasm in the end, it couldn't possibly have resonated for them as it does members of my generation who grew up singing the songs, all of them.I wish those kids would get off their polite little a**es and organize a protest against the Iraq war, as their parents did for Vietnam.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"If You Like The Beatles, Beautiful Visuals, Musicals, or Love Stories, Then This Is A Movie You Must See","""Across the Universe"" is a film I had heard of for years, but had never taken the time to sit down and watch. I knew it was a rock opera with Beatles songs, that it was a love story, and that I heard nothing bad about it. But after about three years of being in limbo on how this movie was, I decided to finally sit down and give it a watch. And I wish I had done so sooner.""Across the Universe"" is about Jude, a young man from Liverpool who decides to go to America to find his father. While what he finds is a disappointment, he meets his friend Max and his sister, Lucy, who Jude falls in love with. The three of them move to New York, where they meet Prudence, Satie, and JoJo, and soon they are all swept up in the 1960's world of music, war, and love. You could possibly look at this film and completely label it a hippy throwback, but while you're watching it, the word hippy never comes to mind. It's more of a story of a group of people's self-discovery and the hardships they go through.There are no big-name actors in this film, at all. It's all unknowns. I love it when big films give young actors a chance to shine, and with this film, it'll probably be the roles they're all remembered for. Jim Sturgess plays Jude. He looks like he came right out of 1960's England. If you could go back in time and put him into the Beatles, you wouldn't know a difference at all. He was the perfect person to play Jude. Not just for looks, but for his performance too. He's instantly likable, you just look at him and grin because you probably know a guy exactly like him.Evan Rachel Wood plays Lucy. She gives a good performance, and Lucy's a likable character. She's obviously a polar opposite to Jude, so it gives them a good character dynamic, but honestly, the exact same kind of dynamic was in ""Grease"", so it gives it a bit of a recycled feel, especially for a musical.Visually, this film will trip you out to no end. In several of the musical numbers, you'll just be wondering, ""who the hell just turned the psychedelic switch to 11""? It'll be a perfectly normal scene, and then it's like you just dived head first into an acid trip. Some of the scenes are disturbing and a bit off putting, like ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", but there are others that are really beautiful like ""Dear Prudence"". It's a mixed bag, but you can't deny, it's a gorgeous film to look at.The songs in this film are all used to perfect effect. You'll realize it later, because you won't be able to listen to the Beatles afterwards and not think of the scenes in the film that go along with the film. Now usually, I'm completely against covers in films, but several of the songs used in the film I think are better in certain ways. ""Something"" is the one I think is probably used to the best effect. It seems like the song is sung in the exact situation the Beatles imagined when they wrote the song. It works so beautifully, that you might find that the original version doesn't work as good if you visualize it being played to the scene.The other musical numbers that really stand out to me in this movie are ""With A Little Help from My Friends"", ""Hey Jude"", and ""All You Need is Love"", which epitomizes everything the film builds up towards. Don't be surprised to find yourself singing along to these songs. Throughout the film, you've grown to love these characters, and these songs lift you up and warm your heart in a way that not a lot of films these days can do.In conclusion, ""Across the Universe"" is a great film. It seems the team behind this film were able to find a story that after viewing this film, you feel like it wasn't forced, but more like it was there all along. And now that you've seen it unfold, you'll never be able to forget it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I feel robbed. I want my money back. It'soooooooooo bad.,"God, what an awful movie. If you want to see a musical, go with Moulin Rouge. Admire the genius of Baz Luhrman's art and how he can use famous songs' lyrics and make it work. If you want a movie with Beatles' music, rent I am Sam: beautiful versions, and a beautiful movie, mainly because Sean Penn. You can't even compare the soundtracks! Listening Blackbird, one of the most beautiful songs of The Beatles by an unknown actress, or by Sarah McLachlan? Let it be by other unknown, or by Nick Cave? Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds by The Black Crowes, and You've Got to Hide Your Love Away by Eddie Vedder! Come on!!!!!! That's what's supposed to be a movie with Beatles music, instead of a stupid love tale with a couple a no-names singing to each other, tearing apart some of the most beautiful songs in the history of the universe.This? This is not a musical. This is a severely lack of respect. To the viewers, to the musical genre, and to The Beatles. It's so bad. The script could be written by any moron. I'm so indignant that I felt obliged to comment this movie.Seriously, there's a TV ad of an Argentinian beer, that scripted just like this movie, done ten times better, and five years ago. In 60 seconds, much more moving than this pseudo-musical.Honestly, the worst musical I've ever seen. And I love musicals. Please, do not watch it.

A major Trip but the best kind!~!,"The trailer alone made me feel like I just had to see it. I was not disappointed and I was amazed at the final result. This movie at first with the singing was different but by the end I could not wait to hear another song because they all helped tell the story. The special effects were mind blowing and the cast with perfect. Evan Rachel Wood is talented and she really showed off her talent. The newcomers were great they were enjoyable to watch on screen and made their characters so real and so believable. The music for one is of course the Beatles but I think more films sound be made like this one but with different artists telling a story just like this one. If your a fan of the Beatles music then see this, if not and you just love musicals then seen it. If you like an epic love story taking place in one of many difficult era's then I recommend this movie those people!~!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Worth it?,"Was Across the Universe worth watching? Yes and no. I've seen this movie sober, and under the influence and I must say, it was a completely different movie the two times I watched it. I first watched it while intoxicated while at a friend's home. It struck me as a movie not particularly worthy of remembrance, but with very good covers of some classic Beatles songs, which stuck with me through the week, though the rest of the movie seemed incoherent and pointless. I decided to watch it again, sober this time, thinking I would get much more out of it than the first time through. I was not completely wrong, but almost. The movie is actually much more of a musical than I'd expected. In my opinion, it nearly overwhelmed then entire storyline. I attribute missing this in the first viewing, to my influenced state of mind, but even then, I was truly surprised I didn't notice. Other than the music, the story is nothing short or predictable. You can see each and every turn, though it's mostly a straight line, from almost the very beginning of the movie. With no real in depth plot, it's probably not worth watching in any state of mind but relaxed and intoxicated. If you like amateur theatre you may enjoy this movie as well, but the normal cinema patron or Netflix subscriber won't be impressed with anything but the music. Overall, if you'd like to watch a movie, skip it, but if you're into 2 hour music videos of good music; stay in, have (more than) a few drinks, and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Absolute Rape of a Legendary Band,"Phonie acting, emotion, and rape of classic works of art by a legendary band. I watched it once in the theaters when it first came out, and one more time recently. It rarely happens that my conception of a film remains the same or gets worse.In this case, it definitely got worse. I feel that being more interested in art in movies as I've gotten older, really demonstrates how bad this film really is. Before it was simply a dislike of the horrible way the actors were trying to sing the music differently for my younger generation. It was just absolutely disgusting and pathetic. They tried really hard to change it to stay in tune for this younger generation that they warped the music and took away its meaning. I mean, you can't say those Beatles songs mean the same thing in this movie. AT ALL. The songs held meaning for a decade in history, and in this movie, though they tried to add it, it focused on a stupid and phone love story. The acting was so horrible, I think you'd be lying to yourself if you didn't think about rolling your eyes at least a couple times during this film. I'll get back on it a little later. But these are just surface things about the movies. Back to the songs though. JUDE! LUCY? Strawberry fields? You've got to have a stupid sense of imagination if your eyes didn't roll right to the back of your heads. Did people seriously sit there and go... ""HOW CLEVER!"" Its absolutely pathetic because this film's only support is that of songs from a legendary band.Rewatching it, I definitely disliked the film more for destroying the classical and true meanings of the songs. Perhaps more so because the characters were played pathetically. If you think about it, Jude's story feels forced into the film simply to be clever and play ""Hey Jude"" and have some (if any) connection to the roots of the music by having a character from Liverpool. His character doesn't really fit in the movie though. He really has no emotion, real drive, reason for thinking the way that he does. If you think about it, every other character has a stronger sense of feeling or doing what they do because they have a stronger back story. Jude is as useless as Prudence if you think about it. Prudence's only reason for being in the film is to add Dear Prudence song. And to prove it, she's gone the rest of the film until the end. You have all these random songs being played because they are good songs, and the film tries to put them by adding a random character or scenario and having these random plot strings that kind of trail off and die.As far as actually filming, the acting is terrible, but I've said that a couple times by now. Why are Jude and Lucy in love? They met at a bowling place, and she shared a simple story with him about her boyfriend dying. Next thing you know she goes all the way to New York and sleeps with him. That'll do it I guess. I'm not sure Jude makes Lucy feel special enough for the connection to transfer to this longing for one another at the end. To be fair, Bane/Mad Max who is pretty much Lucy's boss and secret lover in reality, had a stronger connection with her than Jude. I'm really surprised at the lack of connection.This moves to the camera angles, art, and color added to make scenes look better in the film. The film did use color correctly and even had good concepts of film angling, but it was done totally inappropriately. We can sense a lack of connection with Jude and Lucy really... in my opinion when they get on the bus and find the circus. The reason being because the story is bringing about the decade more in its revolution. Where Jude is having fun, Lucy is living a revolution. I get the love part in the water with the blue and green color, but again, inappropriate, considering the plot has moved on. We continuously see a lack of connection, and all of a sudden we have Jude and the use of love with red in the Strawberry painting. How random, and also convenient to have a Strawberry Fields concept thrown in there.We see how the film has separated the two characters. Lucy is in revolution due to personal losses, but then the film also artificially keeps Jude in his own bubble. The only explanation is he stays in the apartment all day doing mediocre art. There are no real camera angles that depict the true meaning and plot of the film, except when they are all drugged up. Thats all fine and dandy, but all of a sudden Lucy and Jude are to be taken seriously.All in all, bad film. Bad acting, along with a plot that is all over the place due to the fact it is trying to be clever with famous Beatle songs makes it completely pathetic.",1.0,Anonymous,History
I think it was very good,"As someone already said, you have to see this film with an open mind. Like any musical, like ""Hair"", ""A chorus line"", ""The Rocky horror picture show"", or any classic musical we can see on Broadway, there is the storyline, there is the music, and there is the acting. You have to like this ""genre"" to fully appreciate the fantasy.Of course, the rendition of the song in an ""interpretation"" by the different actors of the Beatles' songs, and in no way this rendition in meant to do better that the original songs. It is just ""different"", and this is why you have to keep an open mind. If you want some kind of a story with the original song, go see the ""Cirque du Soleil"" in Las Vegas, all song are originals and they put all kinds of performance to illustrate and enrich the musical experience.On my part, I was prepared to see this film and I was told what to expect. I just went with it and I had a really GOOD TIME!. I believe this movie can become a classic as much as many of those who didn't receive good reviews a first. ANd also, you have to admit HOW good was this Evan Rachel Wood!! Damn she was good. You also have to admit that those different renditions of the song were absolutely flawless as far as ""signing"" was concerned. All those were extremely good signers. As I said, it is ""different"" than the originals, but worthy of listening nevertheless.",,Anonymous,History
"""Rent"" Meets ""Mama Mia""","I give an E for Effort to Julie Taymore, but the problem is she didn't know when to quit. The movie veers from the sublime to the soporific, bogged down by a banal boy-meets-girl story that should have served only as a backdrop to move the musical scenes along, since it's not an interesting or original story in itself. The characters are more generic than ""Rent,"" and the tunes are sewn into a less coherent whole than ""Mama Mia,"" or ""Hair,"" but this movie offers some imaginatively staged musical scenes and special effects which are in a class of their own. The elements of 60's social history are well suited to the music which originated at the same time, but the tone of the film becomes unpleasantly heavy, given that the film doesn't really have a point of view and eventually just dissolves into the gooey love story. Well worth seeing, but don't feel bad if you can't make it all the way to the end.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Greatest Movies of all Time,"Movie musicals are almost always great, but it takes real talent to make an amazing musical like Hairspray, High School Musical 2, Moulin Rouge, or Rent. Across the Universe is one of the best musicals I've seen, becoming a stand-out with some of the best performances and songs in modern film. Director Julie Taymor takes all of these modern clich√©s and makes everything feel sparkling new. Many things in the film have been done before and in drastically different ways, but never have they come out so perfectly and consistently as in Across the Universe. The movie stars relatively unknown actors, but that is why it works so well. Every actor or actress is simply made for the role that they have been given, and such energy flows through the production that you'd be surprised how great things turn out to be. Evan Rachel Wood stars as Lucy, Jim Sturgess stars as Jude, and Joe Anderson plays Max.Across the Universe tells the story of Jude and Lucy, who meet during the 1960's during times of war and crisis, and each of them have separate desires regarding the war, some of which tear them apart. Nevertheless, the two fall completely head-over-heels for each other and must face the hardships that threaten to ruin their relationship.This film utilizes each song in such a beautiful and seamless fashion that in some cases, you forget that you're listening to Beatles songs that have been reworked, sometimes even with different tunes or melodies. Songs such as 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'I am the Walrus' are given luscious and trippy on-screen representations that only makes you appreciate how wonderful the Beatles music really is. Also, there are a few cameos, such as Bono in one of the best scenes in the movie.The cinematography and visuals are probably the best thing about the movie, including the underwater sequence and a crazy scene with Mr. Kite (played by Eddie Izzard). Director Julie Taymor has such a rich vision of the 60's, and she does a great job of bringing it to the big screen. None of the scenes are bland or plain; every shot is unique in some way as song after song is released upon the audience in a spectacular fashion. She captures almost every important political aspect of the 60's briefly, almost making the film a huge collage of 60's references accompanied by an absolutely incredible plot. The visuals are just absolutely insane and revolutionary, and even some of the most minor touches work so effectively. This is the type of film that really pushes the limits of art and creativity and makes something that seems so fresh and new.Another great thing about watching Across the Universe was being witness to the great vocals and acting of the leads. Even the most minor characters like Prudence and Mr. Kite really stand out. Jim Sturgess is, by far, the best up-and-comer in the cast, with a really smooth and flowing voice and lots of charisma. He makes the character of Jude, which could be rather dull and boring under other circumstances, almost instantly likable and very appealing. Evan Rachel Wood is also perfectly cast as Lucy, and she is simply gorgeous in almost all of her scenes. Her on-screen chemistry with Sturgess is nothing short of perfect.Across the Universe is not just a flashy, character-driven romance piece; its design, visuals, acting, and script elevate it to such a higher level than that. The film is basically an instant classic that is very difficult not to like, and its music transcends the film and makes you really feel for the characters and what they're going through. The movie takes some old content and makes it new. Across the Universe perfectly captures the mood and feel of the 60's almost so much so that you feel as if you're living in them. It feels like a revolutionary movie, with all the makings of a cult classic, and yet even that is not giving it enough credit. Oprah is simply raving about this movie, and it has received mostly positive reviews from the critics, especially Roger Ebert, who says that Across the Universe is ""an audacious marriage of cutting-edge visual techniques, heart-warming performances, 1960s history and the Beatles songbook,"" and he gives the movie 4 stars. If you like the Beatles in any way, shape, or form, you absolutely have to see this movie. A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
Meh...,"Across the Universe will likely go down in history as the movie that ""got it right"" in terms of translating the Beatles' music to the big screen, but part of me thinks that they haven't quite got it yet.Let's summarize major Beatles' movies to date: A Hard Day's Night had music translated into a film, and although it was amateurish and manic, they did well.Help! had music translated into a film, an although even MORE manic, did OK.Magical Mystery Tour had music translated into a film, and was a mess. I could barely sit through 20 minutes of it.Yellow Submarine was a very good mix of music/film, with a bit of non sequiter.Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a wacky interpretation of more Beatles' music than it should've been, tainted by the music producers of the 70's. It was definitely a product of its time.Across the Universe was a simplistic love story spanned over two countries interspersed with real-life events. Charming, but shallow.

The only thing that looked correct, kind ‚Äìa was the sign, half right.In the 1960's mid to late, there were 2 to 3 cops on most corners in the east village, lots of grime.

People having sex on the stairways at the Fillmore. Where was the director during the 60's??

What a waste of Beatles songs!,"After watching this film, I'm speechless. In my humblest opinion, it is one of the worst movies ever. Not only the story is unbearable, incredible and bland. It is succession of topics about the sixties, all together in 133 minutes: rock music, the Vietnam war, drugs, youth power, the fight of the rights for black people and so, badly linked together with Beatles songs. But Beatles songs are not the universal glue to stick together a bad plot. The use of some songs may be relevant in some occasions, but of others, not.In addition to all this horror, the main character (would you believe his name's ""Jude"", like in the song ""Hey Jude""?), played by John Sturges, suspiciously resembles Paul McCartney and comes from Liverpool. There's another character who pretends to be an incarnation of the great Jimmy Hendrix. Some other characters have names of Beatles songs characters: there's a Sadie, and a Lucy, and a Prudence, and a Jo-Jo and they all have songs sang to them; The Beatles wrote them: ""Sexy Sadie"", ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", or ""Get Back"".What is worse: at the end of the film, the band, lead by Sadie, sings a song in the attic, just like The Beatles did in their last public appearance. This is nearly an insult to every Beatle fan. I highly recommend not to watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A Psychedelic Odyssey Through Love and Time: 'Across the Universe' Reimagines The Beatles' Legacy,"""Across the Universe,"" directed by Julie Taymor, is a vibrant and imaginative musical drama set in the 1960s. The film ingeniously weaves Beatles' songs into its narrative, telling a story of love, protest, and self-discovery.The story centers on Jude (Jim Sturgess), a young man from Liverpool who travels to America and falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a sheltered American teenager. Their love story unfolds against the backdrop of the tumultuous 1960s, marked by the Vietnam War, emerging counterculture, and civil rights movements. The film's narrative is propelled and enriched by interpretations of Beatles' songs, each chosen to reflect the time's spirit and the characters' emotional journeys.Julie Taymor's directorial choices are bold and visually striking, blending live-action with unique animated sequences, surreal imagery, and elaborate musical numbers. Taymor uses these elements not just as embellishments but as integral parts of storytelling, reflecting the era's psychedelic and experimental energy.The film stands out for its innovative integration of music and narrative. Each Beatles song is reimagined to fit the context of the story, serving as more than just a soundtrack but as a narrative force. This approach offers a fresh perspective on well-known songs, allowing them to resonate emotionally and thematically with the audience in unexpected ways.Taymor seems intent on capturing the essence of the 1960s - its hopes, dreams, and eventual disenchantment. The use of Beatles' music is not merely nostalgic but a deliberate choice to evoke a sense of time and place. The film's visual style, from its vivid color palette to its dreamlike sequences, works to create an almost magical realism, reflecting the era's radical spirit and the characters' inner worlds.""Across the Universe"" is a film that not only entertains but also invites reflection on a pivotal era in history, the enduring relevance of its music, and the universal themes of love, loss, and change. Taymor's film is a bold, imaginative journey through the 60s, as seen through the lens of The Beatles' music, offering a unique cinematic experience that blends history, music, and storytelling in a visually stunning and emotionally compelling way.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Maxwell's silver hammer came down on Julie Taymor's head!!!!,"What went wrong? What went so very wrong? This film is an embarrassment in its execution. The only redeeming quality of the whole film was the music, other than that it is a nightmarish offspring of a VH1 original movie and High School Musical. Julie Taymor is definitely capable of making a MUCH better movie. Frida was well done. But this ***shudder*** was just frightening. There was a Joplin-type character and a Hendrix-type character!! Why, you ask? Oh because they were already spinning a strange cartoonish version of the late 60s, so why be shy? There were moments were it did become visually interesting but when it happened it seemed to be at the wrong moments. Then there were moments that were screaming to become visually interesting and instead they sat there as limp as a wet noodle. I work in the art department on feature films and I must say that some of the scenic painting was nice in the apartment but the way it was all lit and shot, it just killed it all. It looked like a TV movie. I have never seen a movie that teetered on the edge of being good but instead leaned towards bad as much as this one did. I can only hope that this monstrosity was the product of the studio mucking it up. I know there were fights. I know that they essentially ripped the film out of Taymor's hands but I have trouble believing that they would take away visual effects that they had already paid for. If that is the case then I will watch a directors cut. I really want to believe that Taymor had a much better film in the can and that it was the ""suits"" that put this sad movie into the theaters.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Rich vs. poor, illegitimacy, the Vietnam War, riots in Detroit, Michigan. Everything has its place which ties in so nicely with our characters.You could never believe that there is a musical scene showing the draft physical. It is marvelously staged.

Too Good to Be True,"Across the Universe seemed like a dream come true at first; a movie all about the Beatles, encompassing the drugs, the life, the revolution. But, the dream was too good to be true. This movie tried its best, but I don't think any of us could come out saying the movie did the Beatles justice.The movie by itself is definitely an interesting piece and should not be thrown aside with the other failed attempts (See ""Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band""). The characters (most of them) were pretty well developed, although some of them just seemed like they were there to throw in some references to the songs. The singing was pretty good, although some of the songs were just a bit... they really were there once again for the sake of having Beatles tunes in the movie.I think ""Across the Universe"" had two choices: be a Beatles movie just for the sake of Beatles in the movies, or be a real, quality motion picture. It tried too hard to be a bit of both, and although I hate to say it, that's just too good to be true.",,Anonymous,History
mind blowing and exciting...but no Moulin Rouge,"Julie Taymor does a fabulous job of creating a seemingly perfect narrative to the Beatles catalog. Most songs used, especially in the first half of the film, are strategically used to help the story and not just thrown in gratuitously (except ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" which the film could've done without.) The performances are strong and the choreography, music, and visuals are astounding. There are places in the second half of the film that could've used some help in editing to improve the pacing (the second half drags from Bono onward) but it's still a must see for any Beatles fan. I would also recommend Moulin Rouge, an extraordinary musical that also uses contemporary pop songs to tell a story (and in my opinion, done better by Baz Luhrmann than Taymor).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Terrific film utilizing the Beatles music in the most creative ways,"I love so much about this film and always have since I first saw it 15 (!) years ago. Much like the film it most resembles, Hair, it too was sadly a commercial failure. I cannot help but wonder why in both cases as both are excellent films. This film uses 30 Beatles songs sung by the cast in a variety of ways with some very different interpretations than the originals. Some light fluff from the Beatles early years are now somewhat heartbreaking ballads. The cast is great, though I am sad that the two males leads, Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson did not go onto much bigger careers than they did.Dana Fuchs is a musician who plays a sort of Janis Joplin character and she is simply great, but she apparently was not interested in acting. Our loss.There are far too many wonderful moments to mention in this film that takes place in and is about the revolutionary Vietnam War years movement, oddly the same time period as Hair. Perhaps the masses are just not interested any longer in musical films about that era. They were when Hair was on Broadway which was not nearly as good as that film is. Tis a shame as this is an extremely creative and original film that is immensely enjoyable. Some great and witty stuff here.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mixed Feelings,"I've just seen the movie, and I came out with very mixed feelings.I think that in this day and age, the traditional ""movie musical"", where folks keep suddenly bursting into song at odd moments, no longer works. ""Chicago"" dealt with this problem by putting all the musical numbers into fantasy sequences. ""Moulin Rouge"" made the whole film look more like a stage play then a movie. Because film has a tendency to ""literalize""--in real life I can't walk down a street singing a Beatles song and then suddenly find all the passersby joining in. I think in ""Across the Universe"" often the musical numbers worked better when the characters were actually performing on stage, or tripping on drugs. But usually (not always, but usually) it seemed awkward when at other times the characters would just start singing in their ""normal life"". There were times towards the beginning of the film when the songs were so embarrassing I felt like walking out, but gradually the film pulled me in after I stuck with it.Yes, every character is named after a Beatles song. Every time I heard a character's name, I cringed. Because I was afraid that somehow they were going to try to incorporate all those songs into the plot. Thankfully, the only two of these ""name"" songs that are actually sung are ""Dear Prudence"" and, yes, ""Hey Jude"". And these two were not too badly performed (although ""Hey Jude"" does seem to have all the inhabitants of a Liverpool neighborhood joining in, but at least we are spared too many of the ""Nahs""). Additionally, they save ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" for the closing credits.Covering a song is always difficult, because there is always going to be a comparison with the original performance. And sometimes the film's songs are far shot of the original, but sometimes the cover version is quite successful. I think that Eddie Izzard's performance of ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"", which basically becomes a Taymor-designed-and-directed music video, may have been worth the price of admission itself. Bono's cover of ""I am the Walrus"" is also a high point--Bono also sings ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" in the closing credit. But, for example, I thought the performance of ""I want you/she's so heavy"" to be a low point, the ""I want you"" sung by Uncle Sam and caricatured recruiting sergeants (who ""want"" the young men for Vietnam), the ""she's so heavy"" referring to Lady Liberty (!).This has all the characters you expect to find in a film set in the Hollywood version of ""the sixties"". There is the kid who drops out of college to move to Greenwich village, there is the bohemian artist, there is the guitarist strongly reminiscent of Jimmy Hendrix, the female singer who I think is supposed to at least slightly suggest Janis Joplin, there is more than one young man who is drafted to Vietnam, (with the obligatory ""medical examination"" scene) there is the daughter of middle class parents protesting the war, plus one or two drug gurus reminiscent of Timothy Leary. In some ways, there are too many characters to give them all proper development and still have room for the songs. I would have liked to know a lot more about the character of ""Prudence"" who seems to have an interesting story of her own, that we are told very little about. Also the relationship between the characters played by Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther McCoy was not very detailed.Plus the usual supporting cast of assorted war protesters, hippies, beatniks, soldiers in Vietnam, and phalanxes of policemen. There is marijuana and LSD, together with the obligatory imagery that feels like a groovy acid trip, and imagery that feels like a really bad acid trip. We've seen it all before, and I don't know that this film has anything new to tell us about this period of history.Go see the film just because some of the performances of Beatles songs are quite good, I thought that although Fuchs and McCoy weren't given much to do with their characters they both did a good job of making the songs they were given ""their own"". But you will have to also sit through some performances that are almost painful. Maybe your choices about best songs and worst songs will be different from mine, but I don't think anyone will leave saying that the film maintains a consistent high quality throughout.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Beatles are the soundtrack of the times,"I have waited for this film to be released on DVD, it seems like forever and played it as soon as Netflix came through. Although I felt that the film started a very bit slow, it did pick up nicely. My friend Roger is much better at analysis and criticism of films than I, so this is more of a consumer reaction than a real review.When I saw clips for this, I kept thinking of Moulin Rouge, but I could never really get my head around Moulin Rouge. The use of Beatles songs is a soundtrack for the times, which is where Moulin Rouge broke down for me: the juxtaposition of the era and the modern songs came off as too arbitrary for my taste.The musical arrangements and performances for Across the Universe were stellar and beautiful. For me, one of the true highlights of the film came when the plaintive and pure voice of Timothy Mitchum began singing Let It Be in that very moving sequence, with Carol Wood. It was somber, breathtaking and heartbreaking.Seeing Joe Cocker pop up was a delight, though I'd have been even happier had he sung With a Little Help From My Friends. The musicality of the I Want You/She's So Heavy number, and the symbolism involved, was wonderful, and captured the zeitgeist of the counterculture viewpoint of US involvement in Vietnam.I didn't mind Bono, though I've read some criticism of him in this (yes he was well disguised). His semi-Dennis-Hopper-Easy-Rider-meets-Doctor-Hook character was appropriate for its purpose. What I wasn't in love with was the Eddie Izzard-Mr. Kite sequence. It was a bit too dark for me, and the Monty Python-ness of it seemed a bit out of time synch for me, though I confess I can't recall whether Python was well known in the US prior to the 1970s, but if the time line of the film was in the least bit adhered to, this film was set in 1967-1968 (Martin Luther King was killed in the film), the summer of love giving way to more violent war protest and confrontations. I suppose that's being too picky. I really liked the rooftop concert nod and I wonder why Dana Fuchs wasn't being considered to play Janis Joplin.All notes aside, I was loving this film, it was an honest look at the era, with all its warts, and how a generation could move from hopefulness and idealism to cynicism and disillusionment. I'm fairly certain when I can, I'll buy it for my collection.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A mildly Potent Trip,"Julie Taymor does ""Hair""; as a Beatles' Jukebox Musical, no less. As expected from Ms. Taymor, the imagery is exquisite. Most song arrangements are interesting, and the occasional reference to past interpretations (Joe Cocker) add some fun of recognition to this humorless endeavor. I am not sure who is the target audience ¬ñ as a Beatles fan I was irritated rather than entertained by the manipulative use of character named just to excuse some songs and the unfunny use of quotes (""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window""), and I found the plot too pale for those not fully aware of the catalog. ""Across the Universe"" is not a ""bad trip"" (pun intended), just not a potent one.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beattles Musical is a Failure,"This was a poor attempt at creating a musical out of a some of the best Beattles songs ever written. First of all, a musical usually consists of a plot-line, which this movie lacked in a serious way. The movie never drawls the viewer into the characters. I felt I had no vested interest in people who are never developed. Secondly, the songs are desecrated by poor lip syncing and bad choreography. My final comment is that what the director may view to be deep, intelligent imagery is just painfully clich√©. I would recommend for all of you who have been really wanting to view this see this film, save yourself the time and spare yourself the from the desecration of one of the greatest bands of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Inspired entirely by Beatles lyrics, the story presents a crossroads of many different 60's icons.","Great movie for those of us who weren't around during the Beatles era. The movie brings the lyrical importance of their songs to the forefront and helps us all see how the songs became so meaningful to people of the time. There many layers of symbolism to be taken into consideration, as well as an easy enough to follow love story. Beautiful story and amazing cinematography. Some parts are little strange, yes, but, you are guaranteed to leave the theater feeling a little bit better about life, and respecting the genius of the band much more.

"Bad ""Hair"" Day","It was impossible for me to watch this film without comparing it with the earlier anti-authoritarian rock film ""Hair"" - and it suffers badly in that head-to-head. I don't really like the film ""Hair"" all that much, but at least the soundtrack is composed of original tunes (some of which were decent hits in the hands of other musicians such as The 5th Dimension and the Cowsills. Here I was ""treated"" to what I thought were rather tepid versions of Beatles songs shoehorned into ""hippie"" scenarios, often with lame associations tacked on. I can see how rabid Beatles fans would like most movies that would so many of their favorite band's compositions, but I find the experience (despite being a Beatles admirer and an unrepentant original hippie) to be artificial, glittery, and exploitive. But others might find it entertaining and even inspiring, I feel the film diminishes the songs' legacies and adds nothing to the cultural heft of the Beatles. A fair enough watch if you don't expect much.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Baby Boomers Will Love This Film!,"and teenagers and kids...hey, that's everyone, isn't it? I put off seeing this for a few weeks because I usually despise films that have inappropriate singing in it and thought because I hadn't seen any TV promo for it that it was one of those films that movie companies release under the wire hoping enough people will see it in order to break even financially; I couldn't have been more wrong! This film broke through all my cynical barriers and actually made my week! Intelligent, transparent merger between the spoken word and song, great acting (I didn't recognize any of the actors, but that's probably just me), and a fantastic script! The special effects weren't overworked even though they were used often, you didn't feel barraged by them. I actually cried during a few scenes... Ironically, this movie somehow applies in some surrealistic way to the war in Iraq that we're fighting presently; Hopefully, it will inspire our youth and boomers to unite as one in an effort to put an end to what's happening to those fighting in the Middle East (and other locations).

For someone who hates musicals - I'm completely agape,"If I had anything to do with the musical Hair, I would now shoot myself. There's no comparison. Unlike Hair this is the real deal. Sure there are a couple of rough spots, but, in general, no one, not even the Beatles themselves, have put together such a loving tribute to their music. And I really, really hate musicals. I only went on the strength of Roger Ebert's review. He said he saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and that, despite his heavy schedule, he had to see it twice! He was right.I was a young man in the 60s and 70s and this film very deftly brings out the core spirit of the times amongst those who were enjoying the alternative lifestyle. Nevertheless, I would have made a couple of changes in this film. For example, I would have made the cops more cruel, and I would have had Vietnam veterans be far more ruined and lost by their experiences. But as far as the most lyrical and emotional aspects of the times, this movie has it down perfectly. High praise to Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson especially. Evan Rachel Wood is also very good, but somehow, not really of the period for me though you often don't mind. For me, the picture hangs on the two male leads, Sturgess and Anderson, with Sturgess carrying most of the burden. Others are quite good too, and it's clear that the director, Taymor (who I will now follow no matter what her next project might be) got high quality performances from all.Probably the best part of the movie is the way they managed to make the Beatles' songs relevant to their storyline. The interpretations are brilliant, and I only wish they had done more along that line. That's no doubt the work of those who wrote the screenplay. But whoever is to be blamed, it's completely mesmerizing. I have never seen a musical I really like, except this one, and I am at a total loss to know whether I will ever like another one, but my guess is no. It's just too unlikely a combination of charismatic people, great music, and captivating ideas. There are some serious short-comings, like an almost complete lack of Hispanics, but I was somewhat quelled by the movie's credits which had a more representative smattering of them listed. I just can't let that ruin the experience of this film which is probably the most memorable and delightful 2 hours plus I've ever had in a theater. The only people I could believe wouldn't love this film is -- Dick Cheney and his ilk.",9.0,Anonymous,History
If you need an escape from reality and love the sounds of the 60s,"This beautiful work of art tore me apart -- in an amazing way. If you feel, like I do, that reality just keeps knocking you down, there is nothing like escaping across the universe. Cute boy, rebel rockstar meets the beautiful prom queen-esquire girl next door. The music works extremely well to go along with each scene. I didn't see one viewer not stand up and give a clapping standing ovation at the end. Visually impeccable, this is not just a movie for Beatles fans, but for those who love and want to be loved in return. Rhymatically the movie paced itself, incorporating the hypocrisy of war protesters, civil unrest both in the US and Vietnam and how love conquers all. Let's face it. We all want the good guy to win, and I fell in love with these characters and rooted for them to be together all the way. Buy the soundtrack, and yes, it's not Lennon/McCartney and it's not what it's supposed to be. We're here to see how people of ever age, race, sexual orientation, etc. can relate to each Beatles song, singing it with such convincing passion that you're glued to your seat, maybe shedding a tear or two.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of my favorites,"This is by no means a perfect film, but it remains one of my all-time favorites despite its flaws. Yes, it is thematically simple, even childish at times; yes, the plot is at times predictable and at times tangential to the point of madness; yes, some of the acting is wooden. But if you are willing to look beyond plot and character and see it first and foremost for its CRAFT, its FILMMANSHIP, if you will, you will find a dazzling masterpiece. The point of this film is not to accurately portray the 60's or realistic characters that may have lived in that time period, but to capture the period's ESSENCE through the songs of its most iconic musicians and a positively STUNNING sense of aesthetics that captures much of the psychedelic and liberal feel of the time. The film makes my heart soar and often takes my breath away. Any film that does that deserves praise.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"You needed a little bit more than love for this, sorry","Well, I did see this with an open mind & I expected that I would like it, but after about an hour I really just felt tired & frustrated & wanted to turn it off. I bravely sat through to the end... I did not think any of the performances were very good & Bono's Timothy Leary caricature was the worst... There wasn't great characterization & the plot was kinda silly in the parts where there was plot at all. Even the music wasn't that great & I love the Beatles. A song like ""I want to hold your hand"" for example is a rock song but they turned it into a pop ballad, whats more it wasn't quite clear what it had to do with whats going on & even then this jock that it seemed she was infatuated with only lasted one single scene so whats the point? Perhaps it was just to introduce the character of Prudence & yet it provides no characterization that is relevant to any part of the film after this point... Another thing about Bono's Dr. Robert is it was clearly trying to parody a Timothy Leary type character yet there is nothing interesting about his character. From the few minutes we see of him he comes across as an unintelligent drugged-out nobody with nothing to say. There was potential for Dr. Robert to be an intelligent & interesting character but instead he's really just a dumb bong-rat. In conclusion little or no characterization & when it seemed like maybe there was it turned out to be completely useless information as far as things that happened to that character later. There was little or no plot & what little there was were just forced opportunities for bad Beatles covers. I found this film to be songs & dancing strung together with the bare minimum plot & characterization... I did not feel it captured the feel of the 60's at all, maybe some people feel a small buzz of nostalgia merely because the bad covers remind them of the good originals...",1.0,Anonymous,History
Movie was to the 60's what Grease was to the 50's,"Just saw this movie and I must say - that was fun! The story is pretty universal - a guy and a girl from two different cultures fall for each other and their differences strain at their relationship, but eventually love conquers. The story has been told a lot of times - this one was set in the hippie period. But the centerpiece of this movie is the music.One thing a great musical requires is great music - and how can you get better than Beatles music? Listening to all those extremely familiar songs, I still marvel at the changes in chords and the way the music unfolds - awesome - makes me want to cry. Music really gets a person where they live - it exalts the human spirit and adds poetry to everyday experience - great music does it in a great way - Beatles music is great music.So with the awesome music, the movie has a great head start. Beyond this it is pretty well done - capturing the culture, politics, fashion and icons of the time. (We were pretty sure we saw Joe Cocker in this movie and IMBDb confirms it.) I noticed the director was born the same year I was - knowing Beatles songs inside out and having lived this era caused the movie to mean a lot to me. In addition, the movie had that aspect that you can't just put your finger on - it just moved me.I know I'm biased, but I believe the years 1965 to 1973 or so were the best ever for music. Every generation rebels against their parents' culture and that usually includes the music. But there is something different about the music of this period. I have noticed that my children's generation and all the subsequent generations to the ""60's"" rebelled against my generation - but the music is an exception. Subsequent generations to the 60's seem to love 60's music and Beatles music. So this adds some universality to the movie. There were several girls about 16 years old in the row in front of us in the theater - we could see they loved the music and this movie as much as we did. (My frame of reference to the movie was the hippies, protests, Vietnam War, etc. - I can't help but wonder what their frame of reference is for such a movie?)",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Creative and beautiful, ""Across the Universe"" works as a wonderful tribute to one of the greatest bands in music history","Managing to create an interesting story from dozens of Beatles songs (which, even considering the vast material of the legendary British group, is not something simple), the script also has the merit of developing its characters considerably well, creating dramatic arcs that, even full of clich√©s, manage to hold the audience's attention. Thus, we know that Jude travels to America in search of his father and that his absence ends up leaving the boy without reference (""I don't have an ideal"", he says), while the trauma provoked by the death of his first boyfriend and the unexpected call of his brother to fight in Vietnam ends up igniting the activist flame inside Lucy.As it should be, considering its fragmented origin, ""Across the Universe"" exhibits an excessively episodic structure that results in the feeling that its scenes were created without the writers worrying about what came immediately before or what would happen next. Soon after, caring more about fitting as many songs and references to the 60s as possible within its duration. So Sadie and JoJo emerge as pale caricatures of Janis Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix; Jude and Lucy star in a clich√© romance in which jealousy and misunderstandings predominate; and the war in Vietnam takes on the simplistic role of an obstacle to the main couple's love. Likewise, Bono appears in a cameo created just to make an (expendable) allusion to Neal Cassady and Ken Kesey, since his character, Dr. Robert, is a mixture of the two, soon inviting the protagonists (who are thus transformed into Kesey's Merry Pranksters) for a trip on the bus eternalized in Tom Wolfe's book, ""The Electric Drink Acid Test"".But everything is really an excuse for ""Across the Universe"" to invest in new versions of Beatles classics - and often successfully. Joe Cocker, for example, stars in his own reading of ""Come Together,"" while ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" turns into the touching and melancholy outburst of a lesbian girl who can't find the courage to declare herself to her beloved, a cheerleader (and the line ""Let me be your man,"" needless to say, thus takes on an entirely new connotation). And if the beautiful ""Let It Be"" gains strength when accompanying a little boy who hides behind a burning car during the racial clashes between the police and the black population in Detroit, in July 1967, the equally classic ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" is converted into a political anthem in which strawberries come to symbolize the blood spilled by war. On the other hand, ""The Benefit of Mr. Kite"" gives rise to a surreal, as well as throwaway, sequence starring Eddie Izzard, while ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" is used as a forced elegy for Martin Luther King.Easily divided into ""numbers"" of greater or lesser effectiveness, Julie Taymor's film is uniform at least in terms of the quality of its production design - and, in this regard, the sequence packed by ""I Want You"" emerges as the best of the film when bringing Uncle Sam enlisting young people who are handed over to an army of robots and sent against their will (on a treadmill) to Vietnam, when they appear carrying the Statue of Liberty while destroying the country with their giant boots and singing the verse ""she's so heavy"" - an image that, by itself, is worth the whole feature.Overall, all performances are beautiful, thanks to great production design, a dive into elements of psychedelic art. Let It Be, the most moving musical segment, tells us about hard times, the need for faith and the feeling of hope. The song is presented in a formidable parallel: while we watch a black child cry and then appear dead at a wake, the narrative focuses on the burial of a white boy from the war, receiving all the assistance for having served in the military. The Walrus"", an ironic song written by John Lennon, psychedelic and vibrant colors dialogue, transforming the images into a kind of exuberant painting compositions. The same style is adopted in ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", an excerpt that takes us to the works of Andy Warhol. ""Dear Prudence"" emerges as an anthem for people who are tired of social conflicts and their consequences.None of these numbers, however, have the metaphorical strength of ""I Want You"", an excerpt that rescues the famous character Uncle Sam, perhaps the greatest war advertisement in modern history, used in 1917 by the Armed Forces of the United States, interested in recruiting soldiers for the First World War. The poster with the character already crystallized by the collective memory brings the imperative sentence that names the musical performance. The recruited characters are packed, thrown on a conveyor belt, stamped, in short, in addition to being musically exciting, the excerpt is dense in terms of the film's dramatic load, given the simplistic script.Although some of them sound out of place and unnecessary, most of the songs on Elliot Goldenthal's soundtrack are creatively inserted into the narrative, appearing organic in a few cases, such as when Jude sings on top of a building or during Sadie's band concerts. And Jo-Jo. And even in artificial sequences some songs work well, like when Jude sings ""All my Loving"" to his English girlfriend (Lisa Hogg) or in the touching funeral sequence accompanied by the beautiful ""Let it be"". In other cases, the arrangement in the rhythm of the song is not so successful musically, as it happens during Prudence's performance with ""I want to hold your hand"", in a slow-motion sequence that also resembles a music video - and that, curiously, lends an interesting dramatic weight to the song by approaching it so sadly. But if on the one hand the songs are pleasing to our ears, on the other it is clear that the actors dub their own voices in many of them, which is strange and artificial. Even so, the sound design ceases to be competent, allowing us to hear the songs, dialogues and diegetic sounds clearly (as in the shots and helicopters that accompany ""Strawberry fields forever""), never allowing the sound of the songs to override the others.In the cast, the always beautiful and magnetic Evan Rachel Wood composes Lucy in a charming way and stands out more when she is not singing, although she has a good performance in some songs, as well as Jim Sturgess, who lives Jude with intensity and charisma in most parts. Of time - and the empathy between them is essential to the success of the novel. On the other hand, T. V. Carpio barely appears as Prudence, the girl who cannot express her attraction to girls, while Joe Anderson only has a regular performance as Max. Finally, Martin Luther gives humanity to guitarist Jo-Jo, while Dana Fuchs comes to sound unsympathetic as the self-centered Sadie, but even so they manage to create empathy in the skin of the couple that clearly honors Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.Demonstrating sensitivity in scenes such as the one in which Lucy falls in love with Jude, Julie Taymor leads the narrative safely, occasionally sinning, along with her editor Fran√ßoise Bonnot, by overextending some sequences, as in the participation of Bono Vox as Dr. Robert and the appearance of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard), full of competent visual effects, but that serve little to the narrative - which does not occur, for example, in the visually inventive scene in which the army summons the soldiers, rocked by ""I want you (She's so heavy) "". On the other hand, the editor has its merits for keeping the different narrative lines always interesting, prioritizing the romance between Jude and Lucy without dropping our interest in the case between Sadie and Jo-Jo, for example. In addition, her work is essential for the musical sequences to work, getting it right by creating interesting transitions, like when the sound of the helicopter announces that Max has arrived in Vietnam (a good example of a sound raccord, by the way).Following a standard narrative structure in novels, ""Across the Universe"" uses Lucy's activism to insert the conflict that will lead us to the climax, provoking arguments between the couple (in one of them, Lucy appears at the top of a ladder and Jude below her, demonstrating visually who psychologically dominates that relationship) and creating a tragic scale of dramatic actions that will lead Jude to be deported and stay away from the beloved, at the same time that Sadie gets angry with Jo-Jo during a concert and right after Lucy is arrested during a manifestation - in a scene, incidentally, excessively melodramatic, conducted in slow motion by the director. However, when the climax finally arrives, not even the predictable collective reconciliation and tired situations like the couple's mismatch manage to spoil the sequence, which ends the feature in a pleasant way and with great songs.Not everything is perfect in the script. It is notorious that the script creates poorly developed subplots (Prudence comes and goes without further explanation and her story never has an appropriate outcome, the same applies to Jude's father) and invests in clearly expendable characters (Sadie and Jo-Jo fall in love, fight, break up and get back together without any logic or explanation). Indeed, even Lucy's political activism is abandoned in the third act, when the film realizes that the time has come to resolve her romantic impasse with Jude. The story is simplistic and the editing should have been concerned with reducing the film, as there are 133 minutes that could easily be adapted in a smaller format.Even with these ""details"", ""Across the Universe"" has the advantage of being a musical that goes beyond those interested in the band that shook the planet and became one of the biggest references in pop culture. Creative and beautiful, ""Across the Universe"" works as a wonderful tribute to one of the greatest bands in music history.",7.0,Anonymous,History

But even all this original energy was not focused and frankly spun out of control to the point where the story, the characters and even the performances were laughably ridiculous.

If they make a Beatles movie he should play Paul, Paul Dano, should play John Lennon cause he kind of looks like him a little bit.

Across the Universe is AMAZING!,"When it comes to The Beatles I'm usually a purist. Meaning I steer clear from those who would cover, imitate, or otherwise copy their work. BUT, Julie Taymor and the cast of Across The Universe have proved me WRONG. This film is a fresh and visually engaging voyage into The Beatles music as told through the characters in the story. The song selection was perfect, and the cover tunes ideal in terms of the selection for which cast member is chosen to sing each particular tune. Jude (Jim Sturgess) finds his groove early and Evan Rachel Wood (Lucy) is as captivating as she is beautiful. I was shocked to discover that she was only 20 years old. And was shocked once again to discover that she is hooking up with Marilyn Manson. But you gotta give a guy his props. Nice catch. Joe Anderosn (Max) fits nicely into the visual puzzle, and the cameo by Selma Hyack was well placed. Hello Nurse.

Ticket To Ride,"I first laid eyes and ears on the Beatles at age 11, and consider myself a charter member of the era and a volunteer protector of the legend. This was unapologetically the music of my young life. This is the music I introduced to my children, and God willing, will teach my grandchildren.Fresh vocal and instrumental arrangements of the group's most famous songs, formed together as a story of young love in the midst of civil unrest and war, made interesting with fantastic choreography and special effects, and fun with Beatles allusions, were enough to hold me spellbound, laughing, crying, and overwhelmed, for more than two hours. It was a fantastic roller coaster ride and I wanna do it again.In only the briefest moments was I disappointed or puzzled by some of the minor clich√©s and unnecessary puns, and in others, stunned with the intuitive RIGHTNESS of the images.Since another commentator already mentioned it, I LOVED the funereal procession of soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty to ""She's So Heavy."" You don't need to be an intellectual to interpret the message of patriotism as a crushing burden in those times. The use of ""Strawberry Fields"" was a deeply moving metaphor, as well, but I won't spoil it for you.Some of the negative critical reviews, I suspect, were written by persons who either did not live the era or somehow expected the movie to deliver a profound, all-encompassing insight not demanded of other entertaining movie musicals. Someone even foolishly compared it to the ditsy long-ago Sgt. Pepper movie (with the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton), leading me to suspect that they had seen neither. No, you will still need to be a scholar of the Beatles, the 60s, and the Vietnam War in particular, if you want to begin to know ""what it all meant.""But for those who simply want to enjoy a quality musical and visual production set to the images and music of their young lives, yet told fresh and anew by young talents, you will be very pleased. It resonates with love, care and respect, just like a ringing George Harrison guitar hook over a burst from Ringo's solid drums, leading into a soaring Lennon-McCartney harmony.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting and unique, but a little too much","After my friend just couldn't shut up about how great Across the Universe was, he just kept begging me to sit down and watch it, so I finally did. We are both Beatle fans, so I think that's why he went so crazy over it, however, I wasn't so thrilled. While this movie is very creative at taking such classic songs by the Beatles and turning it into an entire story, I felt like this film was a little over the top and wasn't exaclty well put together. I was disappointed on a few things: the story wasn't that original, the Vietnam War story has been done too many times to the point where I was able to predict the story. Second: the songs, I absolutely love the Beatles, but the some of the songs felt like the director just pushed them in at last minute because he had too. Third: the characters don't have and depth and don't really do too much for the story.Jude has come to America from Liverpool, England to see his real father, he succeeds, but both of them know it's not the right time to get to know each other. But Jude decides to stay, he meets a college student, Max, they instantly become friends. Jude meets Lucy, Max's sister, they instantly fall in love. But the Vietnam War is tearing them apart when Max is sent to fight in battle; a few friends of their's stick together and try to bring the war down and make a difference. Lucy goes so far in the peace fight that it starts to pull apart her relationship with Jude and sends him back to England when caught in the middle of a riot. But Jude wants to fight to get Lucy back through the power of song, because all you really need is love.Across the Universe is a decent film, I would never deny that it was unique and interesting to watch, but I just wasn't too moved with this film. In some strange way it reminded me of Forrest Gump, with the girl who is in the peace fight and the man who is finding himself, also the music too I think. The actors were good, but I felt like this was just a waste of their talents, I mean acting wise, their singing was fantastic, but Across the Universe just didn't do anything for me. I know there are a lot of people who are going to disagree with me on this comment, a lot of users loved this movie, but I just didn't get into it, so I suppose this is a movie that you will have to judge for yourself, but I wouldn't really recommend it if you've seen a lot of Vietnam War movies.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece!,"This movie is by far one of the most original movies I've seen! To call this movie a whimsical musical is so wrong. The way the songs are woven in to the movie is absolutely SPOT ON. I almost get a feeling the movie was made for the songs. All the best Beatles songs, but I do admit I'm not 100% familiar with all of them. Their other famous songs hat were left out would just not have suited the theme of the movie and after seeing it, you'll agree that the songs featured suit the period very well (think Beatles trippy period vs. the psychedelic parts of the movie).Across the Universe has that wonderful ""feel good"" about it unmatched by few. If you like Moulin Rouge you'll love this one too. To touch the subject of the movie, the era couldn't have been better chosen! The 60's... It's politically involving without going to far (there's no moral qualms trying to be settled re. the Vietnam war etc..) and it shows us the hippie movement doing what it does best, a hell of a lot of weed ;)Hope this makes sense...Go see this movie NOW! And then get the soundtrack ;)",8.0,Anonymous,History
I walked out,"This is only the second movie I have ever walked out on. The first was Orca the killer whale. I love the Beatles and I grew up in those times. This was a gorgeous, yet tedious, experiment, and a really, really bad idea.The Beatles songs don't tell a story they are a soundtrack to a story of a time. To try and make the songs serve the dramatic ends of the trite and predictable story line was laughable.On the other hand, the special effects and the staging were surrealistic and imaginative. The actors were, of course, young and appealing. so that's a plus. Break this up into music videos and maybe it can be watched one number at a time on home video.Here in Chicago it should be a hit at the local night club movie viewing venue , the Brew and View where you can drink beer and scream things at the movie screen.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"""Yes...All You Need is Love With A Trip Back in Time and Magical Music""","ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a 'magic carpet ride' of incredible music and a love story of a wonderful young man's journey from Liverpool to America and the lessons he learns about real love, suffering and what it takes to find the woman of his dreams-and more. This is a great film and the cinematography is out of this world and Bravo! Julie Taymor for giving us a film you wanted to bring to the screen and not be dominated by the demands of a studio. I loved this film from the opening to the closing frame and it has the magic of ONCE with a dash of HAIRSPRAY in another role played by the incredible Evan Rachel Wood and a fabulous cast of actors and dancers.Having grown up and come into 'manhood' in the '60's, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE hit home to me with the remembrance of the draft, Berkeley and People's Park, the flower children of San Francisco and like the songs from the Beatles, I kept thinking about the Jefferson Airplanes' WHITE RABBIT and Grace Slick belting out her songs in Golden Gate Park and of course, the powerful songs of Janis Joplin.I look forward to hopefully seeing ACROSS THE UNIVERSE at Awards Season for a nomination and the pleasure of watching the cast again deliver a breathtaking performance and command of a love story which connected such an important time of events in American history.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I didn't even find it visually arresting and what Taymor and the actor's did to the great Beatles music is a crime.

Better than the Beatles,"One of the best movies you'll never see! I don't much care for the Beatles or their music. But LOVED this movie. If you like theater, history, and unique ideas and experiences, you'll love this movie. It's going to be a cult classic. Plus, it modernized the songs and I found myself humming them days after I saw the movie.And who knew Evan Rachel Woods could sing?? All of the songs in the movie are sung live. The only songs re-dubbed in a studio are a few that were sung on the street and there was too much background noise. Did I already say that I think these songs are better than the originals...? Unfortunately the movie jumped rapidly out of first run theaters into second runs because the studio gave it zippo support. But, YOU MUST SEE THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN. PLEASE, do yourself that favor and go and see it if it's playing in art houses or on the big white wall at your local park during the summer.BTW - Julie Taymor, the director, also made Titus and Frida, two more really excellent movies worth seeing.

This movie conveys the change and confusion of the time with a minimum of clich√©s and condescension.This movie accurately captures the changing cultures and the changing politics of the late 60's.

"Chaotic, but beautiful","Julie Taymor was not shy about saying there wasn't much dialogue in the film. There is a share of dialogue, but mostly to transition to the next musical scene - no large bodies of text or academy award winning speeches. This is a musical to its very core. It has a lot of ideas and there's always a lot going on. Most of it works.The 90s onward have been cursed with jukebox musicals, using an artist's songbook for the story. While Across the Universe does this, it doesn't spin some hackneyed Vegas style musical together and instead uses the Beatles songbook very appropriately, detailing lovelorn tales, drugs, and the ever so political decade of the sixties.So it shouldn't surprise anyone that while the songs are used mostly to tell a love story of Lucy and Jude, the plot plays merely a supporting role to the images and performances that the Beatles songs inspire. The ones that stuck out to me were ""She's So Heavy"" which was transformed into a nightmarish image of individuals reporting for the draft and ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" offering perhaps the best narrative portion of the film were the two male protagonists use it as a vehicle to state their conflicts. It functions well on a dramatic and aesthetic level.But with all the wealth of ideas, there are a couple missteps. The amount of characters can be overwhelming. It mostly works, but Prudence could've easily been excised from the script, as she is merely a subplot and her take on ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" comes off as unintentionally funny.My only other complaint is that a little too much time is spent on some ""Drug tripping"" sequences. While it's appropriate to the times, it seems more like a way for Taymor to do more visual work, which is fine because the scenes look fantastic.And I guess that's what it boils down to. The performances and visuals stand out so much in this film that it's hard not to recommend even with the chaotic overflow of characters, subplots and sometimes bizarre imagery. It's a feast for the senses and thoroughly enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,History
All you need is love,"An original musical film, Across The Universe is a fictional love story set in the 1960s amid the turbulent years of anti-war protest, the struggle for free speech and civil rights, mind exploration and rock and roll. At once gritty, whimsical and highly theatrical, the story moves from high schools and universities in Massachusetts, Princeton and Ohio to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Detroit riots, Vietnam and the dockyards of Liverpool. A combination of live action and animation, the film is paired with many songs by The Beatles that defined the time.Note: I am not a Beatles' fan. I have never been one and probably will never be, even after watching this film. I am only familiar with a couple of their more famous songs and I'm a fan of musicals. Now, I will say this film is extremely creative with its art direction, production design, choreograph, and anything else from the brilliant mind of Julie Taymor. However, I was kind of disappointed with the film as a musical.I really don't like much of the Beatles' songs. In the film, you'll hear about 35. Out of those selected 35 songs, I would count 3 as some very good songs and 7 as good songs. Yeah, I'm not really into their music as much as the billions of people around the world. I just expected better songs, you know? However, I enjoyed the film.When you first watch this film, it's hard to determine whether you will like or hate the film. In fact, it can polarize audiences. I felt like I could've hated or loved the film because some musical spots were fantastic and creative while others are incredibly horrible, in my opinion. I did like the cameo by Bono.The new, fresh faces in this movie is good. As an ensemble, they're decent, compared to other ensemble-type musical films. The story, unfortunately, is kind of predictable. You might already know what happens to the guy and the girl and the whole formulaic thing behind that.If you're a Beatles' fan, I don't know if you will like the film or not. I'm not so sure. I'm just an outsider who was just excited to see a musical, in which so many people I knew loved. This film could probably make you hate what they've done with The Beatles or love The Beatles even more because you've seen this film. It's your choice.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Grease With The Beatles,"My wife really like this movie. I thought it was horrible. As you read through the comments, you'll notice most people were entertained by the cover songs and the cinematography.I too am still confused as to what this movie was about. It's not that I need a movie with a point - I've watched many without. However I think this movie was supposed to have one. I'm also confused as to whether or not this movie was supposed to be a Broadway show, a drama, a rock opera, a giant music video, a love story, or a comedy. It jumps around so much that just as you get into whatever is going on, it changes into a musical scene that tries to be like ""Grease"" and fails. Miserably.Admittedly, the singing is why it gets two stars from me, as most of the covers are done well. Otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered to rate it.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Beautifully flawed,"Watching this film was an exhilarating experience. Not only was it consistently unpredictable, but it was one of those rare films that succeeds by wearing its heart on its sleeve, flaws and all. Were parts of it contrived? Definitely. Was it sometimes disjointed and poorly edited? Absolutely. Did I embrace it in spite of all this? Completely. Watching this film it is obvious that this was a labor of love by all concerned.There is a profound sense of joy abundant in this film; as if the actors, directors, set designers etc. were infused with a totality of inspiration. It would be easy to find fault with this movie. Yet it rises above all the flaws to emerge as a completely unique and engrossing cinematic treasure. In this way it reminds me of ""Apocalypse Now"", another film in which the glaring blemishes, born of inspiration,only serve to contribute to the sense of uniqueness and wonder at the effectiveness of the finished work of art. Immerse yourself in this film and you will be rewarded.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Jukebox musical with art-house pretensions,"As far as the mini-genre goes, better than ""Sgt. Pepper,"" ""Tommy,"" and ""All This and World War Two,"" not as good as ""Moulin Rouge."" Closest in feel & structure to ""Tommy,"" down to the rockstar cameos (Joe Cocker & Bono vs. Elton John & Tina Turner) and bursts of psychedelia.Way too long. Suspect the critics are falling all over this because it's directed by Taymor, rather than for its intrinsic merits. The whole is not equal to some of the pieces.Plot is inconsequential and a clich√©. Probably could have shaved off quite a bit of time by ditching all the dialogue and just leaving the music - it's not as though it would be too difficult to follow without spoken exposition.As a way of marketing Beatle music to a younger demographic, it seemed to work at the theatre in which I saw it. Teens and twenty-somethings seemed to be discussing it on the way out more than boomers (my age group).",6.0,Anonymous,History
Well worth the wait!,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a few disjointed moments, but was overall very awesome. The puppet sequences looked like they were directly from Bread and Puppets (not surprising, seeing that Julie Taymor apprenticed with the troupe in the 60's!), and caused my daughter to exclaim ""hey, there's the cow!"" (we had gone to Bread and Puppets in VT for the soul purpose of seeing the puppets after seeing the preview in August).Although I have at least one review downing the movie, I really liked it and was thrilled to see some of my favorite Beatles tunes incorporated into such a creative story portraying such a diverse period of our history. It was interesting trying to explain everything to my daughter, including why Max would have to hospitalized for drug addiction after returning from the war, and the vivid example of the civil rights race riots that occur early on in the film.We honestly need more films like this, giving us both the good and the bad points of periods of our history.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful,This movie was absolutely breathtaking. I unfortunately never got to watch this movie in theaters but i now own it and never get tired of it. This movie is unlike anything else out there and it's depiction of the 60's is very interesting to see. Most of the actors were unknowns which i believe was a very good idea but the downside to having unknowns is people not wanting to see a movie with actors and actresses they've never even heard of. I think the director did a good job with picking The Beatles songs that are in the movie she used the iconic songs and matched the scenes with the songs brilliantly. This movie is definitely a buy rather than a rent because you find something new in the story and visually every time. This movie is perfect to watch with friends over popcorn.,7.0,Anonymous,History
"Flawed, But Thoroughly Enjoyable; all Thanks to the Magic of The Beatles!","If you grew you up listening to and loving Beatles' songs, you're not to miss this movie musical. Though the movie lacks enough story or depth, the brilliantly choreographed renditions of the Beatles songs against well-shot landscapes and set-pieces are enough to mesmerize you; the songs itself have such power and meaning that when they're sung in relevance with the story have a terrific impact.To be honest, its badly-structured minuscule plot is quite a distraction, but ultimately, you end up loving the movie just due to the power and essence of The Beatles.Stephen Holden from the New York Times describes the movie aptly, ""I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled."" So, it ultimately depends on the person whether the flaws of the movie matter or not.

Save the $12,All I can say is I am in awe of the high rating of this film... Seems like it tried hard to be another Moulin Rouge and just fell totally flat on its face. I tried to just sit back and watch this with and open mind but it was just a hodge podge mess of a film. The characters lacked depth and warmth. In the end you do not care much if they get together or not you just want the movie to end already. Terrible movie.... I enjoyed Frida that at least had some feeling and depth to it.

Not what you expect  ...,"When you first hear the concept for the movie you're first reaction, like mine, is ""huh?"". How is that even possible? I don't know. It's not a bad movie by any means. It's just... interesting. This is one of those movies that when you try to explain it to someone you it comes down to you saying, ""You have to see it to get it."" You can't say too much about songs used otherwise you ruin the surprise of usage.The concept may seem contrived and stupid but it's in fact not. You get sucked in from the very beginning. The songs are placed perfectly, sometimes to a point where it's annoying or irritating. But you have to love it anyway. It's not the picture as a whole that gets you it's the little parts that make it up that do. The characters quirks, especially Max, soon make you feel for these characters and then it doesn't let you go.By the end of the movie you're wondering to yourself what the heck did I just watch. The ending seems strange at first but then you think about, and you realize it's perfect. I had to re-watch it right after I was done watching it the first time.

Steaming pile of dung,"Yes, drug use was rampant during the time the Beatles were big, but apparently it still is, seeing as how IMDb members have currently rated this better than 7 stars out of 10. This movie was in no way a tribute to the Beatles, but an insult. It was completely disjointed, as were most of the songs. The singing was appalling and the tempo was far too slow. The pathetic attempt to piece together a plot failed miserably, as did the attempt to be cute by issuing names that reference song titles to the characters, a couple of whom had no other reason for existing. When the movie finally ended, I was shocked to see that it had only run 2 hours; it felt as if it had dragged on for 3 or 4. It was all I could do to hold back the tears and the vomit as they proceeded to murder one tune after another.As a Beatles fan, I saw ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" when it was released in the theater, and I wasn't very impressed by it at all, but at least it had a great wide cast with well-known, decent performers who did a much better job of singing Beatles songs as they were meant to be sung. Even its totally silly plot line looks like a work of Shakespeare next to ""Across the Universe.""I have been an IMDb member for several years, yet this is the only review I have on file. What force compelled me to take the time to sit down and write one?

"A visual, aural and emotional feast","I grew up with the Beatles. I remember when Magical Mystery Tour came out - my brother bought it and played it non-stop. I remember the riots of the 60s, the horror of the Viet Nam war and the feeling of hope that saturated this time in history. This movie captures all of it: the look, the sound, the feel, the hair (Lucy's mother's hair in this movie is PERFECT) I got full-body chills about twenty times during this movie. It was like I was living those moments again: the fear, the joy, the hope, the wonder. And the music. Once again I am filled with gratitude for the Beatles and the miraculous songs they wrote. Just these disparate elements would have been enough, but Julie Taymor (and the writers of the screenplay) weaves it all together with a cast of believable characters caught in the throes of youth and revolution. I left the theater feeling like I was walking on air. A wonderful, wonderful film.I am relatively hard to please when it comes to movies - a bad script, bad directing, careless attention to details can all damage my enjoyment of a film.

Music was fun,"So I am a freshman in high school and I absolutely love this decade that this film was supposed to take place in. I have never been too major of a Beatles fan but I am a fan of many other bands of the decade. At my school, freshman were RAVING about this movie. Personally, I find freshman to be stupid and I don't think they understood anything in this movie. They probably just liked the music and played along with the crowed and said it was fantastic. This movie was not fantastic. It was descent. The plot was very...blank. So to speak. I felt as if you couldn't really connect with any of the characters. There is also the fact that I am a extremely conservative person and this movie was extremely liberal. It is kind of hard to enjoy a movie when you don't agree with anything in it. The only reason I give this film 6 stars is because the music is very catchy. Now you may hear people say its so ""artsy"", I personally thought it seemed like whoever created or directed this movie was trying too hard to be artsy, if that makes sense?

Across the Universe literally takes you throughout The Beatles era side by side with the evolving Beatles generation. The plot is nothing special, but the well casted actors compensate for it. One won't find Mr. Geres or Mr. McGregors escorting Mrs. Zeta-Jones or Mrs. Kidmans, the cast is about almost unknown characters with great singing talent and better charisma. The story starts in the sweet 60's and runs all trough the hippie 70's, when people would had to duck, crawl, roll and jump to sing for survivor and cry for love, showing the world what it really needs.

I never should have doubted this one..,"I was a little hesitant about seeing this, but it exceeded my expectations.Being a fan of Oldies' music, I was deathly excited to see what Julie Taymor would create from a script almost entirely based around Beatles' music. The first portion of the movie was phenomenal; I was sitting in the theater thinking ""alright, this one is totally going on my favorites list."" The creativity put into these music sequences was incredibly. I loved the bowling scene especially; I thought the guy who played Jude was great, especially with his quirky smiles and fairly decent singing voice. The whole idea of remaking the Beatles' music with the actual actors was also a good idea. I actually like some of these remakes (namely ""Hey Jude"", ""Girl"", and even ""I want to hold your hand"") as much or better than the originals. Probably the only pitfall for me was some unnecessary questionable content. A few downfalls... parts of the movie seemed like it was just thrown together using because Taymor was trying to stick too much to just music instead of creating a decent plot. Also, I'm fairly certain that the film could have been just as decent or possibly better without so many excessive drug and sex implications. I understand that this is an image of the 1960's, but Across the Universe could appeal to a larger audience if they cut out a bit of the nudity and such. Not to mention, I really don't understand how this film could have received a rating of PG-13; it certainly should have been R. However, all in all, I was highly pleased with the outcome, and am actually going to see it again on Friday. Cheers",8.0,Anonymous,History
Unoriginal and uneven but dazzlingly beautiful and unique,"""Is there anybody going to listen to my story all about the girl who came to stay?"" Julie Taymor's ambitious Beatles musical opens with her main character crooning this classic Beatles tune in a sad, melancholy tone longing for his love, quite reminiscent of Ewan McGregor's crooning David Bowie's ""Nature Boy"" longing for his love. The similarities are hard to miss, and this one song alone effectively sums up my whole opinion on the film, which is a series of parallel conflicts and contradictions that somehow all work in the end.On the one hand, Taymor's movie has many flaws. It is very simplistic and although it deals with large political and universal themes of the time it portrays, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. We've seen the whole hippy-getting-drafted-to-Vietnam tale in Hair, and we've seen the all-you-need-is-love theme in Moulin Rouge, which Taymor's picture reminded me of greatly. The story at its core is one of utmost simplicity: boy meets girl on the background of 1960's America political upset. The characters themselves are paper thin, each having about one or two identifying characteristics and one very straightforward character arc, and nothing more.But Taymor's work also delivers such immense beauty and brilliance in other fields that the two natures of the film overlap each other. As simple as it is, the epic boy-meets-girl tale outstandingly works on both an entertainment and on an emotional level. Once we reach the film's finale, we do feel for the characters and we are moved by their final gestures of ultimate love, despite their being thin and underdeveloped.But the film's true beauty lies in its visual and musical styles. Visually, the film is an accomplishment of unreachable levels. I haven't the slightest idea where Taymor drew her visual style from, as it is indescribably, remarkably beautiful and utterly original and never been seen before. Her film contains such downright amazing imagery, such as ocean waves clashing juxtaposed with protesting citizens clashing into walls of police forces, an incredible underwater sequence, a New York loft apartment becoming the sky, soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty through a miniature Vietnam jungle (singing ""She's So Heavy"" while doing so, no less), and five Salma Hayek army field nurses. The film is, no doubt about it, a sight to behold. But it's not just the sights that make this film such a unique beauty. It's also the sounds.For the Beatles' song adaptations, I truly and honestly salute Taymor and her crew. In this film she has created some absolutely exceptional productions. Naturally, the film's most beautiful, touching, poignant and best scenes are the ones involving the musical numbers. It's not just the songs, it's the entire scenes Taymor crafts around them that don't just feature the song ¬ñ they embody the song. And being a die-hard fan of The Beatles' music, it was just these parts featuring their tunes that were the most special for me. There are 33 Beatles numbers throughout the whole film, but a few truly stood out for me. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", which was consummately transformed from an innocent song about young love to a sad, melancholy tune of unrequited love without changing the lyrics whatsoever; ""Get By with a Little Help from my Friends"", which features the Ivy League gang and Jude ransacking and running wild around Princeton; ""I've Just Seen A Face"", as Jude sees Lucy for the first time; ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", featuring Max arriving to the drafting office and striking imagery of soldiers trudging through a miniature Vietnam jungle carrying the weight of the Statue of Liberty on their backs; ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", as Jude spirals down into frustration while bleeding strawberries are pinned to his wall; ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Because"", and of course ""All You Need is Love"" are my favourites.After I first saw the film, I wasn't entirely sure what to think, as my thoughts were so conflicting and contradicting. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it is a lot more complex than just a simple love story. It is in the simplicity that lies the key. The film isn't just a film that draws inspiration from and features The Beatles' songs. It breathes them; the songs literally embody the film. They are one and the same, drawing from one another. Have The Beatles' songs ever featured in-depth and intricate characters, or have they always been about simple, universal, undisputed love, especially their old works? Also, notice how the film begins with their older songs ¬ñ ""Girl"", ""I Want To Hold your Hand"", ""Hold Me Tight"", ""All My Loving"", ""I've Just Seen a Face""; in the middle are the psychedelic songs ¬ñ ""I am the Walrus"", ""The Benefit of Mr. Kite""; and in the end their later works ¬ñ ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Hey Jude"", ""All You Need is Love"". The film forms an arc similar to The Beatles' discography, and I don't think it is by chance.Ultimately, with Across the Universe, Julie Taymor creates a piece of film-making that simultaneously draws from many other sources before it such as Hair and Moulin Rouge, but also exists as a totally original and unique piece of art. Although Taymor's characters can be described as rather flat, we still do feel for them and by the film's finale are entirely emotionally engaged with them. The musical adaptations are downright incredible, absolutely beautiful and truly a revelation, and Taymor's cast of unknowns delivers incredibly well. The film doesn't always work. Whenever Taymor trails off and loses focus from her main plot line, the film can become rather tedious; the scenes with Bono and Eddie Izzard are particularly irritating. But on a whole, this is an ambitious, beautiful achievement in the movie musical genre with its ups, downs and contradictions but that ultimately works.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Extraordinary Creativity,"It's one thing to make a movie based around Beatles songs, how could you go wrong, but Across the Universe is so full of delightful surprises, so flawlessly executed, so heartfelt, it feels like a very welcome gift to our troubled world. I am no fan of on-screen dancing, but the choreography for the 'dance' numbers was so creative that I loved every minute of it. The actors singing voices all had a great sound and gave a new dimension to these ""old favorites"". Finally, the weaving of the songs into the storyline while sometimes predictable (and there's nothing wrong with that), at other times completely caught me off guard. I used to believe that there was no point in other musicians covering Beatles songs, because they couldn't be improved on -- after this move (and the I Am Sam soundtrack) I no longer feel that way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Eh?,"I liked this movie. That said, I think this movie is terrible. The plot is boring and characters are more often than not pointless. What redeems this movie, and makes it a guilty pleasure are the music scenes. They are creatively designed, and the singing is decent. When viewed as a series of unconnected music videos, this is very enjoyable. However, that doesn't make it a good movie. Without any real narrative structure, the set design is really the only shining part of this movie. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy creativity, and fans of music, but most other people would just find it boring. So, while flawed, I can still enjoy this movie, and hope to see more like it in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,History
leave the Beatles to the Beatles,"no, no, no, no, no. as a die hard Liverpudlian Beatles fan this film upsets me to the point of tears. cant ppl let the memory of the Beatles stay true instead of having half arsed Americans and the likes of Joe cocker ruining it. sorry but this is just a cash cow. previous reviews have mentioned that this is a great take on bringing Broadway to the big screen but for me leave it treading the boards so that it doesn't have to insult true Beatles fans with cheap second rate covers. only the Beatles could perform Beatles songs and that still rings true today, and as we are 2 Beatles down i don't think we will ever hear that magnificence again",1.0,Anonymous,History
Pure artistic expression,"The World through the perception of a lost era. A vision that could only be described as optical poetry. No creative entity of film making went untapped.

Any fan of the Beetles or any music of the Vietnam era will love this movie. Truly a heart felt story of love, loss, and strife. I predict this to be one of the ageless classics of our time.

not terribly original but what the hey.....,"It is really easy to find out whether or not people will like ""Across the Universe"". Just put two questions to them: ""do you like Beatles music?"" and ""did you like 'Moulin Rouge'?"". If the answer is ""yes"" to both, then they will; if either is ""no"" they will doubtless hate it. The film is not very original, a very severe criticism to direct at a director like Julie Taymor. I kept flashing on movies I've seen before - Milos Forman's ""Hair"", ""Apocalypse Now"", the Monkey's movie ""Head"", Taymor's ""Titus"", and of course ""Moulin Rouge"". (Fortunately, when ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band"" came to mind, it was only to note that this film was WAY better than that notorious stink bomb.) We haven't gone very far afield from those films here. There could have been some invention on display, and its lack is disappointing. But the film does not deserve the gripes, voiced here, that it is no more than a glorified music video, or is some kind of festival of self-indulgence. To the extent that the film captures, visually as well as thematically, at least the mythology of what the 60s were supposedly about, it can be put down as a success. Just not an enormous one.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"The Best Musical of 2007, Best War Film of 2007, but not without its quirks...","Let me begin by saying that this film is brave, timely and poignant and I love it to pieces. However, I concur with the other reviewers who have had slightly mixed feelings. The key to producing good musicals, especially now that the art form's pinnacle of popularity in the golden studio era of the 50s is an entire half-century past, is to maintain the audience's suspension of disbelief. In that respect, Across the Universe is exceedingly clever, transitioning with choreographed precision between what one might call diagetic and nondiagetic moments- ""real"" scenes and dance numbers. For example, football players careening and colliding in front and behind the protagonist of the moment gracefully transpose into dancers, flipping and tumbling yet still retaining a style of movement consistent with the football theme.The visual style of the film echos the innocence of Hairspray in earlier moments, and the colorful melodrama of Moulin Rouge in its representation of the Beatles' later more political work, as the politics of the film begin to cement. Smart editing in the opening sequence creates graphic matches, carefully balancing newspapers atop crashing waves. An army boot camp montage splits individual body parts into separate boxes, suggesting the dehumanization by fragmentation (Full Metal Jacket?) that takes place to create soldiers. Strawberries are grenades, bombs, bloody masses sacrificed to the war on terror --strike that-- the war against Communism. Yet in some scenes, all the visual trickery loses its place, and doesn't quite live up to our expectations of sensory overload¬ó the circus scene somehow seems too thin and too out of context for its own intentions.The film contains some of the most innovative set, lighting and costume designs I've ever seen- Max's abduction into the military comes to mind. Floors slide unexpectedly, hospital beds flip with Busby Berkeley precision. Soldiers march over a scale-model of Vietnamese jungle carrying a heavy Statue of Liberty. Many pieces surpass Dream Girls in their ambition and pure bravado. The budget, clearly many multiples larger than Hairspray's, lends itself well to the rendition of the Beatles' music, and the action is indeed impeccably matched to the visuals and emotional pitch of the plot. There's even some surprising re-casting of songs to suggest alternates to literal readings, ie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" about loneliness.But there are exceptions- the bowling alley scene falls particularly flat, as does an elating but contrived vision of ""Dear Prudence"" (could that effect be any more clich√©?). The plot also occasionally hits a rough patch, failing to sufficiently motivate Jude's animosity towards Lucy, and skipping awkwardly around the issues surrounding Prudence (is she Vietnamese? Were the filmmakers timid about offending the audience by exploring her sexuality in a less roundabout, under-the-radar kind of way?) and Jude's father. The emotional weight of the film takes longer to develop than it should, leaving audiences to spend the first 20 minutes wondering if they'll care about the characters or not.Despite these quirks, Across the Universe is the kind of film I have been waiting with bated breath for a brave filmmaker to take on. Its characters are not literally the Beatles or Janis Joplin, nor the actual characters described in the Beatles' music, they are in effect *metacharacters*- stand ins for ideas, people who embody the ethos of a generation, and by proxy, a suggestion on the direction of our own. The film repoliticizes and recontexualizes the Beatles' music for a new generation, allowing us to understand both the original context of the work, and its pointed applicability now. Comparable to Apocalypse Now in its timely, subtle and yet provocative objection to a war without end, Across The Universe asks a new generation to take up the struggle passed to it by their spiritual predecessors. It is a brave and elegant statement, despite its quirks and oversights, well deserving of a wide and receptive audience.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not Yoko, not the Beatles either","First, two warnings:1)This musical takes the material of 'The Beatles', maybe the most loved band of all times, so, clearly that some people will hate on it even before seen it. But this movie isn't no Yoko Ono, so chill2)This review is divided in two parts, 'For Everybody' and 'For Beatles fans'['For Everybody']This movie starts with a silly 'High School Music' feeling, quite dumb. But, when the principal plot is presented, we are on a ride for some good shots, that move the audience to the 60s, giving the whole experience on the youth of the time. And some times we are led to incredible moments, like the Detroit scene, or the strawberries scene, just blowing minds. With a combination of music, acting and photography that really bring a whole new feel to your soul. A very fun ride for allThis movie have some problems, if you don't have the Beatle's discography you may enjoy a little more the less famous songs, since its never the same thing, and get pretty disappointing when your favorite song is played in a ""wrong way"". Another problem is the feel that the filmmakers tried to shove the most music as they could in the movie, and sometimes you feel like a certain song isn't really needed in the moment.['For Beatles fans']Don't go to watch this thinking on your idols, the actors do their best, but they aren't Paul, John, George and Ringo. In a homage aspect the movie brings the feel of the music, and on the time. So go for a fun ride, and expect a fan movie made for the Beatles.Ps.: Sorry for the misuse of any word, or any mistake on grammar, English is my third language",7.0,Anonymous,History
A movie that does the Beatles justice,"I absolutely loved every second of this movie. I have been a Beatles fan for most of my life (granted I am only 19) and felt that this movie represented how music by the Beatles helped give a voice to a generation. The stories of the characters suck you in and let's your mind explore a musical world, in which I'm sure most of us wish was real. There are parts in the movie where the symbolism and artistic filming can make you look over to your movie watching buddy and say, ""really, did they just do that? That was a little weird"" But I believe those moments are what make this movie special. It is different from all the mainstream movies and lets your mind free itself of what society and reality has laid down as rules. If you don't like artsy movies, then this probably isn't for you. But if you are an indie film fan or like movies such as.... Breakfast on Pluto or any musicals then this movie will be like an addictive drug to you. I just saw it 2 days ago and I am dying to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Fun And Enjoyable Musical,"I haven't seen a whole lot of musicals, but obviously there are many different ways of doing it. Some include the music in a way that makes sense, some just break out into song, some are more fun while others are more serious. I think this movie is more of the fun and enjoyable type, and I like it for that. Sure, it can be cheesy, and you can nit pick little things and roll your eyes when you hear that the characters in this Beatles music themed film are named ""Jude"" and ""Lucy"", but if you just let those things slide, there's fun to be had.The film has a lot of unique visual qualities that make it fun to watch, such as the ""I've Just Seen A Face"" sequence or the ""Strawberry Fields"" sequence which both are a visual treat. Some sequences are more simple but still work well. The singing is also quite good. It gives a different and unique take on classic Beatles songs, which I enjoy even though i'm not really a big fan of the Beatles (I don't hate them, I just feel like they can be overrated. I understand their musical influence and significance, but still).There's also an interesting historical take in this film. It kind of revolves around the United States during the Vietnam war and a lot of the protests and issues involved in it. It makes for an interesting backdrop and obviously fits the music. Some may find things to disagree with politically within the film, but I personally don't think it forces any views down your throat. It shows how crappy Vietnam was, which is kind of undeniably true.Overall, it's a musical that I could recommend to fans of the Beatles and musical fans. Even people who aren't exactly into musicals can find something to enjoy within this film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This was,"not even a movie. I have never reviewed a movie before, but when I saw this film I felt compelled to warn people (and doubly so once I found out that some people actually liked this ""movie"").When I watch a movie, I expect entertainment. I expect to at least be interested in some semblance of a plot, and I expect the music (especially in a movie which emphasizes music) to not only sound good, but to add to or re-enforce the plot.What I got from ""Across the Universe"" was not in the least bit entertaining or interesting, but rather an enormously clich√©d and uninteresting story. The plot was a shameless mess of a story, which was clearly nothing but a poor excuse to play a specific list of songs. Even the praised ""psychedelic"" sections are simply a few minutes of horribly edited paint throwing and a ""solarize"" filter.The one part I could tolerate was the music. A few songs were even good covers, but most ranged from mediocre to things I could barely listen to. Even then, however, the characters inexplicably broke out into song for (often) no apparent reason.For these reasons, I do not consider ""Across the Universe"" a movie at all. It is, at best, an absurdly long and poorly made music video which thinks it can be a musical if it fits enough songs into one storyline.Most of the original songs were better than those in this video, and the story and visuals were a pitiful attempt. My recommendation, then, is simply to buy and listen to the original songs. It will save you time, you'll hear better music, and watching paint dry would be better than watching the video.",1.0,Anonymous,History
I left the movie smiling and singing.,"All right, top five things about the movie. Here it goes:5. The emotion of the sixties is captured in a completely new way. There are the highs, which get your heart beating and your mind racing (as well as redefine 'high'), and there are the lows, which take you so far into the characters lives and make you so connected that you feel the need to turn your head away in embarrassment.4. Not gonna lie, Jim Sturgess is attractive. He sports the short shag and the British long shaggy hair extremely well, he can sing with emotion...and he has that wonderful accent. For some, this is reason enough to see it.3. After I saw this movie and went around raving about it to my friends, one of the questions they asked me was who was in it. I honestly told them that it didn't matter. This is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a long time. Not all of these people are unknowns, but enough of them have gone under the radar that when they display the amount of talent that they do, you have a whole new appreciation for them.2. The movie straddles the line between reality and imagination and does so in a way that makes it a work of art. The surrealism is invoked at appropriate times, when drugs are implied or there is a mental breakdown, and doesn't hinder the plot, only helps it.1. The music. I ran out and bought the CD as soon as the movie was over and haven't stopped listening to it since. First of all, the actors are all extremely talented singers and it is pleasing to listen to. Second of all, this movie either redefines or reemphasizes the meaning and emotion behind these songs. The way the songs are incorporated into the plot make you rethink the words and it is the songs that carry the story and not the other way around. If you go into the movie looking for classic Beatles and an open mind, you will enjoy yourself. It is a new generation's swing on the classics, which needs to be understood. It is a reawakening of Beatles music.In a nut shell, see this movie with open ears and an open mind and you will not be disappointed. All you need is love.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Thirty Covered Beatles' Songs,"There are no opening credits. A young man, alone at the beach in winter, laments about his lost love as he sings ""Girl."" Then we see a montage of late 1960s violence in the USA as Dana Fuchs (""Sadie"") sings ""Helter-Skelter."" Next we are at a high school prom, circa 1964, where students dance to the tune of ""Hold Me Tight."" The boys sport the short haircuts of the time and wear white blazers. Then there is an inter-cut of British teens at what appears to be the 1960s ""Cavern"" night club singing the same Beatles' lyrics. The English boy (Jude = Jim Sturgess) says goodbye to his girlfriend as he sets sail to America. He wants to meet his biological father. Jude was conceived during World War II when his bio-father was a US soldier stationed in England; the father never knew that his girlfriend became pregnant. Back in the USA, at a high school football practice, an Asian cheerleader, Prudence (T.V. Carpio), sings ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" in the most deadpan manner you will ever see. Prudence grieves as she sings that she wants to be the ""man"" as she eyes a sexy blonde cheerleader. Yes, Prudence is a lesbian. ""Across the Universe"" is a simple story really, about young folks in love against the backdrop of the later sixties: the British Invasion aftermath, civil rights, the military draft and induction, Detroit riots, assassination, druggie culture, and hippies. Pretty heroine Lucy Carrigan (Evan Rachel Wood), who has lost her first love in Vietnam, has become radicalized. She spends time in New York's Greenwich Village and has fallen in love with Jude. Before leaving her comfortable home, Lucy reassures her mom that she will be good. Then she sees Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a Janis Joplin-like singer, perform ""Why Don't We Do It in the Road?"" After that she turns naughty and literally lets her knickers down. Subsequently she joins a radical hippie group that ""progresses"" from mass demonstration protests to violence to bomb-making. Ah, idealism! Meanwhile Jude finds work designing record album covers (like the psychedelic strawberry). Jude disapproves of Lucy's activist group and there's a rift. Will the former lovers ever reunite? The Beatles did sing ""All you need is love,"" but do you believe that love alone is really enough? Think about that for a minute.The real center of the movie is the Beatle songbook with the majority from the later Beatles; all are covers. Some are done better than others. As previously described, Prudence's performance is oddly sung. In contrast, grubby Joe Cocker, bogged down by age and weight, can still belt out ""Come Together"" with the best of them and still find time to save a careless pedestrian from being struck by a taxi. U-2 lead Bono's interpretation of ""I Am the Walrus"" is very well done too. Surprisingly, female lead Evan Rachel Wood's rendition of ""If I Fell"" is not bad at all. She can sing. By the way, Beatles aficionados know that the movie character names come directly from their songs: Jude, Lucy, Max, Prudence, Mr. Kite, Dr. Robert, etc.Although the actors are competent they are not exceptional. The pop art creation and choreography and sets are done well enough. Check out the businessmen with their look-alike suits, hats, and briefcases (albeit the second one from the right does trip during the song). How about the ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""I Want You"" sequences with the coming-alive Uncle Sam posters and induction tirades? On the other hand, the prostitutes singing ""Come Together"" does not exactly work at all. Unlike most musicals, this one has a song every few minutes that hampers the storyline, which runs far too long for one with just a paper-thin plot. The critics are all over the board on this movie. Dennis Schwartz (Ozus' World Movie Reviews) pans it, and Reelviews' James Berardinelli has only slightly more empathy. Leonard Maltin gives ""Across the Universe"" 2 ¬Ω stars, or OK. On the other hand, Roger Ebert rated it the number seven movie of 2007, and awarded 4 stars.

this is one of the worst movies that came out in 07.,"this is one of the worst movies that came out in 07.yes the visuals are amazing, but they belong in music videos. but the point is THERE WAS NO STORY, there was no connective thread between all the elements of the numbers, it was all random bursts of beatles songs pooped right out of the butts of high school musical kids(except the mr. kite's number and maybe 'let it be'). the writing is laughable, the acting is amateurish at best, there was no chemistry or real development for the characters (and 'jude's bouts of depression that turned him into an artist' doesn't quite cut it) and the most desgraceful thing is how they cutesify the 60's experience and turned it into some one dimensional Disney channel crap. The movie is a kiddie pool and I expected at least a waist deep pond. It was too sterile and broadwayie and if you're a beatles fan it'll leave a disgusting taste in your mouth.

"Decent musical drama, with too much sophistication and predictable solutions","The Beatles was not music of my youth and I was no hippie (due to much younger age), thus I had no nostalgic feelings about the period - late 1960ies. But I like musicals - in spite of trivial plots - and I welcome when ""ordinary"" actors perform singing as well. The latter was in place here, but as ""real"" and good actors like Joe Cocker and Bono were used as well, there was a big voice-related contrast (unlike in Mamma Mia!, for example). The plot was just okay, without sudden twists, and some scenes were aridly constructed based on a song-text, there others had too many hints to psychedelic experiences arising from new drugs. The ending was also anticipated.As the plot involves both Americans and Brits, the inclusion of British actors is logical - and usually their performances tend to excel the American ones. Not here, though: American females (particularly Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy) were much stronger than British males (Jim Sturgess as Jude and Joe Anderson as Max). Luckily, there were several smaller but great performances (Dana Fuchs as Sadie, Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite - to name a few).Therefore, Across the Universe is not bad, but I find Les Miserables or even Mamma Mia! more interesting and smooth.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant,"As a person who lived through the 60's as a teen Beatle fan, this movie never fails to offer up beautiful imagery and appreciated interpretation of Beatle music for me.

U. is one of my favorite films of all time and it always befuddles me as to why critics often give it a low rating.

"All You Need is Love, Love is All You Need","Originally, I wasn't a Beatles fan. I kind of thought their music all sounded the same, and was really weird (other than a few exceptions like ""Hey Jude"" and ""Let It Be""). This movie totally changed my perspective on it. I've learned to really appreciate the Beatles and their music, which I now think is brilliant, because of the movie. It skillfully mixed multiple references and successfully crammed 30 songs into 2 hrs. The visuals are stunning, and the story was so much better than I expected it to be. The main characters, Jude (""Hey Jude""), Lucy (""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds""), Max (""Maxwell's Silver Hammer""), Prudence (""Dear Prudence""), and Sadie (""Sexy Sadie"") help make the story what it is. This isn't a movie where there are few scenes that stand out. The movie as a whole should stay in your mind long after leaving the theater or watching the DVD. Some of my favorite scenes were ""I am the Walrus"", ""Let it Be"", and ""All You Need is Love"". Spectacular cameos were made by Bono and Salma Hayek, who actually sing (SHOCKER).

"Fun, but lack of Britain and what did this have to do with the Beatles?","Across the Universe - Julie Taymor's homage to the 60s and 70s. I'd call it an homage to the Beatles, but aside from using 33 of their songs (and referring to a few more) and eye-roll-inducingly calling the two main characters Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachael Wood), this movie has no real tie to John, George, Paul or Ringo. Nor, aside from Jude and Mr. Kite (played by the lovable Eddie Izzard), who I'm pretty sure was a hallucination (or was it? It looked so real), is most of the cast British.What shots there are of Britain (at the beginning and end of the film) show a stuffy factory-working bunch of elderly old men. Yeah, it's not like anything happened in Britain during the 60s and 70s anyway, right? Unless you count, um....THE BEATLES! I guess they were all so downtrodden cause we stole their Beatles.I love music and singing. I like Beatles music. I also liked most of the arrangements in the movie. Quite a few caused that goosepimples reaction. I also liked most of the singers. Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson, and Martin Luther were quite good. Didn't really care for Dada Fuchs as an actress or singer, and I found it kind of funny that SHE was the one to go on as a professional singer in the movie. My favorite has to be Joe Anderson. He had the most charisma, and was also the best written part. I wish that more of the songs weren't pre-recorded (There is a noticeable difference in sound) but I'm happy that the singers did their own singing.There is undeniable power in these tunes, if you're into musicals or just plain Beatles music. I am. Notable entries were ""Hey Jude"" ""Come Together"" """"Strawberry Fields Forever"" ""I Am The Walrus"" (How ridiculous was it for Limey-disliking Americans to say words like knickers and ""English Garden and English Rain). Notably weird and therefore personal favorite entires were ""I Want You"" and ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"". ""Twist and Shout"" was surprisingly absent, as well as most of the more shallow-pop Beatles songs. I guess Ferris Bueller cornered the market on that one. I was disappointed as I expecting a scene where Jude drunkenly types out one of the more innocuous Beatles songs like ""Love Me Do"" or ""P.S. I Love You"" in a letter to Lucy.Unfortunately, if the 33 Beatles songs were the films strong point, they were also it's weakness. Sometimes they had little to do with what was actually going on in the movie (or if they did, it was in a very roundabout way) and sometimes I had little clue as to what was going on. The script was kinda ""helter skelter"" and thinly tied in with the songs. These are elementary musical mistakes. If you're at the point where you want to get through the dialogue to get to the next song, the musical's in trouble. The music should assist the story, not override it. And this is a paper-thin story. The songs don't reveal or mention much about the characters themselves, aside from the obvious ""Hey Jude"", and ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" doesn't play til the credits roll. What was the point of naming her that then? Events are mentioned that mean little though are meant to mean more. People break up and re-unite for reasons not explained to the audience.This was an ambitious movie, and it suceeded and failed in various places. Loved the singing. Wasn't so crazy about the thin characterization and story. A mix, but mostly enjoyable, Across the Universe gets a B.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Tremendous Letdown,"I'm a huge Beatles nut, and a big fan of musicals as well. I was really looking forward to this movie. Boy, did it ever drop the ball. Granted, I saw an advance screening, but it was only a week before the movie comes out, and I doubt they'll change anything.There are two major problems with this movie; its plot and its characters. The plot itself is wafer-thin at best. The story is incidental to the music, rather than it being the other way around, like a good musical should. It feels like a succession of music videos with weak segue-ways in between. As a result, several of the songs do absolutely nothing to move the story forward in any way, shape, or form.The characters... The protagonist, Jude, and his love interest, Lucy, are two of the most unlikeable leads since Anakin and Padme. Jude, especially, is really terrible. The film does absolutely nothing to endear him to the audience, and by the end of the movie, I found myself rooting against him.Another character, Prudence, should really have been completely cut from the film. She has no real affect on the plot or any other of the characters, and was really only in the movie to allow them to sing ""Dear, Prudence."" Early in the film, she sings a VERY slow version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" and it did nothing but slow the movie down. Every time something happens with her character, more questions arise than are answered.If you're up for seeing some occasionally interesting visuals, and halfway decent covers of Beatles songs, then you MIGHT enjoy this movie.

Absurdly naive and badly made,"Am quite an admirer of the Beatles music
I spent a good part of growing up listening and learning from their music
The Beatles music would probably touche any body, and normally it is subject to numerous covers
Now this movie for me was a great structure that would make me enjoy a favorite group, a genre I love (musicals), and moreover it portrays the protests on the Vietnam war and the youth struggles in the 1960s.
Ended up as more than 2 boring hours comprising of a childish narrative and visuals that presented nothing new.
I immediately thought of what I was rerunning few days ago ""My Fair Lady"", a 1964 production, of the 1979 movie ""Hair"", of the 1991 ""The Doors"" the 1st is a theatrical piece played on screen, and the 2 later ones pretty much share the same interests of youthful struggles, Vietnam and protests against the establishment. Also came to my mind the 2008 Abba inspired Mamma Mia. Whereas these movies provided joyful and thoughtful experiences, Across the universe is a painful 2 hours where I struggled to enjoy the great tunes of The Beatles sometimes performed well and many others inadequately performed

I resisted seeing this in the theatres for fear it was too Beatles-centric.While the film isn't perfect, it's flaws are easily forgiven by the amount of heart that comes across, and the homage to the spirit of the period. It's actually quite magical, and this is one I wouldn't mind having in my DVD collection. And now I'm regretting not seeing it on the big screen.I really enjoyed her vocals.

This is just boring crap.) that are beautiful to look at; but the line is drawn there. It's snippets of Beatle songs that evoke memories of the times. The ""times"" that Taymor evokes are boringly snatched together and bear to meaning to a story. Scenes from HAIR and a couple of other movies come to mind. Oh, they were made in the 60s and 70s.

Better than excellent!  That's all I can say.,This movie is like a diamond. It has so many facets that create one brilliance. Phenomenal! I would do anything to work with this writer/director.Well..... my thoughts don't count unless I have 10 lines to say it in. So..... in the commentary alternate endings were considered and I am pleased with the one they did use. I interpreted it as no matter what developments/barriers progressed in Jude's and Lucy's universe (illustrated by being distanced by 2 roof tops) their lives were spiritually boned and came together again as did with all the main characters.It's been awhile since I enjoyed a work of art as this.

Unbearable Nostalgia,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is an unabashed musical packed with more Beatles tunes than I remembered even existed. The singers are brilliant. The boy who plays Jude, Jim Sturgess, is spectacular. He is better than the Beatles. He gives the songs depth, meaning and emotion that they did not have in the bouncy originals. The movie is essentially an opera, with bits of dialogue to tie together the musical numbers into a clever strangely uncontrived story. Each song usually begins with a minute or two a capella, perfectly sung. There are usually about ten people in the background dancing, or doing something or just looking colourful. It is like a non-stop visual torrent washing over your eyes. The choreography is original avoiding repetition.The movie reminds me of Grease and Peter Fonda's early movie, The Trip. It also reminds of my youth. It is pretty realistic for how surreal it was.The nostalgia was so thick it made me cry a few times. At one point Sadie did a Janice Joplin impersonation. Ouch!It is not a particularly light entertainment. It is set against the brutality of the powers that be who brought you the Viet Nam War. The depiction of the violence is mostly surreal. Yet it got under my skin even more that blunt realism would. I have seen so much of that my hide is tough. There was one scene when you watch from a distance as two soldiers deliver notice the beloved son has died and the reaction of the mother and girlfriend. I have never seen that done so powerfully before.The ending was so predictable and so saccharine I felt let down, quite unlike the rest of the movie, but at least they clipped it short.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Hmmm...,"I went to see this movie with high expectations. All my friends said it was terrific. The songs were really amazingly sung (I got the soundtrack before seeing the movie). But after viewing it I was sorely disappointed. The only character that was focused on at all was Jude. Not even Lucy--his lover--had that much development, other than her past tragedy. I thought the transitions from dialogue to song were horrible, and totally random. Additionally, it was hard to take the entire movie seriously. I wanted to like it, but found I couldn't. It started out okay, but everything just got more confusing as the movie progressed.The acting was good. The script was mediocre. The execution left much to be desired, as did the plot.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe will blow your mind!,"Across the Universe is not your typical musical. Set to more than 25 Beatles songs, Across the Universe will blow your mind like it did mine. The songs that were sung were not done in a way that mimics the classics of the Beatles, but done in their own original way which was very cool. Each character was named after a Beatles song or song reference. (i.e Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Prudence, Sadie, Mr. Roberts) Not to mention, the voices of some of these actors are tremendous!Across the Universe is set in the savvy 70‚Ä≤s, as you can probably tell from the picture above, smack-dab in the middle of the Vietnam war. The plot involves every aspect of the 70‚Ä≤s that was important; war drafts, colorful protests, sex, and of course drugs. Though some of the drug scenes are not quite realistic, I think everything else is put in to place very well.The charming Jim Sturgess plays Jude, a young man dropped on the shores of America looking to find his father, who works at Princeton. At Princeton, he meets Maxwell (or Max) played by the amazing Joe Anderson. Maxwell is a quirky, troubled college student with a sister, named Lucy, played by Evan Rachel Wood. Max makes the decision to drop out of college and move to New York with Jude. They stay with a singer, Sadie played by Dana Fuchs, and shortly after Prudence (T.V Carpio)‚Äìwho I must say has an absolutely beautiful voice‚Äì and JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) Eventually, Lucy goes to New York too, and Jude and Lucy end up falling in love.Like I said above, there are 25 Beatles hits that outline Across the Universe, but some of the best by far were Max's ""Hey Jude"", Prudence's ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", Max's ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", and Jude's ""Something"".If you have not seen Across the Universe yet, I highly recommend it to you.

'Love is all you really need',"Julie Taymor once again uses her considerable innovative magic to create a film that not only is mesmerizingly beautiful to watch, but also a 'semi-documentary' about the world changes that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s as young people for the first time spoke out against the war in Vietnam, the death of Martin Luther King, and the senseless mayhem that extended from the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of America, all set to the significant, timely music of the Beatles. It sounds like an impossible juxtaposition of themes and ideas, but in Taymor's hands it succeeds.Opening in Liverpool, England (where the Beatles began their impact on music and thought) we met Jude (Jim Sturgess), a working class boy with the gifts of an artist who decides to set off on a sea journey to meet the father he has never known. Once in New York he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) who represent the wealthy class, but who both show roots of rebellion against the comfortable norm and an objection to the war that is festering like an abscess in the rice paddies of Vietnam. Jude meets his janitor father in a union that is anticlimactic, and in disappointment he falls in with Max, living the artists' life in the Village with free-wheeling singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), her beau/guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther) and their newest tenant Prudence (T.V. Carpio), an Asian girl trying to find her place in a confusing world. The group eventually bond with music and rebellion mixed with free love and the passion that they can make a difference, while around them racial crises are at a peak and the draft tags many of the young men (including Max) for the war they cannot condone. From all of this turmoil the story builds to a climax leading to some very touching scenes that convey the spirit of the times and the overriding importance of love and understanding in a world torn apart by political and racial crises.The cast is strong with each of the actors singing their own versions of various Beatle songs very well (the division between singing and spoken dialect favors the former). But the real magic comes from Julie Taymor's mixture of hallucinogenic visuals, wonderfully choreographed crowd scenes, and ingenious movement from reality scenes displayed on the television to the reactive scenes of the world as viewed through the eyes of the youths and the lyrics of the songs. It is at once touching in its ability to recreate a particular period of history and wholly entertaining in the inventive use of music/dance/visual effects/drama. This film is important now and will only increase in stature as a document of that trouble but exciting time in the history of the world. We can only wonder why the youth of today are not responding to the Iraq War in a like manner, or, more uncomfortable to consider, why we now adults can't muster the same degree of distress about the myriad traumas that are still happening 'Across the Universe'.

"Lennon me, when you're not strong.","Across the Universe is a sublime, beautiful story loosely based on Beatles songs and set against the harsh reality of the Vietnam War. The combination of timeless music with Oscar-nominated costume design yields a thematically coherent work of art that spreads its message of love and understanding to great success.The story centers around a Liverpudlian named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who joins the merchant marines and then jumps ship once he gets to the United States, ostensibly to look up his American father. He meets a wild young man named Max (Joe Anderson) who's wreaking havoc on the Harvard campus, and Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a straight-arrow babe in the woods. Jude and his friends have fun and adventures and suffer the various tragedies of life from the early 1960s through to the early 1970s, pretty much aping how John Lennon spent his time during that period.Almost all of the characters in this story have some sort of Beatles connection. Jude refers to the song ""Hey Jude,"" which itself referred to Lennon's son Julian. Lucy refers to ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" and Max refers to ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer."" But that ain't all. Jude and Max eventually get an apartment together, and their landlady is named Sadie (Dana Fuchs), after ""Sexy Sadie); the character herself is an homage to Janis Joplin. Sadie's musician boyfriend is Jo-Jo, from ""Get Back,"" and he's an homage to Jimi Hendrix. There's a friend named Pru (""Dear Prudence""), too. But here's what's really neat. The songs used in the movie aren't shoehorned in there to fit with the characters' names, and vice versa. Director Julia Taymor allows the viewer to become immersed in the world of Jude and Lucy without being distracted by what's really a constant stream of Beatle references.This is not a small achievement, either. From a Cavern Club show to a rooftop performance, there are scores of people, places, and events relating the Lennon and his bandmates, and it doesn't stop there. At one point Jude and the gang get on a bus that's on its way to see Dr. Timothy Leary, just like Ken Kesey's famous transcontinental trek some fifty years ago. There's a musical number devoted to the song ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" and if ever a song really shouted out for a musical number, that's it. Eddie Izzard, of all people, plays the titular Kite, and he's surrounded by Blue Meanies. Trust me, if you're not high when you watch that scene, you'll feel like you are anyway.But at the center of the madness is the beautiful love story of Jude and Lucy, one a struggling artist who is passionate about pacifism and one who supports more proactive protest measures. As one might expect in any time period, their love becomes strained and even vanishes for a while. After all, this isn't a musical rooted in fantasy. Kids are sent off to war in Taymor's vision, and they don't always come back.Across the Universe seems to capture the spirit, the angst, and the hope that embodied the period. It's a bit long, over two hours, but if you do make it to the end you should find the final number to be a real heart stopper. Honest, winning performances from everyone really seal the deal.",9.0,Anonymous,History

":Recycled ""Hair""","This one is also out in some parts of the country today, rest of the country by the end of the month. Been there, seen this. It's called ""Hair."" As if we need yet another anti-war movie, like ""Hair"" this is a musical using Beatles songs. It takes place during the Vietnam war, and the message is that America's wars are bad, America sends its boys to die and get maimed, and we need spoiled, rich left-wing activists to show us the way. Hmmm . . . sound familiar. It's called Hollywood.Marilyn Manson's girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood plays Lucy, a young girl from a rich family who loses her boyfriend, killed serving in Vietnam. She drops out of school, moves to New York, and becomes an anti-war activist. She also falls for an illegal alien from Britain, Jude. He's the illegitimate son of an American World War II vet who is now a janitor at Princeton. We follow Jude, Lucy (surprise!--the convenient namesakes of Beatles songs), and her brother, who drops out of Princeton and tries to dodge the Vietnam draft--all through a musical journey, which celebrates the '60s counterculture. Because we all know the '60s brought us such great stuff like AIDS, rampant polygamous relationships, drugs, and failed everything. Also features two characters apparently modeled on Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, and equally as brain-addled.Aside from the plot, equally annoying is the cameo by Bono, who really belonged in that decade and out of ours.Although the singing and sets in this movie are well done (and I'm no musical devotee), the anti-war message grows tinny and tired.

A truly breathtaking experience...,"Julie Taymor's psychedelic musical extravaganza didn't really do much to light up the box office, recouping only $29 million of its $45 million budget. Not many wanted to see this film. And it's a real shame, as I believe 'Across the Universe' to be a truly breathtaking experience on the big screen, and one of the most visually spectacular films ever made. But be warned, 'Across the Universe' works purely on an audio-visual level¬Ö The main gripe I have with the film is that it lacks a necessary 'edge' when it comes to character. They all feel generic and the love story that forms the basis of the plot is dull. Being a musical, finding a great screenplay is always a difficult thing, especially when the entire plot is based around the lyrics of pre-existing pop songs. 'Across the Universe' can't escape from leering contrivances. For me, the most interesting aspect of the story was when Maxwell's return from Vietman. His PTSD, with traumatic flashbacks, could have provided a more compelling and unique plot. The love story was 'nice' but not absorbing ¬Öbut maybe I'm just not the romantic this was aimed at.HOWEVER, and it's a big HOWEVER, if you can deal with the stale narrative¬Öwow, is this a film to behold. The voices, the choreography, the use of colour, editing, lighting¬Öall struck a real chord with me, and resonated far beyond that initial viewing. 'I Want You', depicting the subscription process, would have to be one of the most brilliantly choreographed and photographed movie musical moments of all time. It's a magnificent scene, exemplifying just how a big musical number should be shot and edited. The hallucinogenic 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun', featuring cloned Salma Hayek nurses and flipping priests, comes close.The musical arrangements are respectful to the original Beatles songs, capturing the simplicity that made them so beautiful to begin with, but offering enough interpretation that they feel fresh. The vocal performances are consistently good throughout, and some are downright stunning ('I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' in particular). Evan Rachel-Wood and Jim Sturgess both have excellent voices ‚Äì a cut above the average leads in modern movie-musicals.Even with my complaints, 'Across the Universe' is still so astonishing. Julie Taymor is a true visionary, and her boldness and determination can't be denied...but it's those contrivances that stop this from being a truly great film.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Great music, bad story.","The Beatles songbook is full of classics, but unfortunately I felt the value of many of those songs were greatly diminished in this simple, messy love story. Other than the music and a talented young cast, there was nothing exceptional about this film. Without the music, it would have been lucky to get 4 stars. Despite the film being over 2 hours long, several characters and plot points are left unexplored. This is most likely due to the fact that so many scenes were stuck in there for the sake of getting another song in, but added absolutely nothing to the plot. This really could have been so much better if more time were spent to develop the stories. It felt like every time there was a glimpse of real content and substance, in came a pointless scene that just confuses you more. There are touching moments, and I understand how hard it is to create a good musical with songs that weren't written to be a part of one, but if you're going to have such a simple plot, at least try and put in some depth and originality within it...",10.0,Anonymous,History

The singing was worse than an episode of American Idol. The dialogue was almost laughable. The direction was like watching a blind woman going in circles.However what was the most surprising was that you almost regretted every time a song was used.

memorable,"Across the Universe The Beatles, their words spoke for a generation in the sixties. Their music is renowned and loved across the world. Across the Universe tells a story no one has ever seen using the songs everyone has heard.Across the Universe is a visually stunning rendition of over 20 Beatles songs that will dazzle your ears and your eyes. They range from the world renowned ""Hey Jude"" and ""Come together"" to the more obscure ""I've just seen a face"" and ""Because"".The main character is Jude, played by the handsome Jim Sturgess. He is a dockworker from Liverpool who goes to America in hope of finding his biological father. Lucy is young woman played by Evan Rachel Wood who thinks love can conquer all. Jude meets Max, played by the equally handsome Joe Anderson, at Princeton University and they set out to New York where Lucy and Jude fall in love. From then on the story evolves into a face paced and musically powered story of love, war and everything in between.The cast includes the comedian Eddie Izzard, Bono, Joe Cocker and other musical greats. It also introduces Jim Sturgess, a young, brown eyed, blacked hair man who might just become the next teen heart throb. Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson also star in a cast of relatively unknown actors.Now, to answer your question, the covers of many of the great Beatles songs have not been botched. The new renditions of the Beatles songs are spectacular. ""Strawberry fields"", ""I am the walrus"", ""dear prudence"", ""Revolution"", ""Helter Skelter"", have all been successfully reproduced and are sung and played out with a distinct visual style. The songs are so catchy that you'll be humming at least one of the songs by the end of the movie.Julie Taymor, the director and one of the writers of Across the Universe directs a visually inventive but slightly uneven story of war and romance in the early seventies. The cinematography is beautiful and imaginative but sometimes steals from the performances in the movie. The costumes are original and very impressive. The most captivating costumes are those in the ""Mr. Kite"" music number, they show a stunning display of originality. The lighting in the movie is slightly over-dramatic but succeed in portraying the director's vision, albeit slightly heavy-handedly. There are a lot of memorable scenes in the movie and the musical numbers are done with much more grace and style than most recent music videos.The film will surely be enjoyed by those of all ages and is a blessing to all those who love musicals and Beatles music. The movie breaks all generation gaps but will hold a special place in the hearts of those born in the sixties.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"An amazing work of passion, artistic ability, and superb cinematography.","I've read some of the quotes on this film and there seem to be a fair amount of negatives, which I truly don't understand, I think that Across The Universe is by far one of the best musicals in years. To call it just a musical though is to pigeon-hole it too neatly in a category that it doesn't really fit.Years ago watching Moulin Rouge after all the hype and being somewhat disappointed, I thought I would watch this one with an open mind and no expectations. What I found was one of the most superbly crafted musical dramas in years, full of deep and passionate meaning, incredibly talented artists, and a massive amount of symbolism so deftly done that people watching this film I'm sure would relate to it in different ways, and on so many levels.The cast is just superb, the ease with which all the characters engage the story, and the flow I don't believe can be faulted. One pet hate of mine is when artists butcher classics to create an ""artistic"" version, and yet so many of the songs in this film have been dramatically altered or slowed down to suit the current theme, but at no point did I ever think, "" wow...that was a terrible rendition"". The songs were delivered beautifully with passion and conviction, and I dare anyone to watch the ""Let It Be"" scenes without the hairs on their arms raising!

"Wonderful Music, Dazzling Graphics!","I have watched this movie three times over the past few years. I enjoyed it the first time I saw it. And it keeps getting better to me. With movies based on the work of superb musicians, it's awfully hard to do the songs as well as they did. The songs in this movie never make me feel like I'd rather listen to the Beatles. The production values are great, the voices are good, textured, emotional, talented. But the songs are never upstaged.The graphics in the movie convey the full impact of the 60s mixture of free love, psychedelics, and civil unrest in some purely dazzling mixes of imagination and hard core replication of the bare gut feelings of the era, realities and emotions as spot on as any I've seen in any movie about that dreadful-wonderful moment in time. I did my share of drugs in the day, but I'd take this movie over many of those experiences. And that's High Praise, if you'll forgive the pun.Some say the story line is too naive, too simplistic. Maybe to them. But it has never seemed so to me. I watch a lot of romance movies, a lot of musicals. Boy always meets girl and loses girl and wins girl's heart in the end. Some movies make it seem more believable than others, but you know, I'm not sure those were the ones I liked best. As long as our boy and girl end up together, the romance movie has done its job. I will not fault this movie for not doing its job.The movie's depictions of the hard realities of the 60s was certainly not naive or simplistic in my mind. I lived those days, very much as they lived them in this movie. The romantic overlay onto those troubled events was a necessary device for fully utilizing the diversity of Beatles songs that spoke to our generation about life and love, joy and sorrow, despair and, always, hope.If you want to hear something bad about this movie, look elsewhere. Unlike Anthony, I DO come to praise Caesar, not to bury him.Samm",8.0,Anonymous,History
It's borrowed cool and it doesn't work.,"Every time I saw a preview of this movie, I literally held my breath. That's how high my expectations were. After all, it's a movie about Beatles music. How could it go wrong?Let me tell you how.I had posted a short and scathing review after my first viewing of the film, but decided to give it another chance, based on the number of people who recommended it to me. Now, instead of having wasted two hours of my life on this tedious, pretentious montage, I've wasted four, and I think Julie owes me, anyone else who watched Across the Universe, and particularly the Beatles, an apology.I have to admit I'm not a huge Julie Taymor fan, and although Frieda was interesting, it worked marginally only to the extent that it relied heavily on the visual imagery of not only Frieda Kahlo, but also Diego Rivera. Nevertheless, it did follow that, if Taymor could mine those subjects successfully, she might have success with the greatest popular musical catalog of all time.She didn't.What she did do is force together, almost randomly, and often brutally, fully thirty-three Beatles tunes into a steaming dung heap of self-indulgence and pretension. I've seen drunken karaoke singers do better, and actually, I like the plot at karaoke night better than the flimsy story used to string this mess together. The love story ostensibly supported by so mercilessly torturing these musical masterpieces is touching enough, except that neither of the romantic leads, nor any of the other characters in the movie for that matter, is in any way even remotely likable. They are just as self-indulgent and pretentious as one must presume Taymor to be, based on her preposterously bombastic directorial style.What's worse, Taymor seems not to understand at all any of the zeitgeist of the sixties, although she did witness it firsthand, albeit from the insular vantage point of a privileged upbringing, which is patently obvious in how she casts her central characters as devoid of any obligation to do anything other than indulge themselves. Instead, she apparently views the most turbulent period in modern history as a string of sentimental clich√©s, and the people who populated that era as two dimensional cardboard cutouts with only a passing resemblance to actual, multi-faceted human beings. I love how easy it is to pretend to be a revolutionary when you're away at school on mommy and daddy's dime. Now that's real life.The movie itself is absolutely devoid of structure or substance, oftentimes breaking into song almost for lack of anything better to do. The music, to be sure, is sublime, and almost any visual accompaniment would benefit from it, but it should be the other way around. The visuals and the story should add something to the soundtrack, not rely upon it utterly. Oh, and Julie darling, for the record, the Beatles don't need pretentious directors conceptualizing meaning in their music. The greatest songwriting team in history already has that covered, sweetie.This movie is an absolute and complete mess. I kept expecting Simon Cowell to chime in from his perch center stage that the singers, other than the rare and magnificent appearances of the likes of Joe Cocker and Bono, who must not have had anything better to do, were ""simply dreadful"" as Mr. Cowell is so fond of saying. Indeed, most of the singers would not have lasted past the first round on American Idol, and some even used (over-used) pitch machines to ameliorate the tone of their voices. How lame is that?As someone who remembers the Beatles not simply as nostalgia, but as something that was integral to my youth, as someone who reveres John Lennon and his contribution to music, peace and love, I have to imagine that none of the Beatles, particularly John, would be pleased with this silly, shallow and trivial music video. I also have to object to the comparison of this disaster to Moulin Rouge. It's like comparing hamburger to filet mignon. One is a ground up mess. The other is perfection. One is a postmodern masterpiece. One is derivative, flaccid and unredeemably bad. I think we know which is which here.And what was with the Jimi Hendrix/Janis Joplin characters? Are we supposed to accept that as artistic license or character compositing? It was just silly, and, frankly, cheap, like the video clips of Walter Cronkite and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's borrowed cool and it doesn't work. This movie has no cool of its own, and in the end, it was painfully, embarrassingly bad and should be a period at the end of the sentence that has been Ms. Taymor's run as a feature film director.",1.0,Anonymous,History

My favorite is ""I Want You"" using the Uncle Sam posters calling people to sign up for the war followed up with ""She's so Heavy"" - those drafted using all their might to hoist up the Statue of Liberty = genius.

Beyond disappointing,"This movie didn't just let me down by having a soft plot, lame acting and music ruined by auto-tuning. It dismays me by misrepresenting the sixties.

It's all in no man's land and confusingly so.Perhaps this movie could have done better by focusing on a smaller time period or taking just one artistic angle, but each scene is hard to connect to the one before and after. The cameos by Bono and Joe Cocker were unintentionally farcical. Cocker in a long haired wig and Bono has side burns and looks like Lemmy from Motorhead. The trippy scenes look like an attempt to put psychedelia in the 2010s where they don't belong. There is a sequel planned by the same director, which I find depressing that such a train wreck could be considered for repeating.

The film revolves around Jude, who - together with a student friend from college, Max - decides on the spur of the moment to head to New York to start a new life. They rent a room from a singer, Sadie. At times I found the film hard to follow due to its unusual narration. The visual effects were also...interesting.The first half actually bored me at times and I found myself ushering the movie along with the help of my TV remote's Fast Forward button. After the halfway mark, though, the film turned almost 'what the f...!' weird. I mean, this is a very strange movie indeed. It is guaranteed to be a musical unlike any you've seen before - and I'm still deciding whether that's actually a good thing, or not.Some of the musical segments are incredibly well done, like the sequence of Max going to war. It is by far the most interesting military training I've ever seen in a movie. This musical is definitely an art film and will appeal to those with an appreciation for art films. Was I entertained? Yeah, sure I was. But there's also weirdness in abundance, a love story I didn't find romantic, and some characters I didn't care about. Alas, I have to say this is a movie I don't think I'll be watching again.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A terrific tribute to the greatest band alive!,"Julie Taymor is brilliant! She has created something truly amazing, one of the happiest, love-filled movies I have ever seen. Across the Universe is essentially a movie about the awesome era that is the 60's, with a love story added in. The plot is thin, but in this case, it is forgivable because Taymor obviously has no interest in a convention. This movie is a way to bring to life some of the greatest Beatles' songs to life in a bold, unique style. The cast do a fantastic job of covering The Beatles, because honestly, that is an incredibly daunting task. Although they will not match the amazing voices of The Beatles, they add there own touch to some amazing songs. As the two leads Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood shine, they both have amazing voices and great chemistry. The supporting cast are just as good; Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther and T.V. Carpio are smashing! The story follows Jude (Jim Sturgess), who travels to America to find the father he never knew. While there, he meets Max (Joe Anderson) and his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Max convinces Jude to move with him to New York, where Lucy soon joins them following the death of her boyfriend who is serving in the Vietnam War. Jude and Lucy fall in love, but soon the turmoil of the 60's creates conflicts.Most of the story is told through the many different Beatles' songs, including: ""I've Just Seen a Face,"" ""Hey Jude,"" ""Come Together,"" ""Revolution,"" ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and ""I Am the Walrus."" These are a few of the many, all sung with passion by the cast (including Joe Cocker and Bono in two separate appearances). With a bold visual style, these songs are brought to life and I was swept up and taken along a magical journey. Across the Universe is a movie I will never forget, and always love. The message that carries through from The Beatles' songs are still as touching as they would have been when first released. Love, peace, happiness...all these emotions are spill out, along with sadness, loss and death.Across the Universe is not a perfect film, people have commented on its clich√©s and poor pacing. Maybe they are right, but this is a movie that should not be judged on this when so much is done right. The acting, direction, visuals, music, it is all so perfect. Taymor has created a film full of love and hope, an amazing love story set in the 60's told through the songs of The Beatles. Sounds good doesn't it? 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Dangers of Pre-judging,"When ""Across The Universe"" was released in 2007, my immediate reaction was that this would be a picture I would not go near. A bunch of clean living ""High School Musical"" 20- somethings going through synthetic emotional angst and destroying some great Beatles songs in the process. All in all this would make the karaoke wannabees of American Idol and X-Factor seem almost acceptable.No, I thought. You may be old and decrepit, but at least you were there. Let today's children wallow in their melisma crazed mediocrity and you leave well alone.Cut to November 2008. ""Across The Universe"" is showing on a British movie channel this weekend. The house is quiet, I am by myself; OK let's just watch ten minutes and have all my prejudices confirmed.Two hours plus later I have been utterly transfixed and beguiled by one of the most enjoyable and compelling movies I have seen in a long while.Right from ""the off"" I thought this might be better than I thought, when I saw it was written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, probably the best TV and movie writing team that The UK has ever produced, and whose work goes back over 40 years and right up to The Bank Job with Jason Statham. (For younger American movie goers they script doctored practically the whole of ""The Rock"".)And the story, developed as well by Julie Taymor, the director, was very compelling and very well told. Instead of some vacuous piece of teen nonsense, we are given a very believable story of young people struggling with their own beliefs and sense of identity and self worth in a very tumultuous and world changing time. And I can tell you, even though this is ultimately a fairy story, and uses some very stylised set pieces, the sense of reality and truth was very strong. (Although I don't know why Ian and Dick had Jude working in a ship yard; there was precious little ship building in Liverpool in 1964.)And the set pieces were wonderfully done. The Induction scene was quite simply a tour de force of creative imagination, and even the Mr Kite extravaganza was a real hoot.The way the songs and the fairy tale fantasy was integrated into a very real and poignant story was excellent and a testimony to director, set designers and, above all, the actors. I had a real sense of time and place and never for one moment did I think that ""these people are trying to create something they know nothing about"".But ultimately it was the songs. The way they were used was superb and the arrangements were almost without exception imaginative, even breathtaking. Indeed the biggest compliment I can pay the music is that often the treatments gave greater depth to the songs than to be honest the originals actually deserved. Even as I am writing this I can't believe what I am saying, but it's true you know. I would actually like to get Prudence's version of ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"".All in all treat this as a salutary reminder for old has-beens like myself. There are great things still happening out there; make sure your prejudices don't make you miss them.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A real pleasure to watch!,"I don't think I would have liked it at a cinema. There is nothing more pleasing that watching this movie on an HD LCD, big size TV with a good home-theatre sound system, a highly rated DVD player(most of them are pretty good) and a clean blu-ray DVD. I think the difference is enormous. The above combination made me appreciate the stunning colors, the editing, the photography, the sound and the directorial achievement. With the help of consumer publications and internet sites, practically anyone can own a very reasonably priced video/audio system, bring out the organic popcorn, kick back, dim the lights, turn off the phone, shut everyone up, turn up the volume and truly enjoy movies the way they are meant to be seen!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant,"A love story-musical set in the 60s with the storyline tied together by Beatles songs, sung by the actors. Brilliant. I generally hate musicals but this one works so well. The songs fit seamlessly into the plot and the music scenes don't seem contrived at all.The director and scriptwriter even went to the effort of weaving other Beatles references into the story, eg the characters generally have names taken from Beatles songs, and some scenes are meant to remind us of Beatles events (eg band performing on a roof). Very clever, and doesn't detract from the movie at all.The story itself is quite moving, the acting good, the direction great, the singing by the (mostly) actors surprisingly very good, but it is the music, and its perfect placement in the movie, that makes the movie. Made me want to haul out every Beatles album I own (and I have most of them) and listen to them from end to end.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Something in the way she directs. . .,"Having seen the Cirque du Soleil ""Love"" twice this year (11 stars out of 10), I was thrilled to see more Beatles!!! This was a great date for me and the Wife: lots of great songs either woven into realistic plot scenarios, or (and this was where Julie Taymor really soared) great fantasy sequences drenched in color, movement, and imagination.The more you enjoy the Beatles, the more you will like this movie. It was not a plot/continuity 10 out of 10, but Eddie Izzard, Bono, Joe Cocker, and the cast leads gave great performances.Last thing: the Wife and I are Opera Singers (in fact, I had the pleasure of singing in Taymor's Magic Flute at the Met-nice lady to work for). THANK YOU Julie Taymor for getting lead performers that can SING. I thought they were all great except for Sadie (Bad Joplin imitation).Bad singers can ruin a good movie (Phantom of the Opera) but Across the Universe was so enjoyable! Go spend 10 bucks!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Why using the Beatles' mythology?,"Across the Universe in not a good movie. In fact is not a movie at all. What I watched was a 2 hours spot about The Beatles, one of the greatest bands in history of rock whose legacy is reduced to a bunch of cheesy pseudo hippies singing their songs. Using Take That's legacy would have been very much appropriate.There is no such thing as story in ATU. The characters were unidimensional, naive and bad acted. At the end of the film I still didn't know whether the movie was about love, politics, music or just colors flowing in the screen. The cameos, the poor recreation of Beatle's mythology and the use of every single clich√© about the 60's (Janis Joplin and Hendrix sadly included) reflect the lack of original ideas.The movie is empty and quite painful for real Beatles' fans.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Nearly a perfect movie.,"Fun and creative way to integrate songs into a plot.Voices were all terrific. I preferred the movie version of nearly every song compared to the Beetle's originals.Only a couple week scenes. While I am a fan of Eddie Izard, his scene creeped me out. One other scene where the two leads were nude in the water was a waste as well.Otherwise absolutely terrific. The Let it Be scene was terrific.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Please don't call this BEATLES,"First off let me relate a story that will demonstrate my clear bias to this film going in ¬ñ My wife had bought the CD based on some review that she had read or on some one's recommendation, it doesn't matter which. She played it for me in the car one night. Before it got to the third song I pulled it out of the deck and tossed it. The music was so bad it was insulting. I couldn't believe that anyone could possibly consider these bastardized renditions of some of the Beatles' greatest songs as music fitting to listen to other tan corporate CEOs who only cared about how much money they might bring in with sales.Now, if you had to rank this film against others of its nature, say, Hair or Jesus Christ Superstar, from that era, then, you'd have to rank it 5 stars. The movie accomplishes what it attempted to do with each song matched to entertaining visuals, though more often than not the songs' content don't match to the lyrics or to what the Beatles were saying or living at the time they wrote and performed them.But the fact is this film should be rated a negative star or two. This film wasn't made in that era, it isn't that era, it is today, here and now.Fast forward to the future, some time into the present. I was preparing to do my wash as a good documentary (Shut Up and Sing ¬ñ the story of the Dixie Chicks controversy ¬ñ no I am not a fan, but the film was good documentary coverage of what they went thru) had just ended. I took a quick scan of what was next offered on the movie channels that I subscribe to and saw this film's write up, thinking, a movie revolving around Beatles' songs, how bad can it be, besides, I'd be in and out of the room doing the laundry, so if I missed any of it, at least the songs would help me pass the time. How wrong I could have been never crossed my mind. Unfortunately I didn't put the CD and movie in the same context until I was well into the film.Just to set the record straight ¬ñ I stopped paying attention to this film before it was halfway through ¬ñ I only wish I had a fast forward function on my set as I would have liberally used it during the time I was watching the film. I also want to state that I did not turn the film off, I did not walk out, I just tuned out.Given there are well over 400 reviews in this Amazon posting I didn't read them all, though I did my best to read as many of the negative ones as possible, once again, showing my bias. I started by reading the positives and found that they were basically all along the same lines, praising the greatness of the artists, the director, the visuals, and the accomplishments of all of their visions. I guess they were the same people that Mama Mia was created for.About all I could add to the line of positive thoughts about Across the Universe is that the film did its best to follow thru with an exploration of that era's look, feel, and philosophies, while attempting to include all sorts of events and music innovations (was that woman supposed to Janis and her boyfriend Hendrix), although, those were bastardized as well, ala Woody Allen's Zelig style, and later Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump.Maybe I'm thinking of Across the Universe was a mutation birthed by a copulation of THE FILMS Hair and Godspell.If you want to see a movie with Beatles' songs in it see Hard Day's Night, see HELP, even go see Yellow Submarine (not one of my favorites though great music) but whatever you do, don't see Across the Universe and then walk around telling people you just saw a great Beatles film because all you saw was this bad piece of crappy celluloid. If you want to hear great Beatles' songs, listen to the Beatles. Listen to any one of their songs, song by them, and then compare it to the songs in this film. If you think these were as good, came even close, or were actually better, then . . . you, my friend, are just a fool without a hill.Note: I'm not a fan of the films Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Tommy (OK, not a Beatles' film but all of these films are of the same mindset, look and feel), but this ain't no Tommy, it ain't no SPLHCB (though I guess that was what they were thinking), and it ain't a decent attempt at properly portraying the Beatles' songs.PS: I find it extremely unfortunate that the writer, director, and producers felt they needed to coop the aspects of British music history (the way they used the Beatles' final roof concert as a plot dressing in the closing of this film turned my stomach) that they did in this film and morph them into some sort of American bastardization of life seen thru American eyes during that era. But I guess that was what this movie was all about, morphing life into their desire to make money. Am I wrong or did this movie only last 3 weeks in theaters?",1.0,Anonymous,History

I Revisited the 1960's,"I am 57 years old. I lived during the 1960's. I grew up during the Vietnam War in Eugene, Oregon. I watched my friends go to war. I watched them come home, wounded and unappreciated. I heard of some that came home in a ""box"". If you lived in the 60's or you just want to know the feelings of the 60's, then I recommend you go see this movie. It is amazing, awesome. The choreography of the sounds, actions, feelings and history were perfect. I went for the surrealism and was treated with the thoughtful, insightful songs and acting. If there is one weak point in the whole movie it would be the adequateness of the lead female actress. Everyone else including the bums on the street deserve an academy award for their performances.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Across The Universe,"Across The Universe is a musical set in the 1960's about a group of young adults who discover love and friendship among other things of the time such as the war and protests that came with it. The film's characters sing and the music of the film is of classic songs by The Beatles and instead of just playing the original songs the actors in this film sing them themselves and the music is set against the events going on in the film as well as some visually stunning backdrops and cinematography all meant to look and have the feel of the whole 60's psychedelic era and very reminiscent of the Beatles animated film Yellow Submarine only unlike that this is not animated. This film seems to be pretty divided by critics and audiences. I have read some reviews by critics who have loved the film and others who have hated it. I have heard of some members of the audience walking out of this film and others who will not even see it because they think it looks terrible. I personally thought this movie was great and even though I liked it a lot I could see where it might not be for everyone. I have heard some people say that the story in this film wasn't really anything new and lacked originality. I enjoyed the story and while it interested me and kept me entertained I think the real highlight and thing to see about this movie isn't necessarily the story, but the music it is set to and the wonderful and almost hallucinatory sequences they are set to. I personally am a big fan of The Beatles music, so I enjoyed the soundtrack to this film immensely even though I have heard many of these songs before on classic rock stations that almost play them to death. However because these songs have so much energy and because they are still catchy, well written and just enjoyable songs I didn't mind hearing them again and I thought the main and supporting actors did a good job of singing them and as I already stated the sequences and images they are set to make for some very unique viewing. The colours and visuals of this film were very bright and really a treat for the eyes because of the uniqueness, originality and sometimes beautiful things they are set to. This really is a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, but the phrase style over substance isn't totally applicable here because I really enjoyed the story and the characters as well. This film was like watching a time capsule of the 60's from everything to the wardrobe to the hippie/beatnik lifestyle the characters lived and acted. This is a gorgeous and unique film filled with originality and wonderful music set to (at least what I found to be) an engaging story that could easily have taken place now almost 40 years later as well. This was a treat for the eyes and the ears and I enjoyed every minute of it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Love is All You Need,"Greetings again from the darkness. I have shied away from this movie for weeks presuming I would be disappointed. What a wonderful experience director Julie Taymor (""Frida"") has created ... regardless if one is a Beatles fan or not. The music and visuals and stories are extraordinary and her vision comes through in that the parts create a whole.Jim Sturgess stars as Jude, a dock worker from Liverpool who sneaks into the U.S. and stumbles into Max (played energetically by Joe Anderson). As one might imagine, there is a scene where Max(well) is utilizing a silver hammer. There are so many small details and tributes throughout that I can't wait for the DVD to tell me what all I missed. Terrific, as always, is Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy. This amazing actress just turned 20 years old and is assembling a remarkable resume. Her talent is exceptional and was on full display in ""Thirteen"" and has grown as she has matured. She has the ability to look angelic and soulfully wounded in the same film. This young lady will be fun to watch as her career continues. While Sturgess and Anderson are passable in their singing, Ms. Wood's singing here is top notch, especially ""If I Fell"".Also strong is Dana Fuchs as Sadie, a Janis Joplin like singer whose throaty voice and bourbon swilling are a hoot! Capping the support group are Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo (Hendrix tribute), Joe Cocker in a couple of roles recreating his ""Get by with a little help from my friends"", Salma Hayak as multiple singing nurses, Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite and a hilarious Bono (yes THAT Bono) as Dr. Robert in a tribute to Ken Kesey and the electric Kool-Aid.There are too many cool moments to recap here and the film plays like unwrapping mounds of presents at Christmas. It offers a bit of ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Tommy"", while staying true to the music and the unique vision of Ms. Taymor. There are numerous real life moments recognized in the anti-war stories. I loved the rooftop concert (as in the Beatles final public appearance) and mostly enjoyed the shots inside The Cavern Club in Liverpool where The Quarrymen got their start. Good stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Extremely Disappointing,"I love the music of the Beatles and was curious to say the least when I happened to catch this movie on an intercontinental flight the other day. The fact that this movie, that hardly made it to theaters outside of the US, was on an in-flight program should have made me suspicious: after all, airplanes is where box-office bombs usually go to make up for revenue lost on the ground.The movie started out quite pretentious and even though the start - with Jim Sturgess' weak rendition of ""Girl""- wasn't promising, the idea of a musical full of Beatles-music still sounded intriguing. However, not too long into the movie I was quite appalled by the exploitative character of this musical: the story hardly gets a chance to develop since every 5 minutes the story takes a U-turn because another excuse needs to be made for another actor or actress who takes himself or herself too seriously to start blaring out another Beatles-tune. To make it even more pretentious the history of the sixties is intertwined in the whole thing. Sometimes this makes for some unintended laughs, especially since the acting is usually quite bad. You can tell every air-headed cast member in this turd is convinced that his/her below-par rendition of any which Beatles-track they're singing is their big break, so they try and make it more ""emotional"" with meaningful contemplative dreamy look son their faces that make soap-opera acting suddenly look quite intense. You'll have a hard time taking any cast member (but especially leads Sturgess and Wood) seriously in any role after this. I know I will never be able to.To say this musical is a beautiful tribute to the music of the Beatles feels like saying that Heather Mills truly loved Paul McCartney. This musical is exploiting the Beatles just as much as she is.To Beatles-Fans and movie fans worldwide: stay as far away from this dud as you can. It bombed at Box Offices worldwide, with all the right in the world to do so.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Forget Moulin Rouge and Hair,"This film does have similarities to both Moulin Rouge and Hair, however never have I seen a film which pays homage to sadly a long forgotten genius of cinema that being Ken Russell. Julie Taymor must have seen every Ken Russell film and loved the sheer audacity and creativity that seemed to have gotten lost in the critics eyes. A sad lot they are. Ms. Taymore it seems, was ,is and hopefully will in the future continue to expand where Russell left off. There are far too many scenes, shots, camera angles, themes, to mention but should you admire what Russell did in the 70's you must go see this film. Taymor must be credited for taking a chance in the making of this. It may not be your cup of tea, but If you can not appreciate this film for what it is, then you know nothing about the art of film making.

Just What the World Needed...,"...a remake of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978). A pretentious, overblown collection of songs sung by non-actors, in a flimsy, incoherent plot and pace which I suppose one could say is a homage to the hippie movies of the 60s, although the driving force here might be lack of creativity rather than chemical ingestion. Anyone looking to base a school report on the Times That Were a Changing by watching this might also want to consult Species II for their biology essay and Timeline for their physics exam.

I left with the thought ""Second-rate Moulin Rouge?"" But nevertheless, I loved the soundtrack, so I got the music. Over the course of the next few weeks, I listened to the music repeatedly. And every time I listened to a song, the corresponding scenes from the movie would pop into my head. The more I listened to the music, the more I wanted to watch the movie again!

The underlying symbolisms are numerous and I think it would take me many times of watching it (and loving it each time) to catch all the nuances displayed. This is a true work of art in an industry so caught up in violence for the sake of violence or what is thought will sell more tickets in the ""so keep it mainstream folks"" industry.

All of the versions of the song were very good; if anything ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" was a touch off and didn't really have a large impact on the movie. The sex scenes were done very tastefully so this movie is appropriate for everyone except small children.

A Movie That Felt Completely Hollow,"I didn't expect much when I began to watch the movie and didn't come out with much after it was over. All this movie is is a clich√©d and very dumb love story who's plot didn't take it anywhere(or at least that's how I felt). But seriously this movie really felt as though it was going nowhere. As a matter of fact the only way you know that the story is moving along is the progression from one scene to the next, and even then the movie still felt as hollow as you can get. Then there are the scenes that show that the studio, director,etc. were too cheap to pay to film at real places. The subway looked fake, the highway Jude and Max were on looked fake, and even Lucy's breast looked fake. Now the final thing is the covers. How anybody found that these covers were better than the originals completely confuses me. To begin with almost all the covers were a mere shell of the originals. ""Come Together"" had no bass line, ""Helter Skelter"" was completely screwed up by Dana Fuchs, ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" was screwed up by Bono. Almost every cover was stupid. They even managed to screw up ""Flying"", the most simple song in the movie. And the travesty that ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" was. And if it wasn't the songs it was the scenes that accompanied them that dumbed the song down(i.e. the Strawberry Feilds segment and the She's so Heavy segment). Overall, it isn't the worst movie that I've seen, but no plot and a good amount of bad covers did not help this movie either.",4.0,Anonymous,History

I'm a cross-dressing homosexual pacifist with a spot on my lung.,"Love. Love. Love. Love is all you need. This was one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It celebrated love of all types - unrequited love, sibling love, love lost and re-found, gay love, interracial love, parental love, and a love of the music of the Beatles.All this was played out amidst the upheaval in the 60s due to an unpopular war. The children of the 60s were not yet consumed with X-boxes and cell phones, and had the freedom to concentrate their energy towards the greater good.This film has all the elements of a winner. You were consumed with the names of the charters, and when a Beatles song would be woven into the story for these characters. The over 30 songs just fit perfectly with the story.What more could you ask for in a film than outstanding cinematography and sets, over the top choreography, costuming that was amazing, and acting that was superb. Of note, Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy, Jim Sturgess as Jude, Joe Anderson as Max, T.V. Carpio as Prudence, and Dana Fuchs & Martin Luther as the couple Sadie & Jo Jo. Add Bono, Eddie Izzard, and Salma Hayak and you can't miss.Without a doubt, one of the best films of last year.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Don't bother crossing this universe,"""Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry. Because the sky is blue.""Staring at a blue sky for two hours is almost required viewing to settle your mind from the visually lost schizophrenia that is Julie Taymor's ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. How else can you undo the damage from being subjected to an exhaustingly lengthy collage of overblown imagery at the hands of an over inflated ego? I can only imagine the horror that must have swept over the executives' faces after screening this film for the first time. It has been widely publicized that Taymor entered a creative war over the final cut of this film with her producers who wanted to release their own cut of the film. They said the film needed more focus, less experimenting as she hid behind the shield of artistic integrity. Ordinarily, I would never side with any form of censorship but perhaps she should have left her bias in the car and taken a few of the tips that were perhaps being given to her in the best interest of her film. Maybe then, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE could have told a functional story that would have captured some attention, given it some ultimate meaning and made this all-Beatles musical the magical journey it so desperately wanted to be and could have been. Or maybe it would have been worse but I can't see how.ACROSS THE UNIVERSE tells the story, and I say that lightly, of a young lad named Jude (Jim Sturgess), who travels across the ocean to find his father. Find him he does in absolutely no time and then he just bounces around from here to there in pursuit of nothing at all. He meets a girl (Evan Rachel Wood) and falls in love; he gets a room in New York City and paints when everybody else is either going to war in Vietnam or protesting it. A bevy of other characters are randomly introduced, bring nothing to the whole (which is paper thin as it is) and then disappear after accomplishing just as much nothing. It is all so aimless; I'm surprised my neck doesn't hurt more from all the shaking my head did in bewilderment. The style, which can only be described as a refusal to commit to any one style, only makes it more difficult to get taken in. As a viewer, the suspended disbelief necessary to enjoy a musical as one should still requires a firm foundation. Taymor tries to establish a gritty reality with Jude working the docks in Liverpool but the leap to where the music happens, and the magic is supposed to, is always different and seldom seems appropriate. I never thought I would be begging for plausibility in a musical but this was just ridiculousWhile I commend Taymor for incorporating 90% on-location singing into this musical in an attempt to pump a more real quality into the practice, I want to sit her down to talk about some other basic concepts like character, meaning and purpose (concepts she so easily incorporated into her far superior FRIDA). Surely she has seen Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE. Luhrmann's film employed the same musical technique to appropriate existing lyrical content (including some by the Beatles) and contextualize it within his story of forbidden lovers,. The reason his film worked is because there was a solid story driving it forward and characters that were developed through that story and their songs. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE seems more interested in its high concept usage of the Beatles repertoire that characters seem to be included so that certain songs can be included. It is certainly lovely to see a young high school cheerleader sing a slowed down version of ""I Wanna Hold your Hand"" to herself about a fellow cheerleader, just as it is heartbreaking to watch a young boy caught in the streets of the Detroit riots singing ""Let It Be"" amidst the violence but both of these potentially powerful moments and strong performances are hollowed out by their complete lack of context. How can you be expected to care when you have no idea why this story is suddenly being told? And then to find out, there was really no significant point to begin with? Without purpose, all you have are a bunch of people singing old songs on screen.At one point, more specifically when multiple Selma Hayek's in nurse uniforms seductively administered drugs to war patients spinning around a medical ward to ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun,"" I found myself wondering just how many Beatles songs were still left to be sung. When a film has no distinct purpose, it also has no clear ending in sight. I was beginning to fear that Taymor might actually turn me off the Beatles with this disaster but fortunately, the Beatles are timeless and genius and something so laughable as ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is not going to diminish their beauty. It's like bearing witness to a bad karaoke performance of your favorite song; you cringe while it's happening but once you hear it again for yourself, the mastery that was temporarily taken from it comes back in waves of vibrant colour and splashes of insight that touch your soul. The painful experience is easily forgotten and you ask yourself, across what universe?",3.0,Anonymous,History
A true representation of the '60s,If you really want to know how it was in the '60's watch this movie... take it from someone who lived through it.

A truly inspiring picture,"This one got upgraded after my last viewing...There are a few films in a lifetime that can bring true emotion into the forefront and plater it to the screen, Across the Universe is one of those movies.The Movie Stars a young artist named Jude as he traveled to 60's USA. They come into contact w/ issues such as the war, race riots and other things as their very friendships come to difficulty. The movie is a musical using various Beatles songs in order to get the point across.The actors are mainly fresh faces and yet the acting and singing was done really well. I am usually very critical of actors trying to sing in a film I remember how sickened I was by Moulan Rouge which I still say is a terrible movie due to the low quality of the singing. These actors are very good at singing and the people in charge are not star stunned.When I first watched this film I went to theaters as I figured by the commercials it would be an entertaining drug ride, and indeed it was. What I wasn't expecting was a deep story that was very well put together and imaginative. The songs for the most part are executed very well and the imagery is very much stunning. This is one of the first films in a long time that had my attention fully from start to finish.Due to fears of spoilers I won't say anything more about the film. If you can you should definitely check this film out with an open mind. It isn't just some sixties drug trip romance...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Killing the Immortal,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, all I could think about was the great potential there was to make a great movie using The Beatles songs as a basis. As The Beatles are my favorite band, I became excited to see a movie that was supposed to give an artistic vision to the time period in which they created. What I got was a piece of garbage. It seems impossible to the mere mortal to imagine any scenario under which Beatles songs could be made bad. All you need is good singers and the songs are such classics that they cannot be destroyed. Wrong! These idiots took a bad combination of Beatles songs, threw them together, and selected the wrong parts of individual songs, and tried to form a plot. No one told them that you can't put a plot together by simply using bits of songs. Sometimes, you need to have an original idea that flows as a story. The first thirty minutes put a legitimate setup together for a good story. Then the writers must have said ""screw it"" and just thrown together a bunch of songs they liked and decided that if they made up some artsy scenes, it would pass for a message. What they made was a bunch of nonsense scenes full of painted people, costumes, and crap. Pick a Beatles song from this movie, any song, and I guarantee you these morons screwed it up. Like ""Hey Jude""? Well just wait until you see how they murdered it. Think the rooftop concert was a genius piece of pop culture? Well get ready to cry. If Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr sat down and saw this thing, I think they might go on a murdering rampage. Let it be known that nothing about this movie is better than 2 hour acid trip while listening to the Beatles and being repeatedly beaten. As for people who liked this, just go kill yourself.",1.0,Anonymous,History
i Loved it!,Across the Universe was one of the best movie I have seen in a long time. It is a complete masterpiece. The actors and music are what attracted me to the movie the most. The actors had such great chemistry with each other. When I was watching the movie I actually felt like I was in it. The sound track and special effects is what brings the whole movie together. All of the colors bright colors that were used just memorize you they make the movie fun. The time that the movie was based around was a very good for the plot of the movie it made the movie a lot more interesting and exciting because there was so much going on in that era. When you hear the actors and actresses sing they make you want to jump out of your chair and sing along with them. This movie makes you wish that you lived in the 60's because of how much fun they make living in that era look. The director Julie Taymor did a great job with working with the crew. They definitely did a great job of picking out the cast. The cast worked well with each other and the set and their surroundings. They had great voices. The dialogue of this movie was another thing that I liked in this movie. The cast work really well with the script and put a lot of emotion behind what they were saying and acting out. I could feel what the actors were feeling when they were acting out the scenes. You could tell that they were really devoted to this movie and wanted to be there to film it. The editing of this movie really made the film flow very well. The scenery and locations used for the filming of the movie really put the movie together well for me. As Max was going into the Vietnam War I could feel how scared he was and how scared Lucy was for Max. When Jude got deported from the United States Back to Liverpool I could feel the heart break that Lucy and Jude were feeling. I could feel the excitement that Lucy and Jude felt when they were finally reunited at the end of the movie. This movie did exactly what it was supposed to do. It made me feel like I was a part of it.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Julie Taymor's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"The Beatles. Like them or not, you can certainly feel their mark on music history still to this day, whatever you listen to in most genres of music, you can hear their influence on music even today (coincidental or not). In fact, they're so good apparently that when you go to Hollywood executives to talk to them over a musical based on The Beatles' back catalogue, they'll go, ""Sure! That's sounds totally original and amazing, here have the necessary money, have fun!"" When in reality, this concept has been worked with 4 times before and unless it was done with the actual Beatles' co-operation, it never really worked (""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" with the Bee Gees or ""All This and World War II"", anyone?).But alas, the opportunity to make another Beatlemania movie came calling when the respectively-imaginative Julie Taymor (""Titus"" and the stage musical version of ""The Lion King"") decided to weave a large string of Beatles classics together into a plot about a young transatlantic relationship in the 60's, under the passionate title of ""Across the Universe"".Now, you'll be forgiven for thinking this movie would be absolutely incredible because it looked so astonishingly fantastic in the trailer (and it does). But it turns out that it shares two things trailers might have that can be problematic to the enjoyment of the movie: 1) They picked the best parts of the movie and 2) The trailer itself is even better than the movie! Well, ish...the movie itself has some very nice things about it, most of these things are especially noticeable and done well in the first half. The visual design is very appealing, the choreography is exceptional when it's being used to it's full and when special effects are used (in particular, Uncle Sam in the scene featuring ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)""), they're pulled off quite decently. However, that's all that can be said over definite positives.The main problem with the movie is that it can't decide whether it's telling a story or it just wants to be a straight-up musical. Or what mood it's supposed to use. The first part is the most consistent part of the movie, although there's still a lot of inconsistencies and some interesting parts of the story that end up being completely forgotten and tossed over for the clich√© boy-meets-girl standard and bad attempts at outdated political commentary.The middle part is the strangest part of the movie but is also the most odd-to-receive part. You're mean't to take it on as ""Oh that's weird, ha-ha"" but sometimes, it doesn't actually feel right in the context of the movie at all. I feel sorry for Bono as he has to deal with one of the most embarrassing cameos I've ever seen, as a guy who's supposed to be something of a ultra-psychedelia genius but just comes off as a bad Willy Wonka who even in the 60's would fail at being ""hip"", although of course the characters swoon over him anyway before his 8 minutes of screen time suddenly ends. Eddie Izzard however is fantastic as Mr. Kite and hosts a very entertaining and imaginative sequence, but sadly his screen time in the movie is even shorter and there's zero explanation to the scene and zero explanation to how the characters came back to normality.Third act is the worst. Clunky, irritating and surprisingly boring. Hardly anything flows any more, the songs performed start becoming monotonous (apart from ""As My Guitar Gently Weeps"", with Martin Luther's smooth, soulful vocals and beautiful acoustic guitar having to serve as background music to a character's unnecessary rant over sound equipment) and there's a lot of scenes where it's wise to emote with the characters but because there's no real emotion driven into the main character's two-dimensional personalities or into how the actors should emote, everything comes off as awkward instead. I ended up actually wanting to speed the movie up so I can get to more interesting parts or for the movie to just end so I can stop wasting my time.Overall, in my opinion this movie has good merit and potential to be quite good and some parts do have a sprinkling of good quirks and some inspired visuals. But overall, it feels too much like a movie made as a homework assignment than a fully-fledged major inspired production. Also, the Beatles covers are very hit (""Let it Be"", ""Benifit of Mr. Kite"", .etc.) and miss (most of them as a lot of them sound the same). Which is a real shame as Julie Taymor is a fantastic visionary and she had to waste it on this. Good luck with ""The Tempest"", Julie, hope it makes up for this disappointing journey here!3.5/10",3.0,Anonymous,History

See, we all went to ""Let It be"" and we all went out on the barricades on campus and we mourned the deaths at Kent and Jackson State, as we had the deaths of MLK and RFK the year we graduated... It is so easy for me to fall into this movie. I had never seen ms Wood in a film, and she so reminds me of old girlfriends! I dropped out of college, wasted an academic, Big ten scholarship and in an existential rage went to Vietnam as an infantryman. Good dope and live ammo. 1971 was a nightmare. I survived horrors beyond imagining only by the grace of god Almighty - whom i could have cared less about in 1968..... so see this as homage, as eulogy, as tribute to an era long gone and blessedly dead, but bear with us dinosaurs and sixties survivors who need the catharsis still, the weeping that endures for a couple of harmless hours... could I take my wife, kids, grandkids to see this? the movie PLATOON? not either of them - not hardly. but for those of you born after 1958, my heart's desire is that you honor the memories of your older siblings, parents, relatives and friends, and cut us the slack we so dearly need.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A romance that emerges from Beatles songs like Venus from the sea.,"Directed by Julie Taymor. Written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Starring Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood.""Across the Universe"" is a romance that emerges from Beatles songs like Venus from the sea. Young Jude (Sturgess), a shipyard worker in Liverpool, leaves his steady, Liverpudlean girl to look for the father he never knew. He ships out and jumps ship in America to find his father, a professor at Princeton.Or so Jude imagines. Turns out his father is a janitor at Princeton. He had sired Jude while stationed in England during WWII. Time present is sometime in the mid-sixties. Dad now has a family and has no place for Jude in his life, but he does find a place for him to bunk in the building he maintains.Some student pranksters hit golf balls from a rooftop, smashing through the window of a fraternity house. In the ensuing chase by frat boys, one of the pranksters, Max (Joe Anderson) is given shelter by Jude. Max has a sister, Lucy (Wood), whose boyfriend is shipped off to Vietnam early on.Jude and Max become fast friends, and Jude spends Thanksgiving with Max's family, where he and Lucy meet. Max gets his draft notice, burns it, and drops out of Princeton. He and Jude head for New York, where they rent space in a loft run by an aspiring singer and Janice Joplin figure.The film follows Jude, Lucy, and Max in an exploration of ""the sixties"", cross-cutting among scenes of football practice, with square-jawed young athletes and comely cheerleaders, to an urban uprising in Detroit, to scenes of campus protest and clashes with police, to battle scenes in Vietnam, featuring Max, who let himself be drafted, despite his attitudes toward the war and authority in general.All of the venues come together (sorry, Beatles titles are in my head) in one way or another to form a maelstrom that swirls around the young lovers, drawing them in, bringing them together, hurling them apart, then casting them who knows where?The main set piece features a psychedelic trip, a magical mystery tour on the Merry Pranksters' bus, made famous in Tom Wolfe's ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"". Dr. Robert (Bono) sings and commands the bus as a kind of Ken Kesey figure.Along the way, they take in a show by Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard). Words cannot do justice to the visual effects during this trip, and throughout the film for that matter, so I will not do them an injustice. The visuals, however, do complete justice to the Beatles' music and to that whole milieu. The drug-joke is that if you were there, you wouldn't remember. Not true. I was there, and I remember.Taymor makes excellent use of the music, which outlines the plot. She gives some Beatles numbers a clever twist, as when ""I Want You"" comes from the Uncle Sam recruiting poster, and sometimes insightful, as when a lesbian cheerleader (yeah, yeah) sings ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" from a distance to a stereotypical blonde cheerleader. As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, the originally upbeat number is transformed into a ballad of longing and heartbreak.""Across the Universe"" is an unabashed musical, right from the opening shot. I recommend it to anyone who was there in those times. For those who were not, I recommend it for its fresh presentation of the Beatles' songs and for its visual delights. For those who abhor musicals, stay home.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Either you're on the bus...,"There are people who hate musicals. Sometimes they go to see a movie like this knowing they'd never like it and then complain about it, misleading people into thinking the movie is bad. If you're one of those people stay home, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow.Julie Taymor has done an outstanding job. Firstly these kids can sing. I'm sick of people announcing a musical and then the people in it are famous people or someone they think will draw a certain crowd and then those people can't sing. Well, she luckily has chosen some great singers for this film. Secondly she did something very interesting. She mixes in regular history, with Beatles history and the stories within the songs. If you're familiar with the Beatles catalog as most of us should be, you find yourself guessing the next song based on the context. And then you hear the first few notes and you think ""Perfect!"" And then comes the part where you give up trying not to sing along. Yeah I did, and after a while I'm fairly certain I heard the person across the aisle doing the same.I didn't totally get into it right away. It took ""Come Together"" to really draw me into it, and I'll admit that's my favorite Beatles song, so maybe that's why, but this version of it (and I adore the Future Villain Band version from SPLHCB) is really great. She got some vocal help in addition to the basic cast on that song that really punches it through. And all the cameos are great.I was watching it thinking it should be movie lots of people love. The 'High School Musical' fans should like it provided they're old enough to see a PG-13 movie. That's up to the parentals, since it has a boob, and a few butts, and a couple of funny cigarettes, and some cursing in it. But it's pretty minimal for these days. I think people who lived through the time, who don't hate musicals, should feel like they're taking a trip down memory lane. And there is a really collective memory vibe to it. (But I wasn't even born then, which is weird.) If you've seen a few movies, you'll probably be reminded of 'Hair' and of course 'Sgt. Pepper's' but this movie is a truly well made film and really the story is wrapped together so well, I guess it's like 'Shakespeare in Love' in that way.

It had me humming one song or another when the movie was over. The acting was really good (especially, in my opinion, with Jim Sturgess as Jude), as was the singing, although the originals with the Beatles will always be the best.

An opinion is is just that.,"This is not a summary, it is a warning. Few things spurn me to review a movie. Even less propel me to espouse the negative of any one in particular.

What is it that your life is lacking anyway that this completely unimaginative and convoluted film could pretend to conjure up any sense of continuity? The 60's came and are now gone. Don't believe me? Look at the calendar¬Ö It seems that we're now in the 2000-somethings. Anyway, my point revolves around the 'psychedelics' of the film. Literally, a psychedelic experience portends a lack of perception, especially in the realm of reality. Simply, the director of this film sought connections for the screenplay in pop-culture media that weren't even vaguely related. Don't make me listen to a Beatles song bastardized by Jefferson Airplane overtones. The Beatles were the Beatles and Jefferson Airplane was Jefferson Airplane.

Anyone who's ever had a Beatles phase will definitely enjoy the mostly brilliant covers...,"I wasn't too keen to see this because of the lackluster reviews but I'm glad I did anyway. Anyone who's ever had a Beatles phase will definitely enjoy the mostly brilliant covers of the Beatles' classics that this movie's script is based on.Even if this was set in the turbulent 60s, it is still based on real events, and the meshing of Beatles' songs did not seem forced into the story. There were some cringe-worthy sappy moments that come with most musicals, and overlong psychedelic sequences, but overall, the performances from every one in the talented cast were enjoyable.Evan Rachel Wood was perfect as Lucy, a fresh-faced, sheltered teener from the suburbs, who attracts her polar opposite in Jude (played by Jim Sturgess), a scruffy sailor who jumps ship from Liverpool to the US in search of his father. They live a bohemian life in New York in the company of their flower power friends, amid the radical activism prevalent at the time.Memorable renditions of Beatles songs featured in Across the Universe include: ""Helter Skelter"" performed by Dana Fuchs (who plays singer Sadie), ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" performed by T. V. Carpio (who plays cheerleader/lesbian Prudence), and the best sequences were ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" performed by Joe Anderson and Jim Sturgess, which was incredibly choreographed, and so was ""Come Together"" performed by Joe Cocker and Martin Luther (who plays Sadie's guitarist and lover, JoJo), ""Something"" performed by Jim Sturgess while he was drawing a sleeping, naked Lucy, and ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" performed by Martin Luther and Jim Sturgess.Cameos from Bono and Salma Hayek perk up the already trippy and visually stimulating movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

beautiful,"Across The Universe is over all a spectacular (in its most literal sense) film. Yes, there are some cheesy allusions to 60s pop culture (ex: the John and Yoko pose with Lucy and Jude, the rooftop concert, ""She came in through the bathroom window"", etc.) but in the end it all seems to fit together. The choreography, musical arrangement, and effects are awesome. The song/video montages (especially Strawberry Fields Forever) are really cool. The soundtrack is great too, yes, even if they're Beatles remakes, they're great. I do think that this film is much more suited to the younger generation, rather than those who actually lived through these events which is understandable. This movie is a lot like Hair (with some definitely uncanny similarities), but more relateable to today's younger generation. It glides easily through the lighthearted early 60s, into the trippy, psychedelic era, and falls perfectly into the serious wartimes of Vietnam. Furthermore, it gives insight into the tumultuous 60s era while still painting a good love story.after watching Across the Universe, you feel as though you've been on a journey.

As though the entire Beatles oeuvre had somehow emerged spontaneously from the American 60s youth experience!

Stunningly beautiful film,"I am blown away by this film for many reasons. Yes, I am a Beatles fan, so perhaps that has colored my perception, but this is truly a creative masterpiece from Julie Taymor & co.

I loved the appearances by Bono, Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek. But the two leading actors (Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess) more than just held their own and delivered heartbreakingly tender and gorgeous performances. Wow, wow, wow.

Slow Acting Poison,"Across the Universe {dir. Julie Taymor, 2007} (*/****)I've never been one to bury the lead, so let me tell you straight away, I hated this movie with a passion. The more I think about it the more I'm enraged, even offended, by this film. It is an attempt to weave the songbook of the immortal rock band The Beatles into a grand, romantic, cinematic spectacle. Its production design and narrative conceit are at times engaging but only in the smallest of fits. Suffice to say the bad outweighs the good; the treacle drowns the sublime. It contains good songs, well sung by capable actors (all of whom are given types not characters) but its soul is so hollow that it can only rely on its naive intentions. The simplistic attempts at establishing time and place are ham fisted and cloying. The 1960's were a complex time; the decade brought about social upheaval along with revolutionary ideas regarding music art and cinema, yet if one were to judge the period by this film they would come out with a completely positive and simple message: peace and love conquered all. That is simply not the case; the hippies goals were ultimately unrealized, that is the sad truth.As for incorporation of songs, Taymor's methods are flimsy (a character named Prudence is there specifically for the song 'Dear Prudence' to appear)and its entertainment value low. The more I consider this film, the more it enrages me and its been a few weeks since I've seen it. Get back, JoJo!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Spectacular...Best Musical since Moulin Rouge,"This movie is amazing! I have to say that first, whoever loves the Beatles will love this movie no matter what. When I first saw the trailer I was blown away, I had to see it. The songs are sung excellent and I love how the songs fit in with the movie, or should I say the movie fit in with the songs. The songs are the movie, Julie Taymore just gave them picture and movement. It's a classic love story about a boy meeting a girl but it's thrown all together by the power of music, and of course the music is from the Beatles. The cinematography is amazing and the colors they use are brilliant. All of the actors and actresses have phenomenal voices and sing the songs perfectly, when i was hearing Jim Stugges singing (Jude) i actually thought it was the Beatles. The dialoge, that wasn't sung, was also good, its very passionate and loving. Anyone who like musicals, love, and weird, bizarre movies, this is the must see movie of the year. Hopefully it wins Best Musical of the year, Sweeny Todd may have some competition.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Surpassed my expectations,"First of all I never grew up in this era, therefore I will never now what it is like to live amongst a real war happening. So what does that mean, nothing. What matters is that this was a film made to inspire anyone who ever sees it. I am a dreamer like Jude, Lucy, Max or anyone living then or living now who seeks to discover. Love is what I want, it is what you want, all of us need it. All of us need to be understood and understand why living can be so BEAUTIFUL, yet so hard to get through that one day. Across the Universe isn't solely about Beatles covers, the underlying message it gets across is all we need is love.Yes, this movie to me deserves an excellent vote because I have never seen love like this. I have felt it, but this was quite different. For the first time in a long time my eyes, ears, mouth, and heart were open. Walking away from the theater it was almost as if I stepped out into the world for the first time. To imagine how I must have felt as a baby leaving the hospital, who brushed my head first, who was the first to look in my eyes and say I love you. Probably my mom.The thing here is this is just another movie, but it was like magic or something you could never expect to see again. I do not now how I would convince anyone to see this nor do I wish to. But if I did I would illustrate to them a series of captivating pictures taken of the world we live in, friends and family they have grown to love, and tell them Across the Universe is more than a musical.",10.0,Anonymous,History
it reminded me a little of HAIR...,"I think this deserves a valid comment. This movie reminded me of HAIR in a lot of ways, but contained far more depth with strong images and profound symbolism. It exemplifies the era without just exaggerating stereotypes of ""hippies,"" their costumes and setting. Hippies are constantly illustrated in films protesting in futility as bums and druggies that not a lot of people in this era can really relate to. While there was a lot of visual effects this film places emphasis on the humanity of that era and gives today's audience a perspective that they can carry with them. Like in any musical, the characters randomly break into song at any moment but the lyrics are uniquely interpreted and fit in well with the scenes. This film captures the true message of The Beatles' timeless songs and their relevance in any era. The songs carry a very simple message that anyone can understand. It was an overall meaningful and enjoyable film and I think everyone should give it a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A 2-hour long Gap commercial,"""Across the Universe"" is a visual collage of beautiful white people, dressed in fashionable clothing, dancing to modern renditions of classic tunes with no discernible plot. There are bright colors and cool visual effects. There are token non-whites, including an extremely funky black musician, and an attractive woman of mixed Asian ethnicity. There are ivy-league students decorated in plaid, playing golf on rooftops. In other words, it is a 2-hour long Gap commercial.The movie's plot starts out as a number of intertwined love stories. At some point, the plot completely disappears in order for certain musical numbers and cool visuals to happen. The plot then turns to how the Vietnam War affects the various characters. At the end, it becomes a love story again. Overall, the plot lacks clarity as it meanders forward in time with a random pacing. Has a day passed or a decade? It's quite hard to tell, even when the film attempts to imbue historical scenes into the story.When the movie does try to say anything, it fails horribly. Where the unrelentingly literal interpretation of Beatles songs makes whimsical scenes like ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" merely cloying and unsatisfying, it makes the more serious scenes like ""I Want You"" and ""Strawberry Fields"" ring laughably hollow. I am certain I was not the only person to laugh out loud when the soldiers were carrying the Statue of Liberty while singing, ""She's So Heavy"". I prefer my symbolism seasoned in a marinade of depth, with a dash of subtlety. While the war-related scenes were at times viscerally reminiscent of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"", there was no underlying tension to drive them home.The acting was decent overall, particularly considering the script they had to work with had no real character development. The actors played their one-dimensional roles as well as could be.The music was, on the whole, remarkably well sung and played. The more than 30 Beatles covers had a fresh sound while not losing their familiarity.This movie might be enjoyable if you shut off your brain and tune out while absorbing the audio/visual experience unhindered by critical thought. But two hours later, you may decide you'd have preferred to just watch a short Gap commercial.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it,"I'm not going to lie...the beginning is pretty boring and you have to see it with an open mind but it is totally a great movie!! Its wonderful. The effects and music are so addicting!!! These actors have great voices and overall a great movie. Must see. Its not one of those stupid ""break into songs for nothing"" movies. Most people will like this movie. Love it!! The actors are young and good looking but they seem to know what they are doing. This movie can be quite sad at times but seriously a GOOD movie. Once again must be seen with an open mind and be able to sit through maybe 20 minutes of boring moments but in the end it's worth. I personally could have done with a part in the middle where it was pretty pointless but the special effects are good. Also better to see in theaters in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great if you are a Beatles fan... really good if not....,"I thought this movie was brilliant. It moved with good pace and told an interesting story. The plot was somewhat lost at times but the great voices made those moments enjoyable. Speaking of the music the score and singing were fantastic. I am not normally a musical lover but this movie pulls you in and tells a very nice story in song. And don't get me wrong it's not like they sang the entire thing. There is dialog mixed with the singing. I felt the the visuals were really well done as well. I was very pleased with all the scenes and even when it got ""artsy"" I was entertained. I don't give out many 9s and I don't usually comment on movies here. So for me to put this effort in must mean I liked it. I took my 18 year old son who loved the movie as well. This is a must see for any Beatles fan!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it- Musical that rocks!,"It took my breath away. I admit I was nervous about Beatles songs being performed by actors/actresses and the songs getting that sometimes lame Broadway sound. Yes, it could have been heavier at times, especially the part with JoJo and playing the guitar, but it wasn't ever lame. I am a huge Beatles fan and so is my musician husband. I dragged him to go and he actually enjoyed it very much. I am now obsessed with this movie and am seeing it again on Saturday. It was a beautiful love story and the fact that the music was recorded live made it that much more believable. I loved how they incorporated much of what was happening in the 60s/70s into the movie with the Vietnam war and protests and Charles Manson, and Martin Luther King. It was very well done to show the mood of the times. The cinematography was magnificent. This goes right to one of my all time favorite movies that I will watch over and over. I haven't listened to anything other than my old Beatles CDs or this soundtrack since I saw the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Ouch!,"Maybe the big screen experience was needed, but I doubt it as I saw this loathsome waste of film on late-night television recently and was aghast. What movie exec. green-lighted this terrible, relentless onslaught of bad musical renditions of Beatle music and the eyesore ramble of images that escorted them? I'd be surprised to learn he/she is still around as the movie has only made back roughly half of its shooting budget as of this writing (going by IMDb's stats). I wouldn't know where to start in criticizing this mess- it's all that bad! And U2's Bono took an ill-advised role that's still leaving me scratching my head. I thought he was a thinking man's artist. All in all, this film makes me pine away for another viewing of 1978's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and cry out for a remake.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A modern masterpiece--the best film of 2007,"Ever have that experience of a lifetime at the cinema? Walking out having seen a film that truly reached out to you in the theater and grabbed you by the neck and looked you deep in the eyes, making an impression on your life that you won't forget anytime soon...and leaving you speechless for the rest of the night.There have only been a select few films I've seen that truly gave me that experience, and I'm beyond delighted to say that the newest edition to that category is ""Across The Universe,"" which is in my opinion the only decent film to surface since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Across The Universe deals with six major characters--a British art student from Liverpool coming to America to find his estranged father. A preppy, pretty, high school senior whose boyfriend has been drafted into the raging Vietnam War. A black guitarist from Detroit whose son has died in a peace rally. A young Asian cheerleader, running away from her home in Ohio to go after her life. A burnt-out, wannabe singer who performs at a small club and wants to show the world her music. And finally, a college drop-out with a passion for drugs, sex, and booze in search of himself.Somehow they are all brought together by a small apartment in New York and begin to form unique bonds with each other. In the midst of the Vietnam War, and peace movements going on constantly around them, they are drawn to fighting, drugs, pursuing their dreams, finding themselves, and above all, finding true love, which is what the movie is all about.Across The Universe is by far one of the most unique love stories ever written and unlike other deeply romantic films you may have seen, it is not sappy in the least or aimed toward female audiences. Across The Universe is not for the faint-hearted and is surprisingly gritty, hard-hitting, intense, and even shocking in many scenes. The film is shot in an extremely awkward (in a GOOD way) ""Tim Burton"" style that will be admired by anyone who gazes upon abstract art at a modern museum, and I was truly mesmerized.The film seems like it is eight or nine hours long, and in no way is that a bad thing. Coming out of the theater after a 4:30 screening, when my watch showed 6:45pm, I thought it had frozen at some time during the movie. The person I saw it with couldn't believe it either. Across The Universe feels like three or four films--all with separate story lines, and all aimed at different audiences--merged into one, creating a bold fusion of film-making art. I'm being quite literal when I say it has a little something for everyone.And as if the intricately written screenplay and exquisite direction weren't enough, the film is paired up with astonishing performances by EVERYONE in the cast, most of them largely unknown actors, and everything is hauntingly believable. I'd say a good 60% of the movie are Beatles songs, each song seemingly about the current event of the film, and the songs are sung by the actors, all of them with great voices. A lot of times I find musicals kind of worn-out, washed-up and boring, but never in my life have I been so captured by the beauty of film and music together--as one being. It was the absolute perfect addition to the film and put the icing on an already deliciously tasty cake. If you're a big Beatles fan like I am, you'll pick up on hundreds of intimate, subtle references to the Beatles' music such as character names, locations, and events.Quite simply, this film is nothing short of a modern masterpiece, and will sweep the Oscars come February. It's a little bit of Moulin Rouge, Forrest Gump, Ghandi, and Titanic merged into one, with a Beatles soundtrack accompanying. See this film on the big screen before it leaves theaters...it will leave you gasping for air.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"5 minutes in, I loved this movie.","There's only one reason to not give this movie a ""10:"" the story is fairly pedestrian. And yet, the music, cinematography, visual effects (spare and well-employed), and direction completely overcome that minor issue.I first heard of this movie in March 2007, when the trailer hit Apple's iTunes website. I was mesmerized. I next caught the trailer in a theater prior to ""Stardust"" (another great and under-appreciated movie.) My girlfriend really couldn't grasp my love-at-first-sight passion for this movie. Until, that is, we went and saw it this past weekend.First of all, Julie Taymor and her team are a bunch of geniuses. To take thirty songs from the Beatles, rearrange the music and re-task the songs into situations they might not have fit into at first glance, is an amazing accomplishment. Evan Rachel Wood, it turns out, is a fine singer, and shines in her role as ""Lucy."" Dana Fuchs' ""Sadie"" (Sexy Sadie, indeed!) can feel free to join Janis Joplin and Etta James in the land of women with powerful, gut-wrenching voices. Martin Luther's soulful vocals are a great counterpoint to Fuchs' raw energy. Truth is, all these kids can sing, and sing well.Bono, as Dr. Robert, and Eddie Izzard, as Mr. Kite, are wonderful additions to this cast. Bono, especially, does not play his role ""as Bono,"" which I wholeheartedly appreciated. The cameo by Joe Cocker was great fun for me, as well.As a fan of the Beatles, I loved this movie. It's a love letter to the band's fans as much as a love letter to the band itself. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. It won't be getting any Oscar nods (with the exception of Best Song, perhaps), but awards are not why we see the movies. We see them for enjoyment, and this film delivers enjoyment at a high level throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Let It Be,"Certain films are bound to be hyped to the point of unreasonably high expectations, and Across the Universe proves a perfect example. Right from its conception, the film boasted immense promise - the notion of a musical populated entirely by songs by The Beatles and the astonishing psychedelic visual effects demonstrated in early trailers promised an impressive feat indeed. And while Across the Universe may not prove to be a life altering experience, it is an unquestionably innovative and visually stunning take on the musical genre, and a comprehensive enough overview of sixties teen culture, well complimented by the Beatles soundtrack.One's enjoyment of Across the Universe may vary based on what one's expectations for the film are. The majority of complaints regarding the film have been in regards to the allegedly shallow and feeble plot. While it is true that the storyline is not the most monument in recent memory, as is the case for many musicals, the story is structured primarily to drive the film from one musical number to the next, and as such, it is a rousing success. Initially presented as a more conventional teen romance (complimented well by The Beatles' earlier cheery love ballads) the film's tranquility doesn't last for long before it is plunged into some of the darkest themes of the sixties: the Vietnam war, political rebellion, protests, riots, teen alienation and experimentation with drugs, fitting well with much of the Beatles' later and bleaker works. Despite the subject matter presented toeing being fairly familiar for those with any knowledge of the decade, the script mirrors the content and changing tone of the Beatles songs admirably, and the outcome is an overall positive one, even if the emotional tension does fall flat on occasion.And while not always integrated as seamlessly into the plot as one might hope for, the musical interludes themselves are simply flooring - the visual effects are breathtaking and director Julie Taymor demonstrates an eye for colour and composition which would seem more befitting of an experimental art painting, let alone a mainstream musical. Both the psychedelic drug-induced interludes and the regular numbers boast an inventive and energetic choreography and a slew of distinctive visual styles, with Taymor drawing beauty out of the most mundane of situations, such as a football team tackling each other in slow motion morphing into a surreal but fascinating aerial dance sequence.The cast perform admirably, effortlessly underlining their brilliant singing voices with suitable emotional resonance. While many of their parts may fall dangerously close to archetypes, the cast manage to infuse new energy and interest into their roles. Relative newcomer Jim Sturgess is a noteworthy discovery indeed as British dockworker Jude, and he proves a more than adequate dramatic leading man as well as phenomenal singer. Evan Rachel Wood's Lucy, the upper class American girl turned war protester may be slightly underwritten, but her natural charisma and genuinely beautiful singing voice easily make up for an occasionally shallow character. Great support is provided by Joe Anderson as rebellious draft victim Max, Dana Fuchs as spunky rock singer Sadie and Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo - a guitarist not unlike Jimi Hendrix. The film also showcases amusing cameos from a nearly unrecognisable Bono as a cowboy hat sporting hippie singing ""I am the Walrus"", and Eddie Izzard as a very memorable Mr. Kite during his titular psychedelic circus song number.Fans of the Beatles have much to enjoy from the inspired and beautifully sung covers, as well as frequent references and in-jokes to their works (some tasteful, and some groan-worthy, such as the many hammer cracks to the character Max). While the storyline may cover very familiar ground, it does make for a compelling enough template for the key events of the late 1960s, and mirrors the spectacular musical numbers spectacularly. Treating Across the Universe as a narrative Beatles concert, aided by some truly astonishing visual effects will likely yield the most satisfying and enjoyable effect. At any rate, it is refreshing indeed to see such experimentation with the cinematic form and the musical genre, especially when it yields a result this satisfying.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
best musical ever!,"Just saw Across the universe at the theaters and it rocked! Way better than Tommy or any other acclaimed musical. The songs were amazing! Mostly Beatles but there might have some other origins to the songs. And even though the adaptation's weren't exactly like the original songs they were still great.The acting was very convincing and effective. And the surreal moments were, well, SUREALE! Sometimes confusing though. For example I really didn't understand the deal with the Kayako looking girls in the middle of the lake, but oh well still a nice visual. And all the colorful tydye and volcano lamp images were pretty cool too.This is the perfect movie to watch with some friends.

Let it be,"I think you could make a better movie about how Julie Taymor got to be so hip. How does someone get to be such a critics and (sheepy) fans favorite? If only her work measured up to the reverence.This big, commercial, stupid, dazzling/dull film might work for the middle brows and high school kids, but it's pretty terrible. An epic for the post video, ADD generation, it goes nowhere slow.The Beatles songbook, for better or worse, will be endlessly mined for all sorts of projects for years to come; it's brand power an unstoppable force. But Taymor pretty much rattles off the standard 60's clich√©s, with a modestly surprising song choice here and there. Soon enough, you'll be wishing you were listening to the records. Eddie Izard challenges Steve Martin's big number in ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" for winch inducing honors. Rachel Wood makes a dull, if pretty, heroine.It's not too bad at first; and just seems a peppy repackaging of the music for the Hillary Duff set. But the attractive cast ( weren't there any ugly people in the sixties?) can't ring much out of the non-story, and after 90 minutes you'll be quoting John at the end of ""Stawberry Fields"" (""I'm very bored"").",3.0,Anonymous,History
"If you Love the Beatles, and Hair you will LOVE This One!","I really loved and enjoyed this movie! I am a Beatles fan from way back, and this movie just catapulted you back to the 60's. It is very reminiscent of Hair and Sargent Pepper and those movies of that period. The songs wove together intricately with the story line. It brought together so many of the experiences the good and the bad. And at times was just mind blowing. It brought back memories of and turbulent and passionate time in our history. It also gave us a look at England that we rarely see. It went from being totally hilarious at times to heartbreakingly sad at others.

"No longer the ""Magical Mystery Tour""...","Usually when someone sets out to produce a musical, they contrive a story and then create the songs to emphasize certain points or aspects that make up the story. Julie Taymore went against the grain with Across The Universe by taking thirty-three already famous songs by The Beatles and letting those songs shape the story she wanted to tell....And what a mess it is.Sure, this musical has it's good moments, mostly involving very original and innovative visuals and choreography, but it's low points and downfalls far outweigh the good! This musical accomplishes in creating some well-planned feel good moments, but ultimately fails in mashing together beloved songs into pointless and choppy nuances and obnoxious propaganda.Before I continue let me make it very clear that although I seem to be taking on the role of a critic I am in NO WAY trying to say that I could do any better. I can't and I know I can't. I'm simply making observations as an audience member and sharing my opinions as a movie fan who knows what to expect.Let us get down to the nitty of the gritty...there are two screaming faults this movie has in my eyes. One, too much liberality in licensing their own meanings to The Beatles wonderful songs; two, a broken flow of music and story that rarely seems to connect.My first example of Julie Taymore and her crew taking far too much advantage of making their own interpretations of The Beatles songs comes from the beginning of the movie. A cheerleader is singing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" (very well I might add) but you find out that she's longingly singing the song to herself about another female. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to get into anything about homosexuality specifically, all I'm saying is, how do you know that's what The Beatles intended? You could argue by saying, ""How do you know that's NOT what The Beatles intended?"" Alright I'll give you that one...but the point still remains, Taymore is taking the liberty of morphing all these songs into what she wants for her story. And again, when they do the musical sequence for ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" they sing the words over and over again ""She's so heavy, she's so heavy, she's so heavy, etc."" and in the movie they depict that by showing a group of soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty and making a subtle point about government.""What's so bad about that?"" you ask? People who loved The Beatles and flocked to see this movie will forever associate the meanings of their songs with the meanings shown in this film. And whether or not the movie actually DID get the meanings right the point is Taymore and her crew assumed the position of actually knowing the interpretations and asserted their false position of leadership by incorporating it all into their blockbuster film.Also, the movie was choppy, wavering, and sometimes just pointless. For example, the character Prudence nearly seemed irrelevant except for the fact that, because of her name, later on they had the chance to sing another song (""Dear Prudence"")! Oh how contrived...Eddie Izzard's appearance was definitely fun (he's a good actor) but sequences like the circus, and where JoJo comes to New York and they sing ""Come Together"" (so out of place) is all so forced and pointless most of the time. It becomes more of a dragged out music video than a movie. The story was mostly simple and served only the purpose of giving a backdrop to the music.I suppose that I just saw it on DVD and I actually didn't get the ""movie theatre experience"" but all the same, it was a disappointment. The music was stunning at times, the singing was mostly well performed especially by the younger actors, and the visuals were almost always astounding and innovative. But the incongruity of it all, the forcing and obvious contriving of it all, and the lack of strong story brings it all way down. I felt like I was being catered to as a 12 year old, and even by a 12 year old's standards, it was pointless and waste of time...",5.0,Anonymous,History
Blown away.....,"I can not say in words the emotions I went thru especially during Let It Be....oh my GOD !!!! The way the story line was generated and the way it presented itself in the time-line it did was truly masterfully done.

The character building was totally believable, and the way they did both sides of the pond in the beginning was not as confusing as it appears to be. I truly shows we are the same no matter where we are or from. Jude, has a great voice, Lucy perfect and dead on, Max was great too but, Sade and Jo-Jo were awesome and I cannot wait to get the soundtrack.

A tale of two movies,"Across the Universe is a movie based on Beatles songs. Interesting concept. And for a little while an interesting movie. But the concept can't sustain itself over the movie's inordinately long running time. The story can't hold up for that length of time. And the story goes off in directions the movie would have been better off avoiding. What started out as a fun little movie with some great songs devolves into a boring, pretentious slog to the finish. The whole second half of the movie you're just begging to hear Hey Jude. Because in a Beatles-themed movie it's a pretty safe bet that when you hear Hey Jude we're quite near the end. Hey Jude doesn't come nearly soon enough.While it's the songs of John, Paul, George and Ringo which are at the center of the movie we never hear those famous voices. The songs are sung by the film's cast, mostly to surprisingly good effect. OK, there are a few duds in there but by and large the actors do the famous songs justice. Jim Sturgess does very well with the lead male role, a character conveniently named Jude. And in the lead female role, Lucy, Evan Rachel Wood is a revelation. She's fabulous. A couple of her early songs are definitely among the film's highlights. And they're a lot of fun too. Unfortunately in the second half of the movie fun is in short supply. Director Julie Taymor spends most of the film's second half beating you over the head about how horrible the war in Vietnam was. The movie is of course 40 years late to that party. When not going on and on and on about Vietnam the movie is basically just a psychedelic mess. Taymor drives her movie well and truly off the deep end. Things were going along just fine until a musical number which accompanies one character's induction into the military. If you were being kind the best thing you could say about the sequence is that it's bizarre. The truth is it's out-and-out stupid. Laughable. And sadly a sign of what's to come. The rest of the movie is either more of this tripped-out nonsense or anti-war drivel. OK, we get it. In the '60s people did drugs and thought war was bad. Can we move on? Please?Sturgess and Wood do an admirable job trying to hold together a movie which is falling apart around them. They act well, they sing well, and they have very good chemistry. When the story focuses on the relationship between their characters of Jude and Lucy the movie works. Unfortunately that focus is lost and the movie clearly suffers for it. The last hour of this movie is not just bad, it's painful. Not even Beatles songs can save this. And while the Beatles songs used earlier in the film tuck neatly into the story later on there are some rather curious song choices which seem rather forced and don't come off well at all. The songs may be performed well. But too many of them fail to make any genuine impact. And some of them are totally wasted in the psychedelic haze. By the time the movie finally stumbles across the finish line the end is a blessed relief. A movie which seemed to have great promise totally lost its way.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Across the universe and back in time,"Obviously, a film such as Julie Taymor's Across the Universe isn't going to please everyone. Some may discount it, as I nearly did, because they've seen previously released and dismally fashioned limited or entirely non-verbal ""rock"" musicals. Two that come to mind are Tommy, which was a total disaster, and The Wall, which badly needed at least minimal dialog. However, I put away my preconceived notions based on word of mouth and found the themes, characters, settings and music in Taymor's film to be entirely believable and thoroughly engaging. There is truth in the story and characters that transported me to a parallel universe, one that existed for me nearly 40 years ago when I lived in NYC and volunteered with the National Peace Action Coalition for a time. The place, the time, the marches and the protests against the war in Viet Nam are excellently conveyed to the screen. Similarly, the music resonates with meaning and feeling; and the music too reminded me of an essential aspect of my youth. Yes, I cut school along with some of my 9th grade friends to welcome the Beatles when they landed in Queens a few short months after the death of President Kennedy; yes, I saw them twice at Shea; and yes, I grew my hair longer, wore boots, and sported a suede jacket like the one the fab four sport on the cover of Rubber Soul, while I walked the halls of high school with a copy of Sgt. Pepper under my arm four years later as my classmates got ready to graduate. As with so many of that generation, the Beatles' music is the soundtrack I hear when memories of youth come flooding back. Conseqently, Taymor was treading on somewhat sacred ground by having the music come from other mouths. But she ascended almost immediately. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, as did my son. Even the music, which I thought I knew from every angle and nuance, gained new meaning for me at times. One slight example, Evan Rachel Wood's If I Fell. Though I can't say I enjoyed every single minute, I was transfixed by Taymor's characters, themes, and images, as well as by the Beatles' lyrics for damn near the entire running time. So was my 21 year old son, Julian when we took in a recent late morning matin√©e. The timing was our good fortune because we had a private screening in a multiplex theater that was empty except for the two of us. In short, Across the Universe is a film experience that will engage anyone who gives it the opportunity on many levels. As we said back in the day, be prepared to be blown away.

Fabulous movie,"I don't know who else besides Julie Taymor could have made such a great and inventive visualization of Beatle songs .... as hard as it is to do the movie lives up to the high standard of the music. I saw the Beatles in 1965 and their music was(is) religion to me, so I went to this movie looking for a nice evening of music, not expecting much, but was amazed at the creative way the songs were used, the great singing, and the theme's relevance to today. It made me wonder ..... where is the protest to the Iraq war that went on in the sixties to the Vietnam war ? The movie beautifully illustrates the brutal contrast between the consciousness that was awakening during those times (and continues to blossom) and the viciousness of the old paradigm and the powers that be and their childish ego games and horrific disregard for the sanctity of life. Highly recommended !",10.0,Anonymous,History
Matter of Opinion,"I just saw this movie last night, and I positively adored it! It has definitely made its way into my all-time favourite films. Jim Sturgess does a wonderful job as Jude. I loved the new variations of all my favourite Beatles songs, and every dance sequence was spectacularly choreographed. Aside from the music, the film's portrayal of a difficult time in history is powerful and moving. The characters were believable and even lovable. I think it's safe to say it's earned a spot in IMDb's top 250.You can imagine how shocked I was to see that it received less than glowing reviews. Of course the viewers must decide for themselves what they think of it, as with any film. I can understand that not everyone will love this movie, and it may not appeal to everyone. However, I strongly disagree with all critics who say this film ""sucked"". It is fine to dislike a movie, but there was nothing slipshod about this one at all. As I said, I thought it was raw brilliance, but that is a matter of opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best movie I've seen in years,"This was a movie that reminded me why I go to the movies. It had been a while that I had seen a film that filled me with such warmth. I left the theater thinking about it so often that i decided i must see it again. The second time around was just as amazing as before. I think it was put together beautifully and artistically. I think that each actor did a great performance, and had amazing voices. It was a movie that will make you laugh, cry and applaud. What more in life do you need? British boys singing Beatles songs and 60's protests. Oh and Bono as Dr. Roberts and Eddie Izzard and Mr. Kite. I truly cannot wait to watch it again, and again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A brilliant spectacle,"Although I expected this movie to be good, I was still impressed by how brilliantly executed it all was. Instead of just having the characters sporadically (and awkwardly) break out into song, Director Julie Taymor seamlessly mixes the spoken dialog and the music. What's even more impressive is how easily she takes the movie from realistic imagery of the 60's to the surreal and back again. What's best about this movie is that the story itself could have stood on its own, but combined with the music of the Beatles it just made it into something fantastic. I don't think you really have to be a Beatles fan to enjoy this movie either, in fact a lot of the songs I had never heard until I saw this movie, and some of their more familiar songs are used in unexpected ways, but they always work.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Bloody awful,"I found this movie very underwhelming. I just couldn't like it. I just watched it on DVD with my 21 year old daughter and we both just sat there like...what the hell? It seemed promising at the very beginning, but it just didn't go anywhere. It's like someone took a bunch of Beatles song titles, threw them in a hat and then randomly picked a bunch out. Then they sat and said to themselves, "" Okay, let's try to make some kinda story to stick in between these songs."" Sure, the visuals are stunning. But that's it. The so called plot is paper thin and there's no continuity to it really. And the character! None of them were developed in any way, shape or form. They were one dimensional and I couldn't care one little bit about any of them. The character of Prudence was completely unneeded. She added nothing to the pitiful story. Why was she even there? She disappears without explanation for a while and them just sorta shows up again. It was weird. I did enjoy some of the songs. A few were decent versions. Other songs, however, were just awful. So many of them were slowed down so much it was painful to sit through. I couldn't even be impressed with the dancing, which for the most part, I found awful. This movie seemed to take forever to be over. I'm not even sure why we continued to watch it. Perhaps it was a morbid curiosity to see how the heck the damned thing was going to finally end.I was surprised when I came on this site to see what others thought of Across the Universe. I'd been thinking...surely it's not just me and my daughter who didn't like it. Her friend raved about how great it was when he gave us the DVD to watch. So many people on here loved it. I kept reading and found the ones, who like me, didn't like it. For the most part, it seems that people either loved it or hated it. The ones who were in between seemed to enjoy the music, visuals and dance, but were unimpressed with plot and characters. For me, the visuals weren't enough to make this a good movie. I can't possibly recommend it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
up there where it belongs.,"An inventive visual treat from start to finish, this clever film is a great introduction for 20 somethings and teens who are not aware of the Beatles music or of the turbulent 60s and what it all meant. Wrapping 2 dozen Beatles standards in constantly amazing set pieces, I personally found ACROSS THE UNIVERSE a very satisfying experience. I kept thinking ""Kids would just love this"" especially if they have not been weaned on good musicals, the political past, the wildness of the late 60s and especially if they unfortunately think modern entertainment is all killing and destruction. As a time-capsule, UNIVERSE delivers, and I would strongly suspect a DVD gift would make a greatly effective intro to witty visuals and extraordinary and emotional songs for any younger person. I am very impressed with the imagination that has been carefully developed in each sequence and genuinely enthusiastically encourage an older generation to share this film with the younger. UNIVERSE is genuine cinema visual art.",8.0,Anonymous,History
great music better vocals,"This is a visually and musically engaging movie. It paints a picture of the 60's which is spot-on without being a clich√©. (it avoids overwhelming us with tie- dye and headbands), More than anything else, the performance of the numerous Beatles' songs in this movie proves that while they were brilliant song writers, the Beatles were not great singers; their versions are so much weaker than those presented here. here. In particular, the opening ""Girl"" by Jim Sturgess and the later ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" by the lovely T.V Carpio make the Beatles' versions seem pale in comparison. Anyone familiar with th play ""Lion King"" or MacArthur Fellowships will again be convinced that Julie Taymor is a creative genius.

Extraordinary,"""Across the Universe"" captures the cultural explosion of the Beatles era through vivid, powerful and beautiful sights and sounds. The intersecting story lines begin as seemingly unrelated vignettes that are eventually woven together into a compelling single storyline, with tasty musical selections throughout. The young cast is gorgeous, appealing and believable, and it's a treat to spot the special guest cameos by the likes of Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard and even Salma Hayek. The fantasy scenes-- some funny, some moving-- are pure art.The trailers really don't do this film justice because they give the impression that the whole movie is nothing but splashy big production scenes. In fact, it is a crazy visual and musical trip, but it has a love story at its core. Very memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This movie is just downright corny....,"I rented this movie along with the 2004 film Ray. Ray was beautiful and a great cinematic representation of music. I cannot think of another word besides corny to describe Across the Universe. The cringe inducing dialogue as a family gathers around the table talking about ""it's not what you do (for a living) it's who you are"" was laughably bad. The show people smoking marijuana and drinking in a way that makes doing those things look boring. All the songs are used in a bizarre manner. The people in this movie are not attractive and are not the type of characters one should build a movie around. I had to shut this off after about half hour. It was just too dumb for me.",1.0,Anonymous,History
i loved it!!!,"okay this movie was one of the most thrilling, visually entertaining, and impacting films i have ever seen. Every scene was pact with creative visual effects, and untraditional choreography. The plot was edgy too, but sweet at many parts. It would not have been the same without the music. It blended every scene together just perfectly, and I loved the characters. Jude was so likable yet at the same time, unpredictable. The war was depicted effortlessly, the 60's era was portrayed extremely accurately, and the realness in the emotions of each actor was amazing. When I first saw the preview for Across the Universe, back in the summer, I knew i wanted to see it the day it comes out. So I did and could not be more pleased with what I saw.

A psychedelic musical roller coaster ride,"Those four lads from Liverpool had unfortunately broken up before I discovered them on AM radio, but in my pre-teen years their singularly unique sound weaved it's way into my life and has remained there for half a century. How I missed the release of this wild ride of a film I can only attest to an ill-timed move across the country combined with the 2008 global financial crisis. Although a decade late taking it in, I would like to express appreciation to the talented team of professionals who lovingly crafted this ode to musical genius - a genius which transcended all that went before & possibly all that has come to be since- IMHO. A bit inspired I think by Mamma Mia! with a dash of Forrest Gump, this film brought back memories sad and happy as the familiar songs punctuated the films narrative... sparking reflections of people and events long past. This magical mystery tour may not be for everyone as it is not your typical musical fare, but for someone who lived through the tumultuous 60s and 70s, it struck a chord. As a Beatles fan, I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A film to be seen over and over.  It brings a smile to your face.,"Brilliant interpretation and use of classic Beatles' songs. Seeing the movie is like listening to a favorite album. It's something one could do over and over again. And I have. It's like a soundtrack of my life and covered all the events and milestones of the early and late 60s. The actors were gifted and perfectly cast. There were some terrific and powerful vocals. The storyline and imagery were inspired throughout; and some brilliant use of color. I especially loved the ""I Want You"" and Strawberry Filds"" segments. Jim Sturgess got the breakout performance he needed to garner him much attention throughout the world.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Surprise: Great in 3-D!,"I came of age in the '60s, so this really hit home for me. To those who resented it for its strongly theatrical treatment of the Beatles era, I suggest you'd probably have a hard time with anyone else's take on those decades except your own -- still too personal, maybe. But it's not meant to be a documentary. For me,this film advanced that reality into a mythical realm, making of it a parable; so historical license is forgivable here, if the experience for the viewer gets the essence right. Personally, I'm ready to accept that time in my life being transmuted into its cultural gifts, so I loved this one in the theaters, then on DVD ... and (after I got a 3-D HDTV) on Blu-Ray.And that was in itself a revelation. Of course, the film isn't in actual 3-D, but my Panasonic rig has a ""2D-to-3D"" setting which I'd not tried out much 'til now; and I have to credit the technology sector -- the result, while not flawless, is pretty impressive and totally watchable. And I was especially glad that I tried it out on Across the Universe. The faux addition of depth really enhanced this film's imagery, and enabled me to appreciate its complex, fast-moving visuals more thoroughly as layers of content got spatially sorted out for me. I saw distinctions in 3-D I'd never noticed while watching it in 2-D, even in the psychedelically colorized scenes. Considering how many scenes in it were deliberately composed with a strong eye for foreground/background interplays, and stunningly deep perspectives, this film should have been shot in 3-D (were it made today, I've no doubt it would be). I totally recommend to anyone else out there who has access to a 3-D setup, try this out -- the ""long strange trip"" expands your consciousness yet again, and no chemicals are needed -- just a little help from 21st-century technology. (Across the Universe is my new #1 reason I'm glad I sprang for at-home 3-D.)",10.0,Anonymous,History
Five Stars just for the selection of music,"Do you love musical theater? I don't.But I did enjoy my radio and my phonograph when a lot of the songs from this movie were popular. I had a phonograph! And 45s! Those were the days; if you can say that and mean it, this movie is for you.The plot? Flimsy. The acting? Good enough for that plot. Maybe too good for that plot.The costumes: probably carefully researched and so that's a nostalgic trip. But everything you see is way way WAY too clean. Like a production on a stage, there is no litter on these streets.I enjoyed humming along and being reminded of so many wonderful songs from the era depicted in this film. So it's worth all the stars. But for a truly rousing musical on film that gets me moving in my seat and on my feet, I go to 'The Commitments.'",10.0,Anonymous,History

HORRIBLE!!! I can't stress it enough!,"(contains minor spoilers) horrible. horrible. horrible.the move dragged on forever. there was basically no plot at all, and characters of the film (ie Prudence) popped in and out of the story, without real background or explanations to why the character did so. some scenes of the film had no real purpose, (ie the circus) and completely confused the story more. the film tried to be something more than it really was, a piece of rubbish, with the talk about Vietnam and Civil Rights during the 1960's. i felt like it tried to copy The Dreamers in a number of ways. the overacting, done by Evan Rachel Wood reminded me of Jennifer Love Hewitt in that Enrique Inglesias video. much of the film didn't answer questions like ""how did Max get hurt?"" ""why did Prudence leave Ohio?"" ""Why did Prudence leave New York?"" ""How did Lucy know where to call Jude's father to get him out of Jail?"" ""How the hell did Jude return the USA after being deported?"" the whole movie was unrealistic, confusing, tons of plot holes, not worth the hype, utter waste of time.it's a shame though, we needed a good movie about Vietnam and the happenings during the 60's. i'd appreciate a movie like that more, than this trash that really had no story. i can't even tell you what the film was about if my life depended on it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe had a bad hair day,"This movie was pretty good, but the hair almost ruined it for me. Men didn't wear their hair like that in the 1960s! They pretty much either had crew cuts or Beatle hair slicked down with bangs...not preppy, pretty-boy feathered, layered, and styled hair like Max and Jude wore! The women didn't wear red lipstick either. White was trendy for a time, and light pink, but not red like the main actress who played Lucy. The film makers needed to do some research on the hairstyles of the day and make sure they were accurate. I know, I know, the movie is supposed to be timeless, just like the Beatles songs, but it WAS supposed to be set in the actual time period that the songs were popular. I didn't mind the episodic, MTV-styled music video format too much. The singing was fantastic and the Beatles tunes were rendered with much emotion. Pretty good job.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Well, I thought this was awful¬Öbut","I also thought ""Hairspray"" was awful. So draw your conclusions from that. In fairness, it's the producers that let this project proceed on any given day who are at fault. There is no merit to making this filmStill...the performers are all remarkable. And of course, they're singing some of the best popular music ever written. If you can ignore some of the rest of the stupidity on display, there are great rewards.If you're going to ""Mamma Mee-a-fie"" the Beatles canon, couldn't you come up with something less inane than this? And if not, copying (in some cases, stealing) the work of others really puts the audience in an uncomfortable position. The people responsible for ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""High School Musical,"" ""The Doors,"" ""The Wiz"" AND ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Hair,"" ""Rent,"" ""Grease,"" ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Tommy,"" (although there's nothing as campy fun as Ann-Margaret in a vat of pork 'n beans, ""She's So Heavy"" comes close) can all claim their work is being, uh, reused here.You'd think someone who is as an original an artist a Julie Taymour could have come up with her own ideas¬Ösomething besides synchronized bowling? (Now there's a sport the Olympics needs.) I found it offensive to take historical tragedy (like the assassination of Dr. King, the death of soldiers in Vietnam, the Watts riots, the killings at Kent state, the draft protesters, the activities of the Weathermen and Black Panthers, etc.) to score emotional points in a film that's unworthy of any of the material it bastardizes.Most of it made me cringe; some of it was quite effective (the ""Let It Be"" sequence; ""Revolution"" is maybe the only song put in its proper context; ""Because"" is suitably dreamy; ""Dear Prudence"" is cleverly staged and performed). But you sit there waiting for the next punch in the gut like ""When is the awful moment coming when someone says, 'Hey! Jude, ¬Ö'?"" I don't think you need to name a character Prudence or Jude or Max or Lucy for the songs to work. It assumes, perhaps, we're as stupid as the people who made this.If Taymour and the audience aren't redeemed, the performers are. The Beatles, god bless 'em, can take care of themselves.

A cinematic feast!,"At the urging of a friend we went to see this movie today. Now, I am an old guy that grew up when the Beatles were at their peak. So...being familiar with the music was a plus in this movie. However....from the very start the beauty of the cinematography just jumped out on the screen to us. It wasn't setting me on fire to begin with but then, something happened and I was just sucked right into the big screen. At the heart, this is just a very good love story. All of the characters are likable. It is interesting reading the comments of those in the younger age group not ""getting"" this movie and I do understand that. However...me thinks that it was made for those of us that still yearn for those years that were both innocent yet turbulent with the riots for equal rights and the protests of the Viet Nam war. I got teary eyed more than once in this masterpiece of movie making. It is sad that it is not a box office hit and even sadder that the trailers for it on the TV are so bad.

It's one of the most creative and entertaining films I've seen all year. Beautifully done, it was a treat for the eyes and ears. The right casting is really what made this film special. The characters were well developed, and the acting excellent. After seeing this movie I have even a greater appreciation for the mass of lyrics created by The Beatles. Though this movie is over 2 hours of total bliss, one leaves thinking about how many more lyrics could have been used from the endless supply of Beatles'songs. I was particularly impressed with the smooth transitions between scenes and the easy flow of unfolding the turbulence of the sixties.

I can't get enough of this film!,"I first saw the trailer when I went to see another movie and I remember saying ""I need to see that"" then I never heard anything else about it. I'm guessing it had a limited theater release. I happened to finally see it on Starz on Demand and I was blown away! As soon as it was over I hit start over and watched it again.The music is great. All the actors sing so it's not cheesy lip syncing. It's not the typical musical mainly because it's Beatles music. Each song is specific to the scene, so instead of the characters giving the exposition in the form of dialog, it comes in the form of a song. The songs are great, because they're different. They've all been altered to fit the mood of the scene. It sounds like it would be blasphemous to alter music that's already great, but in this film it really works.The visuals are stunning. There are some scenes in which the visuals fit so well it's uncanny. The one with the draft office and then the nurse scene are just spot on in the way the graphics relay the underlying message. Don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that, but add that if this movie had been done with an IMAX 3-D version it would have been a blinder! The cast is perfect! Everyone just *fits* their role and they all play their character so well. I also really appreciated that it wasn't full of big bill celebrities. There were a few people that made you say ""oh wasn't he/she in that one movie...oh what was it???"" you know how that goes?

Perfect for a Home Theater,"I just finished installing a home theater. In particular I have an projector that casts a 13 foot wide image (older 720 model). Many friends have been over to see the installation and Across the Universe is the perfect movie to demo both the audio and video. Everyone loves the Beatles and the creativity of the visuals is exceptional. Instead of just watching a song or two, everyone winds up hanging for far longer then planned to watch song after song. It did take a few weeks before I finally found the time to actually watch the movie from start to finish, and it was surprisingly good. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the move never seemed to have gotten the recognition that it deserves. I think only one person who came over had seen or heard of the movie!! Okay, okay the plots can be thin at points, but that is not what the movie is about, its basically a series of exceptional movie videos strung together with weak plot.

Its as though they decided to take some great Beatles songs, do terrible remakes of them and just put them into a film without a plot. All the songs have the same sound, usually slowed down and given the same boring tone, completely ruining the songs. As for the plot, well, there wasn't one. The characters would be at places or doing random things just so they could fit a Beatles song in, regardless if it made sense or had an explanation. I watched this with some friends (also huge Bealtes fans) and all we could do was make fun of the film for lacking a plot and ruining songs.

Safe and not as romance novel as I'd feared,"So... I'm a man. I'm a manly man. I do like intellectual dramas but mainly I like it when stuff BLOWS UP in films. :)Thus I put off seeing Across the Universe, because, from the promos, it looked way too girly, plus I was afraid that the film would be overloaded with awkward plot twists designed to fit the music of the Beatles. In other words, bad.However! Having seen Mamma Mia and enjoyed it, the mishmash of ABBA music turned into a film, I decided to give Across the Universe a shot and enjoyed it quite a bit.True, there are unfortunate twists, like naming one of the characters Jude, which I thought was a heavyhanded excuse to incorporate the song ""Hey Jude"". And the film definitely glorifies drug use. However, I think it was ultimately true to the 1960s in a way more important than the plot line. It was true in the experiences of the characters.Sort of like how M*A*S*H the movie or TV series, about the Korean War, I mean, you would never have all that stuff happening to one group of people. However, if you pick and choose the biggest stories from hundreds of people's Korean War backgrounds and mash them into one storyline, that's what M*A*S*H is.So, while I found the plot somewhat contrived and unbelievable, with a thin-as-paper lesbian romance, for example, I can believe that each scene by itself says something about the 1960s that matters. There's innocence but there's also war and crime. There's groovy but there's also bummer. The music was often corny in its relation to the plot but - - dang! - everyone loves the Beatles and I did find myself tapping my toes. Plus there's a lot of dancing, as there should be in musicals, to further remind you that the plot line is symbolic and not meant to be taken literally. (In the real literal world, people do not break into synchronized song and dance numbers.)That being said, every song (I think?) had some kind of plot excuse. I can't think of any song in which the characters weren't really singing. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes a film just totally stops, there's singing, and when the song's over, it's like someone's paused the real film for a musical break and then restarts it. But, for example, in the Sound of Music, when there's singing, the plot rolls along, the characters in the film are actually singing. I like that.And the film has a great ending.Such an ending! Thus, I pronounce it safe for you Action Film Guys whose girlfriends really want to rent it. You will survive, I promise. Just don't let her get the Princess Diaries!! :)I'll give Across the Universe a solid but not classic 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing Tribute to an Iconic Band,"The Beatles were a cultural phenomenon whose influence and unrelenting presence has hardly been matched by any other artist since the band originally hit the scene in the early years of the '60s. At this rate, I'm surprised we haven't gotten a good biopic about the bands origins and their eventual parting (though NOWHERE BOY was a good glimpse into the formative years of John Lennon) but at least we've been given a well-done musical utilizing some of the Beatles most memorable music. For the curious, yes this is a full-blown musical. The filmmakers have even stated that there is probably little more than thirty minutes of actual dialogue and storytelling in the entire two-hour movie. The majority of the story in this film is woven from the Beatles songs and how they fit to portray the lives of a group of friends living in New York City in the '60s. The characters are an eclectic group of free-spirits caught up in the drama that raged across the country in that turbulent decade: the Civil Rights movement and its ensuing riots, the Vietnam War and the protests that flooded the streets against it, and the introduction of psychedelics and hippie counter-culture. And just to be sure that everyone is 100% aware that the movie is paying homage to the Beatles, the screenwriters saw fit to name just about every character after a Beatles' song: (Hey) Jude, Lucy (in the Sky with Diamonds), (Dear) Prudence, (Sexy) Sadie, etc. Because, you know¬ÖBeatles!I'm a Beatles fan and I never tire of their music, so this movie is an interesting experience for me. It's essentially a two-hour long greatest hits collection strung together into one giant music video with some semblance of a story woven inside. Director Julie Taymor and the screenwriters did a great job creating a story from the lyrics of the Beatles music. The majority of the movie is expressed in song and it comes together great. Many of the band's most popular songs are brought to life and used in wonderfully creative fashion. Some highlights include ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" as young Prudence pines over a fellow cheerleader, subtly introducing how her character feels out of place in her small town because of her unspoken homosexual feelings, ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" when Max arrives for his appointment in the Vietnam war draft and patriotism comes alive to feed Max into it's war machine, and ""All You Need is Love"" as the pitch-perfect ending with a nod to the Beatles' 1969 rooftop performance on the Apple Corps building. They've even found a way to work ""I am the Walrus"" into the mix in what is easily my favorite part of the whole movie, as the friends experience their first psychedelic trip with Dr. Robert (another song reference), a man resembling Ken Kesey and complete with his own spiked punch, psychedelic school bus, and band of Merry Pranksters. For any of those uninitiated to the Beatles, this movie makes an excellent introduction.The movie is a great experience but I have to admit it's a bit of an endurance test at times. At little more than two hours, this movie feels overly long and could've used a few more cuts to bring it down to a shorter runtime. That's not to say that the movie wastes our time at any point, as every musical sequence is used with purpose. It's jut a lot to sit through and goes on long after I became impatient for some closure and the end credits. Its seemingly exhaustive runtime is probably my only complaint in a movie that pays great respect to the Beatles and their music. The movie is visually beautiful and every musical number is perfectly choreographed and blended with bits of special effects for an other-worldly effect to the music. The cast, primarily a bunch of then-unknowns, are perfect for their roles. They each perform their own songs and I felt they were amazing covers of the beloved songs. Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther, and TV Carpio deserve a lot of credit for excellent vocal performances. Thrown into the mix are also a series of awesome cameos for particular performances including Bono (for ""I am the Walrus""), Joe Cocker (for ""Come Together""), and Eddie Izzard (for ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite""). There is a lot for Beatles fans to love about this movie and I hope new generations discover this movie as a means of introduction to one of the most influential bands of our cultural history.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible,"This has to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. First off the movie starts off with what I though was going to be a good plot. After about a half and hour the movie just gives up on it, the characters don't do any thing else until the last fifteen minutes. In the middle of the movie (which is VERY LONG AND BORING) nothing happens. I thought it was impossible to make a movie without a plot but this film proved me wrong. You can mark the point where this movie goes from OK to horrible, the moment where the kids enter the hipster bus. this movie is so bad that I really couldn't recall that much after watching it. I walked out of the theater and couldn't remember 95% of the movie. I tried really hard but my brain seemed to block out, possible to prevent myself from getting PTSD. This film is an abomination and makes me sad to be of the same species as the people who made this film.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"fantastic blend of music, color and motion","Spectacularly memorable. Awesomely memory inspiring. Entertaining.Julie Taymor has created, with a team of other artists, a truly magical and wonderful trip down Memory Lane.Filmed with live performances of the music, all Beatles tunes strung together with a modicum of original composing, the voices are incredulous and the energy is nonstop. The arrangements are startling.There really isn't a better way to positively spend an evening, and every member of the family can enjoy it together, although there are adult themes, and some very, very tastefully done nudity within the storyline. Wondrous in its achievement; a series of paintings on film that brings Akira Kurasawa to mind immediately.Don't miss experiencing this unique American musical that comes close to being an opera, and is filled with songs and color, motion and dance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I am absolutely in love with this movie,"I grew up loving the Beatles (parental influence) an I have an artistic loving heart.... so I was so excited to see this movie, and fell in love with it before the first song was over. Now I have alway been a sucker for the eclectic movie ( Rocky Horror picture show and Grease are in my regular circulation) and I love how the song and dance production do not take away or make you forget there is a story, but enhance it and help tell it. I also love that none of the headliners are known but will be after this. They are all every talented and beautiful people who deserve every gift given to them. i would recommend it to any to watch at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,History

So creatively and Solid.,"You know when it comes to musical it's very hard to say or explain what really what you wanna say . This movie mixes up postmodern scenes and good songs and nice lovestory affected by war diplomacy and makes a spell and feed it to the viewers . I really Liked this movie and I should admit that the directing is really great and I'm wondered why no Oscar for at least art direction ? this movie is much better than chicago , in the same genre . it's much more solid . of course it has some week points in starring except Evan rachelwood but who cares when you are cursed by the visions .

EXCELLENT MOVIE!!! amazing and weird ALL IN ONE!!!,One word I can say about this movie...BRILLIANT!!! The acting was incredible and they did the songs amazingly. If you decide to go see this movie do not expect it to be normal.May i give a special cheer to T.V Carpio in the role of Prudence and Dana Fuchs in her role of Sadie. Everyone just sang incredibly and they should all be proud.Just one thing. if you like the Beatles and if you like music you will love this movie because there is a song about every 3-5 minutes. It is one of the best movies i've seen in a while. so go down to the movie store and rent it because you won't regret it!!,8.0,Anonymous,History

You say you want a revolution?,"(NOTE: there aren't any spoilers, but there are rather in-depth analyses of certain scenes in particular that I felt I needed to talk about. The scene in question is about halfway through the movie, and I don't give away anything that isn't already in the trailers. But if you don't wish to read, don't)Now, I'm actually quite surprised that I even saw this movie. Mostly because of its abundant negative reviews but after watching it, why is it so hated? While critics might not have liked it, the Beatles themselves actually liked it. Sir Ringo Starr, Sir Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono (John Lennon's widow), and Olivia Harrison (George Harrison's widow) all have expressed their praise in the movie. A story even goes that McCartney was singing along under his breath to the song ""All My Loving"" in the private screening. After seeing it in that screening, director Julie Taymor asked the Beatle if there was anything he disliked about the film and he responded with: ""What's not to like?"" So I decided to give it a chance and man, oh, man, I am glad I did!The story is inspired by several Beatles classics and follows the story of the Liverpudlian Jude (Paul McCartney look-alike Jim Sturgess) who comes to the US in search of his father. There he forms a friendship with Max (Joe Anderson) and falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). There are several other characters inspired by these songs, such as the Janis Joplinesque Sadie (Dana Fuchs), the Jimi Hendrixesque Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy), the shy closeted Prudence (T. V. Carpio), the eccentric Dr. Robert and more. If you don't get it, it's fine but those are characters (some even real people) from Beatles songs. As a Beatles fan I was excited to see these characters and if they were anything like their musical personas (mostly, I wanted to see Max killing people with a hammer) and most surprisingly stay relatively true to how their described, though there isn't any hammer murder. Anyway, the characters go through the sixties, which wasn't great for many people. It starts in the early/mid 60's which were a lot like the late 50's, mostly Pleasasntville-like stuff going on. Then we enter the psychedelic period and the summer of Love stuff. Then we reach the war and the revolution.The music of the Beatles is perhaps some of the most iconic and influential music of all time and must be incorporated properly in order to make this movie work. How do they do that? Enter Miss Julie Taymor. I was ecstatic when I heard she directed this and she does phenomenally. For those of you who aren't big Broadway musical fans, Julie Taymor directed ""The Lion King"" which is one of the most phenomenal things I have ever seen. It uses a lot of clever puppetry and instead of CGI, she actually incorporated said puppetry into some of the most creative interpretations of the songs I've ever seen. The puppets used create this uncanny beauty that defines many of the numbers. There are very good numbers (almost all in the movie) and there are less good numbers (""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite"" though it was funny to try and explain to my dad what I was watching when he walked in on that scene).However there is one scene in particular I'd like to talk about: the performance of ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"". Now this song made NO sense to me the first three times I heard it, after that I just gave up on trying to make sense and just enjoying the song. But what she does on that scene is incredible. You see, Max ends up getting drafted for Vietnam and during his testing, he begins to hallucinate. A poster of Uncle Sam is there and he reaches out and tries to grab Max singing the ""I want you, I want you so bad"", a reference to the famous tagline. Men in uniform who look like GI Joe dolls strip him down, as well as several others, and begin their examination, continuing the ""I want you, I want you so bad, it's driving me mad. It's driving me mad"". Now here's where the scene gets downright haunting. For the ""she's so heavy"" part of the song (a lyric that still makes no sense to me) we see the recruits on a Vietnam battlefield carrying the statue of Liberty singing: ""she's so heavy"" and it sent chills down my spine. That's...just one of the most hauntingly poetic things I have seen in a long time. Hats off! Hats off! I can't get over how incredible this one scene is.Seeing with the ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" scene, what makes this movie great is that it never uses music just to use music. It's using it to provide different interpretations and make you rethink a lot of these songs you know so well. Like ""Dear Prudence"" is another good example of the creative use of the Beatles. The metaphorically closeted Prudence literally locks herself in a closet and is anxious about coming out, both literally and metaphorically. So they sing to try and comfort her: ""Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?"" both literally and metaphorically asking her to come out of the closet. It's a sweet scene. There are so many of these clever uses of music that if I discussed them all, you would've seen the whole movie.Sorry this was so long, but I had a lot to say. The movie is intense, for many reasons. The Vietnam war and revolution are not very easy topics to watch and the movie is quite graphic for PG-13, there just any blood. Pretty early in the movie we see police brutality against people of color as a young boy, hiding from the cops, sings ""Let It Be"" as a way of comfort. It later turns into a full choir singing a gospel rendition of the classic. And it hits, hard. Again, so many of these clever uses of music that I still can't really get over. I don't understand why this movie is so hated. It's sophisticated, romantic, intense, psychedelic, artistic, and set to some of the greatest music ever written. To quote Sir Paul McCartney (again): ""What's not to like?""",10.0,Anonymous,History

I loved this film,"Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but I loved this flick. Julie Taymor is a genius, and the visuals alone were spectacular and imaginative. The songs were (for the most part) used brilliantly. ""Let It Be"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", and ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" were absolutely riveting (I was blown away by ""Happiness""--she actually fit in that bizarre song so it all made sense in the plot.) Sure some of the songs were repurposed (""If I Fell"" sung by a girl), but they worked. Some of the symbolism was too obvious (""Dear Prudence""), but it still worked for me. The performances were also generally first rate, especially the three leads. I rate this a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Painful!,"I was so excited when I heard about this film. I'm a massive Beatles fan and thought it was going to be amazing! To be honest I found it almost unbearable, the tedious links to Beatles songs which were then played out in a full on Americanized way. The fact they put links to Liverpool in but couldn't quite bring themselves to set it there. He's called 'Jude' (can you see which song they're going to end up playing out for him?!), his mothers Martha (hmmmm), There's a Lucy, Sadie and Jojo. Its all a matter of time. Its cheesy, its tacky, but not in a good way. And other than the fact that they play the entire Beatles back catalogue, it doesn't have an awful lot to do with them. Couldn't quite face watching it to the end, it hurt. If you want Beatles watch Help or A Hard Days Night, even Backbeat or that Australian one where a group of fans get trapped under the stage!(Secrets??) Not this.",2.0,Anonymous,History

One of this years best,"So when I heard there would be a musical using Beatles songs and Taymor's visions I immediately began waiting for a masterpiece. I was not let down by any means. I have enjoyed Taymor's work from the time I had seen ""Titus"", her take on Shakepeare's bloodiest play. She is always entertaining and a joy to all the senses. This is no exception. It is both visually stunning and lyrical. First I have to mention the amazing covers of the Beatles songs. From the slowed down ""Hold your hand"" to the trippy ""Dear Prudence"" they never let you down. Even the instrumental score is wonderful. But when you take those songs and allow some of Hollywood's brightest to get their hands on them you have cinematic genius. Which leads me into the cast. Jim Sturgess is someone to watch for. His performance was sweet and endearing and the boy can sing. Another to watch is Joe Anderson, the charismatic Max, Jude's best friend. Throw in a slew of other Beatles characters (i.e. Sadie, Prudence and even Lovely Rita Meter Maid) as well as surprise visits from veteran rockers Bono and Joe Cocker and even a surprise visit from Eddie Izzard and you have something very special. There was one downfall however. Why is Evan Rachel Wood even in this? She was flimsy and completely out of place as Max's sister and Jude's love Lucy. She has a few songs, all of which are delivered with a bad opera impression. I'm not sure ""Blackbird"" will ever be the same for me. I won't deny that she looked beautiful but there was much more required of this lead than a pretty face. When you put her against the other players she pales in talent on every scale. She is out sung by the supporting females, particularly Dana Fuchs who's show stopping cover of ""oh darling'"" made me wonder why she hasn't been heard of before, and out acted by EVERYONE. I would normally take one point away for her boring and vapid performance but because everything else was truly cinematic genius I am forced to give it a full 5 stars. However, studios need to rethink casting Wood is these kinds of roles. Perhaps she should stick to annoying, disobedient, drug-seeking whorish teenagers. All in all: * * * * *",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hated it,"Hated it, hated it, hated it. The only reason I didn't walk out was because my hard to move developmentally disabled sister-in-law was between me and the door. I'm a child of the 60's. Admittedly, the Beatles didn't grab me the way they did many others. I was - and am - more of a folk music aficionado. But I liked them and they are iconic to my coming of age. This movie was all over the place, trying to place the Beatles in and with history, and failed miserably, in my opinion. ""Let it Be"" as the soundtrack to the Watts riots??

WOW....I want that hour and 10 minutes of my life back,"Oh let me count the ways in which this movie sucked....The first scene was GREAT...then the credits start...and then it's ALL OVER.1. trite lines. ...poor writing throughout.

They might'v been special if they'd been filmed in the 70's or 80's....by now we'v come to expect WAY better. Heck...I'd prefer to watch the special effects in Evil Dead 2.4. Bono's appearance in this film feels so retarded....looks like a cross between Buffalo Bill and Tom Cruise's character in Born on the 4th of July....the trails in that scene are likely the ONLY special effect I could suggest was ""well"" done....but more like medium-well (as in a steak) since I'v seen that effect before...and so, yawn.5. The singing...god the singing was like what happens off Broadway...at auditions.....tiny little child voices sent through compressors and high gain pr's to get back to level...and they sound forced pinched, and at times just plain amateur.6.the dancing....WEAK...who choreographed this Brittney Spears?...and Gay references on EVERY side....none of them direct enough to be considered brave...just suggestion...really just semi-naked men dancing with Army Soldiers kind of what are you smoking kind of bad allusion sort of male-macho=repressed gay tendency sort of implication without the balls to come RIGHT OUT AND JUST SAY you think army men are gay...but make them semi-naked and dancing together...well that's OK...COME ON!I'm NOT a homo-phobia...trust me on this...I LOVE the movie Velvet Goldmine...but if you think macho=gay...then HAVE THE FREAKING GUTS TO SAY IT DIRECTLY in the dialog....don't hide behind your weak choreographer's work to say it....you wusses.I do think the privates (in their privates..ha ha) carrying (a fat) statue of liberty is THE PERFECT visual to explain EXACTLY what is happening to our foreign policy...but I keep my policy out of this movie review.Dude....I fast forwarded the last 20 minutes....not worth it to me. I saw the ""plot"" ....if you can call it that....weak...really really really weak finish.Watch the first few minutes....get past the waves of the ocean thing....fast forward to the statue of liberty thing....maybe check out the benefit of Mr Kite....a little ....maybe....the whole rest of this movie is a TOTAL and complete wash out....I resent that I paid $4.99 to on demand this trite pile of trash.",2.0,Anonymous,History

A Real Dud,"Julie Taymor may be a competent Broadway choreographer, but she displays a total lack of movie-making skill with this dreadful film. Though the Beatles songs are competently sung, they are wrenched out of their musical context in a way that completely put me off. Further, Taymor trvializes the Sixties in a contrived, mechanical and offensive way, hitting everything with the same superficial note. Even the choreography, supposedly her strong suit, is lacklustre. The actors are helplessly adrift in what amounts to a poorly conceived and executed procession of music videos.

The storyline, plot, characters, characters development were all great. This movie had a lot of emotions in it. The director picked out great acting Becuse they all acted really good and believeable for there character and they all knew how to sing which was good. There was not one time I thought man this character has a bad singing voice. I thought all of there singing voices were fantastic. This was set when Vietnam war was going on. This was a bit differnce then any other musical I have seen Becuse it was a romance story set around Vietnam war. This was a very creative story but yet everything they did made the story come to together and make sense in the end. Even if they did weird stuff. There was lots of singing, drama, romance, friendship to keep the story entertaining. I never once got bored while watching it. It wasn't the most realistic story out then but I expected that since this was a musical. I never once got pulled out of the story they were trying to tell.

Let Us Take Beatles Songs and Pretend We Have a Plot,"Being a Beatles fan, I was excited about this movie. I was expecting an over the top musical, talented performers and songs that I grew up with aiding in an interesting story. But this movie was AWFUL and there is no way around that. Although I was not a fan of the ""A Story Line"" (Jude and Lucy's love affair), it was the useless and random ""B Story Lines"" that made me hate this film even more.*B STORY FLOPS*PRUDENCE is introduced at the beginning of the film, a lesbian longing for a fellow cheerleader. Later in the film, she turns up as one of the many residents in the NYC flat. How did she get here? Well, since there is no Beatles song about that, let's pretend it doesn't matter. After falling for the landlord, who is already involved with JoJo, her character disappears and reappears, with no problems, with a girlfriend. Explain to me why a character was introduced with a real problem, who the audience could feel sympathy for, and then without any reasons as to how or why, everything is all better for her. We have no idea how she turned up where she did, or how she overcame her initial fears of being a lesbian.SADIE AND JOJO have a steamy relationship from the beginning, but Sadie gets a chance to be a great singer, if she leaves her old band (including JoJo, behind). Sadie ends up hating her new situation, stating that the new band has no soul. JoJo is depressed and lonely, and leaves towards the end of the movie stating he's not going to find Sadie in a bottle. Magically, at the end of the movie, Sadie and JoJo are back together, and everything is fine. Once again, there is no need to discuss how this occurred, because the audience obviously doesn't care about a real story, only an ending.MAXWELL and his lack of a silver hammer represent the many who were against the war but forced into a draft. This humorous (but I assume not trying to be) representation of being drafted, including Uncle Sam posters singing ""I Want You,"" was perhaps the only good scene in the entire film. It was so bad, it was hysterical. The scene in which injured men are lying in hospital beds and POP up to join in the sing along with Max, terrifyingly reminds me of a childhood game called ""Don't Wake Daddy,"" in which children pressed on an alarm clock until ""daddy' SPRANG out of bed. If you are unaware of this game, I recommend checking it out and the re-watching this one scene. It serves as a good laugh.I've been told by one of my peers that this movie should have won Best Motion Picture at the Academy Awards, because it is a movie everyone NEEDS to see. When I stated, but it had an average plot, awful ""B Story Lines,"" and fixed all problems in an instant, she agreed. So my question is, how can this movie be a popular MOVIE when there was a terrible plot and awful characters. Yes, some of the actors can sing, which makes it a good Tribute Concert at best, not a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Dramaticized interpretations of over- the-top music numbers, choreography, canned acting, and clich√©d plot...oh my!I really wanted to like this film - I wanted ""Across the Universe"" to rise above the pitfalls of the musical genre as they managed in ""Sweeney Todd."" And yet, it not only fell right in...it reinforced every single one.This movie has no soul - This movie sucks souls. This movie lacks originality. This movie cheapens every single social movement and era that it portrays. To believe that this pays tribute to the times or the Beatles is to lack any true taste, understanding, or respect for what actually was.

But, if you are a true Beatles fan, then you will love this movie with all your heart - it's that good. A true Beatles fan could not ask for anything more.

This movie not only did their music justice, it gave life to it.

I particularly loved the kaleidoscopic scenes. It was refreshing to see so many new and talented faces on the screen too. Evan Rachel Wood has always been a phenomenal actress, but boy can she sing!!! Jim Sturgess (who I didn't know until this film) is just so incredibly talented; You feel the power and the emotion in every lyric he sings. The same goes for all the actors.

A poignant reminder of how good the Beatles really were.,As someone who grew up around the time the film was set I have to say that this film goes a long way to evoke the feelings of the time using the songs of the Beatles so eloquently. I was at the US Embassy protest in 68' and the Isle of White Festival in 70' so I speak from personal experience. The director deserves great commendation for giving us such a wealth of Beatles songs so brilliantly slotted into the story line. I loved the choreography and I sure that if this was put on Broadway or the West End it would run in equal measure to Mama Mia if not better. Why this film did not recoup its initial outlay is a total mystery as it shines way above the likes of High School Musical etc.,10.0,Anonymous,History
"A jumbled, disorganized mess","This film doesn't work on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. It feels like the filmmakers came up with their favorite songs from the era to use in a movie.

I can't help but think of the play/movie ""Mamma Mia"" which had only the hit songs of ABBA to put together into an interesting narrative which succeeded in the attempt. This film had countless songs to choose from and they seem utterly unrelated even with boring, pointless filler dialogue which should be binding them together.

Disappointed,"I was very optimistic about this film because I love the Beatles and Julie Taymor's creative work,and the ads for the film indicated that this film would be a visual feast of imaginative images reflecting the creativity and culture of the 60's. However, the first third of the film was so plodding that I considered leaving, something I almost never do. Eventually the story picked up as did the art direction, which accounts for the 5. Some of the visual metaphors and/or dance sequences that accompanied the songs (""I Want You""; ""Happiness is a Warm Gun""; )sorely lacked mental muscle, like pages from a sophomore art student's journal. (C'mon Julie- stretch it! Feel the burn!) Am I being a curmudgeon to want the woman who created the costumes for ""The Lion King"" and directed the brilliant ""Frida"" to try harder to come up with some sharp and truly new ideas to depict the familiar themes of the 60's? On the up-tick, about half of the film succeeded very well, and the scenes featuring Joe Cocker were stellar. If only the whole film were of that caliber...The film pays homage to A Hard Day's Night, Rent, Hair, and maybe even some Madonna videos, but ""Across the Universe"" lacks the verve and spirit of the originals.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Has buckets full of heart,"Across the Universe offers a new generation an experience of the vitality and sheer exuberance of the Beatles musical portfolio. Julie Taymor's flawed but ambitious salute to Beatlemania is a celebration of thirty three of the Beatles most famous songs and how they reflected the idealism of the sixties. Utilizing her background in puppetry, folklore, mythology, and mime, Taymor brings imagination and creativity to the table with some silly but mostly wonderful results. The film not only integrates the Beatles songs into a heartfelt love story, it also provides a mirror into the political and social turmoil of the decade.While clips are shown about the fighting and dying in Vietnam, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, and the racial turmoil in our inner cities, the film primarily offers a heart warming picture of young idealists fighting a corrupt system. You will not find any mention here of drug overdoses, children begging in the street for spare change, or clinics and hospitals clogged with young people carrying sexually transmitted diseases. The songs are the stars and the fact that they are sung by the cast themselves rather than being lip-synched adds immediacy to the experience.Unfortunately Taymor dumbs down the power of the songs to capture our imagination by providing too literal readings, naming the characters Lucy, Prudence, Max, and Jude and tying them to specific plot points. For example, Prudence enters ""through the bathroom window"" and provides a lesbian reading of the song ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". Max has a sequence with a hammer and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" becomes a music video in which falling strawberry bombs explode on bleeding strawberry bodies.The story itself is thin but appealing. Jude (Jim Sturgess), a dockworker in Britain is enticed by friend Max Carrigan (Joe Anderson) who has dropped out of college to go with him to New York. Deserted by his American father (Robert Chohessy) prior to his birth, he is eager to meet the father he never saw, now working at Princeton University as a Janitor. Jude and Max move into a Greenwich Village apartment and meet their landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs), a night club singer who is reminiscent of Janis Joplin, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) who plays guitar in the mode of Jimi Hendrix, and Prudence (T.V. Carpio).Cameos are also performed by Bono as a Ken Kesey look alike and Joe Cocker is a street person who sings ""Come Together"". Soon Jude falls for Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) whose boyfriend (Spencer Liff) was killed in Vietnam. While he pursues a career as a graphic artist, her interests lean toward political activism and the values of the two clash on more than one occasion. As Max is drafted and sent to Vietnam, the film touches upon key events of the sixties. One of the most touching is a sequence in Detroit during the racial unrest as a Gospel choir sings the beautiful ""Let it Be"" to mourn the death of a youngster in the riots. One of the best choreographed sequences takes place at a draft center when figures emerge from an Uncle Sam poster singing ""I Want You"" and menacing looking masked soldiers process the stripped-down inductees in a military formation.While the film gets most of the history right, there is some confusion in linking the counter-culture street people with the student protests, two distinct elements that were mostly at odds with each other throughout the period. Nonetheless, for fans of The Beatles and for a new generation that is eager to learn about the nature of their appeal, Across the Universe is a moving and at times transcendent ride. Joyous and passionate, the film has buckets full of heart and a vibrant energy that invites us to viscerally experience a time when people believed in something larger than themselves and were willing to put their bodies on the line to support it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Beatles,"A movie about all the Beatles songs, simply amazing. The story it self was a bit hard to follow. It was more like a two hour acid trip. I was a bit disappointed when i first watched it and realized all the songs were covers. Although the actors, and well singers were great. They sang the songs pretty close to the way the were sung originally. The art in the movie was great, really creative and the way they made the entire movie go along with the songs is most ingenious. Whoever thought of it really deserves an award. Some of the Beatles songs didn't make any sense to me till i saw this movie. It was like they took the song and just made a visual of it. We need more of these types of movies and less of the random action movies, half of them are no good anyways.

An Homage to the Pop Masters,"Rarely has an attempt to interpret the music of the Beatles through covers or another medium been successful to the extent the film makers here have succeeded. In this homage to the American era of the 1960s and the musical quartet whose legacy has come to be regarded as the definitive artifact of that era, rightly or not, the artistic expression achieved is reminiscent of the printed ""Illustrated Beatles"" which was published with the benefit of the Beatles yet together at the height of their influence and creative genius.That said, the viewer must go into this latest response to the Beatles formidable body of work with an open mind: purists might be offended, the uninitiated will be forever impressed, arguably inaccurately by what he or she sees.There is a plot here, a boy meets girl, boy loses girl simple plot, the chronology of which roughly corresponds to the years of 1962 to 1970. What this plot lacks in drama or complexity is quickly disregarded for the realization that it exists only as a vehicle to introduce the observer to the more awesome and stunning impressions of the events, and the Beatles musical contribution to the period of the 1960s conveyed through a series of often truly inspired music video vignettes.There are incredibly inspired visual expressions here, music videos if you will, of the Beatles' music interpreted through an historical lens pertinent to the events of that time such as the Vietnam War. The Army induction scene is simply breathtaking. Another spectacular example of the success these film makers have achieved in mating visual images to the Beatles music is the Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite vignette. Simply spectacular.Unfortunately, using the Beatles music to interpret the events of the Vietnam War and the social realities of the American 1960s has submerged hazards upon which even the best intended production can founder. And here there is trouble. The video vignette accompanying John Lennon's paean to his childhood school, Strawberry Fields, was frankly offensive. What was intended as a sublimely introspective, yet childlike and innocent look back at his youth was turned, by these film makers into something much darker, ugly and violent. This is a tragic flaw. In other instances, such as Blackbird, the music video vignette does not readily correspond to the artist's original intent. And in at least one case, the lyrics had to be edited in another of Lennon and McCartney's pieces to make that song fit the plot line of the story. But then again, even the best directors and actors have edited Shakespeare. The difference is, however, that the Bard's intent is usually well preserved.On critical and political side notes, the producers seemed to have cared little about the meaning and intent behind Lennon and McCartney's lyrics and at least once used this film to further an apparent bias towards the Democratic administration of Lyndon Johnson using audible slogans during an anti-war march scene, yet ignoring the truly malevolent and much more violent ""surge"" by the next Republican president, Richard Nixon, who eventually used the awesome power of the State to actually try and bar John Lennon from residency in the United States. It was during the Nixon presidency that Lennon's anti-war zeal really blossomed, not during Johnson's. A more historically faithful and honest film would have included at least an oblique reference to that ugly part of the story of the American Sixties.This reviewer has only two overriding concerns, that the images associated to some songs are offensive and that young people, new to the ""scene"" will be forever impressed, incorrectly, by some of these images.This film, Across the Universe, all things considered, however, is a must see for any sensitive spirits whose hearts are more often inspired by the angels of their better natures.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Use of Visual Metaphors,"Often, when we see a movie set in the Vietnam era, the directors and writers get lost in the atrocities of napalm and warfare. The directors of Across the Universe have imagined to illustrate the evils of war and radicalism without becoming enamored with it. Rather, these are backdrops to show us the true cost of war--the human conflicts. With visual metaphors that spend every minute showing us the human costs of war rather than telling us, this film borders on poetry rather than a movie. The balance of dramatic writing seen generally in stage productions was made much more poignant by the visual effects only possible on film. Some may wonder why I did not give the movie a 10. I was mildly disappointed by the Liverpool artist's singing or emotional output in his studio. Also, the movie focused so much on visual story telling that the plot lagged behind, especially between the Sade and her guitarist. I also never give movies a 10 unless they change my life. This was an excellent movie, but it did not change my life. Therefore, a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Of course, so many songs by them have been covered already. But there's always room for one more.However, as far as originality and creativity goes, this film has almost proved that there's nothing more new coming out of the Magical Four.

Not that old stuff again.I guess this flick would appeal to certain age groups. But probably not in a fresh manner.

Two hours of bad Beatles covers,"""Across the Universe"" is like a bad Beatles cover band. It means well, tries hard, and plays the band's catalog with love in its heart - but it's a waste of time. At the end of the show, you find yourself wishing that you had stayed home and listened to the real thing.Like most cover versions of Beatles songs, ""Across the Universe"" is awful, a poorly written and badly sung music video masquerading as a movie. The story is shallow, the characters paper-thin, and the musical numbers ridiculously over-the-top. That it drags some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century down with it just adds insult to injury.The plot, if you must: Lucy, Jude, Maxwell, Sadie and Prudence (get it?) sing Beatles songs as they move along with the change and upheaval of the 1960s, with each song representing a key event of the times. They drop acid while singing ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"". They tune in, turn on and drop out to ""Revolution"". They get drafted to ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"". Finally, as if there was any doubt, they realize that ""All You Need is Love"".I wasn't there for the 1960s, so I can't say what those times were like for people coming of age in that moment of history. No one involved in this movie seems to know, either. The themes of the time - the anti-war movement, changing sexual mores, drug experimentation - are given such shallow treatment that they have no real resonance for the audience. It's as if the protagonists are standing outside of the world they live in, so apart from the scene that they could have walked in from another movie. They know the words, but not the music.Wow, do they not know the music. The cast members are all technically proficient singers, but they put no feeling, no soul, into their renditions of Beatles songs. Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, who play star-crossed lovers Jude and Lucy, sing ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" during a breakup scene, but with none of the loneliness that John Lennon put into his best song. Joe Anderson, who plays Maxwell, sings ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" during a party sequence, but his rendition has none of the childlike joy that Ringo Starr brought to the original. Sturgess' ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", sung while he unconvincingly shoots heroin, is so bad it's offensive.Writer/director Julie Taymor makes each song into a ridiculously big set piece. The ""Strawberry Fields"" number has giant, papier-mache strawberries. ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" is accompanied by Salma Hayek floating in a syringe. I don't think I can describe the ""Why Don't We Do It In the Road?"" number in a family-friendly blog.Taymor is clearly a devoted Beatles fan, and works really hard to make her audience love these songs. Thing is, the band doesn't need her help. The Beatles are part of our cultural DNA; they don't need to be introduced to new generations, because they have been transcending generations for 50 years. Like a bad cover band, this movie has no reason to exist, and just makes us pine for the real thing.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Instead of watching it, try listening to a real Beatles album.","Across the Universe is a musical set in a world where The Beatles don't exist but everybody constantly sings Beatles songs. I say that The Beatles don't exist because surly somebody would have said, ""Instead of listening to all these Beatles covers, why don't we just listen to the originals?"" Covering Beatles songs is a very difficult task - one which this movie mostly fails - because the original songs are so good, it is hard to add anything original and new to them. What is more difficult is trying to cram 20 or so Beatles songs into a movie that is trying to maintain a cohesive plot. This leads to a lot of points in the movie where you think to yourself ""What does this singing and dancing sequence have anything at all to do with what's going on?"" The plot is really simplistic and unoriginal, though it obviously only exists to fill in the moments when the people aren't singing, however, I have to admit that the acting is pretty good. But every time a character uttered a line like ""Hi, my name is Prudence"" or ""This is my sister, Lucy"" I cringed at the thought of hearing another poorly covered song about them. I did think that the actor who played Jude was pretty good, but that's mostly because he did a very good Paul McCartney impression while singing.Overall the movie was long, boring, and pointless.

Visually original and energetic musical,"Now I am not normally a fan of musicals. But I do like Beatles songs. And the way they present them will have them stuck in your head for days. Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson are very appealing male leads and Evan Rachel Wood is a fine actress, not to mention pretty damn easy on the eyes. The singing was very good and the choreography was fantastic. The production is quite sumptuous as was the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Julie Taymor and her team went ape with the production and milk it for all its worth. It gives it a good feel of the changing era but at the same time gives it a certain fantasy element.On the storyline front, I liked that they managed to weave a love story and the darkening of this country's ethics into this. That is most definitely a story that these songs could have told. Unfortunately, not enough time is spent on the supporting characters and towards the middle, the whole Eddie Izzard sequence was just too damn weird even for my tastes. But fortunately, it picks up again and drives home the tragedy of the Vietnam War and how it tore apart this country.Now if you are very liberal about your artistic tastes and believes that visuals can speak just as well as words then this will give you a good tribute to the freedom of the 60s.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Watch it for the songs!Before I even express my single regret for the Beatlemania-worship ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, there'll be a band of loyal fanatics out there who'll still defend this film from critics or simply critical viewers like me. ""Oh, it's The Beatles. Screw You for not liking it for that!"" They might say. But the powerhouse soundtrack is not the bad here. I wasn't even born during the supreme Beatlemania era but I know The Beatles music were and still is classic to this day. If you're a Beatles fan, there's no reason you shouldn't see this film, but I hardly doubt you'd want to see it for the story or its moralistic ""messages"". If I'd recommend ACROSS THE UNIVERSE to you, go see it for the music... and the music alone.This imaginative but scattered musical drama centers on mid-Vietnam war era, where hippies and partying teens hit streets. The movie is about a story told amidst the band's famous hits, which leads to romantic moments, emotional moments of tragedy, friendship and many other surreal adaptations drawn from the imaginative minds behind the screenplay (and basically, the whole film itself). For the record, the imagination here is immense and elaborate in every sense. Come on! Any film to associate Vietnam war, the Hippie era with a pleasant array of The Beatles' soundtracks fits the category of imaginative and outlandish. And besides, simply the music of those famous songs are bound to lure any of you to the big-screen or the video store, making sure you won't miss a thing.Everything about the soundtrack and the imaginative ideas are strong, but when it comes to finally telling a story, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE seems confusing and mostly dull. It concerns a love affair between a rebellious teen named Jude (Jim Sturgess), inspired from ""Hey Jude"", and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), inspired from ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", amidst a scandalous and chaos-ridden era of the Vietnam war. The story is convoluted and weakly-told. It's slow-moving and basically plodding, pretty weak when it comes to narrative. it all seems to be dependent on the Beatles music alone to carry the story, while it drags along. Director Julie Taymor has a thing for emotions, but she rarely swoops us here. Other than a blast from the past featuring Beatles favorites, the film rarely has a memorable moment once it devotes itself to dialog and screenplay.ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is not a bad film, it's just a major disappointment. Any fan of The Beatles would come and see this one, come what may. While they'll get their just rewards, they'll still be forced plod along a tedious storyline. Scattered character bits and weak story-telling make up for one imaginative and colorful mess. See it for the music, but you still have the option to buy the soundtrack instead.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",5.0,Anonymous,History
This movie made me love The Beatles,"My music teacher in middle school showed my class this, and i loved it so much. Since then i went home and listen to all the ATU songs, and later i started listening to The Beatles. (Who are now my favorite band) This is my favorite musical, and also one of my favorite movies. The music in this movie is absolutely fantastic, i mean obviously is great music because the songs are The Beatles songs. But Also the ""Across The Universe"" versions of the songs are actually really great. I love how they put The Beatles songs to life in the movie, it's a very beautiful movie.Even though there are music constantly, i feel like it doesn't get as annoying as other musicals. The ""music videos"" are very well portrayed, and really bring some of the Beatles spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Love comment for a film,"I'm exaggerating when I say: This is the most amazing film I've ever seen. ""Moulin Rouge"" just fades next to ""Across the universe"". I mean, ""Across the universe"" has a better soundtrack, more natural and respectful, and how could it be bad with the Beatles' music? All the songs are sung with such a passion by a group of actors that includes almost only fresh faces: and each one has a beautiful voice and stunning artistic skills, especially Jim Sturgess (Jude, so gorgeous) and Dana Fuchs (Sadie, so Joplinesque). Director Julie Taymor crafts tastefully absolutely beautiful scenes that are eye-candy and ear-candy, and never shows dangerous fallings into the cheesy and the kitch. And cinematography, costumes, sets, all top notch. Do you know where the injustice is this time? The movie is splendid, original, almost revolutionary, but the Academy ignores it. That's the sad story of any true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Vusual stunner,"Julie Taymor has created a visual masterpiece by melding music by the Beatles with graphics that are otherworldly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It reminded me a bit of the movie version of Hair of which I am a big fan. The story is thin, but, that is certainly not the point of the movie. It could have easily been called A Day in the Life or Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, but, no matter, kudos to everyone involved with the conceptualization and production. I don't believe you have to be a Beatles fan or an art major to enjoy this presentation, but, you certainly need an open mind and the ability to tear yourself away from more formulaic offerings.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Overrated,"I rented this movie like a week ago, i heard a lot about it, and the Beatles music also attracted me, but when i started seeing it, i knew it wasn't what i was expecting for. maybe it is the fact that i'm not American, so i absolutely didn't feel identified with any of the characters or the plot, but even when i'm not American, if the script was good enough, it should have make me felt involved in the movie than i did... but it didn't. Even when the performances were OK, and some characters were really interesting, i don't think i'm ever going to rent that movie again, though i don't regret of watching it, cause i learned a few thing and i got to see an amazing art direction, which is, in my opinion, the most remarkable aspect about Across the universe.",5.0,Anonymous,History
One Trip I Won't Be Repeating,"Taymor is without a doubt a visionary. Her film is like a lavish visual experience, and the cinematography is astounding. You feel like you're on the strangest drug trip of your life. But sadly, what this film has in look, it lacks in everything else.The story concerns two 70's era lovers Jude and Lucy. This story had potential, too bad it becomes a clich√©d, tired look at a vibrant time. I thought Jim Sturgess' performance was fine, my real problem lay with Evan Rachel Wood. Her performance was flat, wooden and her character was a walking 2D construction. There was nothing likable about her character - disaster for a film that relies on its two leads.The love story never veers off run-of-the-mill. There are too many secondary characters named after Beatles songs that its hard to identify with any of them. The sub-plots are, however, more interesting than the central guy-loves-girl plot. Joe Anderson is trying hard to keep the film together. Halfway though, the film starts losing it, and never recovers.There has been some attempt to 'change up' the songs, but you can't improve on perfection, and many of the songs fall down with the plot. The actors are trying, and they are good renditions, but nothing more. Some of the songs seem to drag the plot along. Several times in the film, the 'hidden' Beatles messages get anxious and far too overt. Taymor assumes that the viewer is less knowledgeable than the filmmakers, and it gets too much.This film treats the viewer to some visual beauty, but overall lacks in everything else, and sadly, a pretty picture does not make a film.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A Musical Masterpiece But Not For Everyone,"""What a great experience, Across The Universe maybe not for everyone but for everyone this is something else, i'm a big Beatles fan i know all the song in here so this is really really something else for me, the way the movie connected the story and the song is perfect, and i don't know why and how but i always feel what Jude feel, from sad, angry, and happy i feel like this character is me and that was the impact of a great movie like this , i got goosebumps every single time they sing, i got all Beatles reference in here, all of the perfomance is incredible, this is for me so unsual for a musical movie, and of course they have a reason to make this movie and that reason was because they are the greatest and the best, overall Across The Universe for me is a musical masterpiece but not for everyone""",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nothing's Gonna Change MY World because All You Need is LOVE,"I have been searching for any kind of website to contact the director and writers of this movie to express my love and appreciation for this beautiful story. Please excuse my incorrect grammar, misspelled words and lack of creativity in my story below. I just had to comment in hopes that the creators and actors know, what they have created, is an absolute master piece.My mother shared her love for the Beatles all my life. When she heard about this movie she immediately rented it. She made us, her kids, buy her the soundtrack the very next weekend for Mothers Day. The first song I heard, ""All My Lovin"", I got chills down my spine. I thought, ""WOW, these guys have done an AWESOME job recreating these timeless classics."" Even though the Beatles were not in my era/generation I have always had a passion for their music. I live in big Ole', hick Texas and someone asked a group of people one day, ""who do you like better? The Beatles or Elvis Presley?"" Of course being in Texas everyone responded, ""Elvis"". I was the ONLY one who chose the Beatles. How can you NOT love the Beatles? They were the true innovators of an ""open mind"" at that time. They sang about everything no body wanted to talk about in those days. Not only were they not afraid to say it, but they put it in ways that lured you into accepting these changes.I am a very boring married mother of 3 and I'm about to turn 30 in July. After I heard the sound track, the same weekend I rented the movie. I was glued, dazing at the screen as I watched the incredible performances from the actors and the unbelievable creativity of the story. I told my mother, ""I want the CD and the DVD for my birthday...."" I called her 2 days later and said, ""you'll have to get me the CD, I just bought the DVD."" A week later I called her again, ""I guess you'll have to get me the T-shirt because I just bought the DELUX CD with ALL the songs."" She was jealous because her soundtrack only had a few. Now, I am obsessed, I have the ring tones and everything.Also, I am a VERY devout Christian and I know the song, ""Across the Universe"" has the phrase, ""Jai Guru Deva"". Which can be interpreted several different ways. The interpretation I liked the most says ""Thanks to my Heavenly Teacher"". Even though John Lennon may be referring to a Hindui teacher we as Christians can refer to our teacher, Jesus, while listening to this song. We all obviously have the same priority LOVE not HATE.Please rent this movie, it's well worth your time. For the younger generations, don't look at this as a musical, it's merely a long music video. Open your ears, your eyes, your mind and enjoy.""Nothing's Gonna Change MY World"" because ""All you need is LOVE""PEACE",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Engrossing, energetic and flawless.","No matter how hard I try, there is no word to describe the uplifting, emotional and truly sensational journey that this film took me on. It's simply indescribable. From the opening scene of waves crashing on a shore mixed in with newspaper headlines, a vague trace of the film's most powerful moment where the two lovers are ripped apart by police and protest and the classic 'Helter Skelter', it is clear that Taymor is going to take us on an epic journey of revolution, charisma and entrancing sequences of Beatles brilliance. Every single scene is so vibrant, fresh and unique.Taymor manages to keep the integrity of each work of lyrical art, while also adding her own distinctive touch of excellence to it. Each sequence is powerful, enthralling and utterly joyous. I really can't put the sensation this film gave me into words, but it's the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced. And the most remarkable thing about it is that this feeling wasn't just during one particular moment or musical number, it hit me strong in the opening sequence and carried me on a pillow of divine euphoria unlike any experience I've ever had.The love story that plays out over the entire film is beautiful, painful and riveting. Both of these young adults are unique and beautiful revolutionaries, but they take their protests in very different forms. Eventually this drives them apart, and in an attempt to reunite we experience the film's most brilliant but painfully heartbreaking scene. As Lucy is being pulled away by the police during an immense protest, Jude fights his way through the crowd and officers to get to her. As they reach for one another, a club hits Jude across the face and he goes down. This all plays out under the cathartic collision of 'Helter Skelter' and 'Across the Universe' while we also see Lucy's brother, the resisted soldier, quickly falling into madness under the extreme pressures of the Vietnam War and Jude's face become bloodied and beaten. It's a scene that brought tears to my eyes and streaming down my cheeks. Thinking about it brings these tears back, but makes my urge to see the film again even stronger.The cameos should also be mentioned, as they are particularly lovely. Bono is hilarious as the drugged out, 'inspirational' Dr. Robert, but it's Eddie Izzard who steals the show. His Mr. Kite is hilarious, surreal and utterly brilliant and through him, Taymor creates a scene that will take you on an acid trip harder than anything Hunter S. Thompson experienced. Another bizarre cameo was that of Salma Hayek who had me lost for at least five minutes. I thought I was stereotyping every Latino woman into the same category of appearance, because I was sure it was Salma Hayek but was confident that she wouldn't take such a random and tiny part in the film. Of course this is when I remembered that Hayek was directed to her Oscar-nominated role in Frida by Julie Taymor and she must have asked to be in the film. Later I learned this to be true.Of course even though the cameos are so exceptional, the main performances highlight the wonder of the film. Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess have perfect chemistry and their acting abilities are just as profound as their lyrical beauty. In fact everyone who plays a musical part really amazes me by their singing talents. Surprisingly, it's Joe Anderson who steals the show in this one. He is charismatic, gorgeous and brilliantly hilarious throughout the first half of the film and then we see the entire affect that the madness of war plays on the mind simply through his painful eyes in the second half. Since the second I first saw the trailer, I thought this was going to be the greatest experience of my life. Slowly I realized that nothing could possibly live up the expectations I had created for this epic cinematic journey. Well, I was proved wrong as Taymor easily met my expectations and more than exceeded them. This was a journey unlike any other, and created a cathartic experience far too brilliant for words. Just impeccable in every way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"They should have called it ""Grease III: The Return Home""","Wow.Let me just start off by saying that NO self-respecting Beatles fan could possibly enjoy this film. (Notice I say ""could"" and not ""will"".)I knew ACROSS THE UNIVERSE would be awful, but I could never have guessed it would be this bad. The idea seemed intriguing, the effects (in the trailer) piqued my interests, and I do feel that Julie Taymor has a definite eye for artistry (even though she's yet to find a good script to direct; and this film is no exception). Plus, I thought that ACROSS THE UNIVERSE might be this year's LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE or American BEAUTY: you know, the film the American IDOL crowd will laud as the next big thing. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if ACROSS gets a few (or more) nods from MTV and the Academy/GG, but it's more MOULIN ROUGE than anything else.Obviously, the songs in the movies are all covers--this is to be expected--but I had no idea that it would be a wall-to-wall smorgasborg of mediocre actors doing their best to try to sing some of the greatest songs of all time. I mean, CLOCKWORK ORANGE might make a fun remake (!!), but what's the point? Why not leave it as is, folks? And that was truly the question I kept asking myself: ""WHY?!"" Why make this movie? What... is... the... point?What most immediately came to mind during my viewing of this hapless commercial for a HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL incarnation of the Beatles is something Dorothy Parker once said: ""This is one for the ages (ages 8-12).""What's more to say, really?

Beatles Music Sung Again by Young Voices,"I have always been a huge fan of the Beatles music, ever since I first heard them on English Pirate Radio while I was living in France as an Air Force Brat dependent. There was something so fresh and true to that sound. ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" still brings a thrill to me.I loved the artistry in which the all the musical productions of the Beatles tunes was carried off. The ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sequence especially caught that juvenile exuberance but in a sweeter more modest pace than the infectious but crammed to fit the radio cut length of the time.They took some chances with some of the interpretations, but, nearly all were entertaining to watch, while the music was always superb.The only caveat with this movie is it is almost 3 hours long. They choose to space out the tunes enough with story so as not be total onslaught of music. Set aside an afternoon or evening to savor this.There are tons of little details in the background that are full of Beatles trivia. I usually don't buy movies to own, but this one is a keeper as it bears multiple viewings.Watch for Joe Cocker and Selma Hayek in cameos.Highly recommended.

Frustration,"This movie is awful, simply because I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. They wont play it in Omaha where I live and I am furious.

Im not about to do that for a movie. so why the heck is this movie NOT playing everywhere? And furthermore, Omaha is in the top 50 biggest cities in the U.S. so if they are just playing it in major cities, then how come some smaller cities than Omaha are playing it? Also, we have an AMC here in Omaha, which plays independent movies all the time, it is required to, and they aren't even playing it there. Someone please explain why they won't play the movie here? I really don't want to have to wait until it comes out on DVD to see it because by then I'm sure someone will have ruined it all. And that is months away anyways.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A feast for Beatles fans and maybe also for those who aren't,"I'm not a fan of Julie Taymor (I hated Titus) so I was a bit leery about going to see this movie. Still, as a Beatles fan, I decided I should see it on the big screen. I went with my 19-year-old son, and we both enjoyed it very much. The film is a visual and auditory feast--sort of like a long music video--yet connected by a linear plot and sub-plots. For those of us who came of age during the 'Nam era, this brought back some vivid memories. But it's the music--a continuous parade of Beatles hits--that is the real treat. Somehow the plot, the (sometimes surrealistic) imagery and the music blend together for a sensual tour de force. Don't miss this movie while it's still playing in theaters; it just won't be the same on a small screen.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Very Good but Had the Potential for Excellence,"I grew up watching musicals. ""Oklahoma"", ""Singing in the Rain"", ""West Side Story""... These were great films with great stories and great musical performances. They tended to be on the longer side, but no one noticed while watching, because everyone was transfixed on the film. The fact that so many folks have praised ""Across the Universe"" in their reviews indicates that musicals, with quality production, could make a magnificent comeback.The music and the visuals were wonderful. I especially enjoyed T.V. Carpio's rendition of ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" and Joe Cocker and company with ""Come Together"". The choreography as a whole was excellent! More than once, I found myself singing along.For me, the music sequences were able to sustain an otherwise ridiculous storyline that reminded me of 1978's ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band"" or 1980's ""Xanadu"". In the case of ""Across the Universe"", the plot is haphazardly shaped around the lyrics of many Beatles' songs. There is (Sexy) Sadie and (Dear) Prudence, JoJo (Get Back) and (Hey) Jude, and even Lucy (In the Sky With Diamonds). It's all fun, sure, but the script lacks any serious creativity. The story's backdrop seemed to me an attempt at Forrest Gump meets ""John, Paul, George, and Ringo"". For me, it just didn't work as planned. About 30-45 minutes out from the end you start looking at your watch, but the finale leaves a very pleasant taste that lingers well after the credits have finished rolling.I would love to experience this film in an Imax as so much of it is an amazing combination of sight and sound. It could have been a masterpiece, but is still very good.",8.0,Anonymous,History
See It For The Music,"I saw Across the Universe in a preview in Union Square last night. Needless to say, I was absolutely psyched for it. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite up to par. It tries to be both Moulin Rouge and Forrest Gump, and it fails at both. The acting isn't especially good either, nor did I find the visuals to be particularly inspired. However, I would recommend you see it anyway- for the music.The songs in Across the Universe are absolutely amazing. There are one or two that seemed to fall a little flat (Guitar Gently Weeps) and some that were dragged out (Hold My Hand, I Am The Walrus), but for the most part, fresh takes on classics done in a generally rather minimalist style, which is accentuated by the wonderful vocals.Keep in mind, when you go to see Across the Universe, you'll be seeing a fantastic series of music videos connected by a weak plot. Also on the negative side, every lyric of the song is literally performed on the screen, which seems rather forced. See it, but be warned.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Far better than I remembered,"Okay, no, it's not a perfect movie, not by a long stretch... but y'know, looking at it again after two years, it ain't half bad.Let's the negatives out of the way first. Eddy Izzard is downright awful, apparently ad libbing his way through Mr. Kite ‚Äî and doing a rather shoddy job of it, especially after one has to watch the two previous takes in the extras section of the DVD. Some of the messages are layered on with a one-ton version of Maxwell's silver hammer, like any of the riot scenes. The cinematography gets a bit precious at times, with some pretty dreadful filtering work that, I gather, is supposed to look like ""oh man, a trip!!""Okay, that's the worst of it. Everything else? Not bad, actually. The performances are all great fun to watch, from the Janis Joplin earth mother, who seems, for a time, the core of the film's second act, to the crazy Princeton boy who winds up in Vietnam (via a fascinating production number that underlines the army's essential homoerotica with a bright, bright red line). The two leads are especially charming, if a bit thin, and the little lesbian Prue really deserved more screen time. Perhaps in Taymor's uncut version she got it.The covers of all the songs we know so well are performed pretty darn well: one converts a love song into an on-stage spat between ""Janis"" and her guitarist, who bears a singular resemblance to Jimi Hendrix. They intertwine with the plot as well as the four (maybe five?) story lines themselves knit together.Visually, it's stunning, with Bread and Roses puppets and walls transformed into clouds and a singularly beautiful scene right at the outset. Taymor definitely carried her stage director's eye into this project, and it served the material well.Again, not a perfect movie. Close, but not quite ‚Äî and so far from it that I had to rescind on that final star. But an enjoyable read of the Beatles' catalogue coupled with a lovely little love story ‚Äî you cant ask for much more than that.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Pretentious Crap, Plain & Simple","What do you get when someone loved ""Mama Mia"" so much that they decided to do the same thing with the Beatles? Why, you get ""Across The Universe"", an unentertaining acid trip through the sixties.To quickly sum up this mess, a collection of characters (everything from a British guy to a seemingly bi-curious cheerleader) all work their way to the same New York flophouse.From there, they laugh, they cry, they drift apart. You know, typical things that happen to total strangers who by odd twist of fate all wind up together.As this bizarre story continues to unfold, we are treated to swirling colors, headache inducing visuals, Eddie Izzard dancing with Blue Meanies, and Bono warbling about how he's the walrus.Now, to be fair, I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this thing sucked out loud.

Acoss the Universe is a movie written totally around Beatle's song lyrics.

I initially didn't expect to like the movie very much because the previews seem a bit odd. Then we had such a hard time trying to find the movie, because it didn't release nationwide until a few weeks later, then I finally got to see it.The music clearly drives the movie.

A dumbed down movie for a dumb society,"OKAY...So many people talked this up to me and said ""You have to see this movie really stoned or on drugs"". The only reason that statement could be legit is because for SOME PEOPLE, weed just dumbs you down incredible amounts. But, even weed did not save this movie for me. It's like the script was written by someone who has absolutely no creativity, no depth to their personality (since their characters and plot have none), and absolutely no experience with what real life is ACTUALLY like. The portrayals of people, romance, war, England, being in a band, hallucinating, etc etc were all a complete embarrassment! And then, just because they use drugs in the movie, it tricks people into thinking ""this is one of those really messed up, really DEEP - trippy movies"" but it's not...I feel like the people who have made it have never used a drug in their life, which is NOT the case with most drug movies...ala Fear and Loathing, Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream, etc etc etc.The movie attempts to make a statement and emotional impact, but all it does is causes you to laugh at how hap-hazzard and weak it's attempt is. What's the statement? People are at war in the world and it makes people sad? People die and it makes people sad? Why do you care about any of these characters? There is absolutely no depth to anything. How can you care about anything that happens to any of them?The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile are the segments where they have costumes and settings that are actually semi-creative. Particularly, the segment during the song ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" is probably the only impressive segment in the entire film. Unfortunately, to me, most of the effects-laden segments are just lackluster attempts at recreating the intense presentations we got with MOULIN ROUGE. And the ""hallucinogenic"" scene...anyone who has FINAL CUT PRO could create that in 5 minutes. There's absolutely no creative thought put into it. OOOOOOH COLOR CORRECTION - how innovative and worthwhile. NOT. I could excrete a better musical in one sitting. Don't waste your time with this mediocre garbage. Do yourself a favor and watch SWEENEY TODD instead, or ONCE, or even the new HAIRSPRAY.And as far as MUSICAL standards go, C'MON! The songs were for the most part very boring renditions of classics, and the stuff that was going on on the screen was not impressive or entertaining in the least! Barely any synchronization of anything! The choreography was so weak! It was like watching a really bad music video the entire time! A really boring one - that has like some decently talented people in the effects department, but then it's like the person in CHARGE, directing, is mentally disabled.

That made it an even more wonderful experience to me. The ladies who played Sadie and Prudence were fabulous. Sadie rocked me with her amazing voice. Prudence was good with the longing in her eyes.

"Starts Out Great, Then It Flatlines‚ÄîIt Is A Misleading Concept","When this movie starts out, it presents a few promises.There is the promise of an interesting main plot. The promise of a few very interesting subplots. And of course, the overall promise that what you'll essentially see is a solid film with music mixed in at key points in the film for visual and plot effect.Those promises are well-kept until about a quarter of the way into the film. We get to know the main character and he develops. We follow a few supporting characters, and get to know them. And of course, the great music of the Beatles is used at very precise and fun times to carry the movie forward brilliantly.Then the whole thing collapses, as a movie, in my opinion.After a quarter of the movie passes, you are then presented with song after song after song after song after song after song, with barely any story or dialogue in between. That wouldn't be too bad of course if the songs truly pushed the plot forward along with what was on screen, but it doesn't. The visuals become more for entertainment and to serve artistic purposes than to carry forward anything that was previously established.At some point you realize that the plot and the overall story of this film takes a *complete* backseat to the Director's desire to make a series of visually stunning music videos for the Beatles songs. And the whole thing eventually feels tedious.But WHY does it feel tedious? The visuals and what's on screen are well executed. The music, of course, is great, and the 1960s vibe is fun.Well, it's tedious because you're essentially lied to. If the film started out completely honestly and established outright that this would be a front-to-back celebration of some great music with story as secondary, that would be fine. But that wasn't done.What happened is that you were drawn into a story to the point where you do indeed give the Director your time and feel commitment to the story being told. Your bring your half to the table because of the promises mentioned above, and quite frankly the film doesn't hold up its end of the bargain.Overall, this would have been much more enjoyable if the film was simply HONEST with it's own identity from the first scene. If it was, it would have been a hit out of the park.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A review: Across the Universe (2007),"Across the Universe (2007)*** out of ****Directed by Julie TaymorWith Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson, Martin Luther, Dana Fuchs and T.V Carpio.Elaborated, colorful musical with Beatles songs about a couple in loved (Sturgess and Wood) in psychedelic times of drugs, love and war. Visually stunning but poorly plotted; although is an aesthetically experience with great choreography and nice songs adaptation which includes ""Because"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Hold me Thight"", ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and "" All You Need is Love"". Feature Bono singing'""I Am the Walrus"" and ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"". Look for Salma Hayek as a sensual nurse singing' ""Happiness is a warm Gun"".",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A musical, trippy, and informational all in one!","I was waiting for this movie to come out, and when it did I wasn't aware because I thought it had a different title, but then I found out. It was amazing, I was a little under the influence which only made it better. How someone can make a film about the biggest cultural phenomenon of the 60's AND make Beatles music fit into it is ridiculous, and the trippy things that happened only made it better. I must say the ending was fairly anti-climactic though, and the theater I was in had REALLY crap audio so it was all crackly, definitely a bummer, but still a great movie none the less. Until I saw this movie I didn't know that the African-American civil rights movement was in the 60's, and now I feel very stupid that I didn't. Only musical I've ever liked. Kudos.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Across the Universe is a testament to the greatest band of all time.,"""Across the Universe,"" is one of those rare films that captures the turmoil of a generation, personifies it with music, and then moves us with a heartwarming love story. Not since ""Forrest Gump,"" has a film authenticated the cultural and personal upheaval that was the 60s, and what better musical score to epitomize it, then the Fab Four from Liverpool, England.The film circles around, Jude who is a shipbuilder from Liverpool, England who meets college drop out Max in Princeton, New Jersey. Max invites Jude to Thanksgiving dinner at his family's stuffy, conservative home in suburbia. There Jude meets Max's sister Lucy where they decide to go to New York to escape their conformed lifestyles.Julie Taymor, who directed the play ""The Lion King,"" is a master choreographer, who accomplishes a surprising feet in almost telling this entire story through the music of the Beatles. The musical scenes coincide with the character's personal narratives and also the cultural, social, and political overtones of the decade as Taymor brilliantly crafts ""The Beatles,"" music into a perfect incantation of the generation's feeling and attitude.The film's 33 Musical numbers first lends its focus on the developing romance of Jude and Lucy. Lucy's boyfriend is killed in Vietnam which prompts her to rely on Jude for comfort as she is deeply conflicted with her feelings for him. In one of the most emotionally captivating performances by the young singer, she sings ""If I Fell,"" as she watches Jude from a distance at a party. The song fleshes out her apprehension and conflicted heart so perfectly you'd think that John Lennon wrote it specifically for a similar situation.There is an apparent revival to many of ""The Beatles,"" more obscure songs in ""Across the Universe,"" as Taymor's interpretations prompt the listener to connect with them in a more profound way then the original. In one of the film's subplots we see a girl, named ironically Prudence somberly singing, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" Later in the film she meets the film's central characters, but she is a troubled lesbian as she longingly gazes at a girl, wanting to hold her hand. The upbeat tempo of ""The Beatles,"" version is suddenly transformed into a song of longing and emotional heartache for a love that will never be realized.As the film's characters immerse themselves deeper and deeper into the 60s influences, the choreography of the film becomes more intense, creative, and elaborate. Bono lends his voice and appreciation for the Beatles as he plays a psychedelic hippy who performs ""I am the Walrus,"" and takes the films characters and audience on one of the film's trippiest numbers as we go on a ""magical mystery tour."" The psychedelic musical numbers call to mind Pink Floyd's ""The Wall,"" but thankfully ""Across the Universe,"" evokes its abstract scenes subtly and with a sense of organization and purpose.Jim Sturgess is impressive as Jude, as he carries himself with vulnerability and pose during a generation of many baffling cultural changes. Evan Rachel Wood is angelic as Lucy, as I and countless other males in the theater fell in love with her soft gentle voice. Both stars I believe could carry themselves on Broadway as they move through countless scene changes and sophisticated choreography.The film's central conflict centers around Lucy's involvement with a peace movement. Jude is against the political convention and fears for Lucy's safety, but she contests, and their relationship falters because of it. I won't unveil too much, but this aspect of the story felt a bit underdeveloped. This musical is not as emotionally prolific through its songs as Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge,"" but that film in my mind is a masterpiece, ""Universe,"" falls short. Sometimes in this particular musical, the song numbers seem forced or awkward in the midst of the film's story, as we see Eddie Izzard perform as Mr. Kite in an insane carnival piece to the song, ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite."" Although beautifully conceived, the song has no tangible reasoning in the film's plot line.The director may have crammed too many musical numbers into the film, but we'll let it slide. Despite the film's strained middle, its beginning and end move eloquently as a touching musical passageway of story almost as good as any Beatle album. ""Across the Universe,"" is a delightfully sweeping testament to the greatest band that will ever be, and shouldn't be missed if you are an avid fan.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"If the music were from a lesser group, this movie would have a rating of 4-5","I don't quite understand the high rating of this film... to me it's like a long MTV which tries to fit in as many Beatles song as possible. The characters are boring and have very weak personality (with the exception of Max, played brilliantly by Joe Anderson)... There are things good about the movie, the costumes and colouration are brilliant, the songs were sang pretty well by the actors/actresses although not jaw-dropping, and few songs (such as Because, Happiness is a Warm Gun, Strawberry Fields Forever etc) were presented very well... but other than that, there isn't much to it... the plot is weak and unlike Mamamia and We Will Rock You, the songs dictated the plot in Across the Universe, but it should be vice versa.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"If I could pat a movie on the head, this would be the film.","An attractive cast cannot distract the audience from a clich√©. Despite how good-looking Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson are, I found myself not laughing at this movie...in places that weren't even remotely funny. It wanted so desperately to be artistic, and it did have its moments, but ultimately, just emulated High School Musical. High School Musical on LSD.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film. It was just a cookie-cutter image of what younger people imagine the sixties were like. I am really thankful that my friend works at the theater, so I did not pay to watch this one. My advice is to see it, but save yourself a buck or two by waiting until it comes out on DVD or begins playing on one of the movie channels.To sum Across the Universe up: It was a really good try.",5.0,Anonymous,History
What a surprise,"You just never know. My wife and I are Beatles fans. Big Beatles fans. Abbey Road,and everything else. We went to the movies last night with our minds made up to see Elizabeth. When we got there late (probably during previews) after a rushed supper, we spied a movie poster for this movie, and asked the ticket girl what it was like. She said, ""Well, everyone seems to like it, it's got a lot of Beatles music in it, that's all I know."" We looked at each other, bought two seats and walked in. After endless previews, the movie started and we were a little non-plussed.The film moves you in very slowly. I am 61 years old, so the Beatles are prime time. Their music is amazing, still hip and relevant, even after more than 40 years, just like good theatre, classical music, etc. The first 10 minutes promised a rather contrived, hokey experience. But we were determined to watch, drawn forward by the amazing vocalizations and incredible productions of Beatles songs that we never believed could be sung by other voices so well (although over the years they have always had varied, some good, some bad, covers).Then it happened, just when we thought it was too much camp to take, we got sucked in totally. The plot, loose as it was, moved us through endless poignant vignettes of the era. I sang with it (quietly) since I knew almost every word, I cried many times at the evoked memories of a passionate time in life.The leads, Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess, were made for their roles, combining the idealism of youth with the awakening of meeting a nasty, cynical, hard world reality. They were beautiful, and so was the rest of the cast. How can you explain perfection.Go and see -- this is a stunning visual and auditory experience.When we left the theatre, I felt 40 years younger, and as though I were walking above the ground. This morning, I am nostalgic about last night's experience. This is the first movie in a very long time that I may rush out to see twice before the DVD comes out, just because I am so anxious to relive it.This is the greatest surprise of a movie buffs life.

Perpetuating the Beatles Legend,"A romantic celebration of Beatles songs deftly woven into the story of a young dockworker named Jude who leaves Liverpool to find his estranged father in America. Set in the late 1960s, this musical reinterprets those turbulent times for a whole new generation through old song lyrics, as Jude falls in love with an American girl and they get caught up in the politics of a world gone psychedelic. A fine example of how the rock and roll canon can be kept alive through new ways of hearing it. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Movie About My Generation,"I was a little worried about this movie. I thought, with the premise of using Beatles songs and dance numbers to tell a story, it's going to be either incredibly good or incredibly awful. And I thought it would take a genius to make it incredibly good.It's incredibly good. If I were a history teacher at an unbelievably liberal school, I'd use this movie to try to explain what it was like in the 60's and early 70's. I was there, and there are things I remember all through this movie. The musical numbers and dance are the most important factor in the movie, of course, but they are supported by a plot with characters who are genuinely authentic and story lines that catch the best and the worst of the times.People who were there will love this movie, and younger people may come away with a better understanding of what made some of us who we are and (MILD SPOILER) the realization that indeed, sometimes, all you need is love.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Just a Failure as a Musical,"Jude and Prudence show up to town to allow some more songs from the Beatles to be played. Yes sir, Across the Universe is a musical throwing it back to the 60s for a love story of sorts torn away with war and strife and LSD. If this isn't making too much sense, you're not alone. Despite a couple 5 minute naps, I will attempt to review the film as a whole.I think the movie took the easy route right from the start, and it never recovered from the decision. What I'm talking about is story structure. Obviously, all the songs are already there. So how did they make the movie? They took the songs, and they attempted to branch a story out of them to fill in the gaps. The result is high-quality music videos with small periods of ""story"" in between.""Well, Mr. Smarty Pants, do you have any better ideas?"" I do, but it's harder to pull off which is why I said they went easy. There are two types of musicals: Those that have the songs in mind and try creating a story around them (like Across the Universe), and those that have a story already in place that will be propelled forward by the songs. Personally, I feel the latter is almost always the better formula to work with, but even then it's not a perfect system. I'm just saying that it could have been a huge turn-around for this film. I mean, there might be a decent story in there somewhere, but I didn't really find it nor have the patience to put effort into searching for it.As this is a musical, we should definitely talk about the songs. Give credit to the film for trying to give modern updates to the songs with flashy graphics to help, but the characters don't add anything because nobody cares about them through the story. I will say, however, one of my biggest issues is that I think most of the songs are worse versions than the originals. Maybe that's a personal bias, who knows. My prime example is ""I Want to Hold Your Hand;"" the film version slows it down. That ruins the entire beat, and the lyrics aren't powerful enough to carry the weight of a slower song. The vocals of the majority of characters is great, but not everyone hits the right notes, and vocals alone aren't worth an update of these songs.Despite my inner Scrooge to humbug at these modern folks and their attempts to reminisce on previous times, I still found myself singing along with such classics as ""Come Together,"" ""Revolution,"" and ""Hey Jude."" I wouldn't even call myself the biggest Beatles fan, but those that claim to hate the band probably just haven't heard the right songs.This 2 hour + movie is not worth it for the few notable songs featured. The story drags on, and it ends up giving you the feeling of ""Oh, is this the last song? Nope, here's another scene."" And thus it goes on and on. Maybe I should just let it be. I don't know.Not sure where it would have fit in, but not seeing ""Yesterday"" featured was a big bummer. There are a couple other songs I would have preferred, but I honestly am not sure if this was album-based or what and I don't care enough to research it.Just did a little research, and I'm still unsure of how each song was chosen to appear in the film. Oh well.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Unplugged Beatles - Most Excellent!!!,"Excellent movie that should be seen on the big screen and with the sound turned up!!! This movie made me realize just how good some of the Beatle tunes are that I had not previously thought highly of. Remember when Eric Clapton came out with his unplugged version of Layla which in it's original form wasn't a favorite of mine, well the unplugged version is. This movie is what I would compare as the unplugged versions of a lot of the Beatle music. This movie may be a love story but that is not the focus or even the reason for making this movie, it's all about the music and based on that it succeeds or fails. I think it definitely succeeds. The Janice Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix look and sound alike versions of some Beatle tunes are the highlight, but the best new rendition of a song is sung by Joe Anderson and is Happiness is a warm gun. Wow!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History
