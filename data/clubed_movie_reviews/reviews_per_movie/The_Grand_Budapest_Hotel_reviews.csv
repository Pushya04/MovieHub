A hotel well worth revisiting more than once,"That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.While it isn't quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don't like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast's roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson's style), 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.It really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.Alexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it's never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.In conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one's taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Strange and pretty much impossible to describe.,"Wes Anderson's films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" worth seeing. It's an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it's filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson's other films, it's full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it's NOTHING like other films by other directors.The bottom line is that all these weird factors work together to make a film that you'll probably enjoy--but, like me, you won't be exactly sure why!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A cinematic chocolate box,"Rarely has a movie looked so good: the compositions and colours make each shot a minor work of art. Rarely has a film had such a constellation of stars: in a fun exercise of 'spot the actor', you should be able to identify a dozen, although one will prove harder than the rest (clue: it's an elderly woman). But then this is a work from the idiosyncratic Wes Anderson who wrote, produced and directed.The structure is a story within a story within a story and at the heart of this Russian doll is a tale set in a mythical Middle European nation called Zubrowka between the two world wars and focused on Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), the dedicated but eccentric concierge of the eponymous hotel, and his aspiring young bell boy Zero Mustapha (Tony Revolori). In a wonderful cast full of exquisite performances, Fiennes is a revelation. The man who chilled us in ""Schindler's List"" here shows a remarkable skill in comedic acting.In a twisting plot of deceit and murder, above all this is a whimsical work from the opening views of the hotel to the final credits (when a little Russian character does a dance). Shot entirely in Germany, most of the scenes were filmed on the stages of the Babelsberg Studios.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A perfect holiday without leaving home.,"My heart is still rolling from the escape to 30's Europe this afternoon, and without jet lag. This movie is an inspiration, a dream, a walk through a painting and a study of humanity.Ralph Fiennes﻿ is a phenomenon as M. Gustave. his interactions with every cast member and especially newcomer Tony Revolori are fantastic. The later holds his own weight beyond belief and the entire film is an amazing adventure with James Bond style chases, a large murder mystery, the best placed cussing and of course the sensational cinematography. The sets, models, angles and even the most nondescript characters come to life each on their own and together as a symphony of beauty. It's freaking brilliant; The Grand Budapest Hotel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"""There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity... He was one of them. ""","Wes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete control on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film he desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest.Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave's company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he's blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.I frankly don't understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren't familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies.Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities. You won't want to return to the real world when the credits start to roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson's Best?,"I would consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, however in saying that, I have only seen a handful of his movies. I was very excited for The Grand Budapest Hotel, because of its excellent cast, the fact it's directed by Wes Anderson and just by how unique it looked. After watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I can confidently say that it's my new favourite Wes Anderson film, and probably his best.As I was hoping, the story to The Grand Budapest Hotel is very original and unique, some may even say strange. And as the movie goes on, the story only gets wilder and wilder. The film is often very hilarious, with some seriously funny dark humour thrown in there as well. Characters are extremely well written, with the bond between Gustave and Zero being the backbone of the whole movie as it's so well written. The Grand Budapest Hotel features an odd narrative structure that works very well for the film, again adding to the uniqueness and freshness of it. I wasn't exactly sure how the story would play out, as I purposely avoided all promotional materiel so I would know as little as possible before watching. This was a great benefit to my viewing experience as I loved everything I saw, and felt as though nothing was spoiled from watching too many trailers.I haven't been a huge fan of most of Ralph Fiennes' work since his phenomenal performance in 1993′s ""Schindler's List"", but this is easily his best performance since then. He proves he can do comedy just as well as he can do drama, providing a perfect balance of both. Newcomer Tony Revolori is excellent as well. I won't get into the whole supporting cast because there's so many who were all so great, but I was particularly impressed by Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan.The Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely a Wes Anderson film, down to its very core. If you know his style, then you known what to expect, as this movie is full of it. Thankfully though, it's not a case of style over substance, with a great story to accompany the gorgeous visuals. The colour palette is beautiful; it's nice to see lot's of bright colours when so many other films are so dark and dreary. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. The cinematography is phenomenal, and I really like how the film was presented in different aspect ratios.You really can't go wrong with this film. It's probably Wes Anderson's best film, it has gorgeous visuals, excellent acting and a wonderful story. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's previous work, you cannot miss this, and even if you're not a fan you should go and see it anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Keep your hands off my lobby boy!,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a zany, colorful and fascinating journey through old postcard Europe, such as only Hollywood can think of. With his old, almost square picture format Wes Anderson pays tribute to recent days, but with the whole movie. In addition to his brilliant humor and endearing characters, this film captures gems with seemingly small details and meticulous compositions. For me, now one of the funniest and most original movies of 2014.The style is unique. You will either like it or you won't. There is no middle ground here.With too many great actors to mention, they all gave outstanding performance that will keep you enchanted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A brilliantly entertaining fantasy outing by Wes Anderson,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the latest from Wes Anderson, and what great fun it is. My review of Monuments Men pointed out that putting the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray and Hugh Bonneville in the same film was no guarantee of a good film. Following that logic, what should we make of the following turning up together: Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Owen Wilson and (a wonderfully made up) Tilda Swinton? The answer is a near masterpiece of cameos that add up to a highly entertaining and memorable film.In a complex serious of flashbacks, Tom Wilkinson plays an author remembering his younger self (Jude Law) being recounted, a number of years before, the life story of The Grand Budapest's mysterious elderly guest Zero Moustafa, played by Abraham. (Are you still with me?) Featuring strongly in this life story, Ralph Fiennes plays hotel concierge and lothario Gustave H., seducer of his elderly and wealthy guests. He is supported in this role – for everything outside the bedroom that is – by trainee Bellboy, and Gustave's protégé, Zero (in the younger form of Tony Revolori).Following the murder of one such guest (Tilda Swinton), Gustave is not surprised to feature strongly in her will, awarded a priceless Renaissance painting – Boy with Apple. This is much to the displeasure of her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and his evil henchman Jopling (Willem Defoe). What follows is a madcap pursuit across snowy landscapes, various grisly murders, a couple of civil wars, some disconnected fingers, a prison break and a downhill ski chase.All the cast seem to enjoy themselves immensely, but it is the production design and cinematography that really shines through: every single shot of the film is just a joy to look at, from the bright pastel colours of some scenes to the oak-panelled finery of the elderly lady's mansion. Beautifully crafted, beautifully lit,beautifully costumed, beautifully filmed. Bringing a film out so early in the new Oscar-year must be risky: but one can only hope that the voting members have a long enough memory to recognise this movie in these sorts of categories.There are some interesting crossovers to recent films: both 'The Book Thief' and 'The Monuments Men' were filmed – as this was – in Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam. No coincidence then that the steam train chugging through the East European countryside looked startlingly similar to that in the opening scenes of 'The Book Thief'; and if you have Bill Murray and Bob Balaban in town for Monuments Men, then why not stick them together for this film too? Simples! Alexandre Desplat turns up AGAIN with another quirky and fitting score.All in all, if you like the quirky style of films of the likes of Moulin Rouge then you'll love this. Highly recommended.(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my archive of other reviews and while there sign up to ""Follow the Fad""! Thanks!).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Funny, sweet, inventive and wonderfully acted","A wonderfully funny fable of the adventures of world's greatest hotel concierge (a brilliant, inventive and hilarious performance by Ralph Fiennes) and the friendship he strikes up with the hotel's new lobby boy (a strong debut by newcomer Tony Revolori).The story goes in many unexpected directions, every one entertaining and eccentric, and the cast is full of first rate highly comic performances by F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here.While not Anderson's most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I don't think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who don't enjoy Anderson's work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Entertaining, slightly farcical, tale of dark deeds and friendship","21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand Budapest Hotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene.

Not Impressed,"I don't see what all the hype is about. I went into this film with no expectations: --Didn't have a clue what it was about. --Hadn't seen any trailers. --Heard it was a fast paced satirical comedy.Really I felt this movie was pointless. Half way through the film I kept wishing I had gone to see something else. I chuckled a few times, but overall I was bored. It didn't draw me in. I wasn't emotionally involved in the story.Perhaps the fanfare with all the celebrity appearances is what had a particularly nice appeal to others, but I am not impressed with celebrity faces.This is the first time that a film that scored a high IMDb rating has disappointed me. I am puzzled at the disparity.I cannot recommend this film. I thought it was a waste of my time and money.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A Grand Adventure,"Wes Anderson is one of the most original film makers working today. None of his films can be categorized into any particular genre. His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author & F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson & countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience).",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A new high for Wes Anderson,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an old relic in the eastern European former republic of Zubrowka. In 1985, the author of the book Grand Budapest Hotel (Tom Wilkinson) recounts how in 1968 he (Jude Law) got the story from Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). He talks about his early life as Lobby Boy (Tony Revolori) with the original concierge M. Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932 who was willed a priceless painting by Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) setting off a battle with the woman's family led by her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and the violent Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Gustave is arrested for Madame D's murder. Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is the girl of purity who's in love with Zero. Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) is the executor of the will.This is a new high for Wes Anderson. He's filled this with his usual unique visual style and his quirky characters. In addition, he has used it in an exciting thriller with a bit of mystery. There are some really dangerous bad guys. There is real tension that isn't always there for a Wes Anderson film. He always had the quirky, the fascinating and the unique. This has so much more than that. It's a pretty fun thrilling ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Could end up being a signature role for him and one that is remembered for some time - although I keep forgetting his character's name. That's a problem.All the usual players show up and their all good to fantastic. Willem Defoe is especially fun. Adrian Brody might be the weakest featured player in the movie. He just doesn't quite seem to match up with the rest of what's going on. Same with Ed Norton, although he's less of a sore thumb. But they aren't problematic for the whole movie.

A Unique and Original Classic,"TGBH is one of my favourite films ever.It's aesthetic is visually pleasing and colourful which makes every scene a joy to watch. Furthermore, when paired with the very fun score from Desplat it gives even the most quirky scene a hint of suspense and tension (such as Deputy Kovac's run from Jopling).Its dark tongue in cheek humour is perfectly timed and not too overdone.The plot is very complicated but certainly not impossible to understand, however this wonderful film is one to entertain, rather than to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat; therefore I would recommend to a first-timer to try and enjoy it rather than to try and keep up and figure out the story.It is a shame that Wes Anderson did not receive any Academy Awards for this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Lots of Star Power and Style, Lacking in Substance","I gather that I was supposed to be thrilled by the ""artful"" use of color, costumes and props--especially color--in this production. And I did find it pleasant for what it was worth. It was also fun spotting celebrity cameos in nearly every scene. They were everywhere! A sort of ""Where's Waldo?"" in film form, with the hidden characters being Hollywood stars. The budget of this film must have been astronomical. But is it a great work of art?I am afraid that I disagree with the reviewers who are raving about The Grand Budapest Hotel. It was somewhat fun to watch, but the story, let us be frank, is rather banal and a weird mishmash of genres. Some may call that ""high art"" but to me it is more like a big glob of clichés from all of the different genres mixed together into one big pot. A mystery? A comedy? A romance? A drama? A slasher crime film (Dafoe plays a psycho professional killer)?This creation ends up being a lot of color and good props and an exercise in style, but it lacks the overall coherence and brilliance of a masterpiece. Star power and style are good, of course, but they do not alone suffice.Would I watch this film a second time? Probably not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Too pretentious and boring....,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is written and directed by Wes Anderson,starring Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder. This is the premise for the movie, but to watch it was boring. The movie is filmed as if you are watching a play inside a dollhouse, if that makes any sense. The so-called comedy is just pretentious and snob. Of course some people find that funny, but for me it didn't do it. The entire movie didn't do it... It could have been a wonderful adventure, but I found the manner and style it was conceived to be too boring and pointless. The acting is excellent and that saved the movie from being a complete waste of time. This definitely isn't a movie for the masses, and that being said, isn't a movie that an average movie goer will enjoy. For some that's a good thing maybe, but for me this wasn't entertaining.

A lot of Style but Little Substance,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)** (out of 4)Wes Anderson's critically acclaimed film tells the story of concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) who befriends a young lobby boy and goes on an adventure dealing with a priceless stolen painting.THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL has gotten some of the greatest reviews of the year and it even managed to pick up several Oscar-nominations but it just didn't work for me. Every once in a while a film will come along that I watch and I can understand why so many people love it but it just doesn't sit well with me. This film is a perfect example because there's no question that the film has some very good performance, has it's own look, feel and style and there's also no doubt that it's really unlike anything you've seen before. With that said, the film just felt like all style and very little actual substance.There's no question that Anderson is one of the most interesting director's working today and he often creates films that are just so original and fresh that they seem to take place in some weird, alternate universe. This film certainly fits into that category because visually speaking it's quite remarkable and it seems like each shot must have taken hours to set up in order to get right. The miniatures used in the film are obviously miniatures but it's clear they were shown like this for a purpose. It builds atmosphere. There color and set design is another major plus working for the film and especially the lay-out of the hotel.Another thing that works are the performances with each actor doing a very good job. Not only do we have Fiennes but there's also F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe, both who easily steal the show. There's certainly nothing to complain about in regards to the performances as everyone steps up and comes across with very original characters.Having said all of that, I just never once connected with the film and this is certainly not good when watching something. Obviously many people love this movie and it's a hit with most critics but to me there just wasn't much here to keep me entertained.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Keeping Things Classy,"Wes Anderson is pretty much the kind of director who never betrays his cinematic trademark no matter how small and unconventional it looks. Just like most of his films, the style and personality are written all over it, from aesthetics to pizazz, but compare this to the others, The Grand Budapest Hotel crafts something that is nearly otherworldly which (obviously) makes it very charming. It is a part thriller and part comedy film that is perfectly coated by its artistic panache, but looking deep within the structure, you may also find a bunch of witty humor and rich character development from the two leads which makes it a really special experience.The film is actually a set of layered events telling how many generations have reached the story of the past hotel owner, Gustave H. That strange piece of intro immediately presents the endless creativity of the picture. Some might think it's unnecessary, but it gives a lot of sense when the final title card appears, pretty much sums up the purpose of that period jump. But it doesn't stop there, of course. The whole film is an amusing multi-genre adventure that takes you to whimsically designed places. Even when it hits to the suspenseful moments, it still sticks to the lightheartedness until every color fades into black and white. It's a quite sophisticated direction, anything else is a pure delight.The aesthetics are an undeniable visual feast. You couldn't ask for anything more than that, the film adds plenty of quirky action within this fabulous looking world. The perfect blend of buddy comedy, mystery, and suspense is all what you need for this platform video game looking environment. But then, it's not complete without the joys of the characters. The real shining moments here is the relationship between Gustave H. and Zero. Ralph Fiennes is wondrous to the role. He made Gustave H. a very likable fellow in spite of his obvious insecurities and selfishness. But then it's an overall compelling performance. Tony Revolori also shines as his apprentice. The misfit pair sparks chemistry that adds more color to this already colorful world. The rest of the cast are just equally terrific at they are doing, whether it's to deliver great humor or give a lot of life in each scene.The Grand Budapest Hotel is often manic yet (obviously) often creative and witty. It's all classic stuff: it suddenly creates a captivating universe where its imaginations are free to express endlessly. I mean it even ends with an animated dance at the credits. Everything is not a surprise from the director, however it is still kind of a refreshing cinema. Because definitely it has larger than life painted exteriors, delightful characters, brilliant humor, and smart filmmaking that do not always exist in your everyday entertainment. It's just a fun caper that is easy to love, no matter if your interests to movies is mainstream or art-house.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A feast for the eyes.,"The once great Grand Budapest Hotel is beginning to fall into disrepair, but as with all great buildings, it has a fascinating past, and a fascinating story to tell.One hundred minutes of the most indescribable, fabulous, outrageous and decadent ....stuff that you could possibly hope to enjoy.It's very funny, it's outrageous, and for the most part, if I'm honest, I didn't know what on Earth was going on.It's a real feast for the eyes, it looks sublime, the camera work, locations and fashions are incredible, and one of the main reasons I think this film has a broader appeal than simply those who adore art house productions.The best element for me, the acting, first off, Ralph Fiennes, he once again showcases why he's one of the very best, he is super here, Willem Dafoe, Tony Revolori, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and many others all shine.I've watched it a few times, each time it seems to offer something new, this is a very rewarding film, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wonderful and witty,"I really enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel. The movie tells a story(literally), and I sat back and enjoyed every bit of it. There wasn't many dull moments, it was both witty and full of action. The story is told lightheartedly, but engaging.The scenery was colorful and strange as only a Wes Anderson movie can be. With beautiful backdrops and weird physics. Full of color most of the time, but grey and dull where it needed to be.The acting was good. It really suited the style of the movie, and why wouldn't it. Wes Anderson has picked old and well-known actors from many of his previous movies. Actors that are let loose to play people with excessive characteristics, and they seem to have a lot of fun doing it. I want to especially commend Willem Dafoe, as he does his role as a brute bad-guy to near perfection.If you like other Wes Anderson movies, you'll definitely like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Delightfully whimsical comedy adventure, with great design and fun performances","I watch a lot of short films and you can tell that Wes Anderson has very much made an impact on up and coming filmmakers due to how often you see people trying to make what they call 'a Wes Anderson style film'. Watching these film is mostly interesting because of how often these efforts fall short. It is a reminder to me of how hard it actually is to do 'whimsy'. To make it work, you not only need to make it happen, but you also need to do it in a way that gets the audience into the space they need to be in so as to be able to enjoy it; without this it is often just annoying.I was thinking of this because GBH is a great example of this working. This is not to say it is brilliant cinema, because in the end it is a whimsical piece but it does do it really well. The structure itself tells you where you are, because this is a film that opens with a girl paying respects at the bust of a dead author, who we then jump to as he starts to tell the story that was told to him by another man – a story which is also that of a story being told – and it is this story which we see for the most part. It is a structure that allows for the exaggeration and elaboration of all told stories, and it allows us to go with the sheer silliness of the tale. I say silliness, but actually the film keeps a lot which actually engages in the adventure plot, but yet at the same time delivers enough decadence and invention to allow us to enjoy it as a piece of fun.The cast match this. In many films it would be a real distraction to have so many famous faces in one film, however here it works – again because the audience are mostly positioned just to go with whatever. Fiennes is the beating heart of the film, and if he does not make his character work then the whole thing would struggle; as it is, he makes it work really well, with such color and flourish. Revolori is equally good, and needs to be since the friendship and his link to the presence (or plural) is also critical to making it work. The rest of the cast contain so many famous names doing small but enjoyable turns that it is pointless to name them all – but they all add to the whimsy rather than overwhelm it. Technically the film is a beauty, with great shots, great design through, and a sense of second-hand wonder which fits the story-telling structure.All told, it is a quite wonderful piece of silly adventure. It works because it knows itself, and it delivers itself really well in a way that draws the viewer into the space we need to be in to really go with it. This is not easy to do, and Anderson does it really well here.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Aesthetically BEAUTIFUL film, great story and acting","I was blown away by the mise-en-scene and composition of the different shots in this film. Almost every frame can be frozen, printed out and hung on the wall in your living room. The colors, the balance, the compositions, everything visually just made this film magical to me. This was definitely what impressed me most, not because the film was lacking in other areas but because it is so rare to literally have such a beautiful picture.The story was clever and engaging with unique characters who we immediately like (even the villains, particularly Willem Dafoe who got uproarious laughter from me, as well as the spectators around me in the cinema).The quirky, fantasy world Anderson has created with the Grand Budapest provides a welcomed escape at a time when many of the films on screen depict true stories.I enjoyed every minute of this picture. Not only was I pulled into Anderson's fantastic universe, I laughed out loud many times and left the theater happy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The grand Budapest Hotel: I liked it so much that I'm afraid to get cheesy.,"I just watched the movie and I'm not even sure if I understood all the implications of what I saw: I wonder if the settings, the register of the dialogues, the many and many things that delighted me meant more than what appeared at first sight. If something hidden hit me. I can only say that in the end I was really touched, as if I were in love with what I just watched. I think it was the brilliance of a human mind that struck me so much.I never read Stefan Zweig's writings although I'm aware of how great a writer he was. I'm particularly intrigued now by his autobiography, 'The World of Yesterday', if for no other reason than for the fact that he completed it the day before he took his life. But while watching this film I couldn't help but thinking of the great deal the Author owed to Georges Remi's Tin Tin for the relentless action, the silhouettes, the endless running and the overall imagery.There are no flaws in this film, I can only state my admiration.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Finnes Shines In What Is Perhaps Anderson's Best,"I have long held a tumultuous disposition towards Wes Anderson's unique cinematic style. Cutting when the camera should pan, panning when the camera should cut, splitting his movies into chapters, and choosing distractingly vibrant color pallets, Wes tends to be a bit too flashy for my taste. Nevertheless, despite it still sporting all of these Wes-isms, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an undeniable gem.Anderson's eighth feature, ""Budapest Hotel"" is a (double) framed narrative told over a 1968 dinner at the titular establishment. Aging hotel owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) tells an unnamed visiting writer (Jude Law) the tale of how he first came to the Grand Budapest in 1932 and served as a bellboy under the hotel's infamous then-owner, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).After M. Gustave's late mistress (Tilda Swilton) leaves him a priceless painting in her will, the family suspects him of manipulating or even murdering her. Rather than wait for the will to be verified, Gustave and a young Zero (Tony Revolori) decide to steal the artwork. What follows is a wild adventure involving bounty hunters, prison breaks, romance, friendship, and tobogganing down an enormous European mountain.For everything wonderful about this film, it is Fiennes who steals the show. Gustave is an enigmatic anti-protagonist. At times he is admirable and at others appalling, but for the audience, he is wholly entertaining. It is nonstop fun to watch Fiennes break from his regular villain roles to play this larger-than-life hotel manager, who nevertheless delights through comedic subtlety.Fiennes also has wonderful chemistry with the reserved yet stellar Revolori. It is not a funny-straight man match up, but rather a burlesque master-apprentice relationship where the master (Gustave) is undeniably the more ridiculous. Both characters are ""straight,"" but Gustave gets himself in more outlandish situations where watching him retain his squeaky-clean demeanor becomes a source of laughter.Outside of Fiennes and Revolori's dynamic duo, the regular Wes Anderson actors makes appearances. Willem Defoe, Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and Owen Wilson all pop up as expected. Meanwhile, Harvey Keitel has a brief cameo while Adrian Brody and Saoirse Ronan play more integral parts. It feels like a big, all-star Anderson reunion surrounding freshmen Fiennes and Revolori at the story's center.Moreover, I must admit that I even came to like the style in ""Budapest Hotel."" Unlike many of Anderson's other movies, this one takes place in the fictional country of Zubrowka. Therefore, I had an easier transition into Wes's Wacky World, willing to suspend disbelief and appreciate that I am somewhere outside of the familiar universe.With that in mind, I could better appreciate the film's artistry. Despite its rich colors and sounds, it actually reminded me of early silent pictures from F.W. Murnau or even Georges Méliès. The sets are unapologetically fabricated with miniatures, and the aspect ratio is archaically square. Given that the film's bulk takes place in the 1930s, this felt tellingly transportive. For the first time in a live action Wes Anderson film, I found myself deeply relishing in the director's artistic liberties.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Welcome to the Hotel Zubrowka,"I'm one of about three people in the world who reckon The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is Wes Anderson's best film, although 2012's Moonrise Kingdom was a return to form after the slightly drab Darjeeling Limited and the mixed bag that was Fantastic Mr Fox.All of Anderson's films are mixed bags of confectionery. As he moves further from the relatively terrestrial charms of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, the results are becoming more alien, and arguably less relatable. The Grand Budapest Hotel is beautiful, charming, and meticulous, but as icily cold as an Eastern European winter. The best Anderson films have a central relationship that provides a warm heart amidst the whimsy. Moonrise had first love. Aquatic had father and son. Budapest has hotelier and protégé, but I never got a sense of intimacy between them, only ego and awe respectively.The hotelier is Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) and the protégé is Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). When Gustave's dear friend and lover Madame D (Tilda Swinton) drops dead, distant relatives and vague friends convene (the first of many cameo-tastic scenes), hoping to get a chunk of the deceased's wealth. Gustave is bequeathed a hugely valuable painting, much to the chagrin of the gathered mourners - particularly Madame D's son, Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis (Adrien Brody), who begins a campaign to imprison and ultimately destroy Gustave, triggering all manner of breakouts, shootouts, and bumbling chases.If you've seen the trailer you'll be aware of the presence of the usual Anderson troupe, although it almost seems like overkill this time around, with famous faces merely popping up for the sake of a chuckle of recognition.The action (and ample talking) takes place largely outside the hotel, in cells and trains and leering post-Soviet streets. As a summoning of a time and place, it's Anderson's greatest achievement yet. The use of miniatures is very effective, reminiscent of the model work in Herbert Ponting's 1924 documentary The Great White Silence. There are also references to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, not just in Anderson's camera arranging characters in medium shot, and sliding through bold-coloured corridors along geometrically precise lines, but also in the theme of the passing of time: the way generations feed into each other through stories of intrigue and murder passed down.This is a melancholy film, made darker by its greedy scheming characters, and as such it feels unusually at odds with its own madcap, absurdist style. Unfortunately (and surprisingly), f-bombs constitute much of the humour; hearing Fiennes curse coarsely is funny the first couple of times, but it becomes tiresome. The scenes between The Author (Jude Law) and older Zero (F. Murray Abraham) work best, showing us the more settled, subtle, sombre film that might have been, and possibly the future of this uniquely talented auteur - but they are also indicative of the film's lack of tonal coherency.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Excellent!,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is now one of my absolute favorite movies. I've never read the book, but the film was fantastic. Some of Wes Anderson's other movies(The Royal Tenenbaums, Bottle Rocket, etc) are a bit slow paced and lost my attention at times. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel held my attention throughout the entire movie. It's fast-paced and I fell in love with all of the quirky characters. It's such a great, feel-good movie and I highly recommend it! Ralph Fiennes is wonderful, as are all of the usual actors in Anderson's films. I was worried the film would be slow, but it was so endearing and entertaining! Every little detail and quirk made it so much better!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"A charming a visual masterpiece, Grand Budapest isn't just for Wes Anderson fans","The Grand Budapest Hotel isn't just for Wes Anderson fans. As a big fan, I feel that sometimes it can be difficult to jump into Anderson's films without premeditation. Yet Anderson's eighth film could very well be his most accessible to date. He has once again created a whimsical world in his latest, and the film is loaded with visual gags and employs Anderson's signature flair to great effect. With his latest, Anderson doesn't enhance his style, he simply masters it, creating another charming film to add to his wall, one that both fans and non-fans can eat up.In The Grand Budapest Hotel, we are introduced to the legendary Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), a hotel concierge at the famous Grand Budapest Hotel. The film tells the story of his adventures with his lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori). After the death of one of his guests and lovers, Madame D (Tilda Swinton), Gustave is suspected of murder after he is left a mysterious painting in her will.From this point, the film springs into action, giving us the crazy set pieces and wild scenarios that only Anderson can create. This wouldn't be possible without Fiennes, who gives one of the best performances of his career as the suave yet crass Gustave H. He is one of Anderson's most memorable characters to date, and along with Zero, the two make quite a pair. Saoirse Ronan also shines as Agatha, a bakery girl who also serves as Zero's love interest.The Grand Budapest Hotel tells a dark story, and Anderson isn't afraid to give some shocking moments, hence the film's R rating. Coming off of Moonrise Kingdom, this is surprising, but it's also a refreshing change of pace from Anderson's latest outings, including Fantastic Mr. Fox.Supporting roles from Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray, and Edward Norton help round out the delightful cast of characters, yet sometimes the hotel feels a bit too crowded. This may not matter much given that Fiennes and Revolori are the stars of the show, but it can be a bit jarring considering their limited screen time. Blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearances from the likes of Owen Wilson can break up the film's quick and zippy pace, and one wonders if his character is entirely necessary or if Wilson appeared for simply fan service given Anderson's legendary cast.Anderson has constructed brilliant set pieces, once again employing his signature cinematography. The film is beautiful, using its visuals to its advantage to create some laugh- out-loud moments amidst the beautiful hotel. But you won't spend the entire time at the Grand Budapest. Excellent scenes within a prison are instantly memorable, as is the wonderful and exciting ski chase that will leave you in pieces.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a mastering of Anderson's craft. Some parts hilarious, other parts thrilling, you won't want to check out of the Hotel Grand Budapest. With a cast of unforgettable characters, including the legendary Gustave H, this is one of Anderson's best films to date, and it's definitely a must-see.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Delicious,"If one measure of a work of art is how thoroughly it creates its own world, then this movie is completely successful. It is funny, witty, charming. There isn't a dull frame or a wasted moment. In the spirit of the Mitteleuropa that it dusts down and recreates, like the wares of its fictional baker, it is exquisitely crafted and delicious. It is nostalgic whilst casting a shrewd light on nostalgia, and only superficially superficial.Whilst I'm sure Ralph Fiennes is very grateful for his career, it is nevertheless true that the role that brought him to Hollywood's attention, Amon Goeth in SCHINDLER'S LIST, set him off on an occasionally tedious course of broody psychopaths and intense romantics. Here he seizes his chance to prove himself an excellent light comedian, clearly enjoying this opportunity to gently mock his previous film personae. He is captivating. It's unlikely he'll get any formal recognition for this, as comedy fares badly at award ceremonies for some inexplicable reason.One of the film's great pleasures is watching a superb cast clearly having a great time. Cameos fly by, none more enjoyable than Bill Murray's. What extraordinary presence that man has on the screen! Among the other goodies are real gravitas from F. Murray Abraham, snarling malice from Adrien Brody, and finger-licking psychopathy from Wilem Dafoe. Praise too for Tony Revolori and Saoirse Ronan as the completely unsentimental but entirely necessary lovers.A real treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Fantastically unorthodox,"A movie hearkening back to the days between the World Wars, to a time where properness, good manners and dignity still reigned supreme. All in good fun, of course. The Grand Budapest Hotel is the best kind of comedy because it refuses to admit it's one. The events are humorous, of course, as are the character, but those characters always act seriously, as if the bizarre things happening around them are the norm. There's no winking at the audience, except on a story level.The humour is also more intelligent than in most Hollywood comedies. It can play with your expectations and pulls its laughs not from lowbrow jokes but from absurdity, straight man routines and from developed character traits. There's no clowning around, rather adult people are made to look silly when the movie starts pulling apart their everyday routines and revealing the hilarity underneath.It's also a gorgeous movie on all levels. The camera work is superb and the whole movie has a fantastical visual style that both strengthens the jokes along with providing a plethora of its own. The talented cast also deserves a special mention. Ralph Fiennes shines as M. Gustave, a peculiar hotel owner known for his eccentricities and impeccable manners. Such a delightful character and his sheer poise is the source of most of the humour.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a must see for all Wes Anderson fans and all of those that want to see a comedy with wit, style and finesse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Zero invites the author to have dinner with him and he tells his story and how he became the owner of the hotel.In 1932, in the glorious days of the Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) is hired to work as lobby boy under the command of the legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) that becomes his friend. Gustave manages the hotel and staff and also attends the sexual needs of the old ladies lodged at the hotel. He spends one night with Madame Céline Villeneuve ""Madame D"" Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) and soon he learns that she was found dead at home. Gustave summons Zero to travel with him to the funeral and he learns that he has inherited the valuable painting Boy with Apple. Madame D's son Dimitri (Adrian Brody) and her family do not accept that a concierge may have inherited the painting and Gustave and Zero steal it and return to the Grand Budapest Hotel to hide the painting. Gustave promises Zero that he would be his heir for helping him. But Gustave is falsely accused of murdering Madame D and is arrested and imprisoned. Will his friend Zero leave him die in the prison?""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is another original and weird movie by Wes Anderson with his usual bizarre characters.

Looks beautiful and is a lot of fun,"Well I had not seen a Wes Anderson film before and I was attracted to this by the trailer which is full of lovely looking shots.The film itself certainly does look beautiful and the way in which some of the scenes are shot is really very clever.The whole film has a cartoon quality about it and some of the scenes are indeed animated such as the introduction of the hotel itself.Three different screen ratios are used, one for each period in the film. I don't think this worked particularly well and personally I would have preferred just sticking with 2.35:1 throughout.

Wes Anderson Off His Game,"I don't know that I'd call ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" Wes Anderson's latest bit of whimsy, exactly a misfire, but I certainly didn't like it as much as some of his other recent films.Almost always there's a strong emotional core to Anderson's films that anchors the idiosyncratic absurdity that defines his style. But that emotional core is missing in this film, leaving us with a slew of Anderson creations, cartoonish characters that don't engage us because they're not given time to. His film is stuffed with famous names, some of them Anderson regulars, some of them new to his world, but virtually all of them are given short shrift. I was excited when, for example, Jason Schwartzman made his entrance, because he's been given the opportunity in previous Anderson movies to make such a comedic impression, but he gets about two minutes of unremarkable screen time before the story whisks on to the next disposable character. It's the first Wes Anderson film I can think of that caused me to actually be annoyed by his self conscious style, a sure sign that in other respects Anderson was off his game.I should add, though, that Ralph Fiennes is sensational. His performance is the one thing about the film I can praise without reservation.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Don't let it fool you,"The Grand Budapest Hotel presents itself as a light, quick watch that you'll forget. It is most certainly not. This film is incredible from start to end. The 1:1 aspect ratio fits the setting and time period so well. The costumes are elaborate and eccentric. The language and names of places are a confusing mix of Polish and German. The obvious use of scale models of streets and buildings as well as the hotel itself is engaging and suits the square format very well. The story does its best to be everything it can be but is not the central focus of the film in my opinion. Regardless, it is still entertaining and the performances and portrayals of each character are brilliant.

"Stars Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and Tilda Swinton","Whenever a film has perfect control over its tone, setting, camera-work, dialogue, and performances, you don't even notice the running time. It's therefore even more pleasing that the madcap caper film that is The Grand Budapest Hotel doesn't outstay its welcome – and gives a fine farcical romp in the process.Back in the 1930s, the eponymous Grand Budapest Hotel is run by fastidious concierge Monsieur Gustave (Fiennes) who's just taken on a new lobby boy, the aptly named Zero (Revolori). He runs the hotel like a tight-knit military unit, catering to the outrageous demands of the rich and wealthy. But when one of these clients, the fabulously wealthy Madame D. (Swinton), dies, and Gustave is framed for her murder, he and Zero must go on the run from D's homicidal brothers Dmitri (Brody) and Jopling (Dafoe) after they suspect D left her inheritance to Gustave instead of them.Unfortunately, describing the plot as I have above doesn't really convey anything about what the film actually feels like. It's light in tone, yet such serious situations as the theft of a painting, a prison break, and a shootout in the hotel lobby take place. The gloriously detailed sets, some bright and gaudy, some dark and foreboding, perfectly set the atmosphere for each scene. Throughout it all, the kinetic camera movement and finely tuned movements of the actors always give the impression that the chaos, such as it is, is still organised.And underpinning it all is the tragic figure of Gustave, whose outward fussiness give way to a tender core as his relationship with Zero (his protégé) deepens through circumstance. Almost innumerable cameos from other famous stars make this a veritable ""did you spot that?"" game, but all serve a purpose, and all serve the main story. Coming in at surprisingly well under two hours, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best movies of 2014.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Hardly a comedy, a little boring, but brilliantly made","The concept of this film is visual, there is no real story to it. As one of the characters notes, this world has vanished well before someone thought of making a movie about it. The location, the people, the names, they are all scrambled into something completely fictional, but very recognizable. The plot is just a jumble of stuff that just happens sequentially, but is quite inconsequential. The main character is neither of the great actors who are in the cast, but this too real fictional world that none of us are old enough to remember, but all know.Now, if you are not interested in a new perspective, a well done movie, fantastic actors doing fantastic acting, etc, and instead you are interested in a funny story, some action, some moral in the end, then this is not the film for you. At times the movie is downright boring and nothing really happens. The only genre listed in the IMDb fact sheet is comedy, but except the kind of old mute film filming that might elicit some smiles, with accelerated speed and exaggerated movements, nothing in the film seemed comedic to me. It is not a dark comedy, either. Or it is as much as it is a comedy, I guess.Bottom line: once one sees great actors in the cast, there is a desire to see the movie as it must be better than the average film out there. However, when the number of stars in the cast goes above a limit, you know you are in for some artful stuff. This is an art movie, no doubt about it. Watch it for the art of making a movie, since it was, I believe consciously, cleared of any separate meaning.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The struggles of the Lumpen Proletariat in a Screw-Ball Comedy that is highly entertaining.,"Wes Anderson's Lumpen HotelWes Anderson's new film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a testament to the yearnings of the lumpen proletariat in the fictitious town of Zubrowka in Eastern Europe before WWI. Mr. Gustave, the hotel's long-time concierge gets ahead in the world by pleasing the bourgeois guests of the famous hotel, anticipating their every need. He teaches his right-hand man, Zero the lobby boy, the ways of the world. Their goal is to satisfy the upper crust, and thus, advance in the world that has little in it for them otherwise. The relationship between Gustave and Zero is a delightful symbiosis of master and student. While Gustave thinks he is doing Zero a favor, he benefits from their friendship as much as Zero does.The movie is visually stunning, high-class kitsch. And unlike many of Anderson's other films, the plot in Hotel is well drawn out yet not simple. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing; he can act out whole scenes with just his facial twitches. Tony Revolori plays Zero Mustafa as a boy, an innocent who is anything but a dullard, with great aplomb considering it's his first major film. Note: As of this writing, neither IMDb nor Rotten Tomatoes lists Mr. Revolori in the credits for the film.That is strange, since he plays the second most important role in the film. The rest of the cast play their roles to various degrees of success. F. Murray Abraham is especially entertaining playing the melancholy yet satisfied Mustafa as an adult.Boiled down to its essence, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a screwball comedy set in a fictionalized nation not unlike the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup. The jokes are more low key and the dialogue is not as ridiculous in Hotel. And to Anderson's credit, the dialogue in Hotel is not pretentious. We can also thanks Fiennes for delivering his lines with tongue-in-cheek sincerity. And of course, the plot is more clever than Duck Soup without being vainglorious as characterizes some of Anderson's other movies.Rating: Full PriceThe movie is, nor is Anderson, as groundbreaking as other critics state. We won't think of the film as a ""classic"" in twenty years, but it's a thoroughly entertaining romp that is meant for the large screen.Peace, Tex Shelters",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Dazzling Visuals To The Rescue,"Another drolly twee film from Wes Anderson, better than some of his previous work (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", ""Rushmore"") but not nearly as good as others (""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox""). Here, he assembles a mighty cast, with Ralph Fiennes starring as the fastidious and ambiguous manager of a distant eastern European hotel (located in the fictitious Republic of Zubrowka; the action takes place between world wars), whose care of his guests extends beyond the usual service and who gets involved with the nefarious family of one of his elderly lovers, led by son Adrian Brody (who, by wearing pseudo-Nazi clothing, unthinkably undermines his most famous role, the persecuted Jew of ""The Pianist""). This being Anderson, it's all about cadence: he expends an awful lot of energy synchronizing his actors' responses and the rhythms of the music (a winning score by Alexandre Desplat). But really, that's all it's about--the film is completely inconsequential nonsense. Sure, it's entertaining while you're watching it but you're completely aware that what you're watching has no real substance. All the performers competently perform to Anderson's stylized, obsessive/compulsive standards but the true stars of the film are Adam Stockhausen's gorgeous production design, Anna Pinnock's intricate set decoration and the fun art direction, led by Stephan O. Gessler: it's easy to get lost in the dazzling visuals, especially when there's no real need to pay attention to what's going on in the forefront. Conceivably, it may even be better with no sound--certainly, the overall design recalls the era of silent film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Touches on universal themes and has a serious purpose,"No one has ever confused the films of Wes Anderson with those of the Dardenne Brothers, but in their own inventive way, they can be just as touching. Anderson's latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is very much in the audacious visual style of his previous comic fantasies - absurd situations, oddball characters, and zany action unfolding at a frantic pace. Here, however, the film's unique voice and compelling performances has an underlying humanity that celebrates the social fabric of a civilized society where sensitivity and consideration for others had not yet gone the way of the hula hoop.Inspired by the autobiography, The World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig that describes the culture of intellectuals, poets, composers, and playwrights in pre-World War I Vienna, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes place in Eastern Europe in the period between the two world wars, when fascism began its barbaric onslaught against civilized society. Set in the fictional country of Zubrowka, the film opens in the mid 1980s as an elderly author (Tom Wilkinson) talks about his meeting in 1968 (Jude Law playing the younger writer) with Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, a once luxurious but now decaying palace high on a remote mountain accessible only by cable car.As Moustafa relates how he began as a lobby boy and rose to be the hotel's proprietor, the scene shifts to 1932 where Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes in one of his most convincing performances, is the flamboyant concierge who services some of the elderly hotel patrons in more ways than one. His closest relationship appears to be one with the 84-year old Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) whose sudden death touches off a drama that involves Gustave and immigrant lobby boy, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) in one caper after another, the mutually supportive relationship between Gustave and Zero being the centerpiece of the film.As the threat of war hangs like a pall over the horizon, Gustave is left a priceless painting (Boy With Apple) in Madame D. will leading to his pursuit by Madame D.'s treacherous son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), whose hit man is the sinister Nazi-like Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Another of his pursuers is the much gentler captain of the Lutz Military Police, Albert Henckels (Edward Norton), an old friend of Gustave whose heart doesn't seem to be in his job. Madame D.'s lawyer, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) who insists on applying the rule of law, is one of the few sane people in the film.The plot is full of twists and turns, filled with one hilarious situation after another, all unfolding with high energy and backed by the luminous score of Alexandre Desplat. One of the highlights is a chase scene between Gustave and Zero being pursued by Jopling over a Winter Olympics downhill course where red flags provide no obstacle. When Gustave is framed by Dimitri and ends up at Check Point 19, a forbidding looking prison resembling a concentration camp, Zero and his fiancée Agatha (Saoirse Ronan), a pastry chef apprentice who makes super appealing confections created in the kitchen of Mendl's Patisserie, help him escape with the aid of Buster Keaton-type ladders, the criminal Ludwig played by a bald Harvey Keitel, and a secret society of hotel concierges known as the Society of Crossed Keys (Bill Murray and Bob Balaban among others).Eventually, they are confronted by Nazis who are coming to power in the area and have moved into the hotel. Though on the surface, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a Mack Sennett-like comedy, beneath the surface, the film touches on universal themes and has a serious purpose. Old West story teller Charles Russell wrote an inscription in a gift of his stories to an old friend that could serve as a metaphor for the film, ""Friend Tom,"" he wrote, ""this book is of the days that you and I knew. They are history now. When the nester turned the west grass side down, he buried the trails we traveled, but he could not wipe from our memory the life we loved.

For Anderson fans only,"Although I don't consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, and I can't stand Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray or any of the Wilson brothers, the reviews of this movie were distinctive enough to get it into my otherwise empty DVD rental queue - but only because there were no other movies that I actually wanted to see.Now that I've seen it, I'm still not a Wes Anderson fan, and I still can't stand Tilda Swinton, et al - and now I also don't like people I've liked in the past, like Jason Schwartzman, Ralph Fiennes, Murray Abraham and Tom Wilkinson. Only Jude Law has emerged unscathed. Every time I see him I like him more.Wes Anderson has legions of ardent, devoted, cult-like fans, but I'm not one of them.

Unconventionally Entertaining and Visually Stunning,"Orson Welles Famously said something like ""Hollywood has given me the greatest toy set a boy could ever want."" Wes Anderson is one of the Few New Hollywood Directors that has Embraced that Boyhood Enthusiasm and Unleashed it Upon His Body of Work with Joyful Abandon. He doesn't give a Hoot if it is Commercially Viable, Sellable, Marketable, or even Understood by the Great Unwashed. This is Anderson at Play take it or leave it.Most Critics Love His Quirky, Offbeat, Out of the Box take on Mainstream Movie Making and Relish in His Delivery of Unexpected, Untried, Ultra-Realism. His Dialog is not Easily Digested and doesn't Fit Comfortably in the Ear. His Visuals Overwhelm the Eye and Stimulate Cortexs that are Not Known to Exist.Watching His New Movie it is Obvious that He has Perfected His Craft and is so at Ease with His Art that the Complications look Effortless. What Emerges is an Art Form within an Art Form for the Art-Film Connoisseurs and a Vibrant Free for All for Anyone with a Modicum of Interest in being Entertained, Albeit, in a Distinctly Unconventional Method.No One is Making Films like Wes Anderson and there Probably isn't Room in the Multiplexes for Many to Try, and some may be Relieved that He is a One of a Kind. It is Verbally Futile to Describe the Insanity of the Plot and to Try and Review what took place On Screen. It is better to just sit back and Watch it All Unfold and be Amazed at its Wonderful and Fully Fledged Pretensions.NoteIf you really must know what it is about then be advised, it is a screwball, slapstick, satire, fantasy, action, romp. The Marx Brothers meet Monty Python. But that hardly begins to describe what it is. It is more, maybe, or less perhaps. Depending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A brave work of art that leaves you dangled over its simple complexity.,"I have never been fortunate enough to watch works of the Director Wes Anderson but I do not usually connect with the works of a director in today's movie industry but the satisfaction of laying eyes over the imagination and absolute freedom of this director attracted me to write a review.The Grand Budapest Hotel wasn't flawless or a masterpiece in my eyes or even what I would categorize as a movie. It was odd even in the oddest categories of films that I have had a chance to watch. It merely gave away a confusing vibe, felt cheap at points and it had wrong pacing at points but the fact is that The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie for just about 2 minutes until you are immersed into the words of a book for a matter of minutes and then again into imagination and thoughts of a fantastic listener who barely lays a word into the story. It is confusing but yet it all feels so cunning and organized that even from a newbie's perspective of his work it seems that even the confusion and pacing was so brilliantly placed. I will leave the rest for your eyes and imagination.As for the rating, I would give this movie a 10/10 because of how much freedom the director took, it made my jaw drop at points and had a sincere smile and a few killer laughs at times. I will watch it again very soon for that I already miss the feel of great imaginative adventure with a touch of brilliant comedy in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
think pink for a look at the days of yore,"So far I've liked every Wes Anderson movie that I've seen, and that includes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". This comedic tale of murder and mayhem in inter-war Europe has everything that we expect in Anderson's movies: dolly shots, pronounced colors, and quirky characters. Watching the movie, I got the feeling that Anderson made it with the aim of appealing to a larger audience due to some scenes that tended more towards action. Not that it subtracts from the good stuff in the movie. One thing that struck me is that even though the movie takes place in a fictional country in Central Europe, every cast member uses his/her real voice: we hear American, English and French accents. It's as though this country is a microcosm of the entire Western world.This time Anderson assembled what appears to be his largest cast. Ralph Fiennes as the hotel concierge and newcomer Tony Revolori as the lobby boy are the main focus, but there are lots of others (including, naturally, Anderson regular Bill Murray). It's just a really fine piece of work. I'll be very eager to see Anderson's next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
You had me at Wes Andersen,"Wes Andersen is one of the truly great directors of our time. The way he makes movie is just delightful to watch as he uses his skills to make a movie as entertaining as possible. When it comes to ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" Wes Andersen has hit the bullseye on achieving this!!When i go to see a Wes Andersen movie i like going in without knowing what the movie is going to be about. That way i get even more surprised when i see what the director puts on screen. So what i would like you to know about the plot is that it's about a concierge (Ralph Fiennes) at a hotel called Grand Budapest. Thats just what i want to tell. Because the less you know, the more surprised you will be i hope. What i will say about the plot is that it's a great story that kept me interested from start to finish.What i can tell you is that i could't stop watching it and not smile. Every scene in this movie just had something to enjoy. Whether it's Andersen's style, writing, atmosphere or camera technique. Andersen just had a lot of enjoyable scenes which mixed comedy, violence and absurdity.The actors worked wonderful in this movie. Combining Andersen's classic actors featuring Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and a lot of other actors with Ralph Fiennes and newcomer Tony Revolori. They were both fantastic as the characters in the movie and fitted well into Wes Andersen's weird and absurd world as well as a lot of other actors in the movie.Why all of these characters worked so well doesn't just come from the acting, but also from the wonderful writing. The script is just simply amazing featuring dramatic moments as well as funny moments..and i do mean funny moments. I do believe this is perhaps Wes Andersen funniest script yet which a lot goes to Ralph Fiennes character who delivers them perfectly so you know just when to laugh. There are just so many quotable lines here that I'm sure you will memorize a lot of them after you've watched it.But it's not just the characters and writing that makes this movie so good. What really helps making this movie so good is the atmosphere. The set, color and location in this movie is just so beautiful to watch that almost every shot could have been the poster. This place that Andersen show us is just so wonderful that we want to live in it.Andersen's camera style and technique is perfected in this movie as we feel every shot throughout this movie was planned and accomplished just as the people behind it wanted.. The camera movements and the lens angle has become one of the most associated thing with Andersen's movies and people who haven't seen it before will without doubt love it when they see it for their first time. It's just such a visually stunning film you can't stop feeling like you have been transported into another place that you never want to leave.Since i didn't want to discuss much about the plot I'm not going to say what message this movie is trying to give, but i suggest you reflect upon it after watching the movie and look it up since it made this movie such a more delight for me.I don't know how much more praise i can give this movie. It's just a really great movie and Im considering this to be one of Andersen's best films, but as i am a huge fan of Wes Andersen it's hard for me to choose, but it is without doubt one of his greatest achievement in cinema. I don't think there are a lot of people who wouldn't enjoy this movie as i think it's the best movie that has gotten out this year and it will remain in my head for a long time.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Visual stunning in every single way but lacks emotional resonance,"I have a love and hate relationship when it comes to Wes Anderson films. Some of his movies come across as absolutely incredible to me (Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox) and others are mostly forgettable (Bottle Rocket and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), that being said, I haven't actually seen all of his movies but I had to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel since it has been helmed as one of the best movies of the year. And is it the best movie of the year? No, not really. Is it pretty good though? Absolutely. The movie doesn't stray away from Wes Anderson's style whatsoever and every single shot of the movie is absolutely incredible to look at. Listen, I don't think too many people complain about how great looking a Wes Anderson movie is. They are always absolutely gorgeous from the way the camera moves to the way each shot is framed to the color palette, everything is incredible as per usual and I think Budapest is probably his most beautiful film to date. My issues with Budapest more so come from the characters lacking real depth or emotional resonance as well as how overstuffed the movie is.The movie already begins in jumbled mess considering it has four separate timelines. One in present day with a teenage girl looking at a monument of a writer simply known as ""The Author"" (Tom Wilkinson) and she begins to read his memoir near the monument. It then jump backwards to 1985 and we see The Author who begins narrating a story about a time when he went to the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1968. The hotel is in a poor state at this point and doesn't have very many guests but The Author encounters Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) and Zero begins to tell the tale of how he took ownership of the hotel, which then brings us to the year 1932 and is the main timeline of the film. The first timeline with the teenage girl is utterly pointless and seems to serve no purpose other than making the reference to Stefan Zweig a bit more evident. The timeline of the author in 1985 also serves no purpose. The only two timelines that are important are at least the ones prominently featured: 1968 and 1932. I would have preferred better connective pieces to all these timelines to string them all together otherwise it just comes across as kind of pointless.We are still mostly taken through the story in 1932 (with 4:3 framing that I actually quite appreciated visually, Anderson uses it to his advantage in every shot), which really takes the viewer through the hotel in the glory days with Zero as a young lobby boy and Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) as the concierge of the hotel. Fiennes is really the carrier of this film, he keeps it entertaining and has the most well established sense of wit out of anyone in the cast and is sadly, one of the only really well developed characters. We are loaded with great actor after great actor (Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, etc.) but they seem to serve no purpose other than to be like ""hey look at these actors we got for this movie. They won't serve much of a purpose in the movie but who doesn't like Bill Murray?"" Some much wasted talent all at once to simply serve in places where many other lesser actors could have filled the role. Very few characters as a whole are developed but at the very least, the story is outrageous enough and beautiful to look at to keep it from losing too much artistic and entertainment value. The movie has jail time in it, murder, people losing fingers, sledding, a bunch of priests in the mountains, etc, plenty of weird, quirky, Wes Anderson stuff (I mean that in a good way).Budapest is not a bad film by any means; simply the reception of the film has been a bit overstated in my eyes. I'll say it again, the movie is so incredibly beautiful visually but the characters lack much development beyond being there to rattle off Wes Anderson quirks (which are admittedly fun to hear and watch) and that is a real shame and disappointment to a movie that I think if more time was spent on writing good characters, the movie as a whole could have been better. Certainly worth watching for the visuals alonebut don't expect characters or a story that is really going to stick with you (despite how weird and fun and quirky the story might be).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Very colorful, wonderful characters and a classy comedy.","The thing about this movie is that you can watch it without being critical about it. It puts you in a mood of comfort where you just enjoy it and not worry that you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this film. From the start (hell! from the trailers), you know you're gonna love this movie. ---simply put, a very likable film.The story drags you deeper into the intricate and unpredictable plot. The humor is there tinged and spiced by the characters' realistic view of life. The innocent Zero interwoven with the precise and darkly humorous Monsieur Gustave creates a mischievously adorable friendship. Anderson (as what i can see from behind-the-scene videos) has complete control of the set, the casts and the story. The script writing is dark in its ways but also really fits the casts. (no wonder big time actors signed up for the roles).Viewers have the freedom to think whether or not it has a gaudy or a conservative ending.

Shouldn't I be laughing more?,"Wes Anderson films are one of those things in life that can make you feel like an outsider; like you're not quite in on the joke.

And yet I wouldn't say I was ever bored watching this or any other Anderson films.Hotel Budapest could lay claim to being the most Andersonesque of all his films, and for many (although none that I know) this is a good thing.

"As far as Wes Anderson goes, one either gets him or one doesn't. I don't.","""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", Wes Anderson's most successful film to date, is visually enthralling, every frame a veritable art museum painting (and not just on the level of ""Boy with Apple""), cleverly utilizing glass-paintings and CGI-enhanced locations in Germany and Poland actually to the level of picture postcards. That may also be its problem. As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it seems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard. Its extraordinary cast members (which includes 11 previous Oscar nominees and 5 Oscar winners) posture themselves like mannequins throughout a fast-paced exercise that feels no deeper than an elaborate puppet show. Admittedly, I've had a long-term aversion to Anderson's 'style', so annoying in its contrived stance of false naiveté. While overwhelmed by the beauty in every sequence, I search in vain for the least empathy with a single character and any emotion beyond the superficial. Many swoon over this film, but its adoration to me makes more sense on a sociological level in sync with the Twitter and Instagram sound-bite age we live in. As I said to a good friend (who's a Wes Anderson fan) after we left the theater, ""How could anyone spend so much money on such a marvelous cast and such gorgeous images and produce something so shallow and emotionless?"" I'm still waiting for the answer.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
One of the best Anderson films yet!,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, inspired by the works of Stefan Zweig and written by Wes Anderson hit United States theaters on March 28, 2014. The story falls between comedy and adventure and throws the audience into the plot within the first ten minutes. The movie works its way through the plot by presenting a recollection of stories from the owner of the famous Grand Budapest Hotel in the fictitious country of Zubrowka (unless you don't want it to be fictitious then it is real), and is perhaps (and will be in my opinion) one of the best movies of 2014. The movie consists of some very well known actors such as Jude Law, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and the one and only Bill Murray. The movie is a non-stop comical adventure and leaves you attached to the characters from the get go. If you like the scoring of all of Wes Andersons usual movies then you will surely not be disappointed as the sound crew keeps the music similar to the other Anderson films. This movie is at a rating of 9/10 because although it was absolutely phenomenal, it wasn't a perfect movie. It was missing some sort of element that I can't seem to place my finger on. However, this movie made its way into my ""All Time Top Five Movie List"" and I will definitely purchase this movie on its Blu-Ray DVD release date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Perfection of Anderson,"""Take your hands off my Lobby Boy.""This is outrageously brilliantly funny. A wonderful modern-day classic. An instant gem of this year of 2014. A perfect film of hilarity, laugh out loud comical banter and acting mastery. You the viewer are sent on a trippy world that only Wes Anderson can make up. The costumes, the sets, scenery are all flawless and truly is the Wes Anderson's persona of making films. He has away with telling the story, directing and getting his characters in the flawless brilliant, funny scenarios that will leave the viewer with a lasting impression of his ultimate, original brilliance.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an instant classic. An instant favorite of mine. It is a must see, must praise and as of now, this brilliant film is added to my all-time favorite movies. Adding it to my all-time favorites is a reality that does not happen much. Few films are added to my 1000 movies you should see before you die. I feel this is a film that is magical and truly a gifted weirdness that grabs the viewer in all its twisted comical realities and takes them on an unforgettable funny, dorky, silly wonderful journey of pure originality and perfection.The cast alone is absolutely extraordinary. There are more actors in this film then can be believed. The actors and there characters create an unbelievable persona and sitting for the viewer. All the acting is brilliant. The stars just shine off screen and are bubbly, hilarious, funny, silly, dorky and absolutely entertaining.Wes Anderson is a genius.The story is wild and brilliantly entertaining. A mix of wild comedy and a coloring book flare.I love the narrative and the ultimate conclusion of perfect comical reality. You never know where Anderson is going and that's the ultimate beauty of his cinema world. The Grand Budapest is a wild story of murder, escaped killers, sex with old people, a lobby boy and deserts and a painting of a boy with an apple.The shining stars are Fiennes and Revolori. Both work off each other in a golden comical way of perfection. Revolori as the Lobby Boy deserves an award for his character of comical banter and flare. Fiennes deserves to be nominated for best actor this year for this wild, over the top beauty of comical mastery. He gave it his all and created a character I will remember the rest of my movie loving life.I love Wes Anderson's creation of characters and the beauty of their persona's and dialogue and the ultimate situations only an original master like Anderson could come up with. I think the golden ticket goes to the surroundings and odd coloring sets and motels and situations where it was filmed. It bleeds nostalgia and retro eye candy. Awesome spots of filming that give all the more reality to the picture.Willem Defoe as the murdering thug is a priceless character. Defoe is a god of acting and he aced this motorcycle, leather wearing, fist rings and mayhem to a memorable and laughable reality on screen. Brody is awesome as the money hungry son and Edward Norton as the law is a magical moment.I have to say this is Anderson's best. I love most all his films but this one truly shines in the odd, original and twisted nature of his cinematic beauty of silliness and over all cast of characters. His creation through, only scenarios he could make up and film as visionary, shines for the watcher.Gustave and his sidekick The Lobby Boy is on the run. Gustave is accused of murdering his elderly lover. He has to figure out the truth through twisted scenarios of adventures and actions that cloud his path of freeing himself.

"Strange, but utterly delightful","Those who turn their nose up at the thought of another fussily-filmed, wildly colourful journey into the world and mind of Wes Anderson, will no doubt detest his latest, and arguably most perfect work, The Grand Budapest Hotel. His work is criticised by his haters for being too meticulously structured, his camera limited to sideways and occasionally upwards movements, festooned with bold colours, always leading to that dreaded, overused word - 'quirky'. Yet this is a world a sly wit, of characters so ridiculous and charming that you could wish they would replace the monotonous bores that litter our reality, and one in which Bill Murray is omnipresent.In the pink, mountainous haven of the picturesque, fictitious European country of Zubrowka, sits the Grand Budapest Hotel. In it's heyday, the hotel was meticulously managed by Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), a charismatic, perfume-wearing horndog, who knew all about what his guests wanted before they even knew they wanted it. On the day that one of his elderly conquests, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), leaves the hotel, he meets new lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), and immediately begins to groom him as his possible successor. When he hears of Madame D's death, Gustave and Zero travel to her mansion to hear the reading of her will.She leaves Gustave a piece of priceless art, something heavily resented by Madame's two evil, leather-jacketed sons, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and Jopling (Willem Dafoe), who don't wish to see this lecherous lothario receive a dime. Sensing trouble, Gustave and Zero steal the painting, replace it with some kind of grotesque lesbian erotica, and flee. This sets in motion a series of farcical events involving a prison escape, an apologetic police officer named Henckels (Edward Norton), a missing butler, and the rise of fascism. All of this is told by an ageing Zero (F. Murray Abraham) to a curious writer credited only as 'The Author' (Jude Law).What it all about, you ask? Possibly nothing. This could all be just a splurge of the director's imagination, or a hark back to the grand eccentrics of the olden days. It could be about the state of Europe between the two World Wars, with the Grand Budapest Hotel a multi- national asylum for all of the continent's misfits. But the setting simply seems too fitting for it's comedic approach for it to be labelled with any kind of 'war' or 'period' label, with bursts of slapstick and comedy-of-manners worthy of Lubitsch, punctured by ridiculous exclamations from it's hyperactive concierge. When he hears about an enemy's dastardly plan, he responds ""the f*****s!"".So, I don't quite know what it's all about. What I do know is that I loved every second of watching it's ludicrous story play out, anchored by an outstanding performance by Fiennes. He may seem an odd choice for an Anderson film, whose films are usually littered with the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray (all of whom appear here), but his Gustave is Anderson's greatest creation, brought fearlessly and completely to life by Fiennes. He's certainly no spring chicken, but he's a strange delight to spend 100 minutes with. And that's really how I felt about the entire experience, it was certainly strange, but utterly delightful.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson's best work,"WOW! What a film! I love Wes Anderson's work and I think this is probably his finest!

But seriously this film will go down as one of my favorite's because of its great story, brilliant cinematography and camera angles and amazing actors! Wes Anderson's style of filmmaking is probably my favourite, (along with Tarantino) because of his quirky characters, all of his story's are completely unique and hilarious with a pinch of drama. His pacing is so fast! The grand Budapest could have easily been over 2 hours because of it's complicated story but because Anderson's paving is so fast the film is only 100 Min's.

The story of Old Europe passing away as the war rages all around, can only be told as the people who lived it are shown.

Ultimately enjoyable movie experience: worth watching again,"For me, it needs two viewings to fully appreciate it. Maybe I was too tired and too preoccupied in the first show. The second viewing helps me appreciate the picture much much more. It is like a very tightly-knit symphony. Every note, every frame, every line is carefully crafted and precisely shot. Perhaps with a background in advertising, director Wes Anderson is very conscious of his airtime. Watching this film turns out to be a very rich movie viewing experience – visually and graphically, in background music and of course the animation-like exaggerating acting. But the most important is the positive message on humanity. What a pleasure to watch.Maybe the fast pace, long dialogues plus reading the subtitles made it hard to follow the first time. In the second viewing I focused on listening to the dialogue while watching the facial expressions and noticed the precise moment when the music entered. I also appreciate more the overall presentation and organization of the plot and the script which you'd better experience it yourself.The swift mood of the whole movie has a style that resembles Charlie Chaplin's movies, as if it is running slightly on fast speed. Even the love/respect for the ordinary people are also comparable. The loud color scheme, the bold use of red and the spacious portrayal of a huge hotel remind me a little bit of Stanley Kubrick's classic Shining, except this one is a comedy with a warm and humanistic respect for the profession of the concierge.The whole layout of the movie is like a set of Russian dolls where we open one layer of story and find more layers inside but there is a thread linking them throughout. Here we have four layers in total that goes back to a century. Starting from the beginning, we see a young woman carrying a book entitled ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" when she visited the grave of the author. Facing the audience, the author (Tom Wilkinson) tells us what he writes is always based on true events. Going back to his younger days in the 60s when he (Jude Law) spent a month at the hotel, he bumped into the owner Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) of the hotel, a very rich man who once worked there as a lobby boy (Tony Revolori). And here the core of the story begins.An immigrant escaping war from his country, lobby boy Zero started his training by the popular and legendary concierge Mr. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) in the 1930s. A devoted and professional concierge, Mr. Gustave inherited a valuable painting from one of his rich clients (Tilda Swinton) after she died. When Mr. Gustave and Zero went to her house for the service, a whole series of accusation, arrest, trial and chase begins. The story is not hard to follow but be sure you are alert because the editing is so precise that you need to be very attentive and literally cannot blink/slip too often.Watching the various stars, including Adrian Brody, Mathieu Amalric, Owen Wilson, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux, Bill Murray, Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel, a few of them Oscar winners, is such a pleasure. None of them except Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori have a lot of screen time but all of them are impressive with their limited exposure. The animation tone throughout the movie makes it look almost like a cartoon played by human and it is really fun.It was not until I watched the second time that I realized many details have already been planted in the early part of the movie. It is just overwhelming in the first viewing because the dialogue is fast and long, the tempo swift and editing sharp. So many senses have to be employed at the same time that I was just too busy to merely follow, let alone appreciate the production.Similar with the Russian dolls where the same pattern stays throughout different layers, the theme of anti-war, bonding among the professionals and passing on the heritage of humanity (take over) across nationality linger on for years.Even the end credits is a breeze to watch with the exciting balalaika playing and a little animated Russian guy dancing. Totally enjoyable. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Slightly better than the average Wes Anderson,"I don't care for Wes Anderson. Every time trailers give me the impression it's going to be funny, I'm deeply disappointed. For me, Wes Anderson's works range from stupid to really stupid. Grand Budapest Hotel is typically stupid. What makes it a little better is the true humor of the sets and costumes. From the Easter egg candy colored hotel with delightful columns, a grand stair-step tram to raise visitors to the heights of the hotel's entrance, delightful hotel staff costumes and villains costumed in traditional black, this Wes Anderson did give this viewer one arena of entertainment that the rest, acting, story (what story?), plot (what plot?), characterizations (who cared about any of them?) lacked. I did enjoy the stellar cast. I think they do Wes Anderson's films because making them must be fun.My favorite of the cast? Jeff Goldblum. I liked his character. And his was the only character about whom I had any feeling for care or concern.Will I ever watch a Wes Anderson film? Yes, but only for the reason I dragged myself through it this time-- it was on the IMDb 250 top films list on the 31st of December. For those who like Wes Anderson, your sense of comedy is different from mine, not better, just different. As for me, I think I'll go back to Woody Allen films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Absence of substance,"I have to admit I don't understand the appeal of Wes Anderson's films. It's not just that I don't like them very much - I'm not a great fan of superhero movies either, but I can comprehend the sensibility that they appeal to. But Anderson's movies, so widely feted, leave be not only cold, but mystified. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', for example, conjures up beautifully a comically rendered vision of Mitteleuropean splendour fading into Nazism and communism in a way that should appeal to me. But in that world, Anderson tells a one-note story devoid of any human depth. To contrast, consider a movie like 'Delicatessan', for example, which is also set in a tragi-comic alternative world; but which tells a story full of very real emotion. To me, the richness of that movie's reality is light years away from the complete shallowness of Anderson's work. As I said, it's as if there's something that's sailing completely over my head; either that, or there's an audience completely unconcerned by the absence of substance. But I'm not part of it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Film as an art form,"I have not seen all of Wes Anderson films, but what I have seen I like. I have not seen every picture in the museums of Europe and New York, but of the ones I have seen I know which ones I like. I liked this film very much; I like it better than any film I have seen this year. It is visually pleasing, the actors are familiar and magnificent and the story was timeless and incredibly human. It is an original work of art that uses humor to convey the realities of human behavior, including greed, lust, love, brutality and the idea that life, in the end, can be what we make it. Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and others will keep you entertained while Anderson spins this historical fairy tale. This film might not be for everyone but as Anderson says, you can tell he gets it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Anderson At His Best,"Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a great film and one of my favorite Anderson films. He has come a long way from ""Bottle Rocket"" and has perfected his style. The story is about hotel concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) and lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) as they navigate their way through a murder mystery and a growing war in Europe in the 1930s. It's an epic tale that is fast paced, witty, and bitter sweet.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is simply a great story where everything is just what it needs to be. Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as Gustave H. Many of the actors in this film have been in other Anderson films, but Fiennes fits right in and dishes out laughs. Anderson has fun playing around with frames. Whatever time period the film moves to, the framing complements the time period it is in. When we are in the 1930s, the framing is thin and tall like the films of the that time. As time progress, the framing gets wider. It's clever and and meaningful, just like the rest of the film.The film looks great thanks to all the focus on the small details of the sets. Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is always balanced and complements the wit of the story. Alexandre Desplat's playful music adds laughs and captures Anderson's blend of humor and drama very well. It is a very colorful film (both figurative and literally) and has the dollhouse composition Anderson fans have come to know.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has everything you want from an Anderson film. Whether it is Billy Murray and Jason Scwartzman or characters with passions or long tracking shots or childish adults and children beyond their or funny original artwork, it's all there. Anderson has perfected his craft and this film shows it.This is one of my favorite films of the year and I hope it isn't forgotten about when awards season comes. It's a funny and meaningful story with characters that you get attached to. Anderson takes you to other worlds and engages you with tales and characters that aren't afraid to be original. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a movie that I think everyone can enjoy and I'm glad it is getting recognized.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A truly stunning and spectacular masterpiece from Wes Anderson.,"I am not very experienced when it comes to Wes Anderson. I despise his adaptation of 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' and I had not seen another of his films, until Grand Budapest Hotel (GBH).I have now however decided to add GBH to my favourite films list, and for good reason. Firstly the drop dead gorgeous cinematography, which is so stylish and clever that it almost becomes a character in its own right. The angles used perfectly to emphasis the emotions of the characters and give personality to the settings (most notably the hotel itself).This along with the lavish set design and stunning scenery are undoubtedly the film's greatest strength and are amongst the greatest examples of the craft I have ever seen. If the Oscar's fail to recognise these achievements, I shall be horribly disappointed.The performances and writing are also great. Ralph Fiennes steals the show with his hilarious, detailed and unique performance in the lead role. Adrein Brody, Tony Revolori, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan also deserve praise for their enjoyable and distinct efforts in the films glorious ensemble cast. All the characters are written beautifully and highly entertainingly, with Anderson injecting his style without allowing it to overwhelm the film or consume the characters.Finally, I appreciate the film's sharp pacing and tone. It keeps things brisk, light and energetic (I'm amazed so much was squeezed into 90 mins so effortlessly), however still for slow moments of character and atmosphere. The film also balances darker character moments and the use of the film's primary framing device is integral to it's almost dreamlike atmosphere.In conclusion, Wes Anderson has won me over with his masterful work. I guess you could call me a fan now after all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Tricks and Treats...,"In a fictional country whose name might earn 100 points on the Scrabble, one of these typical points in the map that started the century in the Austrian-Hungarian splendor and ended up in Soviet austerity, there is a hotel. In this hotel that used to be the place-to-be to all the visitors from Europe, there was a professional, no-nonsense but not without a debonair quality of his own, concierge, his name was Gustav. He had a lust for aging blonde socialites, and from the way he explains it, it's something that requires the taste of a gourmet.There's also a timid but motivated lobby boy named Zero, a baker named Mendl, a murder, a jail sentence, inheritance, family plots and many other ingredients of a real pastry of movie whose story and tone will get over the heads of those who expect something with a plot. Well, that's not what the film is about, it has the old-fashioned charm of Golden Age Hollywood movies, but with a sense of self-conscious wit that gives it a modern touch of originality. It is weird, it is old, you wouldn't believe this is a 2014 movie but like Gustav' tastes, it takes a gourmet to appreciate it.There's something delightfully refreshing in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" in the way it doesn't call for any particular analysis, and provides nothing that can encourage your mind to venture into intellectual considerations. This film is meant for pure visual and narrative entertainment and all you have to do is imagining yourself checking in a hotel where all your wishes will be granted, you don't even have to think, it's all in the 'wait and see' premise.There's also a leitmotif in the film consisting on a delicious pastry, from renowned baker Mendl, who looks and tastes good and is so appealing in any way that when it is sent to a jail pensioner, the man in charge of checking if there's no outbreak device hidden in food, doesn't even let his butcher knife spoil the visuals. This is almost a metaphor to Wes Anderson's aesthetic power, one you don't want to butcher with 'thinking'. You don't need and you shouldn't, because if you try, you're likely to find yourself in some sort of private joke you're the only one not to get.So, embrace that big joke of a film, that shaggy-dog story where each shot, looks like the vignette of a comic-book, enjoy the dry with of Ralph Fiennes in his greatest comedic performance since ""In Bruges"" and don't take the whole thing seriously. The only serious aspect about it is that the film is a visual masterpiece with a unique use of colors, contrasts and environment shots, Anderson is a director, who like Jeunet in ""Amélie"" knows how to make people move in an environment, whether a hotel lobby, a jail or a mountain. Actually, he even know how to make them static, in the middle of a frame, looking at the camera but never breaking the fourth wall, quite a stunt, really.Other moments come in mind, an exchange of punches that look like the frame never moves yet three or four guys end up on the floor, there's a suspenseful moment over a ravine where a man breaks the ice to make Gustav fall only to be thrown away and fall while spinning like in a Tex Avery cartoon. The juxtapositions between shots is another trick cherished by Anderson, a group of escaping prisoners look down over a hole they just opened, the next shot features the exact opposite with guards. I mentioned comic-books, the film's story board would have made a terrific one. The uses of costume is another aspect that immediately associates the film with the animated world, nothing is too wacky or over-the-top if it means a great-looking shot or a hilarious gag, or both.The film is also known for his ensemble star-cast and indeed, it's part of the publicity, it would take a whole paragraph to list all the actors, but the thing is that the film owes them nothing, they're giving their best shot even for a few minutes of screen-time (Bill Murray doesn't have more than a minute but he steals that minute) because they know the film is good enough to have fun with it. It was Ebert who mentioned in his show with Siskel that there was nothing better than seeing actors having fun with their characters, the film would highlight that 'fun' aspect. We know actors love rely on disguises, phony accents and go beyond their usual method acting just to make fun of their own shtick. That's how refreshing the tone of Anderson is. The film would garner 11 Oscar nominations, the most with ""Birdman"" but not one for acting. Fair enough.And as star-studded as it is, Anderson was wise enough to cast a relatively unknown young fellow (Tony Rivelori) for the central role of awkward lobby boy Zero (his old counterpart is played by F. Murray Abraham), Zero doesn't have any physical appeal, he's not even competent, but he's totally devoted to his Master Gustav and that is the key to their relationship, he's his eyes and ears during his absence in prison and together, they lead a heart-pounding adventure with the dawn of the War as a backdrop. Their relationship, which is one of the mentor and master can be very inspiring at time, even poignant, so maybe there are a few things to appreciate beyond the zaniness, after all.But apart from that, it's a film that can be tasted like a treat and full of tricks whose only purpose is to make you laugh, the whole thing wrapped up in a sumptuous visual package à la Anderson, a cinematic Mendl. ""The Grand Budapest"" is all about intellectual detachment, visual entertainment, and fun, fun and fun, tricks and treats, really.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
One of the most underrated films by IMDB standards.,"I have, honest to god, seen this move a number of times succeeding that of my fingers. And every single time, it never ceases to amaze me.This movie is evidently, a beautiful one. Every scene, every prop, every colour, and every shot is so deliberate. Yet, the movie, in its entirety, extend far beyond a series of colourful and lavish shots. The dialogue is impeccable. Each character is given their own personality; a quirky set of dispositions that remain, throughout the movie, largely believable, and more importantly, strongly enforced. From Zero, to C. Gustave, to Agatha and Jopling, you are left, not only wishing them to be real, but very likely believing it yourself.On the surface, you may gather that this movie conveys a grand adventure, through the plains of all worlds, in recovery of a painting. It is very much a grand adventure, but this term should be applied to the relationship formed between Gustave and Zero. I find, that if you consider this notion when watching the movie, all the deliberation of camerawork, care in colour, and attention to detail will leave you truly amazed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
And now for something completely different. Wes Anderson's best.,"Most films that are released now are either cheap comedy films, cliché action films or superhero movies. Apart from some exceptions. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those exceptions. With the perfect blend of dark humour, a brilliant storyline and fabulous directing this certainly is Wes Anderson's best film yet. Anderson's films are definitely stylised to say the least and not all people like his style of still shots with a vintage look and feel. Personally I love it, he is one of this generations best directors. That man is an artist. You can tell the amount of effort from, not just Wes but the cast as well, that went into every shot to make it as good as it can be. The soundtrack matches perfectly to the film and the humour is laugh-out-loud funny. The Grand Budapest Hotel is now one of my all time favourite films and I am proud to say so. I look forward to Anderson's films to come and I hope he continues to make fantastically beautiful films for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Entertaining,"A story is told in flashback about the titular hotel in the fictional small country of Zubrowka in alpine Europe. In 1932, the hotel's concierge (Ralph Fiennes) is wrongly accused of murder of one of the hotel's wealthy guests.Directed and co-written by Wes Anderson, this film shares the same unique whimsy which Anderson showed most recently in ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The energy is always snappy especially with camera angles that move forward, backward, up, down, and sideways to display events happening simultaneously.The story and characterization are enjoyable though not especially strong. But with an energetic performance from Fiennes plus Anderson's playful direction, this film comes off as quite charming and entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
I've just got to stop watching Wes Anderson movies,"My fondness for Royal Tennenbaums combined with the critical acclaim and distinct look of Wes Anderson's movies always sucks me in, but I've regretted every Anderson film I've watched from Darjeeling Limited on, and Budapest Hotel is no exception.I can't say a lot about the plot because I saw the movie on a red-eye and slept through the middle. From what I saw it's about a man who inherits a painting and has some trouble about it.The man is played by Ralph Fiennes and he is terrific as a cool, quick-witted, unflappable character. His dialogue is sharp and funny. The movie overall is pleasantly goofy.,So why didn't I like it? Well ...Some movies engage and draw in the viewer. Some movies try to do that a fail. But Budapest Hotel strives to distance the viewer as much as possible. Characters are filmed at a distance and speak in rapid-fire patter that never achieves the warm quirky charm you get from patter-classics like The Front Page or Bringing Up Baby. The movie feels like a clever experimental short built around the concept of people in a dollhouse and stretches it out forever. Everything in this screams out FORMAL EXPERIEMENT; nothing screams out CARE ABOUT THIS.Would I have enjoyed this movie more if I'd not been so sleepy? Maybe a little. I might have found this a more almost-fun movie like Fantastic Mr. Fox rather than an increasingly annoying one like Moonrise Kingdom. But ultimately I find all of Anderson's later films are quirk-heavy stylistic exercises that leave me cold, and there was nothing in what I saw of Hotel to make me believe my reaction wide awake would have differed much from my reaction half asleep.So this is it. No matter how the critics rave, Budapest will be my last Anderson movie. For those of you who like this sort of thing, ENJOY!",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Ralph Fiennes at his best,"Ridiculously detailed to every nook right down to very twirls at the end of moustache of Mr.Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a must watch for the fans of Wes Anderson. His rather unorthodox animation of FANTASTIC MR.FOX drew attention to quite the number of critical stinkers although personally it was enjoyable to me. Quite similarly TGBH too contains Anderson's eccentricity in the perfection of detailing which is the core pillar of the success of the blisteringly comical motion picture.TGBH isn't snarled, devious or unfathomable to the audience as grandeur as the title wants it to sound. The opulence lies in the minimalism. The ostentatious and foolish escapade of Mr.Gustave (probably the only concierge to reach the Hall of Fame for concierges if ever there was one) and his lobby boy is all what TGBH is about. Mr.Gustave if one may say so is undeniably a ""Play-AH"" and his type is mature, rich, blonde women (GOLD DIGGER!). As all men he knows how to handle his ladies and still be a hit at the office. Mr.Gustave sails a tight ship. Perfection is something he harps on with daily meetings with the staff which is preposterously entertaining. Although Fiennes has proved his versatility in acting it's hard to see him beyond Lord Voldermort to many in the audience. It further will astonish and amuse the audience since this is by far the best performance of Fiennes one is certain to see. OMG YOU ARE GONNA LOVE HIM!The lion-share of the credit is indeed deposited under the name of Fiennes. How can one not credit the amazing, rude and at times intentionally mental performances of Bill Murray, Jude Law, William Dafoe, Adrian Brody, Edward Norton, Tony Revolori & Owen Wilson? It is not a surprise if one can be overwhelmed with the overpowering of star- power. On many occasions directors are belittled for having an overabundance of household Hollywood names to cover the drawbacks of the script or the direction – but not this time. Most of the success is seeing the stars portray these eccentric characters. I spurted my soda out when Edward Norton got his first share of screen time; it's just too funny!Another paradigm to look at TGBH is the vision Wes Anderson may have had for this motion picture. The parallel existence in which everything comes to life is obviously not as realistic as THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL purely because of the colors, but still in hindsight it looked too real not to be true. Anderson seems to have thrown a fit with the costuming and props department. There is finesse in every aspect of every turn. One cannot describe how detailed the production is until witnessed by one's own eyes. Wes Anderson I vouch to watch every other movie you are ever to make! I am your newest fan. Superb work.Lastly before every reader is misguided, TGBH is mostly word play and isn't slapstick or rude humor as in Bachelor parties in Vegas or Thailand. If that's your game TGBH is her name!TITLE: THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL DIRECTED BY: WES ANDERSON STARRING: RALPH FIENNES, TONY REVOLORI, WILLIAM DAFOE, ADRIAN BRODY, EDWARD NORTON, OWEN Wilson & BILL MURRAY RATED: R RATING : 08/10 RUNTIME: 100 MINUTES",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

grand old time,The Grand Budapest Hotel is directed by Wes Anderson and has been nominated for Best Picture Oscar.

There is even a mystery involving a famous painting in the mix. A marvelous tale from an era when hotels were stately and full of wonder. This movie is a bit static at times and long winded.

"Visually beautiful, stylish and utterly funny!","If you're already a fan of director Wes Anderson going into this film you'll enjoy it without a shadow of a doubt. The Grand Budapest Hotel lays on the usual Wes Anderson trademarks that we all love with the symmetrical shots, the old fashioned style of effects, the visually beautiful display of colour, the large A-list cast and the witty humour. This may even arguably be Anderson's BEST work to date.Ralph Fiennes' soft-toned and somewhat camp performance as Gustave is what truly takes this film into being a 'great' above all else. His character is such a well-developed personality that combined with Fiennes' acting makes seeing him such a remarkable watch. His delivery of lines, charming personality and chemistry with Tony Revolori, who plays his young and trusted friend, create for some absolutely hysterical moments constantly throughout.Overall this film is worthy as being Anderson's greatest film. With a running time of 1 hour 40 minutes the film just glides through and isn't hard to follow at all so casual film watchers shouldn't have a problem even if you're not too familiar with the director's work.One thing that may through people off is the aspect ratio of the screen. At the beginning, it starts off as widescreen but during the storytelling timeline the screen size scales down to just a box. At first sight it may look difficult to watch but it really isn't and if anything adds to the creative style the film holds.Definitely going to see this again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Weak and rather pointless movie with a luxury wrapping,"In contrast to other reviewers, I am quite disappointed of this film. It is a rather weak comedy aimed at a British/American audience with limited knowledge of Central Eastern Europe's cultures and languages - and its bare content may therefore appear exotic and hilarious. The whole actually resembles Swedish comedy movies from the 80s, but with modern aesthetics.The weakest link is the script and especially the dialog. The film starts of in an extreme tempo, as fashionable nowadays, probably not to risk boring any potential young and inexperienced viewers, maybe to appear smart and fresh - with the consequence of the audience losing half of what is going on. The extraordinarily many famous actors do not reach anywhere to potential - instead it seems like squeezing in as many stars as possible in roles that do not offer full scope for their talent.The second character, Zero Moustafa, as young played by an Indian-looking (apparently Latino) actor, as old by a white Caucasian (why?), may ring fresh with current political news for a British/American audience as he is a refugee who has had to leave his home country due to war - and due to this fact the constant nonsense-speaking Gustave excuses himself for a ""racist"" remark. And then they run around lightly clad in the snow together for much of the rest of the movie.For me, not finding anything funny, the only joy is the great cinematography, the photo and the music. The whole show is certainly wrapped in luxury paper - it feels like a waste with such weak content. But dollar-wise it might still be a success",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Stylishly made fun film that is engrossing every moment.,"Stylishly made fun film that is engrossing every moment.It surprises for a good part of the film and that's the best part. From the time we enter the Budapest Hotel, it is an fun ride, the characters are interesting and have their own little stories that are comical yet emotional and thoughtful.The story of lobby boy (Zero Mustafe) or that of Gustave, or of any character, they are not very great to say the least but are interesting. They all together shape up this well made set piece that is mostly confined to the setting of the Hotel. The acting by Ralph Fiennes is a treat and Tony Revolori as the lobby boy is a revelation.The interesting part of the film I found was the use of varied aspect ratio. It differentiates the time frames intelligently. Wes Anderson is a director who oozes out fun in his films. His films are more about fun and the camaraderie between the characters. The shots are slick, the art direction is generally awesome and the cinematography is superb. The film is very appealing visually and all his films thus far have been stylish.There is enough substance in this fun story There is action, chase, fight, enough drama and even suspense. It's all well stitched and made the whole film an engaging experience. Of course, the script is the hero followed by superb art direction of the hotel.I am not sure, if this was shot on location or whether they erected a set, but it was just beautiful.

Charming characters and beautiful visuals,"Wes Anderson produces another charming adventure in The Grand Budapest Hotel that is full of interesting characters.We embark on a splendid adventure within The Grand Budapest Hotel told by Mr. Zero Moustafa, the one time lobby-boy and now lofty owner of the establishment. We travel back in time to the 1930's at the hotel's peak of grandiosity to meet the beguiling M. Gustave, Zero's one time predecessor and mentor. A battle of fortune and theft sets forward a monumental ordeal involving an insurmountable many.M. Gustave is a meticulous man with a taste for the finest comforts in life. Ralph Fiennes plays the bourgeois concierge completely straight and, yet, is the source of most laughs in this comedy and is wonderful to watch. The rest of the film is a who's who of well-known actors in fully realized idiosyncratic character performances. Expect to see Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, among others we've grown accustomed in a Wes Anderson film, though I won't ruin the surprise.When you look at the film in parts it is masterful. The visuals and sets are luxuriously stunning, beyond anything you could imagine and a dream. The acting is top notch and characters intriguing. The story is entertaining and funny and especially unique. The music by Alexandre Desplat is charming and complementary. And yet, I feel as though the film doesn't come together as Mr. Anderson wished.Wes Anderson films tend to be rife with characters and plot lines. The Grand Budapest Hotel jumps from each strand without fully completing or connecting at its conclusion, especially in regard to minor characters.While thoroughly enjoyable and charming as a film, if more time were taken to develop some subplots, remove others, and intertwine the rest, The Grand Budapest Hotel would easily have been one of Wes Anderson's finest creations.More reviews of films new and old can be found at our website!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"The film is just so charming, its just so charming","You have to hand it to Wes Anderson. He certainly has his own style of film. The Grand Budapest is a screwball hybrid of action, adventure, comedy, romance and just about everything else. And after all of those elements are thrown together, its one hell of a film.It might just be the most beautiful film I've ever looked at. The production design, costumes and hair and makeup meld together to create a magical setting that I not only believed in, I wanted to be there. From the violet jacket and neat moustache of Gustave H. to the rainbow of jackets of the Society of the Crossed Keys, from Tilda Swinton's aged makeup to the glorious set design of the Hotel itself, Anderson's film is a feast for the eyes.Ralph Fiennes is without a doubt one of the most unappreciated actors in existence. This performance of his might just be one of his best. His comedic timing is so flawless, his delivery perfect and his demeanour so utterly charming, this is as much his vehicle as Anderson's. He takes traits that Adam Sandler made revolting the most endearing qualities possible, and Anderson's words roll off his tongue with ease and grace. And he is wickedly, wonderfully funny. Young Tony Revolori is the perfect foil for Fiennes, they have wonderful back-and-forth, he is sympathetic and endearing all of his own right. I hope this movie is a big breakthrough for him. As for the rest of the cast, it looks like a list of presenters at the Academy Awards, so they're all obviously talented even if many of them feel underused at times. The fact that none of them stand out says a fair bit.Wes Anderson's screenplay is another huge reason for success. The film wouldn't be able to boast the beautiful visuals or glorious performances. His writing captures Gustave H's glorious mannerisms, the film's eventful adventures and most of all, the beautiful setting of the story. The dialogue in itself is completely delightful, and even the four-tier story setting feels an integral part of the film's feeling, as it allows for F. Murray Abraham and Jude Law to narrate and keep the film's flow.Anderson's screenplay has a major hole at the film's conclusion, where all charges are dropped for no reason, Gustave is exonerated instead of being treated with more suspicion, Madame D.'s killer is never revealed, and Dmitri leaves instead of arcing up even more. One person said to me ""oh I don't care about things like that"" when I first mentioned it, and I have carried incredulity ever since. How is the resolution of the entire plot unimportant? Also grating on me are certain accents - some are blatantly American whereas others are distinctly European.But the film is just so charming, its just so charming. I'm glad the visual feast was recognised at the Oscars, even though Anderson and Fiennes were not. Its funny, somber and utterly delightful, watchable on any occasion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Destined To Be a Classic,"Stunning, Beautiful, Witty and Warm, these would be only a few words of which describe the grandeur of ;The Grand Budapest Hotel' a story told retrospectively by a writer whom found himself being a told a retrospective story himself.From the bold acting of M. Gustave and the star studded cast with each vibrant roles, makes this film beautiful. I found myself watching it several times as Wes Anderson's use of camera techniques and story telling are tremendous. The use of Cinema is often wasted in the hands of directors where a big budget will leave you feeling unsatisfied or tithe you over for two hours. However, This work of art gives cinema a new meaning, a classic meaning. More art lesser the mindless action. Each scene belongs and feels like time and creativity was put into it.Too many times have I watched a film and been left cheated from my money. Not these title though. It was a story that I loved and still do.Would I recommend this title?Yes, In a heart beat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Frivolous and visually astounding, fun and funny and still restrained","The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)Stunning at every turn, and yet...well...it lacks something, too, that left me happy but unsatisfied.As usual with a Wes Anderson movie, the amazing sets and set design win the day. Sometimes this combines with a little magic in a movie to lift the result up beautifully, as in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (which I loved). Here there are certainly moments that work but many others that simply reside. The main character played by Ralph Fiennes is wonderfully proper and funny.Plot? A forced fairy tale of a story keeps the narration moving through several distinct parts, but the main idea is that an old man is explaining to a younger patron of the dying hotel how he came to own it. And those events happened to him as a bellboy back when the hotel was truly grand. The fact this is narrated is part of the package, but it keeps everything at that distance Anderson prefers.What it lacks oddly is magic, the one thing a fairy tale like this demands. There are lots of deliberate (and good) clichés at work—a stolen painting, a mysterious patron, an unexplained death—and there is the scene itself, this glorious old hotel both in its seedy later years and in its heyday. And though there are delights, and witty lines, at every turn, there is a feeling of just watching it, never quite getting involved. Maybe that's deliberate, but if so, it still left me a bit restless at times.What about all the stars in this overpacked cast? Well, you can tell they are in it for the pleasure of it, taking on comic book kinds of roles. But there is a disappointment there, too, because too often it seems that each star appears for their own sake, and her or his fame, not for the edge it gives their character. The most obvious case is Bill Murray, who appears in a dull role for all of about 20 seconds of screen time. At the other extreme is Willem Defoe, who is delectably evil all through in his major role. Jude Law makes a decent foil (listener) to the narrator, played well enough by F. Murray Abraham, but both men never shine. They sit and talk, after all.And so it goes. Which takes us back to the sets. Wow. Unbelievable at every turn. The hotel is superb, and likewise the expansive mansion of the murdered woman, and likewise even the train car which appears more than once. It's a wonderfully made movie on all these technical levels, including some flashy, tricky photography that is playful in its wide and then close views. See it? Sure, if you are predisposed. There no hating this movie, for sure. Which is high praise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Gripping,"Colourful, shocking (in more ways than you would think but not gratuitously), amusing, entertaining, beautiful, thoughtful, inspiring - what more could you want from a movie? This film has all these features and more. It really is a tour de force of great story telling, incredible production values, superb acting and finely tuned directing. Tilda Swinton is absolutely fabulous as the grand Dame whose demise causes all the drama to unfold. Action packed, 'mythical' and grimly realistic in equal measure this sure is a 'fairy tale' for modern times. It's worth seeing once, twice and many more times there is so much to take in. A classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Might have worked better as stop-action animation,"I really liked Bottle Rocket and Moonrise Kingdom, and I appreciate the warmth and humor of Rushmore. I've also seen most of Wes Anderson's other feature films, but they didn't engage me anywhere near as much as those three. Grand Budapest, unfortunately, is another also-ran. It seems more like a cartoon than a story about people. It presents caricatures instead of characters and make-believe instead of history. I do enjoy stylized films and TV, but extreme artificiality only works for me if it plays off something honest and real. Grand Budapest, however, is a cold and mechanical film: a caper of sorts, with a surfeit of chase scenes and narrow escapes. It might have been a ballet danced by wind-up toys. Although we glimpse dozens of beloved stars flitting across the screen, the effect is more like celebrities voicing animated images than an ensemble cast bringing events to life. (At least it wasn't in 3D!) I'd like to see the talented Mr. Anderson return to making movies about actual breathing people. Presenting misfits struggling to find their place in the world is what he's always done best. Maybe the idea of Grand Budapest started out that way, but that's not where it ended up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Same old Same old,"Wes Anderson is undoubtedly one of the finest directors we have working today, and this is very much evident throughout the span of his latest film The Grand Budapest Hotel. His choice of adjusting the screen format, his color pallets and sleek cinematography are what save this movie from being a flop. Yes, it is great directing. Yes the performances, especially Ralph Fiennes, are top notch. This is a decent movie, but decent is where it stops. It doesn't have anything to separate itself from previous quirky and dark humor filled films that Wes Anderson has released, it doesn't have the heart from Moonrise Kingdom, the charisma of The Fantastic Mr. Fox, or the mystique from The Darjeeling Limited. Yes, every director may have their own styles and tweak it differently for each of their works, but Wes Anderson only adds some minor plot differences to his films to make them slightly ""different,"" yet still far too similar. I have been fine with them in the past, but by The Grand Budapest Hotel, his fourth main entry, the goofy style becomes a little tedious and actually difficult to get through in some scenes. Many trivial things are presented as important matter in drawn out sequences, making it all the more difficult to watch. Yes, I am harshly bad mouthing this movie, but I did still find some enjoyment in watching the gorgeous film making and the once in while funny script, but come the third act, all the twists just become much too predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying. I hope Wes Anderson has something up his sleeve that can add variety into his collection, because my patience level for this is slowly declining. GRADE: C",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Glad I checked into The Grand Budapest,"Wes Anderson is really consistent with crafting extremely well-made films. His awesome attention to detail and how he shoots his movies won me over with Moonrise and now, with, GBH I'm convinced Wes Anderson is one of the best, original directors we have today. There's a lot going on in this movie: A girl is visiting a memorial and reading a book by a Nameless Author. Meanwhile, the Author narrates this book for us about a lonely hotel owner who then tells the Author a story about his start as a young Lobby Boy being trained by the then hotel concierge. There's a painting theft, a ski chase, a great and suspenseful museum foot chase. This movie is on through the entire time. When it's not giving you a scene filled with great dialog from it's wonderful cast, you're admiring the typically beautiful set design. The script does a great job of using each setting in the movie and throwing in some surprisingly intense sequences. That museum scene is my favorite and there's awesomely shot shootout at the end that kind acts as a cherry on top of the sundae. The dream team cast is near perfect, as with all Wes Anderson movies. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant and carries the movie IMO, any man that can go from the evil Dark Lord to leading a comedy and nailing it is aces in my book. There's a lot of cool smaller roles, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum stand out. Again this film is technically flawless as well. The cinematography and music fit well and direction is perfect. I easily recommend a purchase for Wes Anderson and film fans. Casual movie goers might enjoy a rental.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Quirky and brilliantly unique,"What I loved most about this film was its quirky nature-it felt almost like I was being read a book and this was what my imagination was seeing. The storyline was cleverly put and I loved how it occasionally switched from present day to the main storyline. The poetry was an interesting touch, although I found it remarkably funny how the swearing just popped up every now and then, adding an altogether different twist to the film. Whilst I don't wish to spoil anything for others reading this review that have yet to watch the film, I think that the combination of mystery, slight romance and fast-pace led to an altogether unique experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. A brilliant storyline and a film that I would definitely recommend to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"Quirky, witty and a lot of fun!","I'm not going to go into much detail on the storyline as I don't want to ruin anything; I will simply state the reasons why I enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel.Gustave H is an eccentric, colourful, well established hotel concierge who runs the Grand Budapest Hotel using his own quirky style and approach. He has a lobby boy named Zero Mustafa who he works alongside. Before long the two of them are swept into a series of events that bring them closer, turning them from concierge and lobby boy into loyal friends.The Grand Budapest Hotel is directed by Wes Anderson, meaning that it is going to have a Wes Anderson style quirky twist. People have criticised this movie for this, stating that it is trying too hard to be different, I don't agree with this at all. Yes it is different, yes it is quirky and eccentric but it is magical in its own deserved right. It sucked me into the setting and made me feel much immersed in the movie. The Cinematography is faultless, many scenes are filmed on a back drop that is designed to look like a painting, there are scenes that look gimmicky and there are scenes that feel as if you are watching it in a live play! But these are the reasons that The Grand Budapest Hotel is so enjoyable to watch! The humour is fantastic, it is incredibly witty, and the timing of the punch lines and the use of foul language is done splendidly. Ralph Fiennes who plays Gustave H, the hotel concierge is an incredibly likable and well-presented character. His lobby boy, Zero Mustafa is equally as pleasant and their on screen chemistry grows from nothing in the beginning into a real on screen treat. The supporting cast are also very well picked and they all play their character roles equally well, many of which are well- known faces such as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Bill Murray and Jude Law.If you were the split the film into three sections of beginning, middle and end, and were to compare the pace of the film I would say that it dips in the middle section. It starts off fantastically, you are introduced to the characters in a staggered routine and this keeps you hooked, waiting for who is to come next and what role they are to play. The middle does slow down a little and some of the scenes don't live up to the beginning section. It is still entertaining and kept me hooked, but because the beginning was so strong I think the middle seemed deflated because of this. In my opinion It felt slower paced, the two main characters were shown less screen time during this period and I think the film suffered a little because of this. It did however pick up in the final third and the pace was similar to that of the opening part. It ended strongly and left me very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.The Grand Budapest Hotel succeeds due to great direction, cinematography, script and humour. Its characters are fantastic and some of my favourite characters that I have seen in recent films are on display here. The film is only 90 minutes long but this doesn't stop some impressive character development. I can appreciate that this movie isn't for everyone and it has suffered some poor reviews because of this, but in my opinion it was much better than I was expecting and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has since been nominated for Best Picture and I wouldn't argue with that one bit.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson's Masterpiece,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a brilliant film by Wes Anderson and probably his greatest. There is no other directior that has a more distinctive style than him, so only he can handle this film perfectly. It's very entertaining to watch, and not only is this a nostalgic throwback to the 1930s but also a charming and nice story that gives justice to the source material.In 1932 in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, The once famous hotel called the Grand Budapest owned by the legendarily funny and interesting Gustave. H. The person who plays Gustave H., is probably one of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a movie, he's funny, rude, mysterious, and hilarious, he should have been nominated for an Oscar. And the immigrant lobbyboy Zero is also very funny and interesting. They both form a friendship as the movie progresses. Gustave's girlfriend dies tragically so, he goes pays respect, but her family is evil and rude, so he and Zero steal a very important Oil painting. And then the movie becomes an action adventure, and things get Tarantino-style violent.The reason why the characters are obsessed with the oil painting is because it's the only thing in the movie that isn't Wes Anderson style. BTW Wes really gets carried away with the symmetrical framing and warm colors, but that's what I love about his movies, his movies are original and creative.The actors who play Gustave and Zero do respective jobs, but we also get equally hilarious performances from Adrian Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Willam Defoe, Edward Norton, the list goes on.This film looks like an oil painting. Brilliant work of art.Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
All style no substance,"Much like the protagonist in the story, the film is all style no substance. For some reason, whenever I go to see a movie in the theater I eat a large bag of candy and a huge soda, I don't do this anywhere else in life but for this movie it was strangely fitting. At first, when watching Grand Budapest, It was Visually appealing and indeed Anderson may have missed his true calling as a premiere interior designer for the European aristocracy, as each scene is set up perfectly. My problem with the movie, and all Andersons movie's post Rushmore for that matter, is you don't really walk away from the films having gained anything as far as insight into life, or rewarding feeling you may have after let's say watching Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" which was layered. Sure, GBH was pretty to look at, and it is fun to see all the great actors (mostly used as props in the same way the villains 1932 Sara lea motorcycle was used) but when leaving the theater this time I felt a bit sick after, and I'm not sure it was completely the fault of eating the large bag of candy and sugary soda, in fact I felt more sick than I usually do after leaving the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

And I'm sorry but I have to point out the whole snow board chase scene like that editing had me dead it was so unexpected and funny to me.

Flashy Without a Cause,"The opulence of the sets, the accumulation of famous actors and the twirling camera movements are evidence of this. This grandiloquent pomp is nevertheless put at the service of a rather light story, whose threads will have been unwound with more panache and originality in countless films, novels or fanfics. It is as flashy as a bad taste painting, but above all, it is as stiff as a compassed dandy. All the paintings in the film seem to be stuck in a mixture of starch and mothballs. Despite the virtuoso camera movements that are mostly ham-handed, each shot is empty, dehumanized, sad to tears.

A Masterpiece From Beginning to End,"Sometimes, if you want to know if certain films are worth watching, you have to rely on which cast is involved. Great actors are usually into great projects. This case is no different. The cast is outstanding, and the list is long, from F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, Jude Law, the always brilliant Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, and so on and so forth. And then Ralph Fiennes, complete king of the show, simply spectacular in every bit of it. Wes Anderson, who directed ""Life Aquatic""( 2004), or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001) is back with this little big project. And it is so because it is an intimate story, yet embedded in a large scale game play, a massive project from an artistic point of view; every character and event is paramount in this little poem. This ""Chinese box"" kind of filmmaking, a story within a story, is what Anderson uses to tell us this tale. It is a classic literary device, and like in literature, it might involve the same issue, namely the narrator reliability, (though in the film the veracity of the events is emphasized), so everything could be a wild imagination from the narrator, which may be even better for the purpose of the whole thing. I'm sticking with the latter, because at the end of the day, a good story is a good story, whether it is more or less believable, right? A writer (Jude Law) begins this tale, telling us how in his young days, he stayed in the decadent ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", and met the owner, Mr. Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham), who will tell him how he acquired the hotel, back in the glorious days.What can we highlight in this movie? The cast is amazing, such a bunch of superstars, all of them inspired and enjoying the show. Photography is great, colors, lighting, everything...there is an important amount of detail in production, from the hotel itself in its different stages to the wardrobe, music, visuals and introduction of each chapter. The pace is pitch perfect, a seamless tale that even in a sequence of flashbacks keep the whole together, and so do the actors, follow the lead of Anderson in a way that every single character, every line is nailed, both in performance and rhythm. That is writing, in this case a screenplay, and definitively, that is filmmaking at its best. This is the best Anderson movie so far, is cohesive, compact, it is a exquisite piece of work, both in form and content, his masterpiece. Honestly, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a must-see, a film I strongly recommend not only because of its quality, but because it reminds us that there is always, always a story worth telling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

I am not revealing anything to you , its just the sheer work of absolute brilliant filmmaking and the extraordinary idea of creating a mind boggling effect by putting three different screen ratios for three different era's. the screen ratios are perfect and have absolutely well blended with the different cinematography and production design used in this film.

Why the hate?,"This movie, this particular movie is something I'll never forget. Sure, the plot was not earth-shaking, no giant robots punching each other in their mechanical faces, no grand romances with sexy blondies in skintight leather suits but like hell it needs these!I'm not at all a movie junkie, and I've walked into this one blindly, not expecting much (Wes Anderson? Sure, like I care). And I wasn't mistaken, it wasn't much. But what it was, simply brilliant. Camera movement, music (oh the music...), the colours, the simple yet entertaining plot, characters... A joke it was, dramatic parts spiced with comedy, even though it was somewhat dark, I couldn't wipe the smug smile off my face.People interested in great romances, tragic betrayals, ""depth"", ""insight"" and such are lost, there is nothing for them here.

An Instant Classic,"The central characters in Wes Anderson's films have always had a deep and inextricable connection to the places they love: Max Fischer had Rushmore; Royal Tenenbaum had the house on Archer Avenue; Steve Zissou had his ship, the Belafonte. Despite their usually roguish natures, these connections hint at some kind of deep sadness and longing beneath their charismatic facades. For them, these places are more than houses and boats and boarding schools—they represent something friendly and welcoming. They know that the world can be a cruel, cruel place and all they can really ask for from life is somewhere to call home—a sanctuary. For M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) of Anderson's remarkable new film, the titular location of The Grand Budapest Hotel is just that.Largely set in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka, the film uses four distinct time lines, each filmed in a different aspect ratio and colour palate precisely layered together. The first takes place in present day, and features a young girl walking through a garden to reach the tomb of an accomplished writer. Next is a flashback, in which the the writer talks directly to the audience about a time in the past when he visited the hotel. The third follows him in the 1960s, a young man at the time, through the hotel—a fading relic of a once vibrant and glorious past. There, he meets owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who tells him of the hotel's history and the hyper- competent concierge, Gustave, who is its main attraction. The final and longest time line picks up in 1932 and follows Gustave and Zero, now an inexperienced lobby boy, as Gustave inherits a priceless renaissance-era painting after an elderly socialite with whom he was sleeping is murdered under mysterious circumstances. What follows is a deft blend of genres—caper, murder mystery, prison break, and screwball comedy being the most recognizable.At the centre of the story is M. Gustave, a typical Andersonian hero. He's witty, gregarious, and empathetic. He is also, for lack of a better word, quirky: he recites romantic poetry to his employees, wears a liberal amount of perfume, and has a near god-like ability to anticipate the needs of his guests. What sets him apart from other Anderson characters, however, is his edge: he drinks, gets into fights, and relishes in the use of well-delivered profanity. In turn, this makes his sympathetic qualities stand out much more. He, above all else, understands that the unkindness of people comes from fear or institutional obligation rather than hatred. He is portrayed brilliantly by Fiennes, who adds a human sadness to this incredibly touching role, while seeming to have the most fun of his career.Filling out the rest of the cast is the usual cavalcade of Anderson actors—Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson all get minor roles—and seemingly every established character actor alive, including Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton—in spectacular old-age makeup —and Tom Wilkinson to name just a few. Deserving special attention is newcomer Tony Revolori as Zero. He brings a nervous energy to the film that works as a counterpoint to Gustave's ever-composed nature.The film also features some of Anderson's most experimental camera-work. He moves the camera beyond his usual whip-pans and tracking shots to create some of the most dazzling, empathetic filmmaking I've seen in recent memory. One particular standout shot features Zero's love interest, Agatha, looking directly at the camera with swirling lights around her head, representing the dizzying high of young love. He also uses his common techniques to great effect: every shot is beautifully and meticulously composed, and the script supplies a steady stream of locations for him to showcase his talent – a museum, a mansion, a prison, and especially, the hotel—all rendered in a high level of minute detail and shot in a distinct cinematographic style.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fun romp with a complex, emotional centre and is not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

I wasn't aware this was a Wes Anderson film at first (busy lately, a bit behind on current events), but it was immediately apparent once the film started. Some of the visuals are really quite nice, but the pacing made the film kind of numbing. The humor felt flat and detached, and I was often more aware of the actors rather than the characters they played. That's not to say the performances were off, but more that some of them were a little distracting. This often happens (for me)when a large number of famous actors play small parts. I might have been more interested and entertained if the feel of the movie wasn't so predictably stylized.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson Presents: Another Acquired Taste,"You honestly have to view the breadth of Anderson's work to understand ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". It feels very much like a relatively over-the-top climax of every bit of the man's artistic desires. As if every last thing he wanted fell into place, alongside the pertinent inspiration and a willing audience. An acquired audience.Many will watch this film and, sooner or later, wonder why they're watching it. These people are not the target audience. Others, in turn, will watch the film and understand within the first ten minutes exactly why they're watching it, and will observe with keen interest Anderson's grand vision of the Grand Budapest and the many overtly and/or subtly intriguing characters surrounding it.For my money, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" remains Anderson's finest moment, but I cannot take away from the merits of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". Ralph Fiennes is, in quality and quantity, the featured actor of the film, and does an outstanding job as the excessively eccentric M. Gustave. His constant companion is a young lobby boy, Zero, played with a quiet, reserved charm by Tony Revolori. The cast is rounded out by many big names, each with parts of varying significance and, despite the overall positive results, varying intrigue. I personally regret the brief time we get to spend with Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson, Jude Law and Harvey Keitel. While most of the cast fits into their roles nicely, the occasional head-scratcher remains. Murray's role is perhaps the most obvious.So, the acting is excellent. Working with Anderson's vision, everything merges together smoothly. The cinematography, a long-standing hallmark of Anderson's films, is breathtaking, truly the heart and soul of the film. The plot is flimsy, but that is ultimately the center of the acquired taste; if you can overlook a flimsy plot to appreciate the other two-thirds of film foundation (acting, atmosphere), then you'll have no problem enjoying the Budapest.It doesn't surprise me that this movie has received so much praise. It also doesn't surprise me that it's received so much indifference, displeasure and/or disgust. As usual, Wes Anderson remains far enough outside the widest reaching circles of film making to inherently create a ""love/hate"" offer to viewers with each successive film. While not all of his work has been loved by myself, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" certainly is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Previous films by Wes Anderson were funnier, but the story was losing its interest after an hour or so. Here we have a story who's holding it all the way. It's impossible not to laugh even when M. Gustave is in jail. It's well written. In the end, the most interesting part of the film is the cast. Every member of it is good, and a lot of them are really great.

"funny and engaging, but it may just need to grow on me over time","Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, a tale of an old-lady womanizer (Ralph Fiennes, the reason if nothing else to see the film) who is accused of murder and up against an evil son and set in the backdrop of a fake-but-sorta-real European landscape in the mid 1930's, is at its best when it evokes a comparative feeling through its style that may or may not have anything to do with the film itself.This I mean is the passage of time for cinema, as its in three times (30s, late 60s, briefly mid 80s) and had three different aspect ratios, largely shot in 1:33 (the square, not the widescreen rectangle for you laymans) And at this, of course, the film is always a pleasure to look at. That's a given for Anderson. His work here is especially colorful, every hue pops and shines even in that few minutes where it's Black and White on the train, and Fiennes and company are game to play along...Yet, ultimately, I felt maybe a little-sorta let down following the one two punch of Fantastic Mr Fox and Moonrise Kingdom. Though a lot happens in Budapest hotel and its oozing period detail (both real Euro and made up), it's ultimately a bug-eyed cartoon and only two main males, Gustav and his bell-boy-turned-surrogate-son Zero, have two dimensions with everyone else with one. And of course Willem Dafoe looks cool in black leather on a motorcycle (unintentional homage to his debut in the Loveless mayhap crossed with a second tier bond villain ?) and the music is sweet and catchy.I just didn't see the characters having enough depth for me to care that much past the facade Anderson has made up. As with Fox and Life Aquatic to an extent, this is a world where many times you'll see this world created in the hotel and out as a diorama, and all Anderson and his cameraman shoot it impeccably. maybe, this time, TOO impeccably, for me. It gets to the point where even in its controlled pov you''ll know where the cameras going to move, who will be where, even what they'll probably say, filled with witty and sometimes very funny jargony speech.And at the end of it all it's fun to watch, has a look that is unlike anything at the movies right now, and has the sort of bittersweet ending Anderson has made a hallmark of his career. It just doesn't stick with me and prod at me like the director does when he gives characters with firmer consequences at hand. And yes I know this story is in the backdrop of a (pre) war environment and involves falsely accused murder (if one must give the highest comparative praise, think the cultural refinery in Renoirs 30s pics with a Hitchcock yarn also from the 30s). But... too many characters, all drawn with broad strokes, and just when you think you're getting a handle on one like Ronans character shell slip away from the movie so long that the motivations get mixed up.Recommended for being the work of a master stylist (And Jeff Goldblum cause he's who he is) but not recommended if you want a movie with something to say, which after Moonrise and Tenenbams and bottle rocket, I know the man's capable of. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
fellini on acid,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those rare gems ~ visually stunning, fabulous narrative and flawless characterization - oh and the sounds! in my opinion a perfect film. I have never taken the time before to write a review. I am doing so for this film.It will win Oscars. Everything about this film is an experience of light and sound and storytelling. It is magnificent.It is not fair for me to try and point out who is in it and who says what. just watch the movie. it's amazing.If you have just seen it and like me don't check IMDb until after I have watched - then I am quite sure you agree with me.if you are the person who checks IMDb before watching a film - then you are in for a wonderful ride. enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Had a grand old time,"I haven't really seen much of his other works (except Fantastic Mister Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums that I can't remember) so I can't judge this film compared to his previous ones. I can however judge that I had a grand old time watching Grand Budapest Hotel at the theatre. Stylistically, it was a triumph. It seemed almost every frame was filmed at right angles (90 degrees) - either facing the camera, left profile, right profile, back or from the top - with a few exceptions. I personally don't like when actors talk directly to the camera as so often happens here, but I didn't mind it this time. It even created a weird sense of intimacy. There was also a noticeable amount of rectangles and squares in the meticulously constructed frames with very little camera movement in those frames. It was like a succession of tableaux and, for lack of better expression, geometrically inspired and fascinating. The use of the bright colors, how they matched, was also stupendous, making for gorgeous scenes.So, it is a joy to look at from an artistic and technical point of view, but how about the story and the characters? It takes place in a fictional eastern-European country, probably inspired by Germany, and is mostly a very long flashback. The story revolves around Mr. Gustave, the eccentric but very competent concierge of a luxurious hotel, read general manager, and Zero, a lobby boy of foreign origin. Without going into details, a favoured customer dies, Gustave inherits something important that causes him tons of trouble. Contrary to what one might think, most of the film doesn't take place in the Grand Budapest Hotel. I usually don't like flashbacks, but I enjoyed very much how the outrageous, sometimes ridiculous story was told, even with the narration. However, the plot was mostly a backdrop to introduce a plethora of fun, colorful characters played by very famous actors clearly relishing their roles. Some were played deadly serious, others a little over the top, but what a great cast and very enjoyable acting. Of particular note were Ralph Fiennes playing the distinguished and multi-faceted Gustav, Jeff Goldblum playing an honest, very articulate lawyer, and Wilhem Dafoe as a criminal goon, but your favorites might vary. For me, the newcomer playing the lobby boy seemed a bit out of his depth acting-wise, but he was not too distracting and even good sometimes.The movie has a nostalgic feel to it and was quite funny despite being bittersweet. It has a strong energy and was never boring despite lots of mostly talking scenes. I found it particularly amusing whenever Gustave lost control of his distinguished manners and language. Most of the humor came from the clever writing, a few visual gags, and some ridiculous situations. Some might be put off by the obviously fake nature of certain decors and things (scale models), but I think it's probably a trademark of the director and I found those charming. Grand Budapest Hotel was a delight to experience and I would definitely visit it again.Rating: 8.5 out of 10 (remarquable)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A delight,"At the same time as the Coens have hit a snag in visual imagination and the ability to roam freely, Wes Anderson soars. This has all the lithe irreverence of early Coens, the paradox of Lubitsch, with the self-reference of Greenaway back when he was still making ripples.The structure could be out of Greenaway and tuned to much the same purpose, nested fiction so that we can move to a broader view of life that includes the stage where it acts its dramas - narrators nested within narrators, a girl reading a book by an author who narrates about an encounter he had with another narrator, who narrates over dinner about his escapades with a master storyteller caught in a fiction.Deep down it's the encounter with this master storyteller that matters, a concierge in a hotel, superficially frilly at first sight, but someone we come to realize who cultivates the entire space of the hotel with a storyteller's affection for the contours of duplicitous life, who knows when to gently hover, when to anticipate and direct, when to throw himself earnestly in the creation of memorable f(r)iction for his elderly patrons.The fiction he's caught in and sends him to prison and eventually all the way up to a monastery in the Alps is where he's framed by greedy relatives for murder. Its own commentary on art and narrative that again recalls the sardonic best of Greenaway in Draughtsman - the storyteller framed by boorish patrons who can only imagine a boorish story, lecherous gigolo exploiting vulnerable old women. We know from our position as viewers that he was a character in a fiction spun for her enjoyment and thrill (and his profit of course), but spun in earnest, with genuine care.And this is what Anderson does as storyteller of the whole thing. Spinning obvious fiction shown to be artificial on all sides (one that we enter through a book), but doing it with earnest love for the snowflakes of truth he can elicit on every step. I find here a succulent love between human beings that I first admired in the teenage romance of his Moonrise - as dry and static was Life of Zissou, so much richer these last two films have been.On the whole I'm beaming after this, which I saw twice in as many days. It's such a pleasure to watch Anderson bloom in this way - this is surely his mature period and after the sublime Moonrise he's become for me one to cherish and keep an eye on.The controlled symmetries have been toned down, they're still here, but gone is the coffee shop lassitude, replaced by a dynamic asymmetry first introduced in Moonrise - between what we see and what what is narrated or what we imagine, like the image of prisoners feet dancing in air above the sleeping wardens, a poetic image that hovers for a brief second until the next one explains it. There's a magnetic pace here that comes as a result of paradoxically dismantling expectation - Lubitsch. This along with how music is melded to it merits its own viewing.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
An immaculate cake with a hollow centre,"Wes Anderson's films are immaculately planned and executed, particularly when it comes to art direction, set design and costumes. If you can relinquish yourself to the intricate worlds he creates and ask only to be entertained, you're unlikely to walk away unsatisfied. Which probably explains why I always feel slightly cheated walking out of his incredibly imaginative, flawlessly executed gems—they seem slightly hollow.To me, ""Bottle Rocket,"" despite its flaws, captured a reality and a complexity that I don't believe Wes has delivered since. Don't get me wrong, I love the unique style and quirky cast of characters that he's generated since ""Rushmore."" I honestly just wish that I could care more, that I connected more with the characters.As a point of comparison, I highly recommend Aki Kaurismaki, who also creates stylised worlds with interesting characters, but with more humanity. He never fails to make you laugh or cry, but most of all, leaves you thinking about the film after it's over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Off the Wall Delightful,"It's so nice to have a movie that is knock-down drag-out hilarious. From the beginning foray, telling us about how the hotel came to be, all of its history, and the introduction of the cast of characters, the delightful episodic delivery, it reminded me to some extent of those spectacular comedies of the sixties and seventies: ""The Great Race"" and ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."" What transpires is Ralph Fiennes' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth. One reviewer talked about it not making any money. If that's the case it means that a whole bunch of viewers have passed up a gem.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Visual Perfection,"I watched The Grand Budapest Hotel knowing that it would be a whole new cinematographic experience. Wes Anderson is a true genius when it comes to visual aesthetic; the hotel's decor is splendid, with plenty of small details in the background that I couldn't take my eyes of.This movie clearly has the Wes Anderson's signature, the story telling, the dialogs, the story's rhythm, the costumes... everything is clearly from his unique universe. So if you are like me me a big fan of Moonrise Kingdom or The Royal Tenenbaums, the Grand Budapest Hotel is a must-seen.The originality of the plot comes from this peculiar journey you're getting into. It is a bit of a thriller, with a murder case to solve, a bit of a love story, with the young love between Zero and Agatha, friendship and loyalty are also important themes that make the movie full of humanity. All of these aspects are told through characters that are colorful and truly appealing, the ensemble's acting is right on spot. One of the best cast this year.All in all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a poetic journey, I couldn't find anything negative about it, even the soundtrack is perfect.

Hotel Business,"If you are about to watch a Wes Anderson movie, you should know what you are letting yourself into. The quirky, offbeat, weird and somewhat unpredictable nature of his movies, will either be a draw or a setback.

Normally I'd think I'm not telling you anything new, but then again, you just might not have seen any of his movies (yet).The cast is more than stellar, even in the smaller roles inhabited here. And it's not so much about the story, than it is about things happening. While this also tends to have a violent side to it, it's the dialog that will hopefully entice you and keep the ""tension"" high.

The Grand Budapest Hotel is a grand time,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of 2014 and perhaps one of the most skilfully made films of all time.

It has amazing character descriptions and development. Interesting story and different tensions and comedic moments.The climax is utterly one of the most thrilling, yet hilarious, of all time.

Less Wes?,"The plot in Anderson's newest movie starts in 1968, at a hotel which was once luxurious, but has few guests now.

Gustave. He took good care of the guests in the 30s. In some ways a little too good for his own safety.OK.

Unbelievable,"I am thoroughly shocked and dismayed that this movie received so many nominations at the Oscars. My whole family hated this movie. The movie is filled with nothing but quirky and whimsical scenes that do not develop the characters or even provide a storyline. Essentially, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" uses the same technique but a different location from previous movies by Wes Anderson. I used to take the angry and critical comments about Oscar-nominated or -awarded movies with a grain of salt, since I could see some value in many nominated movies in the past. Now I have absolutely no faith in the Oscar nomination process since they clearly want to pick and choose movie makers who do something ""different"" with their movies. It reminds me of the fable of the emperor with no clothes. I know that I will always avoid any movies made by Wes Anderson in the future.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Not a Tripadvisor review,"Wes Anderson had made a delightful offbeat art house film that never outstays its hospitality. It has a stamp of an assured filmmaker, confident of his eccentric style.Mr Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) recounts to a writer (Jude Law) his tale of the now faded Grand Budapest Hotel over dinner.In 1932, the Grand Budapest Hotel was epitome of decadent and luxury somewhere in Eastern Europe. Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) a refugee started out as a newly hired lobby boy. He is taken under the wing of the eccentric concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes.)Gustave in effect runs the hotel and attends to the personal needs to some of the older ladies who stay in the hotel such as Madame D (Tilda Swinton.) When she dies, Gustave is bequeathed a valuable painting. Her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is far from pleased with this. Gustave is accused of the old lady's murder and Dmitri's henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe) makes sure any irritant is disposed off quickly.Wes Anderson has directed a whimsical and absurd black comedy with a camp performance from Fiennes that has a startling odour. It was a shame that he was not Oscar nominated. There are cameos from Anderson regulars such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Edward Norton. The story can get dark and murderous at times, it has an underlying sadness. You see proto fascists who demand to see papers of all the travellers on a train.

The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun! (Spoiler free review),I went in to this movie not knowing anything about its plot or story. I only knew it was about the adventures of some hero from a Budapest Hotel. Honestly I didn't think this movie was going to be any good since its plot wasn't that much interesting but I though I'd give it a try since it was the only movie from the 2015 Oscars highlights I didn't saw. Now I can say that I was not wrong because this movie succeeds as a comedy with some absurd scenes that had me laughing very hard and with characters that are really well done. Aside from that this movie in my opinion had some issues. Mainly the story is very weird told and I was bored for most of the movie although I understood the main thing of the movie and this whole adventure Gustavo and Zero had. The movie never emphasised the characters who were important to the story... I get the movie had to be absurdly funny but you need to catch the viewer's attention with a plot that can be followed and interesting and characters that are introduced properly. I was continuously asking myself who's this? Who's that? Because the movie's story went on like I was supposed to know who those characters were. But putting that aside there were things I liked like the absurd humor that sometimes had me laughing very hard and the way the movie was constructed. It's been told like a multi-layered story that goes from present to the past with 4 levels of story which made it really interesting in that perspective. Apart from that there were some extremely well done scenes and the movie as a whole was very colorful with some of the best cinematography (I honestly would have given the oscar for cinematography to this movie not to Birdman) although I literally can't understand how Interstellar was not nominated that year. Overall a funny movie with some interesting characters and a multi-layered story and absurd humor. 9/10.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Continental room service, the way it should be.","THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTELMssr. Gustave H. (Ralph Fieness)is the concierge of the Grand Budapest Hotel in 1932. It is a grand edifice indeed, an ancient artifact of 19th century Imperial Europe, as are most of the clientele including a number of dowagers of various title and status. They go there to reminisce about the good old days of dukes, earls, counts and princes, but mostly they go there because of the ""exceptional service"" provided to them by M. Gustave H.Those of you that have a dirty mind will find it an appropriate tool in this particular case.One of these ladies, Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) is so taken by M. Gustave H's ""service"" that a valuable painting is to go to him when she dies, which shortly and conveniently she does. This beneficent bequest causes much consternation to her family heirs. Principle among them is her son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and his hired thug J.G. (Willem Dafoe). These two should find a comfortable home in the oncoming fascist takeover of Europe as together they elaborately plot to frame M. Gustave H for murder .And let the adventure begin!Together with his apprentice and protégé Zero (wonderfully done by Tony Revlori) they will encounter art theft, gunplay, cold blooded murder, jail breaks, Nazis, a ski chase like we haven't seen since James Bond, a network of conciergery (if there is such a word, I wouldn't try it in Words with Friends) with apparent super powers well beyond the Fantastic Four; and German pastry to die for.Sound absurd? It is. It is at times cartoonish maybe even silly with slapstick and sight gags to accentuate the absurdist dialogue and action. It is an existential comedy that would either make Sartre turn over in his grave or stand up and cheer. I would hope it would be the latter, although I have never detected much of a sense of humor in Sartre.To continue further with this absurdist binge, this movie, with its distinct European sensibilities, was written and directed by that good ole' boy Texan Wes Anderson. (Academy Award Nomination, screenplay)Do you recall William Hurt's character in ""The Big Chill"" stating glumly and pessimistically the existential lament that ""Let's face it, we're all alone out there, and tomorrow we got to do it all over again""? Anderson and Fiennes create in M. Gustave H a character who might say that very same line, only with M.Gutave H, it would be said with enthusiasm and gusto.They have given us a hero with an almost ancient likeness (think Achilles) resourceful, intelligent and courageous; supremely self- confident in his ability to overcome any situation no matter how challenging, dangerous or dire and of course do it with style. It is refreshing that the director and actor bucked the current trend to portray the hero as sociopath.Don't get me wrong I loved Walter White.It is hard to recommend this movie because I'm sure there are some people who won't like it. There is a silliness threshold that has to be overcome, and some of the European custom and mores may be a little hard to take. But if you have problems like that, write your own review, this is mine, and the movie invites you to be whisked along on the ride of M. Gustave H's great adventure. I did and had a great time. I think it one of the best movies of the year, and the Academy apparently agrees nominating it for best picture. I was disappointed that Fiennes was not nominated because for me it was the best performance of the year.By the way, it turns out Sartre was cremated, so I don't know what to do with that metaphor.PS This film has brief but meaningful appearances by Owen Wilson, Bill Murray (always in an Anderson film) Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Kietel, Ed Norton, F. Murray Abraham and other familiar faces, if you like that sort of thing. Well even if you don't like it, they're in it.Please click on my name above to read my other reviews, or check out my blog blognmovies/tumblr",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A Masterpiece! Academy Awards (No Spoilers),"Wes Anderson is one of the most talented and uncommon directors of his generation and in this film he shows that he is he is a very inspirational director. The Film is original and will have you laughing throughout the whole movie and story line is fantastic. The way Wes Anderson can turn such a simple plot into something so unique and wonderfully amazing. The acting in the film is outstanding whoever picked the cast is a genius all the actors are perfect for the characters they play. Ralph Fiennes reminds everyone that he isn't just an evil wizard that has no nose and that he is an actor that can play roles of all characteristics. The character that Ralph Fiennes plays M. Gustave is fantastic, he loves older women and loves to be a lover, he also is very resourceful getting himself out of the most horrendous and daunting situations. Tony Revolori plays Zero a lobby boy which I couldn't imagine being played by anyone else, the way he played this awkward and determined lobby boy was absolutely outstanding. He was perfect for the role. I can see many Academy Award Nominations coming towards this movie and hopefully Ralph Fiennes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Just marvellous!,"The main characteristic of this film is its visual style and charisma. The scenes are rich with nicely combined colours, particularly pastel ones, and symmetries are everywhere. Relationships between characters are fantastic and extremely well written. Dialogues are witty and interwined with funny dark humour. Pure brilliance!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"A zany, finely crafted treat","The Grand Budapest Hotel is eccentric, zany and whimsical- characteristic of the Wes Anderson style of filmmaking. It is also quite delightful. The plot is not some intricately assembled thriller masterpiece, but an outrageous, implausible story with surprising depth. This depth lies with the themes of the film- that of an aristocratic old world eroded by, as Gustave puts it, 'barbarians'. The hotel gradually loses its opulence and luxury because the world is changed- such luxury is no longer fashionable or desirable given the changing economic realities of the time. Funnily enough, the film has some of the same themes as La grande illusion, though told in a more whimsical way. Then film is also very beautifully and stylistically shot- it has the cotton candy colours reminiscent of the works of Jacques Demy, idiosyncratically filmed in an unusual aspect ratio which heightens the eccentricity of the piece. The set design is also without peer- it is elegant and lavish, impeccably appointed, and combined with the saturated cinematography, further detaches us from its realism, making us acutely aware that the film is not meant to be seen through cold, realist eyes. Ralph Fiennes adds to this sense of eccentricity with an astounding performance- often typecast into playing villains, now plays the often comedic lead role, as an endearing concierge who is not afraid to say what is on his mind(like a posh Gordon Ramsay really) but also genuinely enjoys his job(partly because he gets to sleep with rich old women). The film however is too zany for my liking- it does have an engaging story, but it is so pulled back from reality that I cannot appreciate it fully. Indeed Wes Anderson style may not be to everyone's tastes- In this film he leaps and breezes through his films plot, refusing to slow down his film for suspense, action, or anything which does not add to its peculiar style. Regardless, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great film I can see many enjoying, for like the pastry at Mendls, it is beautiful, delicious, and delightful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Another caper for the new millennium,"I can barely bring myself to write a summery of plot. I gave up paying attention after 15 minutes. A hotel employee is framed for the murder of one of the frequenters but none of it is actually essential to the filming of a project that most likely appeals to Wes Anderson fans only.With a pinch of 30's slapstick here and a steal from Burton there, one finds himself a hostage for 2 hours having already paid the admission fee. Familiar faces come and go as the ridiculous and overbearing Anderson antics occupy the screen. Repetition is not a problem here. The jokes are funny only when on certain drugs and the story a mere vehicle that could have been about a snowflake falling in love with a cloud if it would provide the required running time and the opportunity to set a handsome decor. Though Fiennes gives us one of his best performances to date, I wouldn't recommend this juvenile exercise in self-indulgence to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A movie that will go through history as a classic,"When I first seen the TV commercials for this film I was very curious of what it may hold. Here I am, nearly a year after. After watching the film I was certainly impressed and satisfied, for what I seen in the trailers was a peachy movie. Now I see it as a perfect comedy/drama film. This film remains to this day (or the day that this is posted) my favorite movie. Despite its ""perfect"" tone it is truly a amazing film and will go down in history (in my opinion) as one of the greatest films of all time. It was nominated for many awards and if I was to decide, I think that all of them shall be awarded to them. Wes Anderson impressed us all (if not most of us) once again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Sophisticated, beautiful, funny, and bittersweet","Wes Anderson's stunning Grand Budapest Hotel is a treat for the eyes and years. It's visually gorgeous, as well as being witty, dark, and magnificently acted by a huge cast which includes Ralph Fiennes, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, and Willem Dafoe.F. Murray Abraham plays the owner of the Grand Budapest, Zero Moustafa, who tells how it came to be his. In order to do that, he has to tell the story of the concierge, M. Gustave (Fiennes), who befriends Zero when he becomes a lobby boy. Gustave inherits a painting, Boy with Apple, from a wealthy older woman (Tilda Swinton) and, in the midst of a family fight for her fortune, takes off with it. Meantime, the world is entering the war.Anderson has created an amazing universe that is like watching an MGM film with a foreign story back in the '30s, such as Idiot's Delight. It goes back to the days of exquisite service, enormous wealth and privilege, and idyllic beauty.It's also hilariously funny, with Fiennes popping off the one liners and the young Zero (Tony Revolon) keeping a serious face throughout. Many of the scenes, including the ones in the prison, are priceless.There's a dark and poignant undertone to The Grand Budapest Hotel because for all its wild characters and antics, it portrays a way of life that is no more.Everyone is excellent, but Fiennes has the largest role and is fabulous -- elegant, funny, flirtatious, and demonstrating masterful timing. It's really a new side to him -- considering that I saw him do Hamlet on Broadway.Terrific, don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson is going strong!,"Wes Anderson has been steadfastly honing his finesse since the outset of his career starting from BOTTLE ROCKET (1996) when he was only 27, from then, this wunderkind's filmography has flourished healthily, presently he is among the most successful auteur in US indie ground and internationally his fame also balloons with his audience, his eighth feature THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, this year Berlin International Film Festival's opening film (and Grand Jury Prize winner) and a genuine box-office triumph, indicates he is not slowing down in any aspect.Distinctively utilising 3 aspect ratios for three different time-lines, the predominant storyline in the 30s is in the standard academy ratio, Anderson marshals a bevy of distinguished actors to offer his die-hard devotees a resplendent banquet inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig.In a fictional Republic of Zubrowska, located in middle Europe's alpine state, there is the titular hotel, on the cusp of WWII, the concierge Gustave H (Fiennes) and the lobby boy Zero (Revolori) experience a smörgåsbord of incidents fluctuate from an inheritance tumult to a painting theft and to wacky murder cases, from an off-the-wall prison break to a catch-and-chase escapade in a snowfield and finally to a vis-a-vis confrontation in the hotel, it is as kooky as one could ever anticipate in a fashion of Anderson's childlike sophistication, at the same time, the narrative unwinds with absorbing élan in the same class as in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012, 8/10).Anderson's one-of-a-kind varicolored miniatures, opulent design and ingenious compositions again leave his audience in a state of awe and elation, although frequently his back screen projections let the cat out of the reality bag, which vastly has the hallmarks of the standard Hollywood productions, a studio setting grafts on an unconvincing outdoor background.Fiennes is superbly foppish and demonstrates a dynamic interplay with the wide-eyed neophyte Revolori. The pair's friendship is alternately self-consciously comical and heroically heartfelt, Fiennes knows perfectly the timing to deliver his sermon under diverse circumstances, as a dowager-charmer, his lovable goofiness trumps any moral judgment simply because everybody deserves to be happy.Among the massive supporting group, F. Murray Abraham deserves more credits for his compassionate hospitality as the elder Zero in the 1960s and the impassioned narrator (nevertheless how come an Indian boy has metamorphosed into an Arabian grown-up is beyond any explanation); Tilda Swinton is strikingly overshadowed by her old-age make-up although she is always a scene-stealer (even when her character is dead); Saoirse Ronan plays Agatha, the love-interest of Zero, an apprentice of the Mendel bakery who has a Mexico-shaped birthmark on her face, she a plucky girl with a sense of righteousness, a symbol of virtue which falls victim of the impending war; last but not the least, Willem Dafoe spices up his menacing goon with equally-dosed grimness and caricature.Principally Anderson underlays a tale of woe with sufficient verve and vibrant palette, more incredibly, he is perfecting his story-telling technique, as a whole, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is his most mature film to date and rosily beckons that the zenith of Wes Anderson school is manifestly on the horizon now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
it's funny and heartwarming,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a sweet adventure that will warm your heart, wes anderson knows how make a emotional scene even with a cartoony tone and cartoony characters, the acting is great especially with Ralph Fiennes, the way this movie is shot is amazing it's shot like it's in the time period and wes anderson uses the the practical effects used at the time and uses Aspect Ratio that were used at the time, my only problems is that some of the actors are underused like Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton and there was that one scene where there was an old naked woman but thats the only problems with the movie, overall the movie was amazing you will love it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Anderson's unique directing style makes this film stand out above the rest,"Wes Anderson delivers a film that is presented in one of the most unique ways i have seen especially in modern cinema. Everything from the dialogue to the amazingly unique shooting techniques have been carefully thought out and refined to create this comedic and heart felt film. The acting performances were all very distinct and all very well portrayed by the actors. The standout performances being Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, one putting in one of the better performances of his career and the other making himself known to the world with this amazing debut to film. This film had a very different and specific style of humor that is not typically used in modern comedies. This both helped to film but i think also slightly hurt it. It did take a little while to understand the humor the director was going for, but once i did it became more clear how it was being used with the overall plot. The plot was an interesting one that takes you back through time and doesn't spend too long in a single location, which really helps to move the film along quickly and provide a variety of scenery. In the end it is the directing techniques used by Wes Anderson that really make this film shine. - 8.3",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

It falls really short,"I had great hopes for this film, I liked the previous titles of the director, and mostly, find him imaginative and cheerful. Also, this film featured a lot of good actors, and even Bill Murray!.But it falls short, it's not really funny. There are a lot of dialogs, that try to be fast and brilliant, but they get tiring after a while. There are a bunch of repetitive jokes, that are not funny. I was really expecting to laugh, and you know that feeling when you are trying to laugh on a film, but it doesn't deliver.Seems like the visuals, while powerful, were meant to be the main part of the comedy. But they don't really add a sense of comedy. Not even the hotel is an important piece of the history. Maybe I was expecting it to be a comedy, but that was not the intention of the director?And then, the just mere circumstantial appearance of Mr Murray.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"splendid. beautiful, remarkable, wonderful.","splendid. beautiful, remarkable, wonderful. This movie, I love it. Unique, lovely, funny, and the whole things are amazing. Wes Anderson always done great, his movies always have unique things as inspiration for another movie maker. The shots are great, they always put the person in the middle of the frame. The color is wonderful, and it just like a pop up book. And the way the movie tells us about story in a story in a story is really great. The one who play as Zero is great, actually.

Brings A Smile To My Face!,"Every time I hear a new Wes Anderson movie is coming out, I get giddy with glee. I love the works of this amazing auteur, especially his last feature, Moonrise Kingdom. This movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is an excellent, stylish film set in the world of Anderson. The film is bright, colorful, and features exquisite cinematography as well as a delightful score from Alexandre Desplat-which finally got him his first Oscar. This film is funny as well with a great screenplay, which worked thanks to the amazing cast.Anderson's latest film is about a hotel concierge named Gustave who befriends a lobby boy named Zero and together they go on adventures. Gustave must rely upon Zero to help solve a murder in which he has been framed all over the account of a family inheritance.When this film has a big cast, I mean this film has a big cast. However, many of them don't get long chunks on the screen. Ralph Fiennes does very well as Gustave and his performance was just a laugh riot. Tony Revolori as the lobby boy also received points in my book as Gustave's new friend. The rest of the cast is just too large to list, but I particularly liked Harvey Keitel as Gustave's fellow escape plotter and Jeff Goldblum as the family's attorney.Overall, The Grand Budapest Hotel will appeal to everyone who is a fan of Wes Anderson. His style of filmmaking is unique and I adore the way he creates inventive ways to create movies. Not only is the story and acting excellent, the movie features strong technical talent. Tilda Swinton and her makeup is just one example. The movie is fast-paced and often funny, so I am glad this film was recognized by the Academy!My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Highly stylistic combined with a witty script and fantastic performances,"Two years ago I saw Moonrise Kingdom and was left feeling somewhat empty. After seeing The Grand Budapest Hotel I can most definitely say Wes Anderson has gotten his mojo back.People bash Anderson for using style over substance but I think he blends the two wonderfully in this movie. We see M. Gustave develop (sort of) as he struggles through hardships he isn't familiar with.There is also a reoccurrence of dark humor and sudden jolts of excitement throughout. But I shan't spoil anything.Overall I highly recommend it, I saw it with my family and they all loved it as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A fun fantastic fantasy,"Not remotely ""realistic""--more like a fabulous fairy tale.-Do you actually notice that in central-eastern Europe all the signs on buildings and vehicles and streets are in English!?Same with the acting--you would not exactly call it ""campy"" but the style of most all the performances is basically Hollywood American Vernacular--speaking in movie-style slang and jargon. Not meant to be realistic. It;'s all playing and play-acting. A film in a similar pseudo historical comedic style is of course ""Deat of Stalin""--all the American actors portraying Russina history as if it's an American TV sit-com.This is of course on purpose--it gives the film it's winking ""all in fun"" overall tone. Like the architecture of the buildings in the movie itself--lavish, realistic but also exaggerated. You could call it cute, you could call it a confection, you could call it an adventure story. But it is never condescending. Just join in the fun. Not very film director can pull this off--balancing the tone like this and making it entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
That's what a movie is,"So here I am writing my first review on IMDb, please ignore mistakes. I have been looking for a movie like this that is different from all current movies like stupid love stories and same old FBI agents thing or crazy high youngsters on a roll. It is a perfect movie in all aspects. Story, acting, picturization, pace all the aspects are perfect. It is not like any other comedy movies which contains double meaning jokes or creates situation comedy and that is what makes it special. Yes it is not a movie that will make you laugh so hard that you stomach starts to ache but it is good enough to find sensible humor out of the movie and relax. Just loved it.

Visually Stunning but Occasionally Confusing,"I recently watched ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it's a really good movie with a unique style. The bright colors and detailed scenes are visually stunning. Ralph Fiennes, who plays M. Gustave, is fantastic, and the quirky characters are fun to watch.The hotel setting is fascinating, with its old-world charm and grand architecture. The attention to detail is impressive, making every scene a visual treat. Wes Anderson's direction really stands out in the way everything looks so precise and artistic.However, I found it hard to stay engaged throughout the movie. The plot jumps around a lot, and there are many characters to keep track of. Sometimes, I wasn't sure what was happening or why certain events mattered. This made it tough for me to stay interested all the way through.Despite this, there are many moments that are funny and touching. The relationship between M. Gustave and the lobby boy, Zero, is heartwarming and adds a nice emotional layer to the story. Their adventures together are amusing and exciting, even if the overall plot was a bit confusing.Even though I struggled to stay engaged, I still think it's a good movie. The humor and visual style make it worth watching. If you like movies that are different and don't mind a complex plot, you might enjoy ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Just be ready for it to be a bit confusing at times. It's the kind of movie that might need a second viewing to fully appreciate all the details.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
thoroughly overrated,Unfortunately I watched this film from beginning to end and could not believe that people paid good money to make this let alone to watch it. It was utter drivel throughout. The emperors new clothes comes to mind! Do professional film critics of today have no concept of what the ordinary man or woman in the street might actually think? It was thoroughly incomprehensible. The film plot was ridiculous. The acting was weird. I despair that film makers seem to have resorted to this sort of infantile production. Whatever happened to a good story line? Whatever happened to believability? I don't know what else to say other than to advise that if you miss seeing this film you will not be missing anything at all.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Excellent Giggle,"Wes Anderson has outdone himself. Funny, witty and excellently well done film.

I found this to be a refreshing change to the director's previous offerings.Cinematography and style are both excellent, whether it be the false aspect ratio or the cartoon like effects, just wonderful.The actors on show provide a tour de force, F Murray Abraham, Jude Law are perfectly suited and then there in Ralph Fiennes who provides a masterclass in the art.Wonderful film that is truly unequalled as a complete work.

Remarkably thoughtful and wonderful,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has many dark depressing themes under its colorfully cute and fun moments. With a variety of characters and a peculiar script Wes Anderson is able to grab your attention from the very first minute. The story is set in fictional country of Zubrowka in 1930s. We hear the tale of how Zero Mustafa (Toni Revolori) the lobby boy of the prestigious 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' ends up becoming the owner of the same. He becomes a good friend of the hotel's concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). But things take a turn when someone close to M. Gustave dies and he is arrested suspecting of murder. Zero and Gustave embark on a journey to prove the innocence of M. Gustave where they become even closer friends. Ralph Fiennes has given a fine performance and definitely one of the most under-rated actors. We also have Edward Norton in a relatively smaller role and a exciting Bill Murray cameo as well.Anderson gives intricate and vibrant detailing to the sets making visually beautiful. Also the make-up and hair styling department has done a great job. The music and background score is wonderful. With a run time of 100 minutes The Grand Budapest Hotel does not overstay its welcome. It is quirky, weird at the same time entertainingly funny with a heart touching story. Definitely worth a watch.RATING: [4/5]",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The film that brought Wes Anderson to my attention,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most captivating movies I've ever seen. From the opening scene, it creates a world and set of characters that's wholly its own. Starting with the art direction, it may very well be the best I've seen in in a movie. The mixture of sets, miniatures, and backdrops, the flamboyant costumes, and the highly exaggerated colors almost tell a story in and of itself and are presented beautifully by Anderson's stellar direction. You could potentially mute the film and just look at the imagery itself and be satisfied. Not that you'd want to, because there's plenty more to the film.The way the film's story is presented is solid gold. The opening, with its multiple framing devices, perfect sets the tone for the film to come. The pacing is flawless, split between plot and simply showing the world of the film. While the plot's solid, it's the worldbuilding where it really shines. Seeing how it works and how the characters in it live their lives is a joy to sit through, and the sharp dialogue gets plenty of laughs.The star studded cast is of course fantastic, but the best is easily Ralph Fiennes. Gustave is one of the most entertaining characters I have seen in a long time. The way he acts, the way he carries himself, even in prison, his various mannerisms and oddities, it all makes for a character that never gets old or tiresome.All in all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a phenomenal movie, and the one that made me interested in the films of Wes Anderson. Suffice to say I can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"A quirky, interesting tale...","The Grand Budapest Hotel, with its star studded cast, does a good job in portraying the adventures of a concierge and his lobby boy in a fictional early 20th century hotel, with a quirky yet elaborate narrative. The story follows the life of Z. Mustafa, and his adventures with the charming M. Gustave, wonderfully portrayed by the ever impressive Ralph Fiennes. Filled with bright colours and vivid imagery, the film never provides a dull moment in its entirety. However, the most striking feature of this film is that even the most gruesome acts are portrayed in such a manner that it borderlines on euphemism. Surely, this dark and brutal comedy will entertain audiences for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"A silly movie, but with great acting, cinematography and screenplay.","This film is perfect for a Friday night laugh. Its comedic element is at times so random but so funny that you can't help but just laugh out loud. It is silly without being overly stupid and it still manages to keep the story going. There are quite a few plots in this as the events just keep coming and the ball keeps rolling.The acting is phenomenal. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori make an unusual pairing but the chemistry between them and their conversations with each other is flawless. They portray their characters incredibly well as did Edward Norton and Saoirse Ronan. Adrien Brody did an all right job, though he seemed a bit over the top or maybe I'm just not used to seeing him in this sort of character. He was still pretty funny. Willem Dafoe's stone face is a weird mix between comedy and thriller.One thing I noticed is that apart from one or two characters, the whole film consists of mainly stock characters. I'm referring to characters who are only one dimensional and only show one side of themselves. I don't know if this is genius but to pull off a film and have it succeed without any character development is amazing. However, because the character's all have a place and fit so well with/ against each other, it works to its advantage. Though these characters are not complicated, it must have took a lot of planning to come up with them and arrange their relationships with each other.The cinematography is great and the artificial colouring adds to its comedic effect. Because it is so obviously fake sometimes, it just adds to the mood. Even the poster and images of the hotel seem to be two-dimensional, like a setting for a play or puppet show. Which is why I found it a little disconcerting when dark elements were introduced in this film (deaths and so on), it was too gruesome an aspect next to this comedic set up.I also did enjoy the screenplay, Gustave is such a very charismatic character and Fiennes plays him so perfectly. The way that the conversations go so fast makes the audience stay focused on what is happening and it doesn't give a moment's rest. The unnecessary swearing, I admit was funny, but luckily there wasn't too much of that.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
An oddball comedy inside a picturesque world,"In what is surely the most weird movie nominated at this year's Oscars, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie that feels like a painting come to life, and in that process adding a sense of quirky adventure that will feature the most random of characters. A rousing appreciation has to be given to Ralph Fiennes for giving a comedic performance for the ages. Perhaps not the most Academy Award worthy performance in the eyes of some, but definitely a stand out from the more dramatic roles that earned high praise this year.This film is yet another project from Wes Anderson that has his mark written all over it. I believe that Wes Anderson is about as close as you'll come to an American director that has a very European style to his films. His American cast counterparts in the movie bring that Hollywood vibe to an other wise independent project. Overall the production values of Grand Budapest Hotel are some of the best of the year. Beautiful cinematography, set design and a smooth directorial effort make for a beautiful movie to behold. On the writing and acting side of things, we get a throwback to the times of screwball comedies. I would say this is the modern screwball movie prototype. Once again, all of the highest praise goes to Fiennes for giving us a wonderful character that not only makes you laugh at the right times, but to a certain degree intrigues you. Throughout the extensive cast there are many good turns, yet our most inexperienced member Tony Revlori more than holds up against our leading man, making for a very believable friendship between the two in the movie.It's not every day that I watch a movie like this. In fact, this is my first Anderson movie, and I gotta say that his style can go either way with me. While I hold off for a while on seeing more of his movies, I leave The Grand Budapest Hotel with a solid score and with the memory of being thoroughly entertained by it.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Frankly watching the mentally unstable characters bounce around the screen was an experience I can only compare to being repeatedly hit in the face with a sock full of sick.The music was only comparable to listening to someone urinate on a cat and the script seemed like something that would spring from the mind of a dog sat at a typewriter.Ralph Fiennes was pretty good though.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"a sentimental,elegant and funny movie paying tribute to Stefan Zweig","It is a fantastic film.Firstly,in terms of style,the lines are so beautifully written with interwoven poems that add elegance to the film.Some remarks are so classic that I listen to them time and time again,like""There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.""As for the pictures,I must say,they are dreamlike.It is like I'm appreciating art.Every shot is carefully taken and contains certain meanings.And Wes Anderson pays attention to every little details.Out of curiosity,I read the newspapers in the film and found even the news content are carefully written.The scores are excellent and they haunt me for days.Some are grand,some are light-hearted and while some are absorbing and exciting.Lastly I want to talk about the cast.As many viewers have commented before,the cast is star-studded and no one is out of place.However,I still want to mention the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori.Their natural eye contact and dramatic body gesture impress me. In terms of its content,I think it conveys a sentiment that pays tribute to a kind of gentlemanship that is lost before the World War Two.Mr.Gustave,a perfect example of such spirit ,was shot to death by the overbearing military.I am moved from time to time by Mr.Gustave's gentile and noble deeds.For example,he takes care of the inmates at Check Point 19,which also helps his own escape.And even maybe at the last moment of his life,he doesn't forget to recite an excerpt of a poem.Not to mention,he protests the thuggery at the cost of his own life.Yet he is not a saint,of course,he is vain,needy,insecure and a little mean,I guess.

The film lavished such special effects using many painted backdrops, à la Murnau. The only bothering CGI sequence was the ski chase, not that it was bad, but the CGI imagery which was used felt out of place, considering the humor in the rest of the film. The film is reportedly based on Stefan Zweig, who, like director Wes Anderson, has written stories full of eccentric characters. It begins with narrator Tom Wilkinson/Jude Law, who, going back to the past, refers the story to another narrator, old Zero Moustafa (J. Murray Abraham), who recalls his adventures as a young Tintin, in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, in 1932. It was the last year before the ominous Nazi regime took power. It is now the year in which the bubbling balalaikas of an irresistible soundtrack can be heard, mixing Vivaldi with Kamarinskaia. The cast is simply historic, not very often such a handful of braves meet on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A cinematic marvel,"If the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel existed I would enter it immediately, the film that has been created is a visual and character triumph. There are very few films that have been created which convey the precise image that the director had intended, down to the last detail, but the Grand Budapest is one of them. The colour schemes that are used to contrast the mood and the emotion for each scene are impressive enough, but the highly orchestrated set design and props allows for a single shot of a character to reveal their entire personality. From the bright flamboyancy of Gustave H to the dark mysterious persona of Jopling, we see true characters being developed, ones we find ourselves involved in and rooting for. While some may only watch this film, I feel the only way to truly experience it is to analyse. For example, why does Moustafa keep the hotel? Is it the building itself, is it the nostalgia or is it the last remnants of the idea good will and kindness of man creates greatness, not money or greed only by watching can you find out and draw your own conclusion. The world is immersive, the characters are deep and full of personality. The story is truly an amazing achievement. This film is what cinema was made for, I cannot praise it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Loved it,"The first thing that struck me with ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" is how much it reminded me on quirky ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" (2001) which I loved back than and always will. No one usually talks much about it but I see traces of ""Amélie"" very often here and there, the narrative, voice-over and all. Apparently this director is already known for his highly recognizable visual style and equally criticized and loved for it - I for one, love it and not only that I ""get it"", I actually wallow in every meticulously pre-arranged scene that makes movie look like some overblown marzipan cake it would probably take me several re-viewing to grasp all the countless little details. So what is here not to be liked? I really wonder - since it delighted me so much - who are those people who snicker and dislike what I find to be unforgettable joy of a movie? Could it be they are so used to familiar action/crime/murder clichés that they wont accept anything that is not fitting into boxes? That Wes Anderson (who, by the way was born in the same year as me, and uses my beloved Stefan Zweig as reference) is too creative and original for them? Contrary to these opinions, I am so relieved, glad and yes, thrilled that there are still directors around who love what they do and follow their own muse instead of making just another forgettable products on the factory line - ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" might seem odd to some, but to me it stands head and shoulders above anything that I see advertised these days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Absolutely brilliant!,"Just like the painting which the movie revolves around the grand Budapest hotel is absolutely beautiful in every way and very unique. Just like the painter who painted the picture, Director Wes Anderson has truly outdone himself and this may just be his masterpiece.The movie has depth and brilliant multiple stories which creatively come together to create an outstanding main story while still allowing for all stories to have relevance. The stories are told through unique and intriguing characters.The movie revolves around themes such as love, death, friendship, greed, and despair among other themes all told through fantastical and funny ways. The dark and unique humour combined with the great dialogue allows for such serious themes such as death and love to be laughed upon while still having relevance and intertwining perfectly to tell the brilliant story of The Grand Budapest Hotel. The movie has very good moral-values but its brilliance is how the moral-values are told through funny and unique ways.The acting in this movie is great with an outstanding cast led by an unbelievably good Ralph Fiennes. The unforgettable multiples cameos are a delight.The movie is stunning visually and I cannot help but admire the camera work, cinematography and beautiful locations and sets. The movie is very detailed and every detail is clearly well thought of. The immaculate attention to detail makes it very difficult to find a flaw in the movie because honestly the movie is flawless. The movie is extremely surreal and the perfect soundtrack adds to the surrealism while helping to create and depict the mood and tone.The Underlying question: Is it good and should you watch it? The answer is absolutely! The movie is very intriguing and unique. The Grand Budapest Hotel has all the ingredients for a great movie and takes you on an unforgettable journey through a wonderfully crafted wonderland, straight out of Anderson's brilliant head, parallel to no other!The only true downfall is that this movie does not appeal to everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

More vibrant tedium from Wes the Less.,"Wes Anderson lays the lipstick on in buckets in his latest pastel pig featuring a cast of big names (Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Ed Norton etc) who rather than get into character simply attend this costume party long on name dropping and quite slim plot wise. It's like looking at the Macy's Christmas window decorations one city block after the next as Anderson piles on his colorfully precious detail from end to end while dragging the anemic plot behind it.Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) , head concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel and member in good standing with the legion of Crossed Keys is known far and wide for his close attention to detail and the extras (gigolo) he provides to one foot in the grave dowagers who check in. When one turns up dead she leaves him a precious painting and perhaps more but her Boris Badenov looking family will have none of this and H is charged with her murder instead. Along with faithful Lobby Boy, Zero, he sets out to clear his name and unmask the real murderers.All form and no content, Hotel is rich in color and set design seducing you briefly with its cleverness and play land look but with its one cylinder storyline engine it hardly advances at all as Anderson bombards the audience with endless dead pan compositions and sorry slapstick performed by arch characters and special guest stars. The precision, detail and the promise of its look simply fails to support its meager drawn out plot and by the halfway mark you get tired playing with the same toys going in circles.Ralph Fiennes as the perspicacious Gustave brings grace and more than a touch of sophistication to his charming and comic role but the rest of the cast is mass caricature that wears thin after initial contact and The Grand Hotel Budapest goes from four star to Motel 6 in no time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Innovative Visual and an extraordinary presentation of a fast moving story,"It was a wonderful narrative of a very simple story. All credits goes to Wes Anderson. The way he imagined the set for the movie is really excellent. The visual of the movie was excellent. He created a different world with his characters. He made own sets of laws for the movie in his created world. The quality of acting was extremely high as we can find big names for such small roles. The movie was like 90-95 minutes of continuous story telling.However there has been lots of violence in the movie, the way of showing was kind of a beautiful. You won't have the feeling that someone just got killed. Ralph Fiennes is just superb as the fast-talking persnickety M. Gustave H., concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, in 1930's Europe. He will become the mentor of the new Lobby Boy at the hotel, Zero Moustafa. Zero is portrayed wonderfully as well by Tony Revolori, making his big screen starring role debut. Much of the story here will revolve around their adventures together in and out of the hotel environs. If I am not very wrong Ralph Fiennes may get a Oscar Nomination for the leading role and The Grand Budapest Hotel will get Best Picture Nomination. I didn't mind the bittersweet ending about M. Gustave, because the movie invested more into that character than Agatha, but it seem wrong, not to show, what happen to them. It seem a lot of the plot conclusion was unfinished. After all, the movie never truly tells how M. Gustave prove his innocent, or who killed him. The film was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. The film has bits from 1939 novel 'Beware of Pity' and 1982 'The Post Office Girl"". You see that in Anderson's films, that he truly love art. Indeed, it's an art-film about loving art. His films are full of His films are full of charmingly obscure references to old music, theater, literature, paintings and photography. The locations that they use are beautiful. I love the nostalgia look of the clothes, you really get the time period. I also didn't mind the use of handmade miniature models. It was funny to see it, but fits in with the mood of the story, so well. The Deadpan comedy works so well, in this movie. I wouldn't stop, laughing. The silly dialogue is delivered in such a serious way that makes it fun to watch. I'm a sucker for smart comedies. I didn't like the lack of European accents. It was alright. The movie does have some harsh language, but unlike other modern comedies. It's works with the story, because it used to expression deep emotion depth, than a misplace adjective. The violence can be a bit too violent at times. This might be Anderson's darkest, most violent film yet. I really think some people might hate what happen to a certain cat in the film. The movie did a few scenes of nudity that could had been cut. It wasn't need. Overall: The movie takes the cake. In this case, Mendl's Courtesan au Chocolats. It's a good well-made movie with some faults.Viewers have the freedom to think whether or not it has a gaudy or a conservative ending. Weis Anderson created a fictional story in a fictional setting which is very easy to love and hard to let go once the credits roll.Enough about Fiennes fantastic performance; there's loads more I loved about this movie. The cast is loaded to the breaking point with talent and everyone delivers. The advertising prints for the film are half cast list, promoting the more than a dozen talents starring in the film. Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton the list goes on with special mention to Willem Dafoe as Dmitri's hard-boiled, silent henchman. It's also nice to see Jeff Goldblum on screen again, even if it's just a minor role as the hotel's lawyer. The impressive cast is fine match for the film's even more engaging visual style. I don't remember much of Anderson's other films but I hope THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a nice indication of what I can expect to see. The film's colors pop vibrantly. The whole world of the Grand Budapest (in the 30s) is a pastel wonderland of pinks, purples, and reds. And I loved that the camera never stopped moving. Every frame has a frantic vibe, if not for the character's erratic natures then the constant camera movement. I really can't say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. The story was fun, the characters were quirky, the film looked beautiful, and it's got an amazing cast. I'm not sure how general audiences would respond to a film so strange but it's won me over as a potential fan of Wes Anderson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A very special and funny crime comedy.,"I had only seen two Wes Anderson movies before I saw this one: Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle Of Dogs, both animated. But The Grand Budapest Hotel has to be my favorite. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't quite understand it. But I at least thought it was funny. I wanted to rewatch this movie again for 7 months, and now I finally did. And now, I understood it more.Now, this is one of my favorite movies. It had some (probably) unnecessary scenes, but I laughed quite a lot. This is one of the most special and funniest crime movies I've ever seen.The cast in this movie is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Celebrities coming in as main characters, supporting characters and cameos. This is very fun. In the big leads of this movie, we have Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. In other roles, we have Saorsie Ronan, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson amongst others. Wow! I'm giving a huge ""Thanks!"" to all the actors supporting this masterpiece. Especially Ralph Fiennes, an actor known for serious work in movies like Schindler's List and Harry Potter. Well, this is some of the funniest actor performances I've seen, not just from him, but from any actor.This is a funny and unconvential movie, that has some problems. This movie is a masterpiece.

A brilliantly bizarre movie,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is unlike anything else I have seen. And for once, that is actually a compliment. Some people may be quick to dismiss this as simply 'style over substance', but I would argue that it has, and exceeds equally brilliantly at both.In terms of style, this is an excellently shot movie with not one ordinary shot - the cinematography is flawless and includes some very memorable shots. The colours, the music, the ridiculous CGI, and the on-point editing along with every other small detail (like how the shape of the camera lens changes for different time periods) all combine to make a very impressive movie. The cast is almost consistently good, from Ralph Finnes to Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton to Jude Law (although admittedly Edward Norton feels a bit out of place in his role).In terms of substance, the movie has a depth of heart and feeling that many movies lack. It seeps with nostalgia, and is filled with characters that are surprisingly potent. The movie is filled with a large amount of loss and compassion, yet still makes room for very obvious, and sometimes quite dark, comedy (that certainly hits hard). The ending is subtle but leaves an impact on the audience that will stick with you for a while.There is not one ordinary thing about this movie. It is comical to the extreme, and with every dose of refreshing originality the movie offers you, along with every marvellous set piece and over the top character, it comes together to form one coherent and bizarre movie, and a great one at that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Keep your hands off my lobby boy!,"Always entertaining and constantly funny 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' introduces us to another beautiful and imaginative world plucked from the mind of Wes Anderson.Its focus remains on Gustave the concierge and Zero the lobby boy. After a wealthy tenant dies and Gustave is named the heir of her fortune, he is also framed and sets out to clear his name and fortune. It's a story unlike Andersons previous films, but he tackled it in the same way he would with any film with unusual characters and a visual beauty leading the story.With a cast with as many big names as this has (Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Willem Dafoe to name a few) and many of them having less than 5 minutes screen time you would usually assume that the film would be selling out. Normally you'd be right and such a cast would just be an attempt at cashing in at the box office.But gladly that's not the case. No matter how small the role, every part of this film comes across as both lovable and memorable. Each characters personality is distinct and the actors ensure that no matter how short the screen time they make their presence in the film remembered. Every character feels as if they are vital to the film and every character just makes the film even more charming.Though as good as the entirety of the cast is, Ralph Fiennes still stands out with his memorable performance as the lead Gustave H, the hotel's concierge. Fiennes shows his great talent for comedy through his brilliant delivery. One moment he shall be a refined English gentleman, speaking with grace and modesty as one would expect from any fine concierge. Then the next he swears like a fu*king sailor.Take for example his reaction when he sees 'Boy With Apple' where he comes across a priceless work of art ""Blond, smooth skin as white as that milk, of impeccable provenance. One of the last in private hands, and unquestionably the best. It's a masterpiece. The rest of this sh*t is worthless junk."" Fiennes switches between the two so naturally, yet somehow remaining charismatic throughout to create a peculiar and unique character.These characters are mixed with Anderson's distinct visual style to create the beautiful world in which the Grand Budapest is set in. Short of 'Fantastic Mr Fox' this is probably where his directing style comes across strongest, with the film filled with his trademark centred shooting style and panning shots. Mixed with this is his usual charming dialogue and unusual storytelling style. This time Anderson experiments with a unusual narrative spanning 80 years in the first 10 minutes.In the modern day a young girl is reading a book. In this book the author recounts a time when his younger self met the mysterious millionaire Zero Moustafa. Moustafa tells tells of the inter war years when the hotel was at its prime and under the leadership of Gustave H and the adventures that they went on. Through his smooth style the intro feels as if it were plucked from a book through the authors descriptive tone to explain the narrative and Andersons smooth style passing through scenes as if one was turning pages in a book.This narrative also plays a significant role in Andersons visual style, most importantly that of the hotel. Due to the films narrative then there are two designs to the hotel. The first from the 30's where the bulk of the story is set. With this the hotel is a grand design, with stunning hallways constantly crowded with the wealthiest individuals, impeccable service and with brightly coloured cinematography to emphasise the beauty. It is nothing short of an ideal hotel, creating an illusion full of life and happiness.The second design is from the 60's where in contrast the hotel is aged after the war. The halls are no longer crowded. Service is lazy at best. The bright colours are less defined. And it is no longer full of life as it once was. Whether it is to demonstrate how the war has destroyed the beauty of the hotel or to serve as a reminder of how the heyday of the Grand Budapest will be remembered for generations to come, Anderson uses the visuals of the hotel to give greater meaning and weight to Gustaves story. It makes the life seem all the more beautiful then and makes us desire even more to experience it.And that's what makes the film truly special. Anderson not only creates his unique image of a world but makes us want to be a part of it. Whether it's the charm of Gustave and every other character or the Grand Budapest itself, Anderson hypnotises us to the screen through the films charm and beauty. It's certainly a film that I'll want to revisit time and time again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Another fantastic film from Wes Anderson,"This film is gorgeous. It is visually astounding. Wes Anderson has always written fantastic screenplays and this may be his best one yet. The story involves an hotel concierge M.Gustave and his protege Zero, M.Gustave is highly respected in the hotel business and even manages to become very close to feeble old ladies, when one of them dies, M.Gustave becomes the chief suspect in her murder.The dialogue is great, very funny and delightful. The story takes many unexpected twists and turns and is perfectly paced, with many cameos from many famous actors. Ralph Fiennes was phenomenal in the movie, his performance is certainly Oscar worthy, whilst many of the other performances in the film were great such as Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody, Ralph Fiennes remains outstanding.The shots in this movie are incredible, The Grand Budapest is fantastically directed and the cinematography is in some scenes is jaw dropping. This one of the best looking movies of 2014 and most certainly deserves a best cinematography Oscar nomination. The use of color is extremely well done in this movie, the scenes shot in the hotel are bright and colorful to represent a happy sweet tone, whilst outside the hotel is shot with a bleak and sort of grey tone.Overall this is certainly one of Wes Anderson best movies, with gorgeous visuals, splendid acting and a fantastic script, this is easily one of the best movies of the year, very funny, incredibly sweet and all with Wes Anderson's flair. The Grand Budapest is a film not to be missed.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wonderful Film,"Other than reading a couple of quick reviews of this movie I had no real idea of what I was going to watch. I was not familiar with this director, Wes Anderson, though I did know most of the actors. The best way I could describe this movie would be Stylish Cinema all the while walking the line between being a classic and absurdity. It does it extremely well.The movie is set in a fictitious location somewhere in Eastern Europe between WWI/II and portrays a bygone era of opulence and old world manners. The primary location is set in a luxurious hotel replete with a staff whose primary purpose is to look after the guests.Early in the movie we realize we are being told a story. The beginning of the movie is set in the 60's after the hotel is basically run down and then switches to the mid 30's which is where the majority of the movie takes place.The main character is played by Ralph Fiennes who is the concierge of the hotel. While he is the focal point the cameos by other well- known actors were plentiful and varied, not to mention eccentric.The movie is a lament for bygone days and an era which we shall never see again while also being somewhat of a parody. A couple of the more memorable quotes from the movie:The golden age that Zero is evoking never really existed. ""His world had vanished long before he even entered it"".""He certainly maintained the illusion with remarkable grace,"" one character remarks of another near the end of the movie,"" suggesting this may sometimes be the best we can do.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it made me want to watch some of the director's previous films and too watch this film again which is a rarity for me.

Review: The Grand Budapest Hotel/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,"""You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughter house that was once known as humanity"". If there was ever a quote to sum up the films of Wes Anderson, this would be high on the list. Highly inventive, absurd, and at times, narratively incoherent, Anderson's eighth feature film is a grand, accommodating feature whose self is probably not as grand as the cast it has rounded out.From Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Kietel, Bob Balaban, Saoirse Ronan, Lea Seydoux, to regulars Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and of course Bill Muarry, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a formidably full house of A-list actors who happily lend their skills to the highly inventive and immensely visual Anderson. Aside from the wholly impressive cast, is the quirky and unmistakably unique vision of Anderson himself.If you haven't been fortunate enough to experience a Wes Anderson film yet, you are surely missing out on one of the most elaborate, detailed, and symmetrical styles of film-making ever known. Anderson's style, renown and admired by many, may very well be the American indie art-house King and The Grand Budapest Hotel may very well be his grandest and most admirable spectacle yet–although it may not be his most engaging or beloved.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an empirical picture, in every sense of the word. Throughout his career as a writer/director, Anderson has defined and refined his vision to the point that every heist; every adventure; or every group of individuals, can easily be distinguishable, as if their existence could only be understood within an Anderson film. The essence of the characters within The Grand Budapest, as well as his overall vision, is creatively maintained thanks to the purity of the scenarios and wackiness of the characters Anderson houses, in whatever setting it may be. For decades now, Anderson has bequeathed to film-lovers everywhere and audiences' alike, a signature style unlike any other.There are countless films where the characters have come secondary only to the immense and elaborate setting they are placed in. For example, in many films urban settings; New York City has played a pivotal role (see: Shame and Annie Hall), The Wild West (see: The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Unforgiven), and exotic locales within Europe set the landscape for timeless stories of intrigue, lust, love and tragedy (see: Vicky Cristina Barcelona and The Bicycle Thief.). In Anderson's world, although many of his settings are within the very real world we live in today, sublets of his world are envisioned within our world, and in essence, these locales become the greatest character of them all, housing very small, intricate tales of the people whose stories are shared in its presence. The setting this time, is none other than the Grand Budapest. A hotel, that houses the highly empathetic new lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori) and his journey to becoming the irreplaceable sidekick to the one and only infamous concierge M. Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). Among the many other patrons of the hotel and each of their individual secrets, tall tales, and life memories, Anderson centres the film around a priceless painting, now put in the hands of Gustave thanks to death of M. Gustave's latest deceased romance, the mysteriously elder Madame D (an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton). What transpires, is an array of fantastical plot schemes and recanted storytelling that may only make sense when mentioning the name of Wes Anderson.Like any other Anderson film, the stories are only secondary to their execution. Anderson's films are the closet things to mathematical proofs, where the process of plot-making comes first before the final, usually predictable and happy outcome. Anderson may have come off one of his most cherished screenplays with his last film Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel may in no way trump it, but thankfully, it never tries. Instead, after exploring the unfathomable bond between young lovers, Anderson penetrates deep and long the affections of friendship and the importance of patronage within the industry of service and hospitality. Surprisingly this is a theme that he has yet to encounter, especially after his beloved muse and frequent collaborator Kumar Pallana passed and served as nothing less than a staple to the Anderson cannon. Think of The Grand Budapest Hotel as a large and completely dysfunctional family taking care of you, much like Anderson's earlier work The Royal Tenenbaums, only this time, imagine them slotted at the other end of a hotel reception desk.In recent superhero films, including the abysmal Spider-Man 3, some of studios biggest let- downs are due to saturation of talent. Many directors, usually overwhelmed with fitting in actors, story lines, and significant narrative points, are unable to tend to the large range of highly versatile skills many character actors possess. But, as seen with his raw and disturbing state of family life, Anderson has a natural knack for understanding and using large casts to his advantage. Never taking up more screen time than needed, each face, each actor and each role is given its due diligence and serves a purpose, always elevating the unbelievability of his stories. His characters are merely caricatures of the people Anderson imagines, and it can only be seen that we, as an audience, are allowed a faint glimmer inside this imagination.The Grand Budapest Hotel truly lives up to the Anderson name. As incredibly talented and always enigmatic, the work of this visual artist/filmmaker, will continue to be studied, analyzed and understood, well beyond his death. Anderson is mostly concerned with the indulgence of life. Thankfully, using his neon bright cast to highlight a dull and ubiquitous story of hidden secrets and falsification, new light is shed on a world and a man whose purity and pleasure in movie making art, is like the enjoyment of a fine French pastry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

The story line is one of the best that I have ever experienced in a movie, and the film is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It is magnificent. It mixes action, comedy, thrillers and a dash of romance to create what I think is definitely the best film of 2014.

Jaw Dropping Opulence,"Whether the hotel rooms' sets came from custom set design; cgi; or actual filming locations it was all jaw dropping engaging in its opulence. The film showcases that period between wars in eastern Europe when fortunes rapidly rose only to just as rapidly dissipate. We follow those fortunes and lifestyles through the guests, workers and others whose lives intersect with the hotel's rise & fall. Not only the sets, but the props and costuming were all period appropriate first rate. The painted mat backdrop for the hotel gave an other-worldly fantastical feel to the film's locality. On the downside the script itself was uneven - not polished thus not comfortably easy for a viewer to get hooked into the plot's digressions. The acting, on the other hand, was superb.

An excellent parody of classical film!,"By far the best part of this movie is the way it is filmed, every shot is deliberately placed to draw the audience and make it more believable of the set time period. The colours are bright and bold and bring the movie to life while still managing to create dark scenes. The comedy is excellent, it is one of the few occasions where visual comedy is used a lot and it works brilliantly. For those that don't know, visual comedy is when something funny is shown instead of simply telling the audience something, it works far better but is much harder to achieve. The acting is nothing to scoff at either. There are some big names in this movie, most of them having very small parts, it was a very risky move but I feel has worked in favour for the movie. The use of physical miniature models for the chase scene and others further emphasises the time setting but is also so deliberately and obviously fake that it becomes hilarious. The plot is alright and creates for some funny turns, the pacing is generally quite fast for the movie which can affect it in a perhaps negative way...I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. Some of the dialogue I found to be quite hard to follow due to the ostentatious language used by the upper-class individuals.

"An Adult Looney Tunes Cartoon that paces like a hyper flipbook, Grand Budapest Hotel is dazzling, unique, and pure absurd entertainment","You know you've made your mark in the cinematic world when just a few visual images from a trailer reveals that you are behind the movie. Whether it's the rapid-fire editing of Tony Scott (or his successor, Edgar Wright), pulp house content of Robert Rodriguez (who just isn't the same anymore), or the long-sweeping shots of Steven Spielberg, if you can immediately figure out who made the movie with just an image or a scene alone, it's a very, very good sign.And now we have Wes Anderson and his whimsical, colorful, adult Dr. Seuss style of storytelling that has potentially reached its peak with the enduring, zany, and unpredictable Grand Budapest Hotel. This cinematic ball of energy looks like a Pollock painting if it ever got organized, runs like a Looney Tunes cartoon, and delivers an adult story in a most unique, childlike wondrous way. Similar to how Woody Allen's career took a second wind as he went overseas, Wes Anderson's movie-making trip to Europe elevates his skills and abilities as a director to brand new heights.The story is surprisingly dark, as it spans multiple World Wars and covers a mystery involving a woman that may or may not have been murdered. The plot however moves so swiftly, so quickly, and contains so many humorous twists and turns you don't have time to dwell on the grimness. It does help that we have an excellent cast playfully tagging along for the ride, including Ralph Fieness in an Oscar-worthy performance, William Dafoe, and Tony Revolori---while also giving points to Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Adrian Brody, and Jeff Goldblum for their small but memorable roles.Cast is important (Wes always has great casts, Hollywood should take notes), but this is Anderson's work first and foremost, and it's his writing and meticulous attention to detail that has allowed for him to emerge as one of the top directors in the game. Too bad that his light indie style doesn't exactly fit with the norm that usually gets Oscar attention (Similar to Spike Jonze). Don't let the lack of Oscar bait bum you though, the movie is dazzling eye candy with gorgeous shots and even more gorgeous cinematography that warrants multiple viewings to appreciate the backgrounds and foregrounds that blend with the cast and the story being told. The unconventionalism (not a word, I know) of Anderson separates him from not only Hollywood but from the Indie movement as well.Grand Budapest Hotel is a Wes film plain and simple: great plot, colorful cast of characters, detailed settings, bite-sized dark humor, quirky swirl of comedy and drama, and an energy that you just don't get in many works nowadays. Grand Budapest Hotel is a visual treat from start to finish, so if you can handle his unique flavor and brand, then there is no reason why you would skip this movie. Easily one of the best you'll see this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"A masterpiece of a film that is striking in every sense. Memorable characters, a delightful plot and most impressively, it is absolutely gorgeous of a film. Grand Budapest Hotel contains everything a movie lover can ask for. It's visual and pace is distinctively Wes Anderson while paying homage to films from the past. It has a sense of mystery found in movies from 60s and 70s, complete with delightful foreign names and a quirky mystery. Despite all this, there is also something so pure and true behind the film, it tells the story and journey of men. While not always glamorous, these special men remains loyal to themselves and their beliefs, and this is what coats the entire movie into the masterpiece that it is. A special movie that can be seen as the masterpiece of one of the most imaginative director of our time, Grand Budapest will also live in my memory for a long time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Hotel Anderson,"Wes Anderson films have become events. This maybe because he has his own individual style that doesn't bow down to Hollywood or follow the pack. Even if his films aren't always home runs you can't hate on them too hard because they are completely his own. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" may not be the strongest film in the Anderson library but it is a beautiful film that has its moments.Anderson's films all have the storybook look to them and what better way to drive this point home than to start the film with a young girl opening up a book that contains the narrative to this story? A young writer, who is briefly played by Tom Wilkinson then handed over to Jude Law, is staying in the famous Grand Budapest Hotel. Though it seems very docile at the moment we find out the hotel has a rich history. The young writer runs into Mr. Moustafa who knows a lot of the history about the place. When he was a young man and looking for his place in the world he worked at the hotel. Zero, as he was referred to as a young man, works under the great Gustave. Gustave runs things by making sure his customers are taken care of in every way possible and I mean every way possible. Let's just say Gustave has a taste for older women. One of these women are Madame D.. When she turns up dead, in an apparent murder, Gustave becomes a suspect even though she left him her most prized possession, a work of art ""Boy with Apple"". Gustave, with the help of Zero, must secure the painting from Madame D's evil son, Dmitri, and find out who killed her.Ralph Fiennes is someone who doesn't venture into comedy that often. Here, he gives Gustave a a playful nature that should provide the actor enough evidence to try comedy some more. He sells the physical comedy as well as the witty script by Anderson. Much of his screen time is shared with Zero who is played by Tony Revolori. Revolori who, even though he has had small parts in other films, gets an introduction credit in this film. Fiennes and him have great chemistry together. Zero looks up to Gustave and Revolori sells it with his naive wide eyed optimism even when Gustave passively insults him at times. Overall, Gustave is hard on Zero because he sees the determination in the young man's eyes. The film wouldn't have worked without the chemistry of these two succeeding.The film's quirkiness does muddle the central story of the murder mystery. In Anderson's early works he seemed somewhat restrained in the way he revealed the oddness of his films. It seems, at times, that he purposely tries to inject each scene with some Wes Anderson-ness. Even though the supporting characters are perfectly played by some of Hollywood's interesting actors they seem more like caricatures than fleshed out people. Still, it is still great to see actors like Saoirse Ronan, who like Fiennes rarely venture into comedy, cut loose. She also like Fiennes does a great job and should do more comedy.Every shot is beautifully shot with Anderson's precision to detail present. Even a shot of a dessert treat is expertly filmed. Anderson shoots the film in different aspect ratios in each time period. The main part of the story is shot in 4:3 with black blocks on both sides of the screen. This may annoy some viewers but I found it a bold choice that I quickly got used to. The film also mixes sets, miniatures, background paintings, and real life locations quite well. When the movie does sag a bit in its narrative your attention will be picked up again by the gorgeousness shot by cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" isn't a terrible picture by any means. There are moments of greatness in it. It just lacks the natural comedic power that similar odd ball pictures like Anderson's ""Rushmore"" or ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" contained. Anderson shouldn't have to prove to anyone that he is different from the pack. We have seen this in his growth over the last few years as a film maker but it doesn't seem like he does.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Does the plot matter?,"I'm not sure whether the plot really matters in any Wes Anderson picture. It's worth the admission fee just to view the amazing setting. Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave H., I wasn't convinced that he could pull off a comedic performance but he manages it with aplomb. He is assisted by Tony Revolori as lobby boy Zero Moustafa. There are fleeting cameos from, most notably, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel & Willem Dafoe. Dafoe was doing an impressive impersonation of Christopher Walken's headless horseman from 'Sleepy Hollow'. I enjoyed the movie, there were some humorous situations created by Fiennes & Revolori but all in all I would describe this as more quirky that funny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
What part of this movie did people like?,"First, this is billed as a comedy. At the showing we saw, nobody laughed. At all. Nobody. The only reason I did not rate this lower was that there were a lot of fine actors portraying their roles with skill. Unfortunately, the characters are two-dimensional, the plot is silly at best, and even the cinematography is frequently cartoonish. There were whole scenes that were amateurishly animated. Many lines that I think were supposed to be shocking just came off dumb. Having funny stuff going on in the background can be a great device when used with skill, such as in Police Squad or even Mad Magazine, but then the background stuff has to actually be funny. None of this movie was. I'm sorry I paid money for this film, but even if it had been free I still resent the waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
cinematic delight,"In my opinion this is Wes Anderson's finest work as a whole. From the use of colors and symmetry every shot is pleasant to the eye and entertaining to watch.

Overall a 9/10 and in my personal top 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Quirky, funny, a must watch","Although Wes Anderson hasn't had many films in the spotlight he is undoubtedly a very talented filmmaker, which is very evident in The Grand Budapest Hotel. It has all the quirkiness that has become his signature, is very subtly funny and also packs a punch of emotion. I'm not certain it would fall into the comedy category (which it did for the golden globes and has done on IMDb) though, so don't watch it expecting to be in stitches, as I said it is subtle comedy. There was one slight thing that irritated me; the accents of all the actors were different, with many American actors sticking to their American accents, Saoirse Ronan with her Irish accent, and Ralph Fiennes with his English.But obviously this doesn't retract from the film, just a side note, and the beautiful art and soundtrack alone more than make up for it. Overall,it's excellent, and Ralph Fiennes once again shows us his incredible range as an actor, with an impressive debut from Tony Revolori! I would certainly recommend it to anyone that enjoys their films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A grand movie.,"Not being a big fan of Oscar winning movies normally, the year 2015 was a great year for the Oscars. Great movies like The Theory of Everything, Still Alice, The Imitation Game and Interstellar, were all worthy competitors like The Grand Budapest Hotel was. It was a difficult year to chose the best from all those movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel won 4 Oscars and it deserved them all. No Oscars for actors though, and that's because of the quality of the other movies, as Ralph Fiennes did a great job in this movie playing M. Gustave. The young Tony Revolori as Zero, the lobby boy, was also a delight to watch. The rest of the cast, with great names as Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray etc, they all have minor roles but it says enough about the quality of the cast and the movie. Probably Wes Anderson's best as thus far. The movie is very pleasant to watch as it is told in a funny but very structured way. It looks like everybody is walking in a straight stiff line, what gives this movie that something special. The cinematography is also a delight to watch, it's all very horizontal and vertical, every shot is rehearsed until it looks all strangely normal. Not only is it well shot but the story is also captivating enough to keep you amused and entertained. Definitely one of the better movies of that year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Still not a Wes Anderson fan,"I am shocked how well this movie has done among IMDb users and critics. The cast is amazing, but the movie is truly terrible. I walked out of Rushmore and would have done the same here. The characters were annoying, the dialog pointless and I was just waiting for it to end. Bleh.I did not understand why any of the characters acted the way the did. The little cuts that Anderson employees so freely for dramatic effect just seemed pointless. There was a sequence where there were cuts between different hotel managers that was funny through two cuts and then just dragged on and on as each manager had to stop what he was doing and put his Boy in charge. That is this movie in a nutshell -- it dragged on and on. That could have been interesting to see how a whole network of hotel managers could have been activated, but it just ends up being pointless.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"Arguably, Anderson's best work and the most memorable film this year","The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's look at a story of Gustav H (Ralph Fiennes) - a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel and a lobby boy Zero Moustafa, who found themselves in a huge scandal between wars. Movie starts in 1985, under a late-Communist town of cemeteries. An old writer (Tom Wilkinson) drives away his grandson and recalls the time in 1968 when his younger self (Jude Law) stayed Grand Budapest Hotel and became friend with its owner, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham).Moustafa on his behalf tells a story of him working at the Grand Budapest Hotel with its owner Mr. Gustav. He was a man of particular character, loved by rich old ladies who felt a lot younger in his company. This characteristic of him brought a lot loyal customers, I should say, mostly fake blond grannies. Among them was Madame D. who seemingly was in love with hotel owner. The story of Gustav starts with her departure from Grand Budapest willing to take late-lover with her. Shortly after that, he gets a notice about death of this extremely rich lady and Gustav decides to pay her a farewell visit.As it turns out, Madame D. has a huge family of sisters, brothers.and son, who all are fighting for her wealth. Among others, concierge gets some part of it - the most valuable painting A Boy with an Apple. Being disgraced by will of departed, her son Dmitri (Andrien Brody) questions validity of the will and accordingly, Gustav has to steal the painting.This is where the fun starts - heirs hunting over stolen piece of art. This is where Wes delivers haunting dark comedy and plenty of enjoyment.The Grand Budapest Hotel has everything we appreciate in Anderson's works. Most importantly, great visuals and easy to follow fun story. First thing, obvious from very beginning is how stunning everything looks in this film - production design, costumes, cinematography. Last year, Moonrise Kingdom had something we don't often see in contemporary movies and this year, Wes definitely improves any his previous works.This amazing work with colors, designs and decorations brings whole story to another level of enjoyment. It entertains eyes and gets us closer to events happening on the screen. The darker story becomes, the more colorful art direction is. On the paper, the combination of such visuals and screenplay looks quite weird and experimental, however in practice I can not imagine The Grand Budapest Hotel without either of them. It takes place in plenty of different locations, started from Hotel to Mountains and prison in between. Each of them is as spectacular as it is.Anderson, the same time, perfectly deals with storytelling with light, dark and definitely funny humor. It does not disappoint you, even more, it makes you sure that you've got the most engaging and diverting an hour and a half ahead.What I also liked is how quickly everything happens. Movie consists of five chapters and they all play in speed of light. Therefore, it never shows unnecessary layers.Films would not be that perfect without this all-star cast, that includes Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, William Defoe, Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Nilson and many others. They all do great job and especially Ralph, who's portrayal of Gustav H. is beyond hilarious. But biggest kudos to Tony Revolori for playing Zero aka the Lobby Boy, who was both funny, sad, interesting and did something new and very good. He in fact co-leads with Fiennes and is no less good than him, if not better.And finally, the music by Alexander Desplat makes all above said a lot better. Desplat, who I think composes one of the best music currently, made another award worthy scores that absolutely is in cosistance with everything director tries to tell.All in all, The Grand Budapest Hotel is the most entertaining movie of this year. Don't hesitate to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
One of the Most Fun Films of 2014,"I haven't seen many of Wes Anderson's films. I think I've seen DARJEELING LIMITED and most of LIFE AQUATIC. I don't remember much, as it's been a while since either, but the one element that remained with me was the incredibly unique style of the filmmaker. I've heard and read plenty about Wes Anderson's talents, seen the praise heaped on his work, but it wasn't until the release of THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL that I made a point to seek it out. The trailer was hilarious and the visuals were gorgeous, and a lot of people were claiming it to be one of Anderson's more accessible films so I figured I'd use it to see if he might be a director I want to check into further. Thanks to THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, the answer is a resound yes. I loved this movie. It's framed as a story within a story within a story. We open with an introduction from an unnamed author (Tom Wilkinson) who penned the tale that's about to unfold based on the experiences of Zero Moustafa, the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel with whom he'd become acquainted during a visit in the late '60s. It tells of an adventure he'd become entangled in when first hired as a lobby boy at the hotel in the '30s under the tutelage of the hotel's most famous concierge, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave had a reputation for forming intimate relationships with the elderly ladies who came to the hotel and, when one such beloved rich guest dies under mysterious circumstances, Gustave is willed a rather valuable painting in her passing. This draws the ire of the woman's selfish son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody), and sends Gustave on the run with his trusted lobby boy Zero when Dmitri accuses him of his mother's murder. Hilarious antics ensue.THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL had me grinning from the moment we're introduced to Gustave until the very end. I don't know if all of Anderson's other films are this much fun but, if they are, I'm sold. The humor is often subtle and it's so fast-paced that it's easy to miss a great line or delivery if you're still laughing from the last. I've seen it twice now and it was just as enjoyable on both viewings. Fiennes is fantastic as M. Gustave. Gustave is the epitome of class. He swore an oath as the concierge of the Grand Budapest and he lives it to it's fullest. He has an immense respect for the position and finds enormous delight in his daily routine, especially when he's getting cozy with some wealthy elderly woman. One would assume he does it for the very reason he finds himself in this mess: get the woman to love him and reap the benefits in the form of gifts. I never felt it was quite clear if does it out of greed or if he actually had a thing for these women. There were glimmers of both in him. One thing's certain, he's a man of loyalty. Aside from the unwavering faith to the Grand Budapest, he forms an almost immediate connection with Zero (Tony Revolori), his new lobby boy. Zero accompanies him to the viewing for the deceased Madame and finds himself caught up in the craziness immediately after. Gustave becomes a mentor to the boy, going so far as to give his blessing when Zero falls in love with a local baker's daughter, and promises Zero the fortune from the painting should anything happen to him.Enough about Fiennes fantastic performance; there's loads more I loved about this movie. The cast is loaded to the breaking point with talent and everyone delivers. The advertising prints for the film are half cast list, promoting the more than a dozen talents starring in the film. Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton the list goes on with special mention to Willem Dafoe as Dmitri's hard-boiled, silent henchman. It's also nice to see Jeff Goldblum on screen again, even if it's just a minor role as the hotel's lawyer. The impressive cast is fine match for the film's even more engaging visual style. I don't remember much of Anderson's other films but I hope THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a nice indication of what I can expect to see. The film's colors pop vibrantly. The whole world of the Grand Budapest (in the 30s) is a pastel wonderland of pinks, purples, and reds. And I loved that the camera never stopped moving. Every frame has a frantic vibe, if not for the character's erratic natures then the constant camera movement. I really can't say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. The story was fun, the characters were quirky, the film looked beautiful, and it's got an amazing cast. I'm not sure how general audiences would respond to a film so strange but it's won me over as a potential fan of Wes Anderson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Impeccable,"Grand Budapest is, without a trace of a doubt, Wes Anderson's crowning jewel, and I believe it will be marked in film history as his trademark piece.

As a white person, I can say to all of you that Wes's direction in this movie is at its finest.Don't be fooled by the overstated appearance of the characters and the sets, the classy and pompous sheen is an ironic statement - the plot and moral (if you can call it that) is very true and has a universal appeal to people of all walks of life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Pleasantly and persistently confusing,"I was never quite sure if this story within a story was meant to be a comedy or a tragedy, French or German, modern or period. It was delightfully puzzling, and I was generally excited to see what was going to happen next.It made the film artistic and cutting-edge, but also a little bit confusing. There was a great number of characters, locations, and plots to keep track of, all moving along at the fastest speed imaginable for a film.To actually follow the entire story required my fullest attention and focus. While that wasn't difficult for a movie that mostly kept me entertained; the flurry of cuts and transitions, narrated by several characters in both modern and period settings would've easily lost me at any given junction.It's artistic nature and rather... unique sense of humour made it enjoyable, to be sure, but it's the kind of movie you watch for the sake of having watched it. It reminded me of comical classics like 'Rat Race' and 'What's Up, Doc?'; but without the laid-back easy-to-watch nature.It's like someone took a classic comedy, filled it to its brim with characters on either side - without telling you who's a good guy and who isn't, and then cut it together like Inception; deliberately leaving the audience in the dark the whole time.It's funny, and delightful, and the protagonists are easy to love; but you would almost certainly need to watch it twice to take in the bombardment of story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

A Quirky Wes Anderson Classic,"The Grand Budapest Hotel, directed by Wes Anderson, secures a 6/10 for its unique style and classic Anderson quirkiness. While the film is undoubtedly a well-crafted piece, its distinct and somewhat eccentric approach might not resonate with everyone.The film is known for its visually stunning aesthetic, a hallmark of Wes Anderson's directorial style. The attention to detail in the set design and color palette is impressive, creating a visually pleasing and distinctive world. The narrative is whimsical and intricately layered, featuring a series of interconnected stories that are both amusing and intriguing.However, the very elements that make the film a classic in Wes Anderson's repertoire also contribute to its polarizing nature. The quirky humor and unconventional storytelling, while appealing to some, might be perceived as odd or off-putting to others.

The cinematography is great and pops off the screen.I like the plot, way its told and the setting. Some of my favorite actors are in this and the newer actors are great too.The timeline jumps and the hops in the plot are just right, enhancing the story.I don't know if this is an award winning movie, but very, very well done and the type that doesn't ask for too much investment from you but entertains well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Fiennes at his finest,"I totally understand some people find this movie boring, shallow, pretentious, all style and no substance etc. I'm not a huge fan of Wes Anderson and would have felt the same if it had not for one outstanding factor: Ralph Fiennes. He is spectacular here. I never thought he had so much comedic chop in him. He carries the whole movie almost single-handed, perfectly playing the haughty and suave but hopelessly insecure and lonely concierge. Forget other stellar cast, who play more or less cardboard cliche characters. Forget cinematography and production design, which are very pretty but unrealistic. For me this film was worth watching because of the amazing performance by the lead actor. I have to add that young Tony Revolori as the lobby boy was equally great. Together, the two make one of the best ""buddies"" in movies I've seen in recent years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Grand Buda pest-Grand night at the movies,I see the reviews here for this movie and must say that I am amazed as a 63 year old man (especially for the other gent who gave his age) this movie is just magical I really loved this and predict that it will beat the odds on shot (boyhood) for the best movie Oscar if there i8s any justice. Watch this with an open mind and it will delight you. I watched this not really knowing what to expect but found it to be a wonderland of intrigue . From the very beginning it will lead you through a kaleidescope of mystery and the way the stories all blend together really made me think that the money spent to watch this was well spent. As to people who walked out half way through it serves you right you needed to see the whole thing for all the pieces to fit,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Another point of view,"Okay so here is MY experience. People like or prefer different things and I'm aware that, like with ANY movie or show on IMDb, most reviews will come from fans: of either Wes Anderson or this genre for instance.So don't get mad or irritated when you get a point of view from someone with another view.I have watched many many many movies in my 50 years of life, being a true movie lover. And it has always been my experience that when a movie starts spending a lot of effort on 'artsy' stuff, like for instance ""filming-in-one-shot"" or overly great cinematography, it ALMOST ALWAYS just chips away at all other aspeccts a movie needs to be enjoyable. Like for instance a good driven storyline or compelling, ever developing characters.The extremely rare times a movie gets really artsy but still manages to keep the basic necessities going, it can be truly BRILLIANT and exhilarating indeed!!! A very good example of this in my humble opinion would be: 'Requiem for a Dream'.Well, I guess you already feel where I'm going with this. The Grand Budapest Hotel was no exception to this devastating rule to my disappointment.The movie is supposed to be a comedy, yet at 14 minutes into it, the corners of my mouth hadn't even moved into a curl ONCE. I recall at one time the guy said: ""She was shaking like a sh*tting dog"" and me wondering if that was maybe supposed to be one of the jokes I missed finding funny.At the 27 minute mark I had completely given up on the comedy part. But even apart from that I could search my entire soul and find not one single reason for me to want to keep watching. Yes there was a story going on (I DID notice that), but it was hardly gripping and I felt all I was doing was looking at the beautifully styled sets and listening to one overly poetic line after another. While completely forgetting to be actually fun or compelling.Oh yeah I forgot: like all the artsy stuff, another red flag that very often seems to lead to bad things is when a movie has 26 hollywood superstars in it.... In my moviewatching experience also that rarely lead to a fun or compelling movie.So yeah, don't shoot me for being the messenger of another point of view. I am not a Wes Anderson fan per se. But I am a big movie fan and The Grand Budapest Hotel just did not move me. Still I will give it an honest 6. You know, for all the artsy stuff and the poetic lines which were good in itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"The problem with Wes Anderson. Flat, X & Y and full of 90 degree right angles","I admire the effort and meticulous planning that goes into his scenes. It's a breath of fresh air to see a director take passion in the colour palette of a film and stylise it so. However, what happens to your actors when they can only walk either vertically or horizontally? It becomes flat. I get the overwhelming impression that Anderson has planned his scenes so much so that there is absolutely no spontaneity. I think this is probably the most frustrating film I have ever seen, mainly because of the amount of effort that has gone into it but the lack of exploration given to the actors over arches the entire production. It's close, but miles off at the same time. I literally had to turn it off half way through after the 100th symmetrical scene or a shot in profile / head on. What had happened to exploring the 3 dimension world the film is shot in. I actually feel like within 30 minutes his direction becomes lazy and he has forgotten what the emotion of film is all about. Incredible scenes are lost because of the direction being so caught up in its own aesthetic. It's almost like watching Pac man for 2 hours. Shame, obviously a great script.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Enchanting and Graceful,"This movie is one of the masterpieces in art films. I often felt the scenes were transpired straightly from strips of drawings. I am fond of black comedies. They are hard to contrive, execute and even more often perceived as tragic nonsenses.Two main characters interacted seamlessly. Articulately ridiculed lines made me laugh consistently. I would like to see an animated version of it. I think it would serve the purpose of humanity. I abhor swear words. I often feel since we are the only specie can use this sophisticated communicating skill. We would rather using it wisely than abusing it.

The way the music and sounds peak the senses and indulge you in the scenery and the small weird parts of the scenes. The characters are strange but meaningful to the story, the are very explicit and each has their own charismatic way of just being and belonging. And off course the big picture of the whole story that fits very well together and ties all the visuals, sounds well actually most of your senses in, I would like at times to have smell be art of it, fresh baked bread, the mountain air etc.It is just a very complete film and even though it doesn't take that long to tell the story, it works out very well and is just intriguing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Wes Anderson shares with us the whimsical goings on in his creative mind.,"I watched this movie twice. The first time I neglected to consider that it is a Wes Anderson movie. As such I tried to make sense of it in the usual way and, while I enjoyed it enough, my second viewing a few days later was much more fun. In fact, I'll go so far as to say this is one of the most fun movies I have seen in quite a while.The most common element of every scene is that there is nothing in common with normal expectations. Every scene is done in a very careful, particular style. Whether it be colors, or camera angles, or unexpected dialog, often all of these and more, the whole movie is a delight of invention.The phrase ""never a dull moment"" applies.The story has three layers, 1986, 1968, and 1932. It starts with the older author telling of his younger self meeting with a mysterious man who tells him of his past, in 1932, and that is the story featured. It is about how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel in a fictional place. It involved wealthy guests, a bisexual concierge, and a very new lobby boy, destined to become the old owner of the hotel.It has a great cast of some of the best actors, many of them typical participants in Wes Anderson projects. The story is fun, but it really is secondary. The filming and story-telling mechanism is the best aspect of this movie.I watched it again March 2017 and in February 2020, and each time found it as enjoyable as ever.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Not really grand.,"It's nice! Starting interesting, it develops misteriously but at half point it becomes obvious and thus tedious.

This movie makes you feel like you are taken to an fantasy/magical version of reality, while still not being supernatural. It reminded me a little of Tim Burtons recent style. An similar movie to this could be Hugo 2011. Also Amelie 2001. Maybe a sprinkle of "" A series of unfortunate events"".

Great...in spells,"Great...in spells. Also quite dull in spells.Broad feel of the is typical Wes Anderson: quirky, whimsical, sentimental, sometimes funny.

It is the third quarter or so where things get tedious and uninteresting. Essentially the movie becomes a silly common-or-garden chase movie.Performances are great.

I don't understand why some people who know that they are not fans of Wes Anderson's work have commented that they hated this film. His style is unique and if people don't get it or like it, the best approach would be to avoid it. Wes Anderson's contribution to cinema is legendary and he is one of my firm favourites.It's difficult to choose a specific aspect of this film which stands out, because it is uniformly excellent, and although Ralph Fiennes performance is central, all the performances however small (Bill Murray was a cameo and so were some others) were crucial and contributed to the whole.

"A beautiful, funny story that is just as smart as it is nonsensical","Wes Anderson's latest film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" opens at the elaborate Grand Budapest Hotel with a storied history located in the fictional former empire Zubrowka in Eastern Europe. Young Zero Moustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori) is an aspiring lobby boy for the famed concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). The elder takes Zero under his wing and the two begin a trek across mythical lands.As with recent Anderson films, this shares his distinctive artistic sense. Like he's telling a story through pictures. The story here is a quirky, idiosyncratic tale of mischievous and silly whimsicality. Random nonsense could also be a way to describe it. The plot, or a loose semblance of chapters of a related story, literally takes Mr. Gustave and Zero from satisfying old ladies, to art thieves, through a murder plot, to prison, a brief pause to fall in love, to escaped convicts and back to the noted Grand Budapest Hotel. It was quick and playful, also very far removed from any relatable sense of reality.But the interesting thing about the film is that it does serve as an odd viewpoint to the real, war-torn world of late 1930s Europe. Personally, I found the juxtaposition between the frivolousness of the story and the dark, grandiose themes of life to be too startling and moves the film even closer to random nonsense. However, this is also where the film shows off its unique, incredibly intelligent and endlessly witty dialogue. It is really funny and fits both the quirky, playful nature of the story and the darker tones of the times. The dialogue at least allows you to laugh your way through the film even if you don't form much interest in the story.As mentioned before, Wes Anderson is telling a story through pictures. Each shot is framed meticulously and symmetrically. I like his ""square"" way of telling more ludicrous stories. There are also a number of shot set-ups which allow for some funny jokes as the camera pans over to complete the scene. The production design is also very beautiful and fits the grand and eloquent, but also lonely, hotel. The colour palette this time around shifts more than usual, but the story also goes through a lot of phases. The hotel itself is bathed in a dull pink and purple, which is a gorgeous visual imagery for the overcast pall of communism and the lavish and hopeful lifestyles of its residents and employees.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is based on the writings of Stefan Zweig and it opens with a writer telling a story of an older Zero relaying the story of his life. Part of my issues with the film is that these characters don't resemble humans. Zero's motivations aren't clear and are not understandable, and Mr. Gustave is just crazy. And then they embark on an adventure that is just as odd as they are. The dialogue is hilarious and astute, and the landscape it all unfolds on is beautiful and elegantly created. It's a beloved film, but some will be unable to place themselves in that world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Does not deserve 1 star but nor does it deserve 8.4,"So, here I am again after trusting the IMDb rating only to be disappointed. Does this movie deserve the 1 star rating that I have given it? No. Does it deserve the bloated hyped 8.4? No. This movie is a 6. However I feel as though I owe to the IMDb community to help balance the rating.I was looking forward to this movie, excitedly anticipating it's release date. Visually, this movie had it all, which is what you would expect from a Wes Anderson movie, however, it did not have anything else. It was almost as though we are expected to be satisfied by just that. Don't get me wrong, I love and cherish most of his works. I mean Moonrise Kingdom has to be one of my all time faves..and Fantastic Mr Fox's genius screenplay will always be my cussing fave. But this movie felt empty, it lacked something. You cannot churn out the same visual beauty every time and expect the same hype, there needs to be innovation, whether it is visually, via screenplay or plot. This is what upsets me, there was no innovation. Without innovation there's nothing new, the punchlines are few and far in between, the plot was boring and character's were not well rounded.Maybe the money that should have been spent developing the above was spent sending armies of people to bloat this rating.

Very tightly made film,"Definitely a noteworthy film in its technicals. From the costumes, to the actors, to the story, to the cinematography, everything is very well made. The ensemble cast is irresistibly combined with the tragically interesting story with a very humorous touch to it.An author (Tom Wilkinson) recounts his story of visiting a dying grand hotel, in which the owner, (F. Murphy Abraham) sits him down and tells his story of how he became in possession of it, as he recounts his service as a lobby boy and his association with M. Gustave, (Ralph Fiennes) the hotel's concierge.The film is fast paced and very clever with its dark humor and dramatic hooks. Despite who may or may not be a bad guy, everybody is likable in some sense, from their goofy antics to their unusual appearances, (Willem Dafoe).The film looks beautiful. Its colors are vibrant and the camera style is amazing. Not being one on makeup or costumes, the costumes are very creative in this, complimenting the art direction and style of the settings. Everybody in this is irresistible, even small roles that include Bill Murray and Tom Wilkinson. Ralph Fiennes carries this film with an incredibly underrated character with irresistible charm.It's paced to perfection. It's tightly edited but it's not too fast paced. Its got an unusual humor to it as well. It's not really a black comedy because of how bright it is, but its got subtle dark touches here and there that come out of nowhere, the film is constantly unpredictable, but very easy to follow.In terms of film making, it's somewhat of a masterpiece.

Badass,"OK fine, I'm a Wes Anderson fan. I'm starting to gather that's a prerequisite for liking some of his movies. I like to think this one crosses over though.It's charming! It's wonderful. The characters are quirky but believable. The story is wacky but somehow holds water. It really feels layered and honest, and the convention of a story- within-a-story-within-a-story is used to excellent effect.If I had any complaints... hm. I can't think of any at the moment. I guess maybe I wish it was longer! It really held me captivated, and I know I sound like a gushy fanboy here but honestly I mainly like violent science fiction, so hopefully that lets you know I'm not just a total softie promoting things without weighing their merits.Anyway, if you are at all curious about this movie, I strongly recommend.

Delightful Black Comedy,"I've never been a fan of Wes Anderson . He's something of a one trick pony who makes black comedies with well known casts where the cast obviously enjoyed working on the film more than this audience member enjoyed watching them , That said when FILM 2014 reviewed this movie guest critics were falling over themselves to lavish praise on it especially the technical merits and the close attention to detail . Also you should bare in mind it picked up several Oscar nominations including winning a few Oscars and considering it was released in the Spring of 2014 about seven or eight months before the main big hitters with their eyes on rewards go on general release it seemed to have stuck out in many voters minds . Giving it a chance due to the acclaim it received I found myself very surprised as to how much I enjoyed itThis wasn't the case at the film's start . ""Oh dear"" I thought ""We're getting a story within a story as a narrator talks over a series of events . One thing I share in common with Robert McKee is an instinctive hatred of voice over since it's usually delivered in a clumsy manner which caused me to hate THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS with a passion and thought we'd be getting more of the same but I stuck with it for which I was rewarded with a brilliantly witty and delightful black comedyThe plot is relatively straight forward . A hotel concierge Gustave finds himself in himself hot water and the metaphorical water is going to get a lot hotter he finds himself in episodic dilemmas . I don't want to make it sound like it's an earth shattering plot because it's but Gustave is beautifully drawn and Ralph Fiennes makes the most of the part especially some wonderfully sardonic dialogue and insults .. He's an anti-hero with humanity and you find yourself greatly sympathising with his plight as well as laughing out loud at the absurd situations . Fiennes is excellent and one wonders why his performance wasn't nominated for more awards . He is at the apex of a wonderful cast though I should perhaps warn that despite a large number of well regarded actors most of them only appear in cameo roles . Perhaps the best performance from the supporting ensemble is Willem Dafoe as Jopling , a silent and sadistic assassin on the trail of Gustave and the house boy ZeroDespite some bad language and violence there is a very old fashioned feel to TGBH and that's not just because of its chronological setting . Wes Anderson must be a genuine film fan and I was constantly reminded of the great Michael Curtiz . Does Budapest appear in the title as a reference to the great Hungarian born film maker ? At other points in the movie I was reminded of THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and one chase scene reminded me of the best James Bond sequences . Typing that last line I was reminded of what a mess this film could have ended up as and yet it's a very consistent and involving film on both a narrative and visual level which I enjoyed watching",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Director Wes Anderson is at his quirky best with The Grand Budapest Hotel, which features a very funny performance from Ralph Fiennes, says Tim Robey","Dir: Wes Anderson Stars: Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Tilda SwintonIn his new comedy, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson has found an elegant solution to gripes about how stifling, how annoyingly perfect, his films can be. He ignores them wholeheartedly. Obsessive design which forbids any sense of spontaneity? Check. Feelings put in inverted commas, or swept aside to concentrate on the colour palette? Check that too. Non-devotees might be bracing themselves, but the scales could just as easily fall from their eyes when they sit down to watch this. The trouble is: it's wonderful. It does all of the above, and it's still wonderful. You could get light-headed on the pure fun of it, which unleashes fresh waves of fun-within-fun at every point where you worry it might dry up. There are three prologues, each nested within the last as storytelling conceits to bring us back, in stages, to 1932, and Chapter 1. Here we're introduced to the story's prime mover – a famous concierge called Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes), who is the meticulous heart and soul of his establishment, a monumental pink palace perched high up somewhere in a misty Mitteleuropean mountain range. The will of one eminent guest, an 84-year-old widow called Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis, becomes the contested centre of a farcical bust-up between Gustave and her money-grubbing family. Brief as it is, the role of this old lady is vastly enlivened by having a magnificently crusty and bizarre-looking Tilda Swinton play it. Madame D departs the Grand Budapest on the same day that a young lobby boy called Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) first comes to the concierge's attention. Gustave must school this pup in the ins and outs of the hotel, not least explaining his own peculiar role in the sex lives of its weathered residents. ""When you're young, it's all fillet steak,"" he tells his new protégé, ""but as you get older, you have to move on to the cheaper cuts.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Perfect mix of everything,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has it all: great actors, an interesting story-line, beautiful cinematography, a dreamlike set, and of course a brilliant director.Ralph Fiennes, who played M. Gustave, was the perfect concierge. He not only embraced the intimate role of the concierge, but he somehow ""completed"" those words on the screenplay in a way that most actors could not. I have to say that the entire cast made a stellar performance on this film, but sadly cannot name them all as I would run out of space to write the film review.M. Gustav and Zero's relationship throughout the film was a pleasure to watch. It was funny to see them from the very beginning, when they had first met, to the point where they trusted one another with their lives. In a way, they became the family they'd always missed.If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's style, the colours, the patterns, the comedy, the symmetry, and all that jazz--you won't be disappointed.

Wes Anderson's return to form continues,"Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Building on the success of Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel marks the recovery of Wes Anderson's directorial career. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, The Darjeeling Limited and Fantastic Mr. Fox were all commercial failures, but now he can be confident in the backing or producers and Hollywood money men to give him the artistic freedom a creative talent like him needs.The reason for the renewal is difficult to pin down. The brilliant cast certainly helps: a whole parade of famous names and faces, such as Adrien Brody and Harvey Keitel. Anderson has always had a talent for convincing stars to join him despite his very modest budget, but he has really outdone himself this time.Ralph Fiennes is a big factor in the central role. Until now, he has generally been thought of as a very serious actor, with gravitas and dignity aplenty, but GBH shows that he has also mastered the art of comic timing. His delivery of comedic lines is brilliant, as are his movements and gestures, playing on his his perceived seriousness to hilariously ridiculous effect.Anderson has always used obvious directorial flourishes and camera movements that deliberately draw attention to themselves, like the exaggerated movements of a mime or clown, but in this film it is taken to extremes. The models used for the exterior of the hotel and its environs are very obviously model-like. Not only is no attempt made to disguise this, it is actually gleefully emphasized. So prominent is Anderson's directorial presence that he is almost a character in the story.There is one very slight blemish: why does Anderson use a different star actress in every film? So many of the male actors return again and again, but not the women. Is there something about working with Anderson that puts them off? It's barely a mystery though, more of a curiosity, and judging by what we see on screen, they seem to be enjoying themselves as much as anyone.A key part of Wes Anderson's attraction to viewers is that he and his collaborators are obviously having tremendous fun, and they bring us along for the ride. His most successful films are the ones that convey that sense of fun best. I look forward to enjoying more from him in future.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Not my cup of tea,"It was actually painful to watch the entire film. I can see that it's trying to be funny but wasn't actually funny. It felt like the director is trying to say ""Hey, this is where you're supposed to laugh!"". Black comedy is hard to pull off and I'd say this one failed... with me at least.The number of big name casting and cameo didn't help either. And not needed. Each of them didn't have any ""performances"" so to speak. Just ""appearances""But even with everything aside, the story just isn't that interesting. If you peel off all the glamours and colors, the basic story is so... basic and uninteresting. And it just felt like the director tried to dress it up with actors and colorful editing. In a way, it felt like an ordinary girl putting on lots and lots of makeup.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
How didn't it won the cinematography Oscar?,"I finally watched ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and I can honestly say it was an experience that left a lasting impression on me. This film is undoubtedly Wes Anderson's masterpiece, and I could tell right away that I was witnessing something special. There's something about the way the film is crafted that gives it a unique identity.At first glance, some of the practical effects and prop work might seem a bit ""amateurish"", but I quickly realized that this is precisely what makes the film so special. Everything feels handmade, with a level of care and attention to detail that's rare to see. It's this authenticity that won me over.For me, the cinematography is the highlight of the film. It's a crime that it didn't win the Oscar for Best Cinematography because this is where the film truly shines. The way light and color are used to tell the story is simply genius. It's what made me want to see the film, even over a decade after its release.I'm a fan of many acclaimed directors, and I often draw inspiration from them for my own projects, but Wes Anderson was a name I hadn't fully explored until now. After watching this, I realize I've been missing out on a major source of inspiration. His way of storytelling, with its quirky humor and distinct aesthetic, is something I'll value much more from now on.The cast is incredible, and everyone seems perfectly suited to their roles. The makeup, costume design, and set design are so well-executed that they almost feel like characters themselves.In short, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a solid 10/10 for me. I have no complaints, just the desire to watch it again and dive deeper into Wes Anderson's work. I'm sure that you've already seen it, BUT if you haven't, you're missing out on a truly unique experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Complicated storytelling made simple,"That was an amazing watch. What stands out most is the cinematography, Fiennes performance, and style of storytelling. Most of this is so beautifully shot that it's serene at times. Andersons vision is so clear and unique throughout the whole film. Fiennes is perfect in his role but I also have to give credit to the side characters. Edward Norton and Adrien Brody were both so fun to watch on screen. The running joke of ""don't flirt with her"" is genius and improved an already sweet friendship. I appreciate how a very complicated form of storytelling is made simple and cohesive. I don't usually watch films like these but this was an amazing watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A compelling piece from beginning to end.,"I have just watched the Grand Budapest Hotel (and grand it is, indeed) for the first time and I was wowed beyond expectation. I must admit that I do take prior IMDb ratings into account before watching a movie and I was impressed by this film's high appraisal. Also keeping in mind the noise made by this movie a few years ago at the Oscars, I entered this movie with quite high expectations. This film is nicely paced, and instantly I was put into a trance by the beautifully designed set. I must give credit to Anna Pinnock and Adam Stauckhausen, they rightfully deserved the Academy award for production design on this film. This film is simply beautiful to the eye. This aspect is nicely complimented by the intricate and aesthetically pleasing costume design. The star-studded cast definitely positively impacted my experience. I appreciated the smaller roles played by A-list actors such as Owen Wilson and Bill Murray (Wes Anderson regulars) and others including Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton. The acting in this movie is stellar, especially considering that this type of film/performance is not often seen by mainstream present-day audiences. This is not necessarily your run-of-the-mill movie, but in my opinion that is not a bad thing. Although not typical, I would say most movie-going audiences would enjoy this film as I did. The Grand Budapest Hotel balances just the perfect amount of bizarreness, creativity, sentimentality, independency, and story-telling ability to craft a one of a kind piece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Inspiring dialogs and a bit of Sherlock Holmes,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has inspiring dialogs of refined language. A movie that trusts its viewer, it shows no fear of oblivion and omission. It is not a historical movie, although it uses a historical setting. In its pictorial beauty and its subtle humor, always keeping a distance to the narrated, it can be described of what is a movie with the poignancy of ""The Fall"" combined the irony of Woody Allen.The Grand Budapest Hotel is not a movie of dull ambiance, but it is also far from being tacky. It has some elements of Sherlock Holmes, or closer to Woody Allen, ""Scoop"", it is romantic, ironic, and driven by its characters and the magnificently narrated story. Typical elements of an romantic piece of art, it is also reflecting on art itself. It deals with the consequences of the Nazi invasion, but purposely not in a historical flavor. The insignia of the ""SS"" is replaced by ""ZZ"". This is a story of Gustave and Zero. The girlfriend of young lobby boy Zero, Agatha, is much more of a symbol for Zeros progress in poetry and arts than a character.If there had been bears and prostitutes, I would have suspected John Irving as the writer of the script: A story of a boy growing up with his Idol, being separated for a while only to reunite later. Love affairs with older women and boyish adventures. Elements we know well from Irving. But more importantly the movie shares his passion for details in a passionately narrated story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"The Grand Budapest, What a wild ride!","The notoriously quirky film director Wes Anderson strikes again with his latest academy award nominated film, The Grand Budapest Hotel. This film takes place in a fictional world set in the 1930's between World Wars and depicts the eccentric life of Gustave H (played by Ralph Fiennes), the hotels concierge and his sidekick known as lobby boy. As credit to Mr. Andersons talents he has assembled a star studded cast with brief appearances from major Hollywood actors such as Bill Murray, Jude Law, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton, and Willem Dafoe just to name a few. This film tells the humorous adventure story of a hotel concierge and his apprentice lobby boys' journey as they steal a priceless painting and attempt to outrun the many adversaries that try to get in their way. The underlying theme throughout this movie is bonding through mentorship. Although Gustave is not the best role model from a moral standpoint, he immediately sees himself in the young lobby by and takes him under his wing. Through their crazy adventures together they learn to rely on each other and eventually Gustave lets his young apprentice know how proud of him he is. Virtually every scene in this film ties back into the theme; these two characters are completely reliant on one another. A great example of this is the prison scene where lobby boy aids in Gustave's escape only to be lectured for not being prepared enough. Later in the film lobby boy saves the day when the pair sneak back into the hotel to retrieve their prized painting. While watching this film I am reminiscent of the theme in life aquatic (coincidently another Anderson film) where another corky character named Captain Zissou takes the crew under his wing for one last crazy journey teaching them along the way. Wes Anderson directs his films in a very unique way. The color used in this film is what really stood out to me as a viewer. Although this movie was a little dark in humor the colors were vivid and plentiful, perhaps purposely done to contrast the heavy parts of the storyline. The hotel itself is pink in a setting of a snowy and gray mountaintop town; this seems to underline the tone of the film perfectly. Another impressive technique in this film was the angles used. The director did a fantastic job of making the scary characters more daunting by shooting them from the ground up, specifically Joplin (Willem Dafoes character). The chase scenes made a very small man seem very scary by portraying him in dark colors and low angles giving off the appearance of extreme power and fear. In conclusion I feel this movie was very well directed and the storyline keeps the viewer interested. Although I don't care for this type of film it was interesting and at time hilarious. The theme stays consistent throughout this film and has a solid ending the leaves everyone happy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
It's a joy - because just when you think it might droop - it picks up a new colour,"Poinless describing the plot as it's surreal. There's visual joy in this movie from the start. Animation, hyper-reality, backdrop, green-screen, cartoon, It hops about in the most delightful way. All the central cast are great -and all play just the right ""tone"" for their character. There's cameos , most of which are fine, except Goldblum who does his ham schtick as usual and is greasy and creepy , as usual. This whole fim is stand-up unique.

"artsy and humerous, but what in the hell did i watch?","I heard of it being a classic must-watch, so i watched it. It's one of those movies that apparantly requires a certain taste for the lightheartidly absurd, if I had to describe it as anything.It borderlines arthouse material, with every single scene being centered to the last inch. If anything, this movie continues to grab your attention by putting every character, in ever moment dead-center. You have no idea if this even takes place on planet earth, or in a parallel reality. The country in which it takes place is somethting vaguely German-European and when there is a sporadic mention of a war -an element that is marketed to be a key plot point but really the movie is the same if it were without it - they even go as far as renaming SS to ZZ. I mean... what?The story doesn't have much to it - it's a man telling a story, about another man telling a story on how he was the protegé of an esteemed congierge of the dubious hotel. How said hotel has fallen into ruin in the first place is hardly mentioned, and the story that you'd expect - about the hotel itself you'd presume - becomes a weird tale on art thieves, a dead widow and a shady testament. Could be fun, and it kinda is, but the manner in which it all is told is silly to say the least. Something monty-python like posh slapstick humour almost. So yeah, weird and silly, but strangely amusing at the same time. Still wondering why the hell some characters were portrayed as being a vampire or werewolf without ANY reason for them to be those things in this premis! 
 
All in all: masterpiece? naah. The only thing masterpiece worthy here is the acting. Too bad Tilda Swinton had such a short role - I love that woman in every role she plays! Ralph Fiennes' posh but foul-mouthed caharcter is a delight, there are some teeny tiny roles for Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and Tony Revolori has a very endearing character.

Not Funny,Rented on video and nearly switched off. Don't know what the fuss is all about. Didn't like Moonrise Kingdom either. Rubbish. How this type of film wins a Golden Globe confirms either I am completely out of touch or the awards are. Not seen Birdman but put off by the fact it won a Golden Globe. Saw a useless film starring Brad Pitt called Tree of Life or something similar. Waste of money producing. Then again Shakespeare in Love and Ordinary People won Oscars for best movie.

The story is full of absurdities. Actually, the main theme of the movie is not about the story itself. Instead, the moral of the story is the true thing the story wants to tell. There are lot of opinions about what the movie wants to tell. For me, I think the hotel manager represents the old European gentlemen.

Escapism perfected,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (tGBH) somehow resembles going into an antique shop full of toys from your youth. They may be toys by definition, but they no longer represent toys - kids of today would barely know what to do with them. Intead they represent inostalgia with a whiff of escapism. Or... tGBH is like a box of chocolates for grown ups - lots of different flavours, initially, camouflaged in a generic layer of dark chocolate, that burst into unexpected flavours and trigger, equally, unexpected memories and sensations.If that description sounds somewhat ""out there"" - your mindset is heading in the appropriate direction for what you may be about to watch. And if it sounds personal, that probably is the greatness of tGBH doing its thing - triggering different emotions in different viewers. Wes Anderson allows the viewer full access to, not only his own but also, the viewers world of fantasy and escapism. Making a movie showpiecing your own fantasy world is one thing - triggering the viewers mind is leagues beyond.Wes Anderson does such a stellar job; one almost gets the impression that the film is an, all but forgotten, favourite from the past - and arguably it is. What triggers your personal experience has arguably ""been there all along"". The sense of recognition is ""just"" filmmaking genius. A second viewing may, very well, have a completely different end result as may a third and a fourth...tGBH offers not a plot to follow - it offers a plot to lead. If you actively are looking for ""the"" story line - you probably won't find it. If you actively look for ""things that are wrong"" - you probably will find them. And finally; if you go in relaxed and just let the Grand Budapest Hotel present it's own version of hospitality, chances are wou will be content at checkout - and possibly planning your next trip.It is, when it comes to reviews and recommendations, a big ask - to suggest watching anything less critically. On rare occasions, and this is arguably such an occasion, the movie is worthy of ""letting yourself being hypnotised"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Nothing like it.,"The Grand Budapest Hotel Follows the story of Gustave played by Ralph Fiennes the concierge of the Grand Budapest hotel and his lobby boy Zero played by Tony Revolori. I takes place at the time they steal a priceless piece art from a dead patron of the Grand Budapest Hotel and are forced to go on the run with plenty of third parties hunting them.The best word i can use to describe the direction of the Grand Budapest hotel by Wes Anderson is meticulous. Everything shot feels well thought out with everything centered to the screen. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a rare original treat for movie goers with an enormous cast and plenty of cameos to go with it. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, and that is probably due to Ralph Fiennes who steals the show as Gustave H in every scene that he is in. There are plenty of humorous moments that made me chuckle in the movie but none that really made me laugh out loud. The movie can feel a little overwhelming at times with a cast of that size when the scenes are generally brief and refer to characters from previous scenes, so keep up!The best thing about this movies though is its originality. At no time during the movie did i know how it would turn out for Gustave and Zero, or anyone else for that matter.Wes Anderson has put together a movie thats a good time at the cinema that doesn't have a dull moment.

Nothing more than a murder mystery with obsessively detailed visuals,"This is the first Wes Anderson movie I've ever watched, and given it's supposed to be its masterpiece, I think it will be the last one. In fact, I could just stand to watch half of it, and decided it wasn't worth wasting the rest of my time so just read the rest of the argument.When I watch a movie, I wanted to have some emotion behind it, and to teach me something. The reason why didn't like this movie (and probably, Wes Anderson's particular style) is that I felt there was nothing in it besides its visuals, this perfectionist shots and stiff way of acting. All the scenes look alike, and all actors act in the same way: stiff, inexpressive. It didn't seem funny to me at any point.Even if the plot made up for it (which is based on a book by Zweig), the execution of the film just spoils it. This very plastic, very materialistic outlook of the movie, with an obsession with this beautiful visuals, just seems a way for the author to conceal the shallowness of the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Whimsical Elegance and Faint Shadows: A Journey Through 'The Grand Budapest Hotel',"Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a film that unfolds like a beautifully bound book, each page a window to a world both familiar and fantastical. The film is a confectionary tale of a bygone era, told with the precision of a master watchmaker. Anderson's meticulous attention to detail is evident in every frame, every costume, and every line of dialogue, creating a cinematic experience that is as rich in visual splendor as it is in narrative depth.The story, set between the wars in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, follows the adventures of the hotel's concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), and his protégé, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). Fiennes delivers a performance that is both flamboyant and nuanced, embodying a character who is at once a dandy and a man of great depth and loyalty. Revolori, as the young lobby boy, brings a quiet strength and innocence to the role, serving as our eyes and ears into this eccentric world.The film is a pastiche of genres, blending comedy, drama, and a touch of thriller, all while paying homage to the literary works of Stefan Zweig. It's a narrative nesting doll, with stories within stories, each layer peeling back to reveal more about the characters and the world they inhabit. The screenplay is a marvel of construction, with Anderson's signature dialogue that is both witty and poignant.The production design and cinematography are nothing short of breathtaking. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself is a character, its pastel façades and opulent interiors providing a stark contrast to the growing darkness of the world outside its walls. The use of miniatures and matte paintings gives the film a storybook quality that is both charming and surreal.However, at times, the whimsy can feel overwrought, and the meticulousness that is Anderson's hallmark can come across as self-indulgent. The pacing is uneven, with some scenes lingering a touch too long, while others feel rushed. The narrative, for all its cleverness, can at times be too convoluted, leaving the viewer to untangle the threads of the various subplots.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" remains a testament to the power of storytelling. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of art as a refuge, a place of beauty and wonder in a world often devoid of both. Anderson has crafted a film that is not just a visual feast but an emotional journey, one that resonates with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a film that celebrates the human spirit in all its flawed glory. It is a love letter to a bygone era, a time capsule of a world that perhaps never was but one that feels as real as any memory. Anderson's vision is one of hope, a belief that even in the darkest of times, there is beauty to be found, stories to be told, and life to be lived to the fullest. And in that, he has created not just a film, but a work of art that stands as a beacon of creativity and imagination in a sea of cinematic conformity.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Pink Panther rides again!,"Wes Anderson serves up what might be called a 'romp-com' with this between-the-wars tale of the misadventures of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), concierge at a splendid spa hotel which manages to be located simultaneously in the Alps and Eastern Europe. Falsely accused of the murder of one of the hotel regulars (Tilda Swinton, made to look like a cross between Edna Everage and Miss Havisham), Gustave and his apprentice escape from prison and go on the run, aided by a 'mafia' of continental concierges.Gustave is more than somewhat reminiscent of Inspecteur Clouseau. Fiennes plays him with an appropriate klutziness that often pleasingly evokes the late great Peter Sellers. There are scenes which appear to pay homage to Stanley Kubrick (THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT) and even Stanley Kramer (IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD). There's an Alpine chase which calls to mind several ski sequences from the Bond franchise. F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody and Willem Defoe give fruity supporting performances; Owen Wilson and Bill Murray are among the many stars who contribute walk-ons, presumably just for the kudos of being in a Wes Anderson movie.This is a monumentally daft and old-fashioned movie, sometimes hammy, sometimes hysterical. There are a few misfires; the story-within-a- story-within-a-story is clunky (providing roles for Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson); the use of Miniatures is painfully obvious.

The Cast Outshines The Overall Film,"I have only seen a few Wes Anderson films and I still haven't understood the tremendous love people give him. His style is vastly different from anything in Hollywood right now but I cant help but think of a film like Dr. Strangelove as an inspiration for Andersons career. Now obviously when I say I haven't understood the love for his films doesn't mean I don't like them. I thought Moonrise Kingdom was extremely interesting and unique, as is The Grand Budapest Hotel. But as far as a movie-going experience I just don't think his style fits my liking.With that said, I think he always gets the most out of his actors. Especially in certain comedic moments I think the performances are fantastic. The film can be outrageous at times but its when the film becomes self aware that it really shines. There's something about movies that know they can be crazy and play off of it that separate it from other movies. The film also has many dark comedic moments such as just shaking off deaths without thinking twice. Dark comedy really only works when you have actors that can sell the moment. Ralph Fiennes was perfect for Gustave and I'm sure will be considered come award season.Even though the movie is only 100 minutes long, it does drag at certain moments and I found myself drifting for a few moments. The overwhelming amount of celebrity cameos were cool but most only felt like it was just the actor acting. Owen Wilson was much too easily recognizable to my liking but Dafoe and Murray were great in the small but crucial roles. Might you ask what the point of the film was? Well it seems to be about trying to find the last remaining glimpses of hope left in humanity and Gustave was one of the few left who loved people and believed in them.+Fiennes was spectacular+how many great actors in one film?+dark comedy-drags at times-some celebrities were too easily recognizable7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Pretentious? Nope. Fun? O yes.,"I was put off watching this film by the polarised reviews on IMDB, then watched it and realised exactly why some of those reviews were so polarised - because some were looking for more in the film than a tall-tale beautifully and wonderfully told. To me it succeeds in telling that tale remarkably well. Some say it's pretentious, over-long and makes poor use of a ""stellar"" cast - I'd say it's none of those things myself, indeed the ""stars"" taking part might even be glad (and proud) they got to play even a small role in this truly remarkable, fantastic and silly-fun film.

Good fun. Don't take it too seriously.,"The Grand Budapest Hotel... is quirky, odd, slightly off-colour and something you might watch if you don't want to tax your brain too much.Very pretty to look at, if you like scarlet and pink and turquoise all in the same place with some wonderful cinematography.I thoroughly enjoyed it except for the hideous cliché of the cat out the window... I loathe things that make out animal cruelty is funny... and some other bizarre gore which didn't seem to really fit well with the theme, quirky as it all was... this was a huge put-off for me, like finding out in the middle of a fairy tale that someone's been raped.And then at about the 58 minute mark it got stupid for about 5 long, long minutes and annoyed me for another dumb clichéd period of time.The other wild and weird stuff was quite fun. In a different mood I might have hated it but I can't see that in another different mood I would have liked it better.Great cast, all superbly acted, as they always do, so they really redeemed this movie almost entirely.

The Grand Budapest Hotel welcomes audiences to the most whimsical and characteristic lodging cinema has to offer.,"War-torn Zubrowka. 1932, '68 and '85. A grandiose inn towers over the frosty mountainous peaks, accessible by rickety cable cars. Its halls, like a fabergé egg, wrapped in decorative garnishments. Jewelled classicism haunts the ornate corridors, tainted glows guiding visitors to their designated suites. International guests, brimming with eccentricity, seeking warmth within the inn's own hearth. Employees upholding the luxurious lavishment that surrounds the building's legacy. These descriptions are, of course, illustrating the proud member of the Society of the Crossed Keys that is The Grand Budapest Hotel.Film, in all its expansivity, offers a multitude of poignancy within each story that is told. Some depict historic events in an attempt to remind audiences of humanity's past mistakes, others strive for emotive reflection within their searing drama. Anderson though, no matter where your opinion lies in terms of his trademark aesthetics, is a distinctive storyteller through and through, as if reciting a bedtime tale. Very rarely, the simplest of stories can be the most effective when manipulated by a distinctive style that exudes an abundance of personality. No convoluted twists. No melodramatic sorrow. No burdensome themes. Just good old fashioned capers. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a reminder that film can combine artistic integrity with general entertainment to form a crowd-pleasing feature without resorting to archetypal traits. It is, without a doubt, tapping on the edge of mastery.Through three differently adorned timelines, Anderson's comedy-drama depicts the story of an unlikely friendship between the hotel's concierge and newly recruited lobby boy, as they embark on several misadventures to prove the innocence of a wrongly accused murder.First and foremost, let's address the obvious. Every single frame in this feature can be extrapolated, printed on a canvas and exhibited in an art museum. Anderson, inhibiting his inner Kubrick, meticulously positions his actors, props and camera in such a mesmerising way that it can only be surmised as art. Whether that be precariously placing Fiennes' arm on a counter or dictating hierarchical power by positioning actors far away from each other. It's purposeful to accentuate Anderson's beloved visual flair. His trademark visual style, involving symmetrical compositions, exterior and interior tracking shots, snap-zooms etc., explicitly grants the hotel itself an abundance of character. The introductory segment expends precious limited minutes in detailing the very foundations of the building, most notably the various rooms that occupy its floors, and does so through epigrammatic cinematography that alludes to embellished imagination.Anderson's story flows beautifully throughout, constantly introducing eccentric characters into the eclectic mix of talent. Gustave's flamboyant yet nonchalant persona juxtaposed Zero's monotonously blunt personality, but it is with this stark contrast that the film proudly expresses its ability to marinate polar opposites. Anderson's screenplay bursting with energy, providing supplement to his perceptible approach, granting every single character memorability and characterisations. The odd expletive or two emphasising the hilarity that ensues within Gustave's misadventures, yet bestowing an equilibrium in visual and literary comedy. I recall my initial viewing being an experience of astonishment, by just how much disposition was embedded within the script for such a small runtime.Every cast member embraced Anderson's aesthetic appeal to maximise their characterisation. Fiennes, in particular, was sublime and withheld the ability to switch between passive aggressive to sarcastically calm beautifully. Revolori battling against Fiennes' domineering demeanour perfectly, each assisting each other in becoming that inch closer to perfection. But even members who had minor roles, including Anderson favourites Swinton, Wilson, Schwartzman and Murray, made a massive impression within the hotel. Costumes were exceptional, exhibiting vintage European cultures without hyperbolising its attire.Desplat's score, ranging from a balalaika to traditional orchestral instruments, elevated the surrounding alpine environment that the hotel was built upon. And, finally, praise must be given to the brief animations that were intertwined. From the skiing chase to the mounting of cable cars, the handcrafted nature of these segments, again, aided in producing personality to Anderson's feature. Especially the introductory tracking shot of the Grand Budapest, which was clearly crafted from layered card and agglutinated together.The Grand Budapest Hotel is brimming with intricacies that enable it to be so much more than just a standard comedy-drama. It's a masterful exercise in combining character-driven dialogue with a contemporary visual style, bestowing a mass appeal upon the colossal front doors of the hotel. Quirky, vivacious and aggressively funny, it secures a director's ambition into the realm of auteurism. It is, in my humble opinion, Anderson's greatest cinematic accomplishment and receives an elusive perfect rating from myself. And remember: ""Rudeness is merely the expression of fear"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Nice To See This Director Hitting His Stride,"I usually don't like Wes Anderson films but I truly enjoyed this one. I understand what Anderson has been trying to do by creating self contained worlds for a story to be told, but I found his past efforts failed because the set design and acting were simply not good enough. For this type of thing to work everything has to be 100% great. Most of the previous productions were OK and a person could sit there and enjoy playing make pretend, but to realize such a peculiar individual vision everything must be spot on. In Grand Budapest Hotel there seem to have been no holds barred and it's obvious that a greater than usual amount of effort went into its realization. Every bit of the story has many layers of narration that depend upon each other to tell the tale, and the viewer has a fantastic time connecting all the bits together. It's fun to watch this film and it presents beautifully. It's nice to see this director hitting his stride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Charming movie,"Beautiful aesthetic throughout this film, eloquent dialogue and strong acting performance by Ralph Fiennes! Just looking at the colors in this film feels like watching visual ASMR, combined with a classy cinematic retro style this is just awesome.What I did not like about this film is the plot itself. It does not seem very interesting to me and I was not finding myself particularly emotionally invested on how it would turn out.

Wes Anderson does it again!,"""Did he just throw my cat out of the window?""If you were to walk blind folded into a movie, you'd only need 5 seconds to recognize you are watching a Wes Anderson film. His quirky sense of humor and stylized films are so unique that he manages to draw us in to this colorful world effortlessly. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception, and once again Anderson introduces us to a quirky setting full of dysfunctional yet amusing characters. In my opinion there was no better setting for an Anderson film than a fictional country in Eastern Europe like the one in The Grand Budapest Hotel where these gigantic and beautiful ancient castles fit his style perfectly. At times his films feel like you are turning the page of an illustrated book from one scene to the next and that is what is so unique about his style. I am a huge fan of his films and wasn't disappointed with his latest effort although I wouldn't consider it amongst his best work (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Moonrise Kingdom are my favorites). I do acknowledge however that his films tend to grow on me upon rewatches so it may manage to make it near the top of my list in the future. Once again watching an Anderson film proved to be a wonderful and unique experience, and I laughed hard during many scenes. Anderson never seems to lose his touch as there are several memorable moments throughout the film.No one can deny Wes Anderson's creativity and it is just a pleasure to experience what his quirky mind is going to come up with next. The dialogue is brilliant once again and several characters stand out. Ralph Fiennes in the lead role as the hotel concierge is brilliant as is his apprentice, Tony Revolori. The two have great chemistry together as Fiennes' character sort of becomes the parent figure of the young lobby boy, which Anderson always loves to explore in his films. The epic cast was brilliant as well, and it was good to see Anderson's frequent collaborators on screen together once again. They may not have much screen time, but Anderson fans will appreciate every second they are on screen (Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Tilda Swinton). The highlight of the film for me were the spectacular and hilarious chase scenes through the gorgeous Alps background and Willem Dafoe's comedic performance. The way Anderson edited those scenes was extremely funny as well. I really liked the quirky soundtrack which just added to my overall enjoyment of the film. I only wish the film would've explored the romantic relationship between Tony Revolori and Saoirse Ronan a bit more and that it wouldn't have concluded in such an open ended way. It was still a lot of fun!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson At His Best; A Must See,"Wes Anderson's latest film was an absolute treasure. It was perfectly in line with Anderson's current cinematographic identity, with a visually perfect aesthetic, consistently vibrant colors and symmetrical balance in every shot. Having already seen a majority of the director, writer and producer's films, this was certainly one of his best. My only complaint with the film was the unusual use of gore, with which I believe the filmmaker was testing the waters. There were three brief, but alarmingly bloody and violent scenes, which did not exactly fit in with the style of the film or the director and were all-out unusual and unneeded. I hope that in his future films, Anderson omits this type of shock factor in the form of unnecessary gore.The film took the style of a story, within a story, within a story narrative. The bulk of the story took place in the far past, with the lobby boy, Zero played by a relatively new actor, Tony Revolori, and Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, the concierge of the titular hotel. As per usual Anderson used some of his favorite actors for this movie, namely Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Adrien Brody and Edward Norton, all of whom shined in their roles large or small. Fiennes led this all-star cast and was constantly charming and kept the viewers at the edge of their seat. At just over an hour and a half, this instant classic is certainly worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Recursive Self-Spoofery,"This movie is a visually stunning scenario that never becomes a story worth hearing. The literary artifices of nesting narrations and the picture-book-like montages are not garnishes on a sumptuous plot, but just morsels plotted into a course of snacks that never makes a meal.This hodgepodge results from the assemblers' (Anderson et al.'s) desire to assemble plot-components into a movie scenario--the consequence of absence of desire to tell a story the writers feel, with any passion whatsoever, compelled to tell.Because the writers know we'll know they're recycling leitmotifs of the sexually frustrated dowager, petty infighting among inheritors, homoeroticism, etc., and motifs of archetypal fascism and Nazism, etc., to keep it from becoming totally insipid, they resort to spoofing their own story even as they're telling it. But rather than cleverly crafted comic relief in the midst of what admittedly is elegance of style and diction--rather than match that elegance--the spoofery is just vulgar. The jar of that vulgarity might make you laugh, until you realize, if this is irony, it's just not that funny, and it doesn't seem to be for the sake of anything other than self-spoofery. Hell, the movie doesn't even attain campiness. At times it gives you the sense of being told, ""Oops, you caught us tinkering with leitmotifs and primal archetypes; we'll have to poke fun at ourselves to hide our triteness and banality as story-crafter hacks."" The story is not told from the heart, or if it is, the writer'(s) heart is in the wrong place.Tony Revolori as the lobby boy ""Zero"" is of course the movie's saving grace, and gracefully and sweetly does he play his rôle.Conclusive Ranking: Splendiferousness of set design and conception à la the best children's illustrated books (probably all the more appreciable under the influence of psychotropics or hallucinogens) – 10; Tony Revolori as Zero – 10; Primal archetype capturing – 8; Character development – 4; Plot – 3; Passion – 0; Six criteria total score – 35; Overall rating – 5.8",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

a wonderful caper brimming with pleasant marvel,"This is simply another marvelously crafted piece, specifically the 8th, by auteur Wes Anderson, whose artistic flavor and ability manifest in its meticulously arranged camerawork and grandiose sets, the rich nature of the soundtrack, and the gliding pace, given even more vitality by the performances of a straight-up stupendous cast. The combined presentation is phenomenal, I'll argue.From the opening shot, all attention is placed on the scenery, a motley of color and positively baroque environments. From the floridity of the Grand Budapest Hotel to the brutalist nature of the prison, there's intense mise en scène all around; Wes Anderson did incrediblely well to build a world, boxy yet vast. All of this is well-framed under the lucid camerawork, a sort of hovering betta delicately absorbing both the most penitent scenes and most beautiful scenery at once as it follows the cast throughout, as they indulge in their eccentricity and plots, to the tune of the balalaika-heavy soundtrack, which can range from bubblingly mellow to bubblingly anxious. The acting is mostly underplayed but by no means diluted; the humor and general dialogue is executed in a natural yet purposeful cadence, coupled with fluid motion. I've had a couple of chortles watching, and was heavily invested throughout. I honestly can't recommend this enough.Now, issues some might have: The plot acts only as a vehicle for all other facets of the film itself, and by extension the characters may come across as superficial. I honestly don't view this as a defect; I figured the intention was to impress the audience with an absurd caper and enjoyed it greatly under that assumption. All the same, because of this, the film is sorta hit-or-miss, depending on what you're looking for or to resonate with. I suppose most of all Wes Anderson films are.Still, I recommend giving this a watch, if only to appreciate the style that penetrates this film immensely.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"The most excellent tale, told in the most beautiful way","The story of the Grand Budapest Hotel is told in the most beautiful, artistic and amazing way. Set in four levels based on the story of M.Gustav and Zero, told by an elderly Zeron, a young Author (Jude Law) and his elder self (Tom Wilkinson). Level 2: Author Introduction (Tom Wilkinson) - again very brief, as an old man is to tell the tale of his visit to the Grand Budapest. Level 3: Author Visits Hotel (Jude Law) and meets Zero (F.Murray Abraham) - this is many years after the main story and Zero who is now a lot older is there to tell the tale of how he came to own the hotel, by the visiting Author Level 4: Bell Boy Zero and M'Sieur Gustav (Ralph Fiennes) - the main story. Beautifully told story, it is so amazingly beautiful. M.Gustav is the most wonderful eccentric concierge. The imagery is as beautiful as you can find and you will see similarities between this and The Fantastic Mr Fox. Lastly you will find many familiar faces popping up, including Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, Léa Seydoux, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and Owen Wilson.It is one of my favourite films ever, simply it has been put together with the finest detail and a quirky fun and elegant tale.

Geeky Randy's summary,"Charming and adventurous flick about concierge Fiennes teaming up with lobby boy Revolori to prove his innocence after being accused of murder. Both leads are terrific and director Anderson's unique filmmaking style has really found its place with the masses, earning a Golden Globe and even two Oscar nominations. The film gets up and running incredibly quickly, almost too fast for a movie that takes place in a book within a flashback and within a second flashback—Anderson uses three different aspect ratios to inform viewers of where we are in the timeline. At 100 minutes, it feels like the cast and crew downed several quad-venti's and got to filming; seriously, the movie may have actually been better with a little fat, maybe an extra 20 or 30 minutes just so the audience can absorb what's going on.

"Impressive, if not for all","Wes Anderson is generally a film maker you either ""get"" or ""don't get"" ; not getting him does not necessarily reflect the quality of the movie. I fall into the camp who can never quite get on board with him, so it is great praise to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this light soufflé of a movie. There may be argument about a certain emotional distance from the central theme, or that the film is ultimately less consequential than it should be; in the background of this caper is a looming fascism; the lightness seems at odds with the potential drama of the original writings from which the film takes inspiration. There is also a certain lack of development of characters, although something about the tone allows for this; in any case, it is made up for, to some extent, by the fact that the thing is rammed full of mostly welcome cameos, clearly having a lot of fun with the little moments they have. In another work this may have proved distracting, but in fact here it seems to enhance the enjoyment of events. It is a fresh, offbeat, well designed and choreographed piece; the storybook flourishes, the wonderfully vibrant dialogue, sets designed to withing an inch of life, camera moves and cinematography make the whole thing very sweet and amusing to behold, and this is without mentioning rather splendid, comical central turn from Ralph Fiennes.So, to use an appropriate analogy, I found it to be like admiring a really well baked and decorated wedding cake, with all the clever, beautiful trimmings, but when taking a bite, finding there's an ingredient you're not particularly keen on. It doesn't take away from how much you admire the work that went into it, but you can't say you enjoyed it as much as everyone else seems to have done. All credit to Anderson for creating what is clearly a smart and audacious work of art, and it is with this in mind I rate it as highly as I do, but would I watch it again? Perhaps once, to see what I missed, but after that, I don't think so. Many would, though, and I can't ignore that fact.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Grand Budapest: A completely non-vapid exercise in style,"Excluding Uwe Boll, Wes Anderson has likely the most distinct visual style in modern film. His set-pieces brim with colour and detail, yes, but his most obvious stylistic abnormality resides in the presentation of his bijou quirks to the audience. Instead of intensely revealing all that is going on in a scene with a single brutally long tracking shot - a la Inarritu -- Anderson opts instead for the short and sweet, a usually center-framed ground- level shot with a large depth of field that moves only on a rail, pivot, or gratuitous zoom. If it were anyone other than Anderson behind the wheel, the film that adopted this style would surely devolve into monotonous repetition by the ten-minute mark.But then you have something like this:You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant... oh, f*** it.And that is precisely why I love Wes Anderson. His dialogue, and for that matter, his set-pieces and even the most trivial of details are all imbued with joyous irreverence, narrative glee, and fantastic explosion of shapes and colours that even the most CGI-encrusted extravaganzas couldn't even come close to comparison. At times, his visual style becomes the substance of the film that carries it from scene to scene, never allowing the film to segue into monotony.The plot itself is an afterthought compared to the film's visual euphoria. However, the performances, specifically Fiennes', are not. Fiennes plays M. Gustave, the legendary proprietor of The Grand Budapest Hotel, who is charged with the murder of the woman (Tilda Swinton) who left him a priceless painting, Boy with Apple. Fiennes exploits his character's wide spectrum of comportment -- from surprising eloquence to equally surprising vulgarity -- with meticulous skill, charmingly deadpan in every single line he delivers.The film is a jumble of quirks and lightness until its conclusion. It suddenly takes a sombre tone, ending on a rather heavy note. Anderson is able to pull off this tonal shift by maintaining his unique style throughout, but the ending is effective in itself. It leaves the audience simultaneously satisfied and sad, urging them to think about the implications of what they have just witnessed: a lovely film built around a madcap style that explores the extent of the narrative, the pure act of storytelling itself, and the outer reaches of what we call empathy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

A much pleasing watch.,"I am most impressed by the story telling: it is fast and propelling. I was almost always kept seated, due to the feeling that the climax was about to happen. This and the style of abrupt cutting between scenes reminds of Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. There is something comedic and intriguing about them.
The main characters are well built, and the acting did enough to demonstrate it.
The visual is stunning, as I expected before viewing. There is one short sexual shot, and one violent-implying shot, which is great. Keep it natural, no need for PG-13 :D
The anachronistic-ally noble behaviors and etiquette of the main character was a fun to watch. (This certainly reminds me of Kingsman). By showing such usually-ridiculous man under such a positive light, I believe Wes Anderson meant this movie to be a lament of a lifestyle long lost in the course of time.For quite short a screentime, the plot does have to resort to plot conveniences to keep it going. Nevertheless, they are by no means big problems, making no critical pauses to the flow of the movie.A 9.5/10 to me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The film was grotesque - aesthetically ill,"No scene in this film looked good.

What was the point of the first scene when we are introduced in the so called technique of story within a story? Maybe, to show the decadence of a once thriving hotel? When did that hotel look good? The plot had no logic and told no story. No real enemy was present. And that hotel guy whose name is totally forgettable has a machiavellian personality, and his servant is his lap dog with a face that shows no spark of life. No character in this film has any sign of intelligence and nothing made any sense.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Pass the Popcorn! review,"Having only seen one movie by Wes Anderson before (Moonrise Kingdom), it was difficult to predict what to expect from The Grand Budapest Hotel. Moonrise Kingdom isn't a good movie, despite all the good reviews it got: in fact, it's quite boring, style-over-substance-ish, and counts on people liking it because the main characters are ""sweet innocent kids"". TGBH, on the other hand, looked promising – interesting, featuring an awesome cast, funny jokes and an actual story and events you can follow. And after all, Wes Anderson is considered a good director, whose movies, including this one, gained mostly positive reviews. Unfortunately, Mr Anderson will be Mr Anderson, and TGBH is yet just another style-over-substance flick.The movie starts with a girl, reading a book titled The Grand Budapest Hotel, next to its writer's bust. It then switches to the old writer (Tom Wilkinson), that starts recalling the events that led to writing the book. We then see the young writer (Jude Law), staying at the Grand Budapest Hotel and meeting its owner, Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who decides to tell him the story of how he became the owner of the hotel. As a teenager, Mr. Moustafa was known as Zero (Tony Revolori) and worked as a lobby boy in the same hotel he owns. The legendary concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) becomes his mentor and best friend, and together they embark on strange and dangerous adventures.Despite being pointless and strange (since the characters of the old writer and the girl reading his book appear again, briefly, only at the end of the movie), this kind of beginning has its charm, and nicely introduces the whole story. The setting in general is wonderful: the costumes, the outdoors and indoors, the colors and all the playing with shadows and light make TGBH a truly beautiful movie, that's impossible to watch without wanting to be sucked into its world. Another great movie quality is represented by its cast of famous and excellent actors, who, luckily, don't condemn TGBH to the fate many other movies with good casts had recently (The Counselor, Movie 43). And even the less known actors, like for example Tony Revolori, are good.Probably the movie's biggest issue is that it can't decide whether it wants to be serious or silly. Both aspects work fine when seen alone, but put together, they just make the movie confusing – especially considering the background story is one of war and totalitarianism. One may argue that life is like that, a combination of seriousness and silliness, but that again doesn't fit the surrealistic vibe of the movie. There are also a lot of jokes that fall flat – if they are, in fact, jokes, which I suppose they are since some members of the audience in my theater were laughing hard at them. Ultimately, the story exists, but it feels like it would be the same if there was nothing going on: again, too much style, too little substance. TGBH definitely had potential, but ended up being an empty, cold and distant, although visually stunning, movie.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Are you Mr. M. Gustave of The Grand Budapest Hotel?,"A Young Writer (Jude Law) passing through Europe in 1968, stays in The Grand Budapest Hotel that is almost extinct. The owner explains to the writer the history of the hotel and how he came to own it. The story covers times of war and peace.

The Grand Budapest Hotel,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is another delightful entry from Wes, with a stronger focus on storytelling and character. Combined with a stellar performance from Fiennes, which steals the show, the engaging story never falters. If anything, this movie embodies what the Mendl treat is in the movie. What it did miss out on is some emotional engagement, which other entries from Wes have done better.Directing, first an foremost this is yet another artistic step up from previous entries. And I love it. The framing, the colors, everything is just perfect. And by now you now, but it's still just as charming, just as enthralling. Sometimes it feels like being a live theater. There's only a few cgi shots, or drawings, that feel not as refined as the movie. I liked the ideas behind it. But it didn't work a 100% for me. There's also another type of shot that is used, in particular when people are riding on a bike. Now most of it is fine, and fits the style. But the one with the Lobby boy and Concierge lingered for too long and started to feel odd. Really minor nitpick though. Besides that this movie has some great action scenes, filled to the brim with absurdist comedy, slapstick even. The shootout was hilarious, the sled race was good too. And any sort of chase or running is done so well, it's rare a movie gets me going during small chase scenes. But the combination of the pacing, music and buildup just makes it perfect, even if it does lose out on some logic sometimes.Acting was fantastic, Fiennes like I said stole the show, with Revolori being a fine counterpart, but never really got to shine imo. The remaining cast, full of short cameo's, you know how it goes, felt nice and were fun nods. Everytime I see Schwartzman I just get a smile on my face, seeing him still in Wes's movies since Rushmore. Wilson as well of course.Music is very characteristic of Wes's track record, he likes a certain sound and that's noticeable through all his movies. Quite a timeless selection as they are simple in essence but have a really strong dynamic, moving precisely with the story/scene.It was a really enjoyable movie and flew by. A movie I wouldn't skip if I were to see it again one day. But it did miss that essential emotional hook for me. It is certainly the most lighthearted movie Wes has made to this point. (also I just realized I skipped over moonrise kingdom regarding my viewing order...oops)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A pretty random ride,"You get about 5 seconds thorough a Wes Anderson movie and straight away you just know it's that sly guy with his unique style. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Andersons little project here and one that is hugely entertaining as well, mixing humour with wit and love with surrealism, this movie truly contains a lot of different things. The story is about Gustave H a hotel manager of the place in the title, but it is not through his eyes we see the story no, it is F. Murray Abraham well no it is the character of Zero Moustafa a small hotel concierge who is hired by Gustave and quickly rises up to be a star player in the running of the hotel. The plot throws in twists and turns, characters that only Anderson could make up and at one point a shoot-out between a group of people who have no idea who they are shooting(sounds pretty mixed up right). The one thing that stops this being pretentious or anything along those lines is that it is funny, thoughtful but also just generally made up well, it never tries to make you think ""Oh cool"" but you can at times feel that, but it doesn't feel forced.The movie contains so many actors it is near impossible to count how many big names or recognisable faces this movie contains. Gustave is played by an very on form Ralph Fiennes whose performance is both hilarious but also just generally well acted even dramatically speaking. We see the likes of Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Jude Law, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray and even one of Anderson's absolute favourites, Jason Schwartzman. The strange thing is that among all the talent on show it is the young actor who portrays Zero who is maybe one of the most memorable and his name is Tony Revolori. Now I am not saying Revolori is that great I mean it really is Fiennes who steals the show acting wise, but Revolori does enough to make his character stick out and you can sort of in ways connect to him.Straight from the side camera shots are just one of the many things we see so often in Wes Anderson's plethora of work. In this movie he adds in little miniature set pieces with little trees and buildings and also moving miniature figures and vehicles and really makes them look actually good and uses them to good effect too. The movie likes to move fast I mean after all it is fairly short, however the frantic pace does not make this any less of a great piece in fact if anything it makes the jokes funnier because they are so quick and snappy, at times the slight humour can drip out but in large quantities so it feels pretty nicely done. What Anderson also does so well is just make this feel so fresh and new, I mean to be fair who the hell as ever made a movie like this before but what Anderson brings to the table is more than fresh, it is fresh and really good mixing great characters who are likable with really nice sets and Wes writes the thing well too, I mean I can definitely see why this got so many nominations at ceremonies across the world.Is there much wrong? ,well I guess it could have been the slightest bit more laugh out loud at times but that doesn't matter, that isn't what this movie is all about. I think this is a sort of lovable movie but for sure is extremely likable and I don't think only a certain ""crowd"" will like it, it has a little something for all to offer. One more thing I really need to say which I never went properly into is the production design especially the whole make up of the sets used, the sets used for the parts in the 30's are magnificent and some of the best I have ever seen in movies, I felt yet again Anderson's style creeping up in even the smallest of places.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"The other 'F"" word","I am going to need to use letters to describe specifically offensive words which Hollywood seems bent on using which IMDb police wont allow in their review even though I am making a very specific just point. You'd think we were in grade school. Why is it that Hollywood feels like its still okay to use the other ""F"" word (derogatory name for a homosexual)and steers clear of all the other slurs? ""F"" is still the one socially accepted slur. We all heard it in Wolf Of Wall Street along with plenty of other offense and violence directed at the only gay character. In that one Scorsese made the actual choice of having the characters use the ""other F"" word quite a few times but when it came to a character using the ""N"" word, he actually referred to it as ""N"" word. Why one and not the other. If you are going to be politically correct then you need to do so across the border.And now Wes Anderson...You'd accept more from a ""hipster"". I thought they were supposed to be liberal. Oh the hypocrisy. The audience would not have stood for the ""N"" word being used as it did because they are ""just"" and ""socially conscious"" yet they rolled around and laughed at the other F"" word. Oh the hypocritical fools. All hipster of them. Ignorant fools.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Cinema at its finest,"That was perhaps one of the most well-written and peculiarly made films I've ever watched. The characters, the dialogues, the cinematography, the narration, the colors...all of it was so perfectly executed. It is such an amazing ride of emotions, so immaculately brought to life on screen. Every element was exceptionally woven together, with each frame worthy of being its own painting. A movie so warm, yet profoundly melancholic. It really is an unforgettable narrative.I have heard and seen more tales than I care to mention, but this was truly one of the best. I believe storytelling, in itself, is truly magical, which is why I have such a biased love for cinema. So, when I say this movie was the best cinema has to offer, I mean it is truly the greatest piece of storytelling I've ever come across.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Anderson's overdecorated,"I can fully understand that Anderson's overdecorated, overstylized and highly self-conscious movies aren't for everyone, but at least some of the criticism rests on a faulty philosophical or aesthetic footing. Do movies made in a more naturalistic mode, like mainstream comedies and dramas with their formulaic three-act plots, actually do a better job of reproducing human relationships or social reality? What about movies set in outrageously artificial universes, like action films or thrillers, where we simply agree to overlook the fact that everything that happens is wildly implausible? To move the question to a larger frame, since when are the movies supposed to create a convincing simulacrum of reality? American cinema, which remains the medium's dominant model, hardly ever does and hardly ever has.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A manic pace and style over substance,"I have given this film 1/10, only because it is not possible to rate it zero.I don't know why I never learn: ever since Rushmore, a film to which I simply could not warm up, every time I watch one of Wes Anderson's films, I end up disliking it intensely. That was the case with Rushmore, then The Royal Tennenbaums, followed by Moonrise Kingdom, and now The Grand Budapest Hotel.Two of my good friends, whose judgment in films I trust, told me what a great film this was. With that in mind, I began watching it, but within 20 minutes, I realized I would not like the film, just as I had not enjoyed watching the other Anderson films before. One reason was the manic pace at which the actors delivered their lines and the musical score rolled; another was how completely indifferent to their predicaments the characters left me.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a pretentious film, in which visual style stifles any substance its talented actors might have brought to the story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Extraordinary! Much better than Birdman,"The Grand Budapest Hotel was robbed of numerous Oscars when it was in my opinion a significantly better film than Birdman. Everything in TGBH is flawless! The cinematography is gorgeous. The script is deeply engaging. The directing evidences such a high level of detail. The makeup and costumes are admiring to glance at. Wes Anderson creates such a beautiful and fanciful story woven between two horrific periods of endless conflict.

"Slick, stylish and ferociously funny","Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the most delightfully unusual filmmakers working today, his films characterised by picturesque symmetry, wry humour and more than a hint of the macabre. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different and actually stands as one of Anderson's finest films; it's precisely choreographed, gorgeous to look at and, above all, an intelligent comedy that pays homage to bygone cinema whilst adding its own unique spin.
Though the action may jump time periods (whether it's from Tom Wilkinson's direct narrator or F. Murray Abraham's narrator within the story), it centres around The Grand Budapest Hotel, an elite establishment for the rich and pampered in the fictional state of Zubrowka. Our attention is immediately turned to M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel's concierge, who tends to the guests with a managed slickness... that is when he isn't courting dowagers into his room. The film takes off on a race of storytelling, as Gustave is framed for the murder of an old lover (a prosthetic-clad Tilda Swinton) and must flee the law and who knows else with only the help of his protégé, lobby boy, Zero (a suitably boyish Tony Revelori, when not played 30 years down the line by a mellow F. Murray Abraham).
The film is a delightful farce, Anderson and Hugo Guiness' script providing intelligent and subtle comedy that delivers even amid such a frenetic and occasionally scatty pace. For the most part though, The Grand Budapest Hotel is as tightly wound as one could expect from Wes Anderson; even amid the absurdity of ski chases and severed fingers, there's a remarkable level of control to the madness, helped along by Anderson's assured writing and direction.
Employed in the cast is a who's who of star-studded spectacle; Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan are plot-central, but around them are bit cameos from the likes of Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Lea Seydoux. Fiennes leads with rapier-sharp timing as Gustave, his performance radiating clipped composure, all complete with an irresistible charm. The supporting cast are admittedly largely one-note (occasionally the abundance of celebrity proves a little distracting) but are earnest enough to drive the film through.
Where the film has perhaps received the highest praise, however, is its design. The Grand Budapest hotel is a visual treat, its design vibrant yet avowedly architected. There's almost a sense of the characters having been painted on screen; from the bright colours, sharp angles and miniature set pieces, the film feels as much a spectacle of art as an espionage romp. Alexandre Desplat's score is perfectly judged, the musical voice established by the distinct and innovative use of the balalaika. The film is shot with equal verve, snapping from camera ratios incessantly to produce an energised and unexpected cinematography that boosts the narrative. At points, the movie may be a case of style over substance, but the film's unusual design only seems to enhance one's enjoyment of it.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange film, a comedy full of black humour and gentlemanly profanity. Thoroughly entertaining and visually enchanting, this is certainly a gem from Wes Anderson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"Check Into The Grand Budapest Hotel, As Soon As Possible.","When it comes to director Wes Anderson, there is only one thing that's present everywhere in every one of his works that makes his films all the more unique; the eccentricity. But more on that later. Set in the fictional Republic of Zubrowska, The Grand Budapest Hotel recounts the adventures of Monsieur Gustave H, the charming & devoted concierge of the famed hotel who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he's framed for the murder of one of hotel's most regular guests.Those who are accustomed to this director's previous works know that his films present an immensely distinct visual flair that's seamlessly blended with quirky wit, eclectic dialogues & idiosyncratic characters to give its viewers a bizarre cinematic experience. And his latest feature is no different as it's very emblematic of his style, has a tremendous charm to it, is exquisitely photographed, finely edited & peculiarly scored by Alexandre Desplat.Coming to the performances, The Grand Budapest Hotel features a stellar cast in which each actor is assigned an odd character to play on the screen & is introduced to the viewers in Anderson's usually unusual style. But it's Ralph Fiennes as Gustave H whose stylish appearance, rapid-fire delivery & dry wit ended up making the biggest impression. The next best for me was Willem Dafoe who ends up delivering a cold-blooded performance as a cold-blooded assassin.On an overall scale, The Grand Budapest Hotel bears all the signatures of a Wes Anderson's feature & maybe even more. It's arguably his most accessible work to date that's exquisitely designed & elegantly composed. It's like a delicious dessert course that is delicately served to its viewers & is one of this year's sweetest, quirkiest, funniest & most enjoyable films as of now. So just leave your doubts behind & check into The Grand Budapest Hotel, as soon as possible.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Expendables of indie movies. I feel like Wes Anderson just jerked off on my eyeballs.,"Whatever this movie is, it's Wes Anderson. You'll be reminded of that every time there is a 180 degree pan or dolly instead of a normal cut, every time there is straight-facedness in the sight of ridiculousness, every time there is a theater-esque set, every time another massively A- list celebrity appears in a minor role so as to be included in the exponentially burgeoning WA troupe...The story is choppy and riddled with voice-over and voice-over within voice-over, but def hella whimsical. I'm not a hater, check out my other ratings of great films like Rushmore, RT, even LAWSZ...this one was just too much, like the Darjeeling Limited on steroids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Excellent and exhuberent,"Busting with charm and Anderson's whimsical direction- The Grand Budapest Hotel proves to be another hilarious and delightfully odd adventure into the mind of one of my favorite directors. I would say the main flaw of this film, if there are any, is that it doesn't quite ever take its story to the next level. It seems to stroll along the same sort of pace and tone without any true twists and turns along the way- or at least nothing that makes it feel so dire. However, this is also where a lot of the charm comes into play. Ralph Fiennes character is absolutely brilliant in this film, and his performance is magnificent- a charmer of stature and sorts flipped on his head and yet somehow you still care so much and seem to respect him as much as well- as if truly viewing the film through the eyes of the narrator. The rest of the cast is also great of course, Anderson's films ensemble are nothing but perfection as always, and his casting is impeccable. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic- perhaps my favorite of his films thus far- and the costume design is exquisite. Although I did enjoy films like Moonrise Kingdom or The French Dispatch a tad more- The Grand Budapest Hotel is a delightfully melancholic adventure that is as easy to watch as a film can be.My Rating: 9.3/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Old World Charm Never Goes Out of Fashion,"I've found that amongst movie-goers Wes Anderson seems to be a bit polarizing. I'm one of those folks that falls somewhere in the middle regarding his work. I had modest expectations for The Grand Budapest Hotel but have to say I enjoyed it immensely. All of the performances are good and all of the characters are so unique and interesting. Each of them is unique in a way that for me was real and believable, and therefor someone I could relate to. In particular I found the Lobby Boy and his loyalty to the Fiennes character very endearing. Visually it was continually interesting and the hotel, along with the decor, and mannerisms of this film did have an elegant, reserved, old-world feel to it, which added a new dimension to my enjoyment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
There's nobody like Wes Anderson,"I have been watching movies since the early days of my teenage hood , and I have witnessed thousands of imaginings turning into reality from a similar proportion of visionaries all around the world, but I've never been as enticed, as amused by someone's aesthetic sophistication as I am now with Wes Anderson.Mr Anderson is truly unparalleled when it comes to art direction, the visual signature per se; there is nobody like him. The way he envisions scenes, character appearances, and the general feeling of his creations are indeed unprecedented and quite incomparable in this particular business.The Grand Budapest Hotel is nothing more than a validation of my earlier statements. Every shot, each and every frame is crafted as if it were a minute, sophisticated piece of art, replete with subtleties and artistic conveyances.Sadly, the same can't be said for its storytelling aspect, owing to some unfortunate occurrences of the script's inherent weaknesses that slowly but surely creeps in and reveal their existence. But, rest assured, the pictorial eloquence more than compensates for its shortcomings; it just happens to overshadow everything else.P. S.

"As Aunt Tetka Might Have Said, ""Smutna ale Krasna""","My Aunt Tetka lived most of her 101 years in Bayonne, New Jersey but she never learned to speak English well at all. Who needed The New York Times, Kennedy's inauguration speech, or William Shakespeare? Aunt Tetka could sing all one hundred verses of Slovak folksongs.Visiting Aunt Tetka was a trip to another world, a world she took with her when she (finally!) died. There were many curtains. The air was inside her home was as thick as soup. It smelled sweet, like Uncle Strecko's pipe smoke, and pungent, of cabbage, onions, and ham. There were sepia photographs of grim faced men with serious mustaches and women in embroidered babushkas, oil paintings of peasant huts and high mountains, figurines of goose girls, brass ornaments incised with pagan sun symbols and a graphic crucified Christ. Aunt Tetka consumed only pastries, sprinkled with powdered sugar, served on handmade doilies. Five minutes into Wes Anderson 2014 film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" I was weeping. Anderson took me back to Aunt Tetka.Mitteleuropa means ""Central Europe"" in German. Mitteleuropa has had many meanings, some of them frightening, geopolitical, and military. The friendlier Mitteleuropa references musics, languages, cuisines, colors and attitudes of Central Europe, an area stretching roughly from Germany to Ukraine, from the Baltics to the Balkans, a region sharing slivovice, zither and cimbalom, Gypsies, irony, pastry, sentiment, Catholicism, Judaism Orthodoxy, empire and cataclysm. Given recent news events, Mitteleuropa is much in the news: today we speak again of Cossacks, Crimea, and empire.There aren't many American films that encapsulate the feel of Mitteleuropa. ""The Third Man"" comes to mind, with its famous zither score. There's the original Bela Lugosi ""Dracula"" and ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Most of these films emphasize the dark side of the region, and that's too bad. Mitteleuropa has a rich tradition of joy and humor. It's remarkable that Anderson, an all-American filmmaker produced ""The Grand Budapest Hotel.""When watching this film, I really wondered how much of it the audience would understand. GBH so tenderly reflects the peculiar history and experience of Mitteleuropa. For example, the movie is told as a reminiscence by a writer remembering an encounter from his youth with another person who retells the life story of yet another person. Why this ""as told to as told to"" feature? Why not just present the narrative directly?The ""as told to as told to"" feature adds to the feeling of a lost world, of the antique, of a word-of-mouth story that is not reflected accurately in official histories. If you read the official histories of Mitteleuropa in the 20th century, you read of battles and massacres. If you know the people from Mitteleuropa, you encounter warmth and humanity and fate and humor and hair's breadth escapes and moments of generosity and grace that never made it into official histories. If you hadn't gone to that one déclassé health spa in the Zubrowkian Alps, you never would have met that one person, and never learned the story of Monsieur Gustav, and the tiny nation of Zubrowka would always be a mystery to you.The opening scenes, in rapid succession, show the Grand Budapest Hotel under communism, and then in its glory days, under something like the Hapsburg Empire. These very brief juxtapositions are brilliant. They really capture what those of us who traveled to Mitteleuropa saw under the Soviet system, even the creepy green paint.Monsieur Gustav is a concierge and gigolo. While training a new lobby boy, Zero, Gustav becomes entangled in a family scandal, a heist, and a prison break. There is a war in the background. For all its silliness, the movie brings M Gustav to life. Ralph Fiennes MUST receive an Academy Award nomination, and he really ought to win. He plays his part completely straight. His deadpan delivery of funny lines and his commitment to M Gustav brings this parody character in a wacky film to complete life. You love Gustav. You admire him. He moves you. You care about his fate.Tony Revolori is very good as Zero Mustafa, Gustav's protégée. His relationship with Gustav is adorable.The movie moves at a surprisingly brisk pace. The film itself may be looking back with nostalgia, but it is an action film. There is a genuinely exciting chase scene on skis.GBH doesn't attempt to honor the horrors that took place in Mitteleuropa in the 20th century. The Holocaust is just one of these horrors; there was also the Holodomor, the mass migration of starving peasants to the US, battle casualties, and too many other atrocities to mention. There are scenes where characters speak of being displaced and on the run, of families massacred. The viewer knows what Anderson is referencing. At one point the GBH is taken over by evil forces whose insignia, a design close to a swastika, appears on banners draped all over the hotel, in the same way that a swastika was draped over the von Trapp home in ""Sound of Music.""Anderson's answer to this evil is M. Gustav: be kind, be a friend, and be quietly clever. Make connections with other humans. Do favors, and rely on favors. This focus on the ordinary gestures of good hearted people in the face of enormous evil is deeply touching.I wish there had been more women in this film. Saoirse Ronan is the one female part of note, and she speaks in an Irish accent as sharp as a blade that totally took me out of the film. Her screen presence is cold and not fitting. I wish there had been more peasants, and more outside scenes. Mitteleuropa was built on peasantry and GBH needed at least one buxom earth goddess binding sheaves of wheat or milking a cow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wonderful and delightful and funny and inspired,"Made with Wes Anderson's normal fastidious attention to detail, with careful compositions and eccentrically droll characters (with the exception of the inspired M. Gustave played by Ralph Fiennes, a mannered sophisticate with just the right amount of rapscallion that instead of quirky tics, he's a man of desires and decency, an almost real human being).The Grand Budapest Hotel operates on a more plot-centric level than any of Anderson's previous films, and yet retains all his charms and idiosyncrasies, yet by not flaunting his mannerisms as character development or deepness of thought, he actually winds up saying more about everyone and everything by letting them speak for themselves. The melancholy passing of the old world is captured in the sheer joy and exuberance of the scenes taking place there, so that when we are lurched back to the present and the film slows down and hits the notes of normal Anderson faire, it carries with it a sense of loss and sorrow.The juxtaposition of the looming war, with its brutality and chaos, also inspires the scenes in the past as they are full of atypical for Anderson indecency. From the dropping of F-bombs to the explicit, yet not grotesque, gore. These seeming anachronisms, that work on two different levels, are both funny and deep and since they don't just have to be deep they actually work perfectly.The movie plays out in three different aspect ratios, a fun little treat for cinema fans who notice. Although it should be said that the majority of the film takes place in the past and as such uses a near full screen ratio (a relic of old European films), which is a little disappointing considering how gorgeous the filmmaking is. It could have been bigger and better.It bares repeating, Ralph Fiennes, always a great actor, here gets to show his comedic chops in what feels like forever, and liberated he is an absolute joy in every frame of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Minority opinion about this movie--it's good, but not great","The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) was written and directed by Wes Anderson. It stars the excellent Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, concierge of a famed European luxury hotel. The film is set in the period between the two world wars. Newcomer Tony Revolori plays Zero, a lobby boy whoeventually becomes M. Gustave's sidekick.M. Gustave demands perfection from the staff at the hotel, provides satisfaction to every guest, and knows the correct behavior for any situation. Whether he is at his desk in the hotel, or on a train, or in a prison, M. Gustave maintains his positive, always appropriate behavior. That's a good concept, and it more-or-less holds the film together. More-or-less.Many famous actors appear in small or cameo roles. Amng these are F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, and Owen Wilson. It's always fun to recognize a familiar face, and identify the actor before she or he moves on.When I was in the theater, I laughed a fair amount. However, the movie went in several different directions at once. It was as if Anderson thought, ""OK--that's all the laughs I'll get from this situation, time to move on."" Nothing much is left when you get done with those few funny lines. In fact, if you want to save time, watch the trailer. Most of the film's great lines are in it.I respect the opinion of those who think this was one of the greatest movies ever. At the time of this review, GBH is carrying an astounding IMDb rating of 8.4, putting it in the top 150 movies of all time. However, I just didn't think it was that wonderful. It's a good way to pass a few hours, but I wouldn't dream of going back and seeing it again.This is one of those films that really will work better on a large screen. However, if that's not an option, it will be OK on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Mucho Characters in Search of an Author,"First thing that occurred to me watching this flick: The director saw ""The Shining"". And, I'm guessing, maybe a lot of ""end of"" or ""bygone era"" movies. But the picture can't seem to make up its mind whether it loves the past or thinks it silly. Because the credits don't roll until the drama is over I spent a lot of time thinking, ""Oh, yeah, what's his name? He's older now too."" That was diverting. And the acting was well-executed but kind of ""showed"" a lot, it seemed to me. I'm not saying I'm sorry I saw the movie. But I kept wondering while I was watching if it was one of those boardgames adapted to the screen. Perhaps I have lost my sense of humor? Was I expecting an homage and viewed a satire instead? But perhaps that is what I found missing: I was never quite sure how the director wanted me to take the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Grand Budapest Hotel is the greatest hotel ever.,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie directed by Wes Anderson who is a really extraordinary director for sure and this movie have a lots of actors / actress and when i say a lot i mean it , There is so much actors and actress in this movie such as Tilda Swinton , Bill Murray , Tom Wilkinson , Jeff Goldblum , Harvel Keitel and a lot more but the really main actor or actress in the movie is actually Ralph Fiennes , Saoirse Ronan and Tony Revolori but don't mind the screen time for your favorite actors or actress just go for it , everyone in this movie is pretty awesome and really great in it.I have to say that this movie have a really really great Production Design they doing such a perfect job on it , every single piece in the movie are all really well crafted and you can see every detail on every scene in the movie which is really impressive.Director Wes Anderson in this movie also does a really really great job with amazing camera movement and unique storytelling that just blow my minds with this art style from him , even though the movie falls off a bit in plot which is kind of a cliché , repetitive and not much to say but when it combines with Wes Anderson work and really amazing production design you just doesn't notice the bad stuff at all because you're enjoying it so much .In the end The Grand Budapest Hotel is a must see movie for sure with really awesome and great actors and actress all around combine with amazing works from director Wes Anderson and stunning Production Design makes this movie really one of the most ( if not the most ) memorable movie of this year for sure .",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Warped and witty at warp speed,"This is a slick slapstick comedy adventure film taken at a fast pace without a trace of heaviness but with a continual cleverness that had me glued to my chair for the 99 minutes in case I missed anything. More happens in any one minute in here that happens in some entire films (if you don't believe me just try Once Upon A Time In Anatolia for comparison), this is a motion picture first and foremost designed to entertain and make money.Faded hotel owner tells the story of his success in life to an interested guest, how he started off as a eccentric lobby boy to an eccentric employer superbly played by Ralph Fiennes. An elderly rich female  patron dies or is murdered leading to Fiennes stealing a valuable painting, going to jail, and having her thwarted and thrusting family on his and everyone else's heels. And much more. It's a sumptuous and atmospheric world portrayed in a lucid cartoony style – one of my favourite bits being what the impetuous Willem Dafoe did in lawyer Jeff Goldblum's office and Goldblum's perfectly delayed reaction to it. Other fantastic (in every sense of the word) bits: the deep-end introduction of Zero the lobby boy; the cartoon escape from the prison; the 200 mph ski/sled chase through the snow and abrupt end; the call for help to the Society Of The Crossed Keys; the mass pointless shoot-out at the hotel. So many good witty and stylish scenes! Unfortunately a few tasteless ones too, the occasional gratuitous swearing, coarseness and violence is at least understandable – no matter whether the film is in 1932 or 1968 you know damn well you're really still in 2014 and if at all, not so easily shocked. However, replacing the ""valuable painting"" for a piece of pointless graphic pornography is neither easy to get down or get off on – you know damn well the makers (and maybe a larger section of the audience) wouldn't have countenanced a portrait of two gay men masturbating instead - after all, can't be too shocking.Fiennes is memorable as the bizarre lead character Gustave, and in his bizarre relationship to the round-eyed Zero during their journey through this marvellously cynical live-action cartoon for the 21st century. Definitely not another Trouble In Paradise or Grand Hotel and nowhere near being a perfect film but overall, totally engrossing and hugely enjoyable hokum worthy of repeat viewingsbut with room for reservations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Hilarious, wonderful, beautiful","Why, oh, why, have I not read in any of the reviews on the first couple of pages any note of the very clear (to me, anyway,) homage in this movie to the Marx Brothers and WC Fields. From the names of people and places to the characters to the comic setups and even the tempo, both inspirations shine clearly through. Even though the movie is clearly set in WesAndersonland, it is truly a movie lover's movie with many links and references to the broad comedy of these geniuses of the 1920's and 1930s, which is, of course, the period of The Grand Budapest Hotel.The photography is visually lush with the feel of many paintings and painters of the era of Van Hoytel, painter of Boy with Apple.This is a movie for watching and re-watching and re-watching, over and over again. There are so many jokes and witty allusions that occur just outside the center of the screen and/or pass too quickly for real appreciation.I personally plan to STUDY The Grand Budapest Hotel for its many layers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Grand indeed! The Grand Budapest Hotel amazes me with a mix of style and witty writing.,"What is the goal of a hotel? Some might say it is to make you feel at home. Some may say that it is supposed to be a place of convenience where our vacations are easier. I think that the goal of every hotel, grand or motel, is give something that guests can't have in their ordinary lives; a sense of royal treatment. It's unlikely anyone reading this is a grand princess from a European nation or something. But when we stay at a Marriot, were not going to stay in one of their rooms, we are given the key to our room where for the next couple of days, we are to be serviced as much as possible.You could say that because were already paying the hotel, were going to receive special treatment anyway. But even if we only throw fifty-five dollars for a room on the side of a highway, were still given the privilege of having a room to ourselves with our own cook, cleaner, and someone at the front desk to answer our questions. We don't go on vacation for the room; we go for service and for people to wait on you for every move. The chronicles of a most interesting hotel butler and his student are captured by Wes Anderson in The Grand Budapest Hotel.This is a story within several layers. It starts in the present with a girl reading a book, when it cuts to the author (played by Tom Wilkinson) telling the audience his inspiration for his stories, which cuts again to the author as a young man (played by Jude Law) speaking with the current owner of the failing Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham). Despite the hotel falling a part in the movie's fictional nation of Zubrowka, Zero can't let the place die. When asked by the author, Zero then starts to tell his days as a young man when he started working.The owner's story starts in 1932, where Zero is a quiet Lobby Boy working at the Grand Budapest that's about to be stuck in the middle of a war in Zubrowka. This does not bother the devoted concierge, Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) who takes pleasure in serving the richest guests, including Madame D (played by Tilda Swinton). She's murdered one night and Gustave and Zero travel to the funeral, where the concierge finds that he's inherited a priceless painting. This pisses off the rest of Madame D's family; so many of them are sought on revenge. To make things worse, Gustave is accused of murdering Madame D.This may seem like a lot of story for a mystery, but The Grand Budapest Hotel is actually a very intriguing movie. Though the story is a good story, it's not the big focus. It's intentionally structured in an uneven manner going from Hotel study to art to communist war to a who did it mystery. Like a lot of other Wes Anderson movies, the overall style is the best part.This director is one of the few in Hollywood who have a distinguishable look for their movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel is just beautiful from it's old-fashioned sets, models, and even ratio. It's hard to describe why I like it in writing, but it's very lovely. The writing may be odd, but it still got plenty of laughs out of me. We have the actors to thank who all fit their parts well (including other parts from Edward Norton, Bill Maury, and Jeff Goldblum), never playing themselves. It's a grand trip from check in to check out. It's a visit that people will want to make over and over.I'll give this nine lobby boy hats out of ten. The Grand Budapest Hotel is keeping a good place on the top ten box office hits, and I'm glad. This deserves to be a hit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

A Visual Feast Even if the Stars are a Little Dim,"When MGM invented the all-star movie with ""Grand Hotel"" and ""Dinner at Eight,"" the studio packed the casts with their biggest stars of the time: Garbo, Crawford, Harlow, Barrymore, Beery, Dressler. ""Star"" is now a much abused, much diminished term, and Wes Anderson's all-star ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" features stars of varying wattage. As stars, perhaps Jude Law and Ralph Fiennes come closest, although the large cast also boasts nearly-forgotten Oscar winners: F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, and Adrien Brody; one-time A-listers: Bill Murray; and capable actors who never rose above support: Willen Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, and Jeff Goldblum. Nevertheless, the familiar faces are fun to spot and help keep characters straight during the ensuing chaos. Most important, the stars, former stars, and never-were stars seem to be having fun.A stylish, self-consciously old fashioned film, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" unfolds in flashback as F. Murray Abraham tells the story over dinner with Jude Law. The complex tale involves Ralph Fiennes, who managed the hotel during its hey day, and his protégé, a new lobby boy. Fiennes preys on rich, blonde, older women, one of whom dies; the ensuing madness involves a stolen painting and the second copy of a second will, a prison break and a bob sled chase, a young romance, a murder, a shoot out; the movie has it all.The real stars of the film, however, are the superb production by Adam Stockhausen costume design by Milena Canonero, retro-stop-motion effects, and eye-popping cinematography by Robert D.Yeoman. The film is presented in widescreen during the contemporary scenes, but switches to the nearly square aspect ratio of the 1920's and 30's when the action flashes back in time. The camera shots are often straight on and perfectly symmetrical, although sometimes shot Busby Berkley-style, straight down from overhead and, again, perfectly symmetrical. Camera movements mimic Kubrick and either push forward or glide sideways parallel to the frame. The stop-motion effects recall Melies and the earliest days of cinema in their flat simplistic style, and the obviously fake backdrops of Ruritanian scenery could have been done for an early-1930's Hitchcock. While not a direct copy or parody of old movies, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an affectionate homage to a bygone era of film-making.While the all-star cast is as bright as stars get these days, directorial and designer style is the true super-star of Wes Anderson's film. The action is visual, the acting is broad, the plot is full of holes, but the cast, director, and crew evidently had great fun assembling the parts into a vastly enjoyable whole. The film is a big colorful bon bon, a fluffy cotton candy confection that leaves little behind except a pleasantly sweet aftertaste. Similar to ""The Artist,"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" evokes the Golden Age of Hollywood; it's the kind of movie that audiences say they don't make anymore, but occasionally do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Some (particularly IMDb voters) would say it is his best. Perhaps. On first viewing, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was the stronger, more cohesive film... but this one may take a bit more time to sink in, and may require multiple viewings.Certainly it has Harvey Keitel in one of his better roles, as well as a near-endless stream of great actors, many of whom (Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman, etc. etc.) have worked with Anderson repeatedly.

Wes Anderson at the top of his game,"Wes Anderson's latest cinematic confection, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" is a quirky, surrealistic comedy set at a mountain resort run by a concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and a ""lobby boy"" named Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori), whom M. Gustave has taken under his wings to train in the art of service.Set in a fictional country, the movie begins in 1968, when the Grand Budapest Hotel is just a shadow of its former self, having been allowed to fall into disrepair and currently inhabited by a small contingent of eccentric tenants. One of them is a writer (Tom Wilkinson) who discovers that Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) is now the owner of the once-proud establishment. The elder Mustafa regales him with stories of an earlier time in the hotel's history - the 1930s, in fact - when the palatial inn played host to only the richest and most aristocratic of occupants and guests.Through dual-narrated flashbacks, then, Anderson weaves a smart and cheeky tale of an enduring friendship that triumphs over class division, a tale that combines wit with imagination and social commentary with visual elegance, set against the writer/director's trademarked air of heightened unreality. When he isn't fulfilling his duties as hotel concierge, the foppish M. Gustave, fastidious in manner and with a poetic quote for every occasion, offers his ""personal"" services exclusively to blond, fabulously wealthy and emotionally insecure dowagers, one of whom bequeaths to him a priceless painting upon her sudden death. This surprising turn-of-events puts him at odds with a veritable army of the deceased woman's outraged relatives. This leads to a stolen art treasure, a false conviction for murder, a daring prison break and a mad race to stay one step ahead of the pursuing authorities, as M. Gustave endeavors to prove his innocence.To enhance the dreamlike nature of the material, the look of the film is marked by whimsical art direction and ultra-stylized framing. Even the dimensions of the screen change with the time period of the story - traditional square for the scenes set in 1932 and widescreen for those that take place in 1968.In addition to the splendid deadpan performances of Fiennes, Abraham and newcomer Revolori in the key roles, the movie provides a veritable sea of familiar faces in supporting and bit parts, many of them members of Anderson's repertory company: Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Owen Wilson, among others.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" finds Mr. Anderson in peak form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Remarkably Graceful!,"""He certainly maintained the illusion with remarkable grace."" about M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).I marvel at how successfully Wes Anderson evokes an era in between wars, the early 1930's of Central and Eastern Europe, in a mythical country, Zubrowka, with a whimsical nostalgia tempered by impending doom for that country and the world as it approaches the Nazis and WWII. Anderson's brilliantly ironic The Grand Budapest Hotel is both light and grave, an admixture of longing for a time that maybe never was or had vanished long before its characters lost it.M. Gustave (Fiennes), the uber concierge of the titular hotel, is the martinet who runs the famous retreat yet the libertine who beds elderly ladies for fun and eventual profit. The will of a certain dowager, Madame D (Tilda Swinton), with whom he has been sleeping, serves as the catalyst for shenanigans by family and friends as they angle for her inheritance and figuratively the evanescent world of moldy decadence.All the while, moody music perfectly composed by Alexandre Desplat evokes the loss of a time but the promise of a new world. The crayon and pastel colors of diorama-like models are more the fantasies of active imaginations than reality. In other words, Wes Anderson, inspired by Austrian Stefan Zwewig's wry autobiography, The World of Yesterday, has it both ways: a love of times past and a vision of the future, seeded by characters that seem aware of the joys and losses accompanying the contract to live.Although this opulent, decadent menagerie of time may never have existed, Anderson evokes a memory of it not that different from what we remember, for instance, from our youths—my memories are of the halcyon years immediately following WWII. My memories are grand if not real. Anderson remembers like his main character, with illusory grace.The Grand Budapest Hotel is worth a visit, but you can't stay and never could have anyway.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A Free-Wheeling Journey Without Substance. ♦ 63%,"I am a fan of Wes Anderson.His screenplay and direction is what I adore. But the screw-ball he adds to his frames is why I love his films. The Grand Budapest Hotel has all these factors and that is why I rate it a 6/10. But, when it comes to movies, stories do matter. They are the indirect, significant factor that keeps the audience hooked. Unfortunately, this film drops low in it.The whole film is an extraordinary example of artistic cinema. Each and every frame will enthrall you and you may drop dead with the colors, music and slapstick. The story of a concierge who is framed for a murder of his inamorata finds himself escaping prison with the help of his protégé: well, that doesn't work out much for me. Yes, it narrates through a non-linear screenplay and I am a fan of that, but here in, it only succeeds in cramming the audience's mind with confusion. Even if you pay attention, which you will, won't be enough to comprehend the crux of what the writer (Stefan Zweig?) is trying to say. The ending is clever but I did not feel content with the plot. The use of letterbox aspect-ratios was a bad idea.BOTTOM LINE: You may/may not enjoy the story but you will definitely be entertained by the sheer extravaganza of the art setup. After all, Anderson is famous for that, isn't he? Watchable!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Mendl's Cakes,"Cakes made at the Mendl's patisserie play an important role in this film. They are sweet round things, with an appetizing and improbable shape and pastel colors which emanate sugar. They are made by a sweet girl and delivered to the Grand and Imaginary Budapest hotel on the peak of the mountains of an Europe that ceased to exist, or maybe never existed but in the imagination of writer Stefan Zweig and later taken over, amplified and brought to screen and to us by director Wes Anderson. A reverence to a world of beauty and aesthetics, of culture and respect, of honor and pleasure of living which is crushed by history, same as the world of Jewish Austrian writer Stefan Zweig was in the events of the second world war.The story written by Wes Anderson freely develops the themes and atmosphere of Zweig's writings without being specifically based on any one, in a fantasy which extends beyond the historic boundaries of the life and works of writer. Europe survived the war but could not recover its history, its style, it's human quality. If buildings survived they are condemned to decay, if men survived they are reduced to their shady selves. What is left is to remember the world that was - now retreated back in a past that looks more and more like a fairy tale. And fairy tale is what we are served on the screen, albeit a very fun and entertaining ones, and there are many reasons to like this picture even without philosophizing too much about its deeper meanings.One of these reasons is of course the cast - one of these exquisite gathering of stars that usually get together only on the Academy Awards night. Shining over all is Ralph Fiennes in the lead role, and I will stop here but I ensure you that even if you recognize some of the faces you will find out that most of them do something different and in a different manner that you always knew (Edward Norton may be the notorious exception). Second is the amazing visual world created by Anderson which coupled with the camera work gives the viewers sometimes a 3-D feeling (although no special spectacles are involved), and in other cases seems to play with the dimensions of the rectangular screen extending them at will. Third and neither last nor least the settings contribute to passing to viewers the flavors of well-being of the times that went away.Stefan Zweig did not survive the war. When the world he loved crumbled crushed under the boots of the Barbarians he committed suicide. This film can be read like some kind of revenge. At least in the fantasy space created on screen by Wes Anderson a world similar in feeling, manners, colors, smells and tastes to the one Zweig loved survives. A world like Mendl's cakes.

A typical Wes Anderson film,"The work of Wes Anderson is very much a required tasted. Known for his quirky style of direction and writing Anderson has a strong fanbase of film fans, but also has his dissenters. His latest film is The Grand Budapest Hotel easily appeals to his fans, but not going to win over his detractors, telling a story of murder, art-theft and impending war as a hotel concierge in a small European country is accused of murder and sets out to prove his innocents.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a highly energetic, almost screwball like comedy filled with witty lines and a cast that most directors would dream of having. Ralph Fiennes gives an excellent comic performance as the softly spoken lead and he has some of the best lines of the flick. Adrian Brody and Willem Dafoe too were strong as the villains, particularly Dafoe playing a cold-blooded thug of a man. It is refreshing to hear the talented Saoirse Ronan being allowed to use her natural Irish accent for once in a film. Some of the jokes do fall flat and serve as an excuse to give some of Anderson's buddies a cameo such as all the different hotel concierges are all calling each other. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a bright, colourful film and Anderson's stamp is all over it with his trademark shots, angles and camera are all present and he makes a fantastic looking film because of its lavish art-direction and cinematography.

A movie for its own cult following,"When I came to the theater to watch the movie, I had no preconceived expectations about it. 20 minutes into the movie I realized that it was not a movie made for large audiences, but rather a movie created to please the sensibilities of those that view life in a peculiar way. It reminded me of ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Adaptation,"" which have their own cult following.The movie does rely on a superb cast of actors that won't disappoint any moviegoer; but the problem with the movie is the story itself. In a unique way, it rehashes old themes of greed, intolerance, and obsession with the material world. It helps perpetuate the notion that humanity is flawed and that life has no ultimate purpose. It seems to reinforce those sensibilities generated or amplified explicitly and implicitly by individualistic life choices and humanistic thoughts within the confines of the human experience.Artistically, it lacks the complete range of human emotions necessary for a wholesome movie. Nevertheless, in an uncanny way, it would certainly connect with those that already made up their minds about the meaning of life in a subtle and reaffirming manner.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Grand Budapest is as Wes Anderson as it gets.,"I love Wes Anderson and his style as an auteur, do not mistake my comments on this film as anything but pure admiration, however if you're not familiar with his style do not go and see it.I remember watching my first ever Wes Anderson film and being in slight bewilderment of what on earth was going on, so when I saw a couple leave the cinema no more than a hour into the film I understood why. Wes Anderson's films are a lot of things, universal is not one of those things. Gut wrenchingly funny is also another phrase that should be avoided when describing a Wes Anderson film to someone unfamiliar with any previous works.Quirky, colourful, unique, well-made, superbly edited and overall mesmerising are all much more appropriate descriptions of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Suspend your disbelief and enter the slightly obscure world that this film exists and you'll find yourself caught up in a thrilling story which you never quite know where it will take you next.A story which in my opinion is far more well-thought out and defined than most previous films by Anderson, something very much welcomed. Also the lack of extremely awkward love stories is quite relieving. Although Ralph Fiennes, M.Gustave, does have what some would call 'odd-relations' so maybe I should retract that comment.One aspect that must be mentioned is the acting, which as usual is without fault. As would be expected from such a cast.What I'm trying to say is if you love Wes then you'll love this fantastical addition to his film collection. The ending however may leave you wanting more but an open ended film leaves space for creativity and imagination so maybe that's a plus after all.Oh Wes, you've done it again",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson's new film is guitar Grand Indeed. No spoilers,"The Grand Budapest Hotel ReviewWritten by Ryan NilsenThe Grand Budapest Hotel Directed by Wes Anderson Starring: Ralph Fienes,I would say that it's very refreshing to have as good a film as ""Budapest"" this early in the year, but ah who cares. It's May! Now that Spring has sprung so have the great films coming to theaters!Quirky and wonderful. Those are the two words I would use to describe Wes Anderson's new film The Grand Budapest Hotel. Anderson's last film Moonrise Kingdom was an absolute joyful surprise. It was one of my personal favorite films of 2012 and I made a vouch to see whatever this man puts on the big screen next. It seems that vouch payed off because by gone it he's done it again!The film takes place in the 1930's between wars in Europe and is about a European Grand Budapest Hotel's famous concierge, M. Gustave (played by a magnificent Ralph Fienes). After the woman in which he loves (or one of them at least) is murdered, the will for who will receive her money and possessions is read and she has left none other than her priceless painting ""Man with an Apple"" to Gustave. The family of the deceased battle Gustave and his new friend-Lobby Boy ""Zero"" for this prized possession as well as for an enormous fortune.This is Ralph Fienes' best performance to date. His remarkable banter in his relationship with Zero is hysterical, interesting, and at some points touching. Without a doubt the best performance of the year so far. However, the most unique part of the film as a whole is the directing. Wes Anderson's style is so incredibly plain and unusual at the same time (in a good way). It feels like a very old 1930's film with very basic angles and strait-forward shots, but at the same time it makes the film all the more entertaining to watch. It can't be explained on paper that's why you have to SEE IT! The humor in this film is very quirky and off the wall, much dirtier than that of Moonrise Kingdom.

Stunningly realised laugh out loud funny.  Wes Anderson's finest yet.,"Wes Anderson divides opinion. Of that there can be no debate.This movie will divide opinion. Of that there is no doubt.But it is a work of very great merit because it takes the medium and turns it upside down. This movie melds slapstick with performance art, melodrama with interior design, comedy with tragedy and it makes Ralph Feinnes a little bit godlike (something I never thought I'd never catch myself saying).Feinnes' central performance in this movie is mesmerising. Half terribly polite, terribly gay aristocrat, half rampantly heterosexual (having bedded half the female population of the fictitious Zubrowka, a European alpine state). He swears like a trooper, in the most inappropriate way in an ever so pukka accent that just doesn't seem right.He leads us through the proceedings with such dexterity that you cannot possibly guess what is coming next, aided throughout by his sidekick - the 17 year old Lobby Boy Zero Mustapha played by Tony Revolori (he looks about 10, perhaps exacerbated by his hilarious hand drawn moustache). The movie is mainly shot in flashback as the older Zero Mustapha (H. Murray Abraham) recalls the tale of how he came to own what was once a grand edifice but is now entirely run down and frequented by a bunch of random loners.The tale is, of course, ridiculous and involves murder, robbery, disputed wills and the most outrageous jail break you will ever see in your life.The flashback element is framed in a perfect square - a screen shape not seen since the silent era (it's not even 4:3 aspect ratio it's 4:4. Although it's described as 1:37 on IMDb - not so). Frame after frame brings delight. The attention to detail in propping, in background asides, in costume and in the comic use of animation or manipulated film speed (the sledge scene is a hoot) adds layer upon layer and makes the movie a must see again to pick out what you missed the first time.The cast list is too long to list here but I counted 13 bona fide A listers. Spot them if you can as some of them aren't on screen long (an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton, for example, departs after about 5 minutes).Repeatedly Anderson uses repetition in his script and it's laugh out loud funny every time.How good was it?Well, put it this way, I ain't ever seen an audience burst into almost universal spontaneous applause on a rainy Tuesday night outside of a film festival.That's how good it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
'The Grand Budapest Hotel': Grand Madness,"As butts of humor go, the Nazis are the gift that keeps on giving. In ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" writer-director Wes Anderson continues the proud tradition of ""To Be or Not to Be,"" ""The Great Dictator,"" ""A Night in Casablanca"" and ""The Producers"" in making totalitarianism grist for the comedic mill.Inspired by the writings of Austrian novelist, playwright and journalist Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" stars Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who joins with one of his employees (the wondrous 17-year-old actor Tony Revolori whose almond-shaped Wile E. Coyote eyes practically steal the film all by themselves) to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder.The film opens with a teen-aged girl stopping at the cemetery monument of a writer (Tom Wilkinson) while toting a memoir penned by a character only known as ""The Author."" She begins reading a chapter about a trip he made to the Grand Budapest Hotel a half-century ago.Suddenly we're in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, a European alpine state, where we find the once-grand hotel now threadbare and mostly vacant.The young version of the writer (played by Jude Law) meets the hotel's old owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham as an elderly version of Revolori's character) and over dinner in the hotel's enormous but empty dining room, Zero tells him the tale of how he took ownership of the hotel and why he is unwilling to close it down.The owner's tale starts circa 1932 in the final years of the hotel's salad days, when he worked as a lobby boy, around the time Nazi-like thugs begin a rise to power.Zubrowka is teetering on the brink of war, of course (wink-wink), but Gustave, the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge (the terrifically deadpan Fiennes _ the anti-Groucho) is blissfully oblivious as he wines and dines a series of aging, blonde women who love the hotel because of his, uh, ""exceptional service."" One of the these ladies is Madame D (Tilda Swinton), whom Gustave spends the night with before her departure (a departure, as it turns out, in more ways then one).Madame D turns up dead (apparently not at all by natural causes), and Gustave, with Zero in tow, races to her wake and the quick-to-follow reading of the will, where he finds that she's left him with the priceless painting, ""Boy With Apple."" The family is enraged, and the chase is on. And so is the war.At one point, Gustave is arrested and imprisoned for the murder of Madame D.To say much more would spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that Gustave's path is littered with some fascinating characters played by, in no particular order, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Mathieu Amalric, Saorise Ronan, Lea Seydoux, Giselda Volodi and a raft of perfectly cast featured actors. To the person, each fully grasps the value of underplaying.There are some wonderful touches, like the name of the newspaper announcing the start of the war _ ""The Times-Alpine Yodel"" _ and comically contrapuntal title cards that take on a life of their own. Anderson's use of ridiculous miniatures that would make ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" proud absolutely work, as do his signature use of rostrum camera shots and slow motion.But those of us of a certain age find special satisfaction in Anderson's wicked presentation of the would-be Nazis. It's almost enough to want Hitler back for a nanosecond so he could be insulted.It seems fitting, beautifully so, that ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" opened the 2014 Berlin Film Festival _ and that it won the Grand Jury Prize. And ""heil"" all over you-know-who.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Most Wes Anderson Film,"I feel like Wes Anderson's career has been leading up to this film. It's safe to say that those familiar with the literate, quirky director and his celebrated style will find much to enjoy regarding the goings-on in an Eastern European luxury hotel. Those who come in from the cold will likewise find a rare wistful quality and a very common air of post-modernism stabbed through unfamiliar settings.Those who know me know I have not been a fan of Anderson's work in the past. Wasting the potential of large, well known casts and keeping everything fussily symmetrical and pastel, I once compared him and his style unfavorably to that of a 1970's pornographer. I always sensed there was a distance between the elaborate set-dressing and stilted dialogue he always seems to employ and the emotional core of what a good story should be.It was only after I watched The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) did I realize his potential not as a filmmaker but as a creator of worlds. Steve Zissou was once again disappointing in its narrative but managed to be something altogether different from the turgid dryness of Rushmore (1998) and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and Moonrise Kingdom (2012) successfully took advantage of an all encompassing vision which made me much more aware of Anderson's true potential. It helped that his stories were more whimsical and entered squarely in the realm of crowd-pleasers instead of receptacles of arcane literary trivia. He also hinted at emotional artistic expression ever so slightly; especially in Moonrise Kingdom.The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is a happy marriage of Wes Anderson in all his forms; a whimsical visual artist, a pedantic Eurocentrist and finally an emotional storyteller. Ralph Fiennes stars as a philandering but thorough hotel concierge M. Gustave who takes young Zero (Tony Revolori) under his wing as the Grand Budapest's new bellboy. Gustave and Zero are forced into a series of misadventures when one of his elderly bedfellows dies bequeathing him a priceless painting.Thematically, Anderson seems to be playing around with ones sense of nostalgia. The story beseeches its audience into an unearthly place and time inside an unknown European country prior to an unknown war. The film begins with a little girl opening a book narrated by ""The Author"" (Tom Wilkinson); her surroundings are snowy and stark as she stares at a yet unrecognizable statue. The Author recalls a time in his youth when he visited the Grand Budapest in the 1968 and met the elderly Zero (F. Murray Abraham) who had become a man of renown since his time as a bellboy. In these early scenes, the hotel has fallen into disrepair yet while there's evidence of muck and rust, the grandeur of the hotel shines through. He then tells the story of his predecessor who is never without his tyrian purple tuxedo and bow-tie. By the time we get to the story within the story, within the story, the hotel resembles a wedding cake and even the bland colors of Zero's six by ten room pop out at you.Sometimes looking through rose colors glasses may skew one's perceptions of the past. The artifice of the film is always signature Anderson with a suspicious fakeness especially in times of heightened tension. Yet despite the fakeness and moments of dry wit and levity, there's more than meets the eye. There is a surprising bit of bitterness with the sweet confections cooked up by Anderson and his stellar cast which includes Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, and Willem Dafoe. Like in Cabaret (1972), there's foreboding hints of fascism lurking in the shadows; ever present yet not actively driving the plot. Could it be a statement on today's modern political landscape? Could scenes involving Zero and the authorities who jostle him be a statement on immigration? Could the stark clientèle haunting the 1968 hotel, and the hotel itself represent the failed promises of Communism? Perhaps not but there's no denying such sad realities.The language in the film also serves and important purpose in highlighting the film's bittersweet sensibilities. Like in Anderson's previous works, the dialogue is very formal and composed juxtaposed with the farcical elements on full display. There are piercing moments of obscenities which provide a cheap laugh or two yet I feel they serve another purpose. The film reminds the audience, specifically the true filmophiles that while it may resemble Night Train to Munich (1940) and The Great Dictator (1940), The Grand Budapest Hotel is very much a product of 2014.Leave no doubt in your mind, The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson's best film to date and certainly a film worthy of consideration. It reaches the apex of what the director's sensibilities could be which is to say entertaining, artfully done and literate. It's much more than a dotty wee skid mark and a pretty face, like Moonrise Kingdom before it, the film transcends and becomes emotionally satisfying, signifying that Anderson is finally willing to open up and evolve as an artist.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Solid,"This is only the third Wes Anderson film I've seen, but I loved the other two (Fantastic Mr. Fox and moonrise Kingdom). The distinct voice and style that he put in those films is very present here, but for some reason it just didn't connect with me nearly as much. The production design, the music, the visual imagery, it's all rather amazing, should get a ton of Oscar nominations in the technical categories... but while I did enjoy the film to a degree, it also felt detached. It felt like I was watching with a wall in between, so while I could very much appreciate it and even enjoy it, it feels like I should've loved it even more.

From a Wes Anderson 'newbie': Wow.,"Wow. Welcome to the world of Wes Anderson, step inside...The best way to describe this film, in a word, is surreal. I'm guessing this may be a theme of Anderson films, having done a little reading. But what made this movie great for me wasn't the cast, albeit colourful and masterfully done from top to bottom (Willem Dafoe's character was my favourite, although it is hard to make such a choice). It was the combination of a comedy-adventure being set in such a surreal and absurd world; that was what made it click perfectly, and instantly.Take for instance one of the first scenes: A man's face is atop a memorial statue of some kind (or his grave?), and below his head hang many keys on hooks, hotel room keys I assume.HUH??!I was hooked from then on. Perhaps the best part was the desperate phone call made to the 'Society of Crossed Keys', hilarious, absurd, yet somehow relevant all at once. It is very hard to pick a favourite part when it comes to a film like this though, as everything worked, and what I thought was going to be a two-plus hour movie, considering the breadth (or depth?) of the story, wasn't overlong in the slightest, further enriching this adventure with the perfect tempo.To make things even better; in this bizarre, surreal and comical world, a long and hilarious adventure unfolds; further, and further, and further, seemingly getting more ridiculous as it goes. This could have pushed the film over the edge, but because each character was so memorable, each scene crazier than the last, I couldn't stop leaning forward. I feel like I have just gotten off a wild, hilarious roller-coaster that was filled with so many unique and memorable characters, so many funny scenes (done in many different styles of humour might I add), that I can't stop smiling and laughing to myself as I type this. 'The Wolf on Wall Street' was hilarious, truly great. But the surreal setting here made the comic element of the film just perfect. In that regard it reminded me a little of 'The Vampire Killers'. While that is a classic film, 'Grand Budapest' is one of the best films I have ever been lucky enough to watch.I must give this film a ten. Never has a film lingered with me in such a way. 2001 is the only other film where I could say, I feel this is perfect, and that is how I feel about this film. I could hear the conversations and laughter as soon as the credits rolled, everybody seemingly waiting for even more absurdity to jump from the credits. And after speaking to some of my fellow patrons, it seems I wasn't alone in my opinion. So not only do I now have a filmography to check-out, I must decide if I can wait long enough for DVD-release to see this again! I really could go on and on about how brilliant this film is, but it would turn into a thesis. Quite simply, every scene and every character was unique, eccentric and thoroughly memorable. It was that good. I cannot envision a film topping this one for some time... but I certainly would love to be proved wrong!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Intellectually Stimulating Zweig Cinema Magic,"A visionary director of obvious intelligence has taken a screenplay of gold in hand and created a stunning, literate, lovely motion picture for those of us who seek the intellectually stimulating in cinema choices. When it was announced that the wonderful author Stefan Zweig was the inspiration for this film, we were incredulous but tantalized. Upon experiencing this beautiful motion picture, we were speechless. It was thrilling to see Zweig's spirit embraced, alive on the screen and permeating celluloid. Superbly directed by Anderson with characters brought to life by a cast of great actors, especially Ralph Fiennes and F. Murray Abraham ( a delight to see Abraham indeed!), the proceedings are amazingly Stefan Zweig cinematically realized at times. The wit, the quirkiness, the satire is all there, yet the dark cloud of future totalitarianism casts a shadow across laughing faces as a portent of things to come. The tragic cataclysm of fascism in 1930's Europe is seldom far from our thoughts as we watch the incredibly photographed, fairytale landscapes before us. This is simply a wondrously made movie, set in a mythical country that is virtually Oz-like in appearance. The humor is broad and almost slapstick in sequences but there is something much darker beneath all of it and a certain overall uneasiness experienced by audiences. Without doubt one of the very, very few films of the last decade that truly deserves our unreserved acclaim. It is certainly director Anderson's most accomplished and meaningful work and our admiration for him is now quite intense, to be sure. He has honored Stefan Zweig most appropriately and deliciously, surely inspiring a renewed appreciation and even rediscovery of Zweig and that is the real triumph of this quite intellectual piece of cinema magic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Film Authority reviews The Grand Budapest Hotel,"The Film Authority reviews The Grand Budapest HotelWes Anderson's eclectic films have sometimes seemed burdened by the cinema of the past; The Royal Tennenbaums recalls John Irving's The Hotel New Hampshire, while The Darjeeling Limited references Indian cinema. By looking back to the writings of Austrian humorist Stefan Zweig, whose The World of Yesterday is suffused by nostalgia, Anderson finds a common soul to work with, and the result is a complex, over-stuffed but frequently delightful film, at odds with modern fashions. Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave H, a concierge at a glamorous eastern-European hotel who takes an interest in a lobby-boy Zero (Tony Revolori). Gustave has a secret passion for the elderly Madame D (Tilda Swinton), but when she dies, an act of art-theft sets himself up as her killer, and Gustave and Zero break out of jail to attempt to clear his name. Told through flashbacks between an older Zero (F Murray Abraham) and an interested writer (Jude Law), The Grand Budapest Hotel is busy even by Anderson's standards, with cameos from Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson and a host of other familiar faces. The effect is charming, in that it evokes a past where character and style were omnipresent, contrasting nicely with the somewhat tatty setting of Zero's recollection. The Grand Budapest Hotel has lots of comic situations, and even if there are fewer laughs, the elaborate staging and cheerful air of anything-goes storytelling will ender it to a small but passionate group of cinema-goers. Fiennes wasn't first choice for the role, and he plays it with gusto, and the whole cast seem to be in on the joke, especially Harvey Keitel as a spry inmate of the jail.

"Uneven and disjointed, but the overall package provides more hits than misses","Beginning in the 1930's, Zero Mustafa is a young lobby boy working at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Mustafa ends up under the wing of, and ultimately befriended by, hotel concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). The story chronicles the life of Zero Mustafa and tells us how he ended up becoming the owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Along this journey, Mustafa finds love and also finds his friendship and loyalty to Gustave is tested to the hilt when Gustave is accused of stealing a valuable painting and is also accused of murder. How will this endeavour end?I found this to be a charming film and I also found it to be a very funny film as well. The narrative is brilliant and is told in such a way that it makes you feel as though a book is actually being read to you (which I suppose is the point). It's a good story and as mentioned the whole 'crime caper' scenario does keep things fresh and fun. This strong narrative is helped by the great chemistry and inter-play between Fiennes and newcomer Revolori. They're a great double act and they both played off well against each other whenever they were on screen together.Where the film suffers slightly are in the majority of the scenes that don't involve Gustave and Mustafa. I think because they were so good together and because their characters were much better developed than the other characters, there were some sections of the film that didn't involve Gustave and Mustafa where it did get a bit boring. It doesn't help that the antagonists are particularly poorly developed and the writers don't seem to give us any reason to care for them. This meant that I didn't find this film interesting when it was shown from the antagonists perspective. Thank goodness then that Fiennes and Revolori were so good as they really were the driving force behind this film.Performances across the board were solid and notable praise should go to Fiennes, Brody & Norton. The cinematography was both crisp and bleak which was fitting given the fact that the story takes place between the first and second world war.I did enjoy Grand Budapest Hotel and found it to be a nice story that was charming, funny, and quite moving towards the end. The only real drawback with it is that it's rather thin in terms of character development and the film does sag a bit in the middle. As I said in my summary though there are more hits than misses and Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

The story is imaginative and quirky, though it sometimes feels scattered and overly complex.

"Big budget, big cast, big disappointment","Either you like Wes Anderson or you don't. I don't, and I'm bemused when his fans accuse his critics of not ""getting him."" My fellow cinéastes, there's nothing to get. Anderson playfully uses all the tools of cinema, but he has little to say.He really is like a kid, not fully fledged in the medium (and not improving so far). He's just desperately visual with a rigidly uniform style. His characters are mannered and wooden, all cut from the same cloth. He seems to have gotten his inspiration from juvenalia-- a mix of fairy tales and sketch comedy on TV. He uses a stable of friends/ actors, and even gives lead roles to poor actors (e.g., deadpan Jason Schwartzman). Actors who really need direction, such as Edward Norton and Adrien Brody, languish in Anderson's hands.He knows who to hire behind the scenes, though. The costumes and set design are very good, as is the music-- indeed, Alexandre Desplat's score provides the emotion. As for content in ""Grand Budapest,"" it's wrong-headed, if not despicable: if he's aware of what Central Europe was like as Hitler rose to power, he shows no indication of it.But here's a giveaway: If you see it, watch for the fake Egon Schiele painting, ""Two Lesbians Masturbating,"" and ask yourself, why? Why that subject? My guess: because Schiele is still, a century after his death, a radical painter-- an adjective Anderson would like applied to himself, though he is really only pretentious, delivering well-funded displays of eye candy.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A delightfully absurd Ruritanian romance from Wes Anderson,"Wes Anderson makes films that aren't like the films of anyone else. That may or may not be a good thing, depending on whether you 'get' them. I've always felt his films were like live action versions of the cartoons in 'The New Yorker'; sometimes they're funny, most of the time they're clever and always they seem to be designed for the intelligentsia. Perhaps that's why Wes Anderson's films don't make lots of money or win Oscars. Even the 'intellectual' New York comedies of Woody Allen have a wider appeal, not that their films have a great deal in common except, perhaps, their 'smartness'. Although ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has secured a multiplex release I doubt if it will wow them in Des Moines which is a pity since this is a film of considerable charm and a good deal of wit. OK, it's hardly laugh-out-loud funny but I had a silly grin on my face from start to finish. Like all his films it's set in what we might call 'Andersonland', a totally fabricated country made up of scraps from his favourite fiction, in this case the writings of Stefan Zweig who gets a special dedication at the end. It's literary in that words matter a great deal and play an important part in the development of the story and it's a film in which stories are crucial, (it's divided, like a novel, into chapters). Indeed, the story that makes up the body of the film is told as a story within a story begun by elderly author Tom Wilkinson informing us of how he first met the owner of the The Grand Budapest Hotel many years before when we was a young writer, (played by Jude Law), and the owner was an old man, (an excellent F Murray Abraham), who in turn tells the story of when he was a mere lobby boy, (newcomer Tony Revolori), under the tutelage of the hotel's concierge and the films central character, M Gustave, (a superb comic performance from Ralph Fiennes). It's when we get back to this point in time that the dimensions of the screen change from today's customary widescreen to the box-like dimensions of '30's cinema. It's as if Anderson is paying tribute, not just to writers like Zweig, but to film-makers like Ernst Lubitsch as this is a Ruritanian romance set in the kind of Mitteleuropa so beloved of Lubitsch and others of the period. All it lacks are the characters periodically bursting into song. If the film doesn't quite live up to its predecessors such as ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" or ""The Life Aquatic"" I think it's because there's no emotional commitment to the characters, It's too skittish, too self- consciously smart to draw us in. On the other hand it looks amazing. The hotel itself is like a giant cake that the baker in the film, M Mendl, might have made, and then there's always that extraordinary cast to keep us entertained. The film reads like a Who's Who, not just of Anderson regulars, but of moviedom's best character actors. None of them are, of course, remotely 'realistic', not even Fiennes. They remain the stock characters we find in those 'New Yorker' cartoons but they remain good company nevertheless. One thing is guaranteed, of course; you won't find anything else like it, at least not until Anderson makes his next movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A Top 100 Film of All Time,"I write a yearly book for listing 2000 of the best films of all time at Amazon. This film not only makes my top 2000, it makes my top 100, which is very difficult to do.

This is a comedy as good as The Producers.The actors in this film really stay in character, and no one hams it up. Brody came close, but his role called for someone over the top. Everyone else was extremely professional and low-key. It's the best thing that Goldblum has ever done. And several of the cameos are absolutely first-rate. This is a film not to be missed by any serious film goer. Fiennes deserved an Oscar for this role. Wes Anderson pulls a Stanley Kubrick in this production.

Wes Anderson's best,"The movie's biggest stength is its nostalgic atmosphere, it brings to life an era long gone that can now be reached only via the history books - or a movie such as The Grand Budapest Hotel.And it's fully conscious in that regard, not only does it acknowledge that the events portrayed here have no place in the modern world, but it hints that they might have never happened - or if they did, maybe it wasn't exactly like that, not that it matters anyway, let's just enjoy the ride.That's why the movie is done through the aesthetics of a fairy tale. The colours, the landscapes, the buildings, the costumes, you name it, it's all visually stunning.The characters are another part that eluds reality and approaches the surreal. This, however, doesn't mean that they lack heart. The main character is Gustave, an eccentric gentleman, well versed in romantic poetry, yet prone to the occasional outburst of irony or vulgarity. He is the one that engages the audience, carries the plot forward and provides most of the laughs. Also, a key part of his personality is the master and apprentice relationship between him and Zero, which is hilarious but at moments very touching as well.Another interesting element of the movie is that there are multiple narrative layers (the '80s, the '60s and the '30s) and Wes Anderson uses a different aspect ratio for each of them as a tribute to the movies of the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Best since Rushmore,"I am not a big fan of Wes Anderson and I haven't really been that impressed with his movies since Rushmore. I kind of thought he was a one trick pony. Maybe I was wrong because I actually enjoyed this one. Say what you want to about him, he is an auteur. He has a definite style all his own and he pulled out all the stops with this movie. I liked how a lot of the set were little models (It's only a model) and you could tell and he wanted you to be able to tell. He's not hiding any of this goofy stuff. There is an outrageous and absurd, but fun sled chase scene. Ralf Fiennes is one of my favorite actor after seeing him in this. He steals the show. He owns his part. It was interesting how they made Tilda Swinton really old. I didn't recognize her at first. Although the many famous actors that Anderson has come and go. I'm not even going to name them. It would be easier to name the actors not n this movie. The Muppets would be proud of the cameos and short parts. It's also incredibly colorful and pretty visual. I would kind of recommend to try to see it in the theater. Just a quick synopsis, it takes place right at the beginning of World War 2 in Budapest at a hotel, (of course) for the most part. It's actually kind of a story within a story within a story. It's about a friendship between a bellboy and a hotel manager who get accused of murdering an old rich guest he's been sleeping with at his hotel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
not bad,"I found this movie done in a very interesting manner, that differs from most others. Its characteristics are a peculiar camera-work and storyline. I think it's a good comedy,but nothing memorable nonetheless. It's worth watching though, one doesn't get bored I have a feeling few people would be disappointed afterwards. But no strong emotions remained after the experience for me. The storyline is logical, nothing makes one raise the eyebrow, because something doesn't fit. The chosen venues are close to me: an Eastern European country and its hotel in a bad time of 20th century. And the ending is appropriately sad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Extremely Entertaining,"This is not only fun and entertaining, but has a great story and awesome characters. The story is told in flashbacks: in present day, a girl is reading a memoir of an author; which then flashbacks to the author in 1980s; who remembers his younger self encountering the owner of The Grand Budapest (Zero Moustafa); and the owner then tells the story of how he became the owner.The story of young Zero eventually becoming the owner is quite awesome. The series of events that lead to his ownership begins with the death of an old wealthy woman who was a guest at the hotel. This series of events is very entertaining and fun. There are chases, ski chases, gun fights and prison escapes. There is also plenty of comedic, action and romantic moments along the way.There are plenty of awesome characters as well. The ones I found best were Monsieur Gustave H. (the concierge played by Ralph Fiennes) and J.G. Jopling (the evil henchman played by Willem Dafoe).This movie is one of the most fun and excellent movies so far. Definitely would recommend watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Pure joy,"What an incredibly pleasant film. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those movies that just keeps on giving. It's as gorgeous and funny as it is heartfelt and lovely. As a matter of fact, I can't think of anything that I would've changed or liked to have had differently. I think that that's a pretty good indication of just how good this film is.I think that the most obvious thing about this movie is the visuals. Every scene, every set-piece and every shot is just magnificent. The movie is grand and colourful just as much as it's cosy and warm. Indeed I can't quite describe the feeling this movie gave me. But certainly, I was happy and grinning like an idiot for the entire run time.Then I need to talk about the cast. Like the movie as a whole, it just keeps on giving. As the film gets going I couldn't believe how many stars were in this cast. They were all introduced in great ways and I just kept laughing as more and more of them were revealed. For me, the stand out was Ralph Fiennes. He captured the mood of the film so perfectly that it felt like he was born for this role.Although I separated these two aspects of the movie, they are just parts of an incredible sum. Everything in this movie is just sublime. And when you combine all those sublime parts you end up with this masterpiece known as The Grand Budapest Hotel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson,"Wes Anderson is not for everyone. At this point, his films are an acquired taste, and there's enough of a body of work for people to make up their minds whether they like the brand of hand-made, exquisitely carved life-sized doll houses he's selling (if you told me a major director was also a serial killer, my first guess would be Wes Anderson). I happen to be an avid Anderson fan, but I don't argue with people who aren't. His bouts of whimsy are prone to self- indulgence, and his austere emotionalism can be hard to connect with. He's a tremendous filmmaker but he isn't invincible—The Life Aquatic is self-indulgent, The Darjeeling Limited is just plain bad. Still, Wes Anderson on his worst day is better than 98% of working directors on their best.The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson working on a very, very good day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Great entertainment,"At last! A movie that has some quality . After all of the crap I've been tricked into watching lately I was a bit wary going in, but it turned out that I was being too pessimistic. Everybody in the cast gave us our money's worth and the storyline moved along at a perfect pace. Great scriptwriting with intelligent jokes that kept you on your listening toes throughout the film. Fiennes was fantastic and Dafoe wasn't too far behind (even though he didn't say much) Cameo appearances by just about everybody only added to the enjoyment but it did have me asking the question ""How do these guys find the time, with all of the other projects they have on the go?"" Anybody with a half decent sense of humour and a quick wit will find that the time flies by as you chuckle in your seat. Go see it and come out feeling like you've just seen one of the better shows around. Enjoy BillC",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
More adventure and hilarity than usual for Anderson,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is Wes Anderson's most imaginative effort yet. The perpetually quirky master of symmetry expands his scope in a way not seen since ""The Life Aquatic,"" but this story is infinitely more accessible and entertaining.The film, set in a fictionalized version of Europe, takes an unusual storytelling approach. A now- deceased author (Tom Wilkinson) relays the story behind his most famous novel. When he was younger (played by Jude Law), he visited the once-infamous and decrepit Grand Budapest Hotel, where he comes upon the its owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who tells the story of how he came to own it. He's the film's primary narrator, telling the story of how as a young immigrant boy (Tony Revolori) he came under the tutelage of the hotel's flamboyant and unapologetic concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).Fiennes gives a much-welcome change of pace performance as Gustave that is both hilarious and delightful. The tone of ""Grand Budapest"" leans this way as well. Whereas most of Anderson's films move from that quirky, dry humor into stark depictions of relationships, ""Budapest"" almost never loses its comic edge. Far and away, the film earns its label as Anderson's funniest movie.From the outside, the plot looks like a murder mystery farce. Gustave wins the affections of rich old women who stay at the hotel through flattery and sexual services. When one of his most devoted customers, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) turns up murdered, she wills Gustave the priceless painting ""Boy with Apple,"" provoking the ire of Madame's scornful son, Dmitri, (Adrien Brody). To ensure he gets what's rightfully his, Gustave and Zero steal the painting and Gustave makes a deal to make Zero his heir in exchange for his help. The next day, Gustave is arrested for the murder and Zero tries to help him escape and prove his innocence.Gustave and Zero form a hysterical but meaningful relationship. For all of Gustave's risky, eccentric shenanigans, he grows fond and protective of the boy. This kind of friendship has never been the center of an Anderson film; usually, its sibling or family dysfunction. Consequently, ""Budapest"" is a bit shallower in character depth, opting for moments of pure entertainment than inward exploration. On the plus side, it does make ""Budapest"" more accessible than earlier Anderson films, which could now be considered a trend given that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was even more so that way.The case of ""Grand Budapest"" extends well beyond Anderson's circle of actors, relegated most of the usual suspects to cameos and small supporting roles. In doing so, Anderson proves he can direct any actor of reasonable talent into fitting with his style. This ensemble is especially vast, though the one real standout is Willem Dafoe as Jopling, Dmitri's brass-knuckled henchman.Anderson really ups the adventure and fun of ""Grand Budapest"" and celebrates his filmmaking style. He adds even more brightness, color, symmetry and hijinks, something he can get away with at this point in his career due to greater audience familiarity. He hasn't gone his deepest, or really pushed himself as an intellectual, but ""Grand Budapest"" proves to be immensely satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Beauty in the static scenery and dynamic caricatures,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is art in motion, inspired by the Silent Era of film. Director Wes Anderson presents us an adventure where Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) tries to prove his innocence of a murder with the help of his employee, simply named Zero (Tony Revolori). While the story lacks focus at times, the movie remains entertaining through its quirky, witty humor and the growing relationship between Gustave and Zero. This is a visual spectacle to be seen on the big screen. Truly.The Grand Budapest Hotel stars Ralph Fiennes, popularly known for portraying ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,"" playing a completely different character that I will name, Monsieur Gustave. A devoted concierge of the hotel, Gustave is shallow, selfish, and takes advantage of vulnerable older women for his pleasure. The other major character is Zero, a refugee without a family, looking for a place to fit in. He is played by a newcomer to cinema, Tony Revolori. After a murder of a previous ""lover,"" Gustave is falsely framed for her death. This thrust him and his apprentice lobby boy, Zero into an adventure trying to prove his innocence. To start with, in terms of story it felt a bit weak, losing focus at times to show events that never end up affecting the overall arc or characters. However, the backbone that keeps this movie interesting through all the shenanigans is the growth the two main characters go through together. Blended with the quirky banter and dark humor, the relationship between the two is very well written and a joy to watch.There is no way one can watch a Wes Anderson directed movie and not talk about his visual style. His previous films are distinctively unique, and this movie is no different. I personally loved the visuals of The Grand Budapest Hotel. So much so that I feel each frame of the movie could have been hung up on a wall as art, and each of them would tell their own story. Everything in the scenes you see are placed there with a purpose, even down to the way glasses are placed on a table. Anderson does something beautiful where he brings life into static shots of a room or scenery, through the movement and caricatures of the actors. The movie in general gives homage to the Silent Era films, likes of Georges Méliès. This is clearly apparent from the aspect ratio, to the exaggerated acting, and to the bright colors imitating the hand-colored film of that era.I have to admit I really enjoyed the movie, more than I thought I would. There is no denying that Anderson's movies are very divisive, people either really like them or don't. I can say without a doubt that The Grand Budapest Hotel will not turn you into a Wes Anderson fan if you are not already. Still, the ones who are a fan will find plenty to love about this film, and for those this a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
An enjoyable yarn,"As someone who usually can't sit through a Wes Anderson film without the urge to gouge my eyes out, this was a surprisingly painless experience. Sure, his obnoxious camera work and aristocratic narrative nonsense is in full swing here, but Anderson keeps this yarn relatively straightforward and avoids his usual quirky non sequiturs. The art direction is gorgeous to look at and this story book film works because of the structure of the yarn. The teller of the tale is F. Murray Abraham, who gives a nice performance, but this is a Wes Anderson film after all, so while there are a few moments of honesty, this is mostly a madcap farce filled to the brim with broad characters. It's all surface, style, lightweight stuff and doesn't have a millimeter of depth, but this over directed film is Anderson's most entertaining film in quite some time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"As quaint and quirky as the rest of Anderson's films, but made considerably more accessible with lashings of rich emotion and sublime comedy.","Over the last twenty years, writer-director-auteur Wes Anderson has built something quite odd in Hollywood. We don't just mean his deeply unique music-box films, which are themselves ornate, unusual and thoroughly offbeat by commercial standards. Rather, it's the repertory company he's established within the confines of the Hollywood system: a revolving troupe of actors who are more than happy to keep returning to help him achieve his singular vision in film after quirky film. He's reached his zenith with The Grand Budapest Hotel, an unmistakably Andersonian re-imagination of old-world Europe - with all its romanticised cultural mores and traditions - on the cusp of a devastating war.In the late 1960s, an Author (played by Tom Wilkinson in the present and Jude Law in the past) visits the fading Grand Budapest Hotel - an establishment gone completely to seed, with a limited rota of guests. There, he meets Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the Hotel's eccentric owner, and is regaled by tales of the Hotel's glory days. As a young, impressionable lobby boy (Tony Revolori), Zero becomes the apprentice of the legendary M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), a flamboyantly devoted concierge of the old school whose involvement with his elderly, female clientele - specifically Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) - will soon kick off an adventure of epic proportions. Mixed in with a disputed will, a stolen painting, a jailbreak and an encroaching military presence is a healthy nostalgia for a world that, perhaps, never really existed at all.Anderson's critics have long complained of the deliberate archness of his stories and characters - they're so meticulously constructed and so resolutely strange that it's hard to connect with them on any kind of true emotional level. Ironically, it's only his stop-motion animation feature, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, that managed to elude such criticisms, largely because the family of foxes at the heart of the tale were so recognisably human.He again performs a quiet magic of that order with The Grand Budapest Hotel, a sugar-light confection on the surface, but one with a darker, more historically grounded undertow. Much of the film unfolds in the key of a carnival: zippy, fresh and chirpy. But within his fictional Eastern European state of Zubrowka, Anderson conjures up the chilling spectre of Nazism - even if the swastika has been replaced with a pair of lightning bolts and the officers are given a more human face in the form of Inspector Henckels (Edward Norton).As a result, the film hits upon quite a few bittersweet grace notes, emotional connections that are often lost in the tumult of oddities that make up a typical Anderson film. Here, the larger-than-life Gustave isn't merely a bundle of quirks and tics: scratch beneath his fey, heavily-perfumed exterior, and you'll find a man with a heart full of honour and humour. He may be, strictly speaking, a gigolo profiting from the loneliness of elderly ladies, but he genuinely believes that he's giving them the courtly companionship and love they all deserve. The relationship between Gustave and Zero is also wonderfully crafted: an unusual father-son bond forged amidst their hijinks and capers.The cast of The Grand Budapest Hotel is, of course, delightful. Fiennes, a brand new addition to Anderson's troupe, delivers the funniest, warmest performance of his dignified career, demonstrating a comic flair so sharp that it practically slices its way off the screen. Revolori makes a charming cinematic debut as the poker-faced Zero, striking up a sweet chemistry with Saoirse Ronan, who plays his brave and bold love interest Agatha. The rest of Anderson's repertory company gleefully pop up throughout the film: Adrien Brody as Madame D's villainous son; Willem Dafoe as his ominous henchman; Jason Schwartzman as Gustave's incompetent successor, a generation or two down the line - to name but a few.As is now par for the course in an Anderson film, the production design on The Grand Budapest Hotel is outstanding and incredibly inventive. With his trademark hand-crafted visual effects (hotels and funiculars rendered in model form), Anderson lends a quaint, creaky charm to the entire film. It would be easy to get completely distracted by his snow- washed vision of a bygone era, if not for the fact that his characters - who plummet down ski slopes or dash across moonlit rooftops - are such fun to be around.It's easy to complain about some of the film's failings, most of which are characteristic of Anderson's entire oeuvre anyway. It's so decidedly odd that it's sometimes hard to view it as anything but a curio. At points, the film drags a little, quite unable to maintain a consistently swift, sure rhythm. But those are minor points in what feels like quite a major work. The Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson at his most assured and accessible: it's a film that compromises none of its creator's unique movie-making ideas and values and, in fact, goes quite a long way in communicating them to a far wider audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"Artsy, foolish- bland","The Grand Budapest features a drab storyline, wrought from the dullest fairy tales. The cast is of a magnificent blend, but their name alone is the upside.

The three stars I do grant this movie comes from the performances given by Ralph Fiennes, and an honorable mention to Tony Revolori. Ralph Fiennes commands the screen, drawing the illusion that he truly was a concierge in the 1960's.The director makes use of novice camera tricks, and the movie has the feel of a parody the likes of which has been seen in Monty Python, and Weird Al Yankovic music videos. This is not a notable movie, and a tremendous letdown by the ratings from IMDb, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, it really should be titled The Grand, Blandest.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Delightfully infectious, spontaneously funny and impeccably detailed, this is one of the best films of the year.","2014 is yet to reach its half-way point but I think it's safe to say that we may have a winner already. Delightfully infectious, spontaneously funny and impeccably detailed, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of the year and perhaps director Wes Anderson's best film yet.Also co-written by Anderson, the story is a baroque-styled narration, and a story within a story about the once opulent Budapest Hotel – a pink mansion set atop ice capped ridges in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka. Going from modern day to 1968, the narration begins when an unnamed author (Jude Law) meets the owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). The narration and perspective shifts to 1932, where the Grand Budapest is a luxurious hotel catering to the wealthy. Young Zero (Tony Revolori) has joined the hotel as the new bellboy and is taken under the wing of head concierge M Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustav has an OCD for perfectionism, with work ethics that include seducing his richest guests – usually blonde older women. Madame D is one such guest but her mysterious death sets about a series of events that turns Gustav's world inside-out while simultaneously making him a legend in the process.Packed with incident after zany incident, Gustav and Zero's adventures fill most of the running time with a script that never ceases to astonish. Anderson's penchant for style and escapism exists, but this time his typical melancholy is replaced with plenty of madcap humour that turns out to be more whimsical than slapstick. And that's a good thing because there's also quite a few startling scenes of violence. Speaking of which, the backdrop is pre WWII fascism and despite the film's many comical shenanigans, the inner musings on war and tragedy runs deep, even if these are masked with the film's more recognisable outer façade of a whodunit murder mystery.From costumes and makeup to the intricate crafting of its period backdrop, The Grand Budapest Hotel scores top marks as a multi-faceted and exquisitely fashioned set piece. Starting with the impressive cinematography, every frame in every scene is a picture perfect postcard. Another standout is the fantastic list of cameos, some of which are easily identifiable from Anderson's previous films. From bad guys played by Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe to an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, this has to be one of the biggest ensembles since Anderson's very own The Royal Tenenbaums. Finally, Anderson's greatest nuance in this film is the creation of a lovable yet equally perverse Gustav. Not only has Fiennes ventured beyond his comfort zone, his Gustav commands your attention like no other character in Anderson's eccentric universe. The Grand Budapest Hotel is highly recommended as a thoroughly enjoyable dramedy that is in pole position as one of the best films of the year.

Not a Zero,"Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the finer things in life are an acquired taste. The exception to that is writer/director Wes Anderson's films. You either ""get"" it or you don't. Which side of the line you fall is much more a matter of style and taste than intellect.This latest from Anderson may be his most visually distinct and stylistic presentation yet. He even tosses in a bit of a plot so that we have reason to follow the outlandish antics of master concierge (and murder suspect) M Gustave - played with comic verve by Ralph Fiennes. Yes, the Ralph Fiennes known for such comedy classics as Schindler's List, The English Patient and The Hurt Locker. Admit it, when you need a laugh, you fire up the Ralph Fiennes stand-up routine. OK, so he did have a role in the terrific In Bruges, but nothing has prepared us for seeing him in this witty, fast-talking role at the center of Anderson's wildest ride yet.As any follower of Anderson films will tell you, there is always fun to be had in picking out the members of his supporting cast. Assisting Mr. Fiennes with this one are Edward Norton, Jude Law, F Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton (oddly cast after Angela Lansbury dropped out), Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Lea Seydoux, Mathieu Amalric, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. Of course, there is also Bill Murray, in his seventh collaboration with Anderson. The most impressive new face is that of Tony Revolori, who plays the teenage Lobby Boy in training ... a role that turns vital when he is befriended by Gustave.None of that really matters though, as the best description I give this is spectacle. It's a whimsical romp with nostalgic tributes throughout. It's a movie for movie lovers from a true movie lover. You will notice the three distinct aspect ratios used to depict the different time periods, and the music is perfect ... from Vivaldi's Concerto for Lute and Plucked Strings to Alexandre Desplat's fantastic composition over the closing credits. If you are up for some hyper-stylistic eye candy, this one is tough to beat (especially this time of year).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Having experienced many of Wes Anderson's movies, I was enamored of seeing another of his called The Grand Budapest Hotel","Having seen quite a few of Wes Anderson's movies, I knew to expect a certain rhythm and flow concerning characterizations and story. So I knew that most of the characters will speak in a certain clipped tone that never wavers and certain jump cuts were also expected. Jumps in timeline was also expected as this one goes from 1985 to 1968 to much of the '30s. Most of the story concerns a character played by Ralph Finnes and his servant I'll refer to as Lobby Boy. I was quite amused by some of the lines and scenes and so was my mom who only asked a few questions about what was going on though she figured most of it out without my having to answer much of the time. So on that note, I highly recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel if you don't mind such an unusual experience of a noncommercial nature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Escape by Confection,"A meticulously crafted picture-book world, that are resided by decisively quirky characters, whose lives are governed by the principle of offbeat humor. These are the qualities that define what is almost a genre of its own that is a Wes Anderson film. In his most recent work, Anderson brings these qualities to yet another level with an unprecedented control and maturity.The Grand Budapest Hotel takes us to a made-up country deep in central Europe in the bygone era of the 1930's–the furthest away from here-and- now among all the Wes Anderson film destinations. Being a perfect concierge, the writer/director arranges a proper trip across the distance by triple-framing the core story: a girl visits the statue of a writer, who materializes on screen to recount his decades-old memory, in which the owner of a decrepit hotel of an old glory tells the story of m. Gustave H.. Once there, we are pampered, not only with the exquisite sets and locations of a grand scale and pleasing aesthetics, but also by the sweeping plot that grabs the viewer like no other Wes Anderson stories do.It would not be an exaggeration to call Ralph Fienne's m. Gustave H. the most fascinating and lovable Wes Anderson character that lived on screen. He is imperious, flamboyant, and finicky, and yet, gentle, delicate, and understanding. Arguably a ridiculous fellow, he still strikes us as a decent man, and through the narrator's affectionate eyes, is rendered as an endearing character that elicits a protective instinct from the viewer. We cannot take our eyes off the screen as he navigates through the threat of violence with squeamish grievances and stubborn adherence to his own peculiar set of protocols.An astonishing thing about The Grand Budapest Hotel is how it evokes complex emotions about rather unsuspected subjects. There surely is the bittersweet nostalgia about the world long lost, but there is something more. Although what m. Gustave is running away from is neither totalitarianism nor the threat of a war, we catch ourselves subconsciously grieving this aspect of the history by the end of the story. It is this tinge of soulfulness that makes The Grand Budapest Hotel truly special.I came to see Wes Anderson's films as perfectly confected pieces of pastry with tiny hammers and chisels in them. They allow us to escape from the banality and brutality of reality. Two hours in his theater is our brief stay in a grand old hotel of fantasy. As I realized, escapism is not just analgesic, but it can also be therapeutic. Escapism at its best allows us to address obliquely the things that are difficult to be faced headlong. In its strange way, it helps us cope. And of course, it takes us to wonderful places that delight our hearts and expand our world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
So gorgeous and wholesome,"It's interesting how the main gripe many of the criticizers of this movie seem to have is too little screen time for the big names.However, they have nothing else bad to say about it, so I can only conclude that the (maybe lesser known) actors playing Gustave and Zero (both young and old) have delivered absolutely excellent work.I've grown picky with the amount of movies I've been watching lately and it must have been awhile since I rated something 10/10, but this movie absolutely deserves it. There is so much going on from quirky comedy to heavy-hearted drama and from colorful fairy-tale like love stories to dark crime. Even more amazing is how Wes Anderson manages to blend all of this into one fluid piece of aesthetic mastery.It's like a train that never stops until we are at the final destination.

A delightful extravaganza with an engaging plot.,"The latest offering from director Wes Anderson, who is known for his own style of presenting a magical make-believe world on the screen, this is a fine example of an imaginative art of storytelling taking you into a different world of the past quite impressively. Narrating the story of a vintage hotel, the film has glimpses of more than one genres including illegitimate affairs, crime, love, murder, theft, jail-break, mystery, chases and much more. But in spite of that it never puzzles you due to an absorbing treatment of an interesting concept and some brilliant performances by a rare cast ensemble with many reputed names.Set in different time zones of the twentieth century, it is mostly narrated in flashback and tells us about the life a young 'Lobby boy' and his experiences with his boss,Mosieur Gustave. The lobby boy known as Zero is now the owner of The Grand Budapest and the film is all about his journey from joining the hotel to the present status of a sad, lonely man owning the mansion and much more. In the story told of the past, as one of richest regular visitors of the hotel suddenly dies, she leaves a precious antique painting for Gustave to be her parting gift in the will and that's from where the whole saga of crime and deceit begins involving the young Zero.The film unfolds like an exciting fast paced tale in a bedtime storybook of the young ones and presents many charming cameos of prominent names such as Jude Law, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and more. Along with the lead roles played by Ralph Fiennes & F Murray Abraham with a splendid portrayal of the young zero by Willem Dafoe.A kind of wacky comedy, it also subtly showcases the war scenario of those times & three different eras of century through some smartly written witty dialogues, an excellent background score, well detailed art direction and a worth experiencing cinematography (particularly the snow chase sequence at the mountains) which preferably needs to be seen at the big screen. The storyline also has a refreshing emotional angle between its leading male characters and then has a few surprising insertions too like a turbaned Sikh participating in a sequence happening in the Eastern Europe region of the 1930s.But at the same time, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL doesn't offer any great energetic crescendo and is also not for the ones watching Hollywood Cinema mainly for their mainstream well promoted films releasing worldwide. This is for the niche audiences who are more into the offbeat movies and can easily relate to this eccentric kind of story-telling not interested in giving any kind of simulated high through an overdose of computer graphics or some loud treatment. So if you love watching this specific genre then you are sure going to enjoy The GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL largely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
This is what cinema should be...magical!,"I have seen a few of Wes Andersons films now and to be honest while undeniably a talented director, they often left me bemused. If this is a director bringing all together, than I can only hope his next output is as well judged.The adventures of Gustave H & Zero are magical, in a world of CGI driven nonsense they remind you what the very best of cinema still has to offer. I had seen trailers for this and thought it would be worth a watch, but this is hands down the best film I have seen in a very long time.For a film to be so full of fun and charm and yet display almost constant imagination and flair is some achievement. The cast are fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes gives a performance which must rank among his very best, pitch perfect to the last he is the beating heart of the film, Tony Revolori (who I confess I have never seen before) is also worthy of a mention and his characterisation of Zero is full of warmth. However to be honest the entire cast (and like many of Mr Andersons films...its some cast) is fantastic to a man and woman.Even if you think it might not be your type of film, I urge you to watch it...you wont regret it.Well done Mr Anderson, I can wait for your next film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A Creative Movie Worth Visiting,"The adventures of a lobby boy at a fancy hotel and his mentor.I overall found the movie very enjoyable, quirky, and artistically pleasing. There are some things I could do without, mainly a couple explicit scenes, but this can be easily overlooked. The overall charm and simple fun of Wes Anderson's work shines strongly in this film.I think most audiences would be Surprised by how much they would enjoy this film. It hearkens back to a time of more creative movie-making and experiences. Many audiences will find a certain 'magic' of film (that is missing in many modern movies) present here.Check it out, see it for yourself, and if you don't like it, then feel free to move on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Meh,"If you go to see Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, or Tom Wilkinson then you'll be disappointed. Their parts are something less than cameos and really don't give them an opportunity to do their thing.What was great about The Life Aquatic was its spoof of Jacques Cousteau and his milieu, something specific and real to bounce the comedy off of. The Grand Budapest Hotel has no real-world anchor and thus it's just a silly farcical story. The self-important concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) takes himself, his position, and his hotel way too seriously. How much funnier it would have been had there been some real-world character to set Gustave against.The film is set ambiguously in 1930s Europe, even the Nazi thugs are ambiguous; their SS insignia looks like the scribble of a lazy physics professor. The special effects are period too. There's a chase scene on skis and sled that is ridiculously low-tech. How much funnier it would have been if there was something real world to measure it against like Cousteau's 1970s seat-of-the-pants, do-it-yourself science in the hands of Bill Murray.Then there is the fictional bakery, Mendl's, whose cakes and confections try to be funny, but suffer from the same lack of a real-world counterpoint. It just doesn't carry the comic weight of Bill Murray's ship the Belafonte in Life Aquatic because there is no Calypso to measure it against. For those of you who don't know, Calypso was Cousteau's real-world research vessel. The comic jolt comes when you realize that Harry Belafonte was a famous calypso singer back then. It's brilliant little details like that, that made me roar at Life Aquatic but that are sorely lacking in Budapest.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Beautiful movie,loved it As it goes flawless movie for me in the view of acting is concern. I strongly believes it might have gone for winning Oscars if it has released in 2 to 3 years back. I love the whole cast. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing and he is one of the best lead roles in an Anderson movie to date. Newcomer Tony Revolori easily keeps up with Fiennes doing a fantastic job. Everyone else from Norton to Ronan are fantastic. The set design and cinematography are magnificent as usual with great scenery and cool children book style backgrounds. The comedy hits every time and it even packs some surprises to with a great murder mystery that gels with a road film. There's even some sweetness underneath the zaniness giving it some surprising depth to it.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Another exceptional addition to Anderson's cannon,"I'm not sure I can say much more about Wes Anderson that hasn't already been said - he's definitely one of the most singular filmmakers of our generation. Needless to say, if you liked 'The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou', 'The Darjeeling Limited' and 'Moonrise Kingdom' (which I did), then you'll enjoy 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. It's got a huge ensemble cast, but the usual faces (Murray, Schwartzman, Norton, Wilson) are only given bit parts, with Gustave (Fiennes) the undisputed central character here.Even though it's named after the hotel, only about half the film takes place there - and when it does, it looks fantastic, with the colour and framing. They do a great job of telling the film as a back story, allowing Zero (Revolori/Abraham) to be our eyes and ears into the hotel's - and Gustave's - past. It's a fascinating story, with plenty of laughs, but also a decent murder-mystery/chase film packed in there. This is aided immensely by Adrien Brody & Willem Dafoe playing the ""badguys"".Everything flows nicely, there's precise dialogue (as always), a great score and great set/costume design. Goldblum's great as the lawyer and used really effectively. I can't really say much more - it's a really well-made and enjoyable film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
An exquisite tale of,"Time and a tattered economy reduces a hotel's luxury and service to an outdated tacky building on the brink of abandonment, but with a lot of stories to tell. One of these stories is an epic tale of fortune, greed, and friendship at the pinnacle of the hotel's life. The story follows the main character, Gustave an over zealous concierge who thrives at pleasing guests in any way possible. The plot finds one of the hotel's guest dead and her family's fight for her will ensues. It is no wonder that the hotel is at the center of the dilemma because it houses all the secrets and deceptions of the movie. It is almost as if the hotel is telling the story. In fact, the movie personifies the hotel through the richness and exuberance of all its workers and guests.Throughout the whole movie, the workers were historical emblems of the past just like the hotel. The hotel, the grand Budapest, was a first class institution that represented luxury, order, and hospitality. Similarly, the workers upheld the order and the cleanliness of what the hotel stood for. Gustave preached weekly sermons to instill the ideology of the hotel. However, times were changing pre world war 2 and the hotel slowly changed as well. The current state of the hotel was nearly abandoned, profitless, outdated building, yet the movie's personification of the hotel shows how old buildings could be filled with rich history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Visually stunning magnificent movie magic,"Would you like to take a vacation in Europe and stay in a luxurious hotel situated in the mystical mountains? While at it enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of the country in mind tingling details? Then think no further, the doors of The Grand Budapest Hotel is open for you. The Grand Budapest Hotel (GBH) is not just a movie but an experience in a whole different level. If you were not blown out by its grace then you must see a doctor immediately. This is by far in my opinion the best Wes Anderson movie that takes the viewer in an epic journey through the fictional land of Zubrowa and a hotel named The Grand Budapest.The tale of GBH is told from perspective of Zero (Tony Revolori) a lobby boy who works for the hotel. And he works under the talented and charismatic concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes.) These two brings us a story so unfamiliar and whimsically magnificent, a story of romance, fantasy and above all adventurous. And from the very start to the ending scene you will not blink because it looks that delicious.If you recall Wes Anderson's earlier works like Moonrise Kingdom (2012), The Darjeeling Limited (2007) and Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) you already know that he has a style of his own and Wes's movies looks insanely detailed. But GBH surpasses all of them and gives realism a new definition. It's a mix of miniature models, live sets and computer animation that makes this movie by far one of the most memorable of that sort. When you get used to the brilliant looks of the film then you start to engulf in the characters. And the finest and the impressive cast will not let you rest a minute. GBH unveils a parade of talented and well-known actors character by character just like it unveils its beautiful story. Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Bill Murray and Edward Norton are few of them. And the mix of cinematography and performance is complete by seemingly synchronizing and fabulously ear pleasing score by Alexandre Desplat who has dozens of compelling movie scores under his belt.This movie is not just a movie that you will only enjoy while watching. It is like some delicious desert you had while enjoying your most anticipated holiday on the cold mountains. You will recall its taste over and over again and will be mesmerized by it. And those brilliant sequences of the funniest jail break, cable car ride on to the steep mountains, high speed chase down a snowy slope will be steadily embedded in your brain. And that's just the tip of the ice berg.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Much ado about nothing,"This film has excellent cast, costumes and decorations. However it has a very weak and unconvincing plot and fails at storytelling. It feels like wandering through and exotic clothing shop or costume ball with carefully chosen grotesque characters. You await to see a great story but you get a banal and predictable plot. So this film is some kind of baroque, decorative piece which is supposed to amuse and entertain but never goes deeper than that.I was also surprised that the picture of a boy with the apple which is the center of the plot was so poorly executed. It is supposed to be a very valuable renaissance-like painting and they hired an artist who worked some months on it. The result looks like a cheap prop for a film, which does not look convincing at all. It is weird since there exist plenty of artists who could produce an excellent classic portrait in just 1-2 weeks.I grade this film at 6/10, so it is not a total waste of time, but you can find better films to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Many of the rave reviews I now realize come from Wes Anderson connoiss-fans.The positives: it is a feast of visual surrealism; it's a virtual fireworks of movie mega-stars that make for a dazzling show.

"Another New Wes Anderson Classic, But Not As Great As Others","I've always loved quirky comedies. The genre is so full of generic sex and stoner jokes that to see something off-beat, awkward and with true passion behind it is the most refreshing thing for me. Sadly, for the longest time, I had never heard of Wes Anderson. I don't dive into indie films that often unless it has an actor I love or some other person of personal preference connected to it. It wasn't until 2012's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that I was introduced to the work of the auteur director, and immediately after watching, I blew through his entire filmography and all related works. I found several gems, and some more boring pieces, but overall I was filled with joy over this sub-sub-genre of comedies I had discovered. So I was very much looking forward to Anderson's next directorial effort, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". And my patience was well invested.I want to start off by saying that I think Anderson's masterpiece is ""Moonrise Kingdom"", although many say ""Rushmore"" or even this now. But to me, the characters in Kingdom were the most developed and relatable out of Anderson's many creations throughout the years. So I went in hoping that ""Grand Budapest"" would surpass his previous film and become my new favourite. This is the only part of the film I'm truly disappointed in. I don't think Anderson caught that lightning storm in a bottle he had before. Instead this time, he's caught a single bolt, which is more than enough for a great movie, but it's not as great.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the tale of Monsieur Gustave and his lobby-boy Zero whom, while attending the funeral of one of Gustave's many elderly lovers, discover she has been murdered and that she has left her most prized possession (a priceless painting) to Gustave himself. Fearful for their lives, Gustave and Zero steal the painting and run across country to avoid Madame D.'s vengeful son and the authorities in hopes of keeping their fortune and discovering Madame D.'s killer. It's a classic who-dunnit with Anderson's signature twist that makes the film feel very fresh and unique. It definitely stands apart from many of Anderson's previous works, while still keeping many of his trademark themes.Ralph Fiennes headlines the film as Gustave. I've always like Fiennes work, but I always felt like he would never break free of me only being able to see Voldemort when I look at him. But he has finally shattered that mental state with his performance in this film. I will always see Gustave now. Fiennes plays the role with complete confidence and conviction, as if it's a hidden method character he's had boiling in him for years, only to now finally be able to release it onto the screen and give us one of the most interesting and amusing cinematic bachelors in many years. You can never take your eyes off him, and from his mood swings to pointless ramblings he always has an intoxicating affect. You might not understand everything that he's talking about, but you're intrigued regardless.Zero, played by Tony Revolori, is basically Anderson's new Jason Schwartzman. I can see a long and prosperous partnership blooming here. Rightfully so, as Revolori is a great new actor. He has a nice breakthrough here in ""Budapest Hotel"", and while the film doesn't let him show off as much of his skills as I wish it did, he still is always a friendly and comforting face to see. Even if it usually stays in that flat, indifferent expression most of the time. Zero is sadly made an observer in the film, not one to take action. Therefore, Relovori isn't given as much to do as he deserves. Regardless, I look forward to seeing him in future Anderson projects and hopefully breaking out on his own.Aside from those two, the film mostly consists of Anderson's more recent recurring actors that he's assembled from his past three of so films. Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe all appear, along with Anderson staples Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. All these combined create a classic ensemble of whacky and lovable characters who just add more fun and delight to the film. Although I think Harvey Keitel should get a reward for best transformation. It took me a good minute to recognize him.Overall I very much enjoyed ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". I would call it Anderson's third best, behind ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"". The characters are very interesting and enjoyable, the plot's entertainingly complex (although not by that much), and Anderson's classic visual style, unique humour, and gorgeous music all combine to make for one of his best films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"A comedy refined and elegant, but that may not be funny for those looking for easy laughter.","This was my first contact with Wes Anderson's cinematographic work, and for the very little I now know (this single film), I believe I can agree with the general opinion that the director is good, very competent but also intellectual, making very good movies that are a little difficult to describe in a nutshell. The film entertains us and we're able to enjoy the refined comedy that we're watching, but we can hardly say that its a movie suitable for all audiences. People looking for something less elegant, a more ""popular"" kind of comedy where humor is easier, may have a hard time noticing the jokes and actually laughing.The veteran Ralph Fiennes is the actor with more protagonism. Needless to say, he again gives proof of unquestionable versatility and gives the public a work of excellent quality. Adrien Brody and Edward Norton were also perfectly up to the characters and their challenge. F. Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Mathieu Amalric, Jeff Goldblum and other actors of enormous weight and prestige enter this film, but their roles are so small that we cannot even call them roles. Most were cameos. Perhaps the director's prestige and the overall quality of the film were the motives that led so many stars to make these small appearances.

"Adventure, charm and good story telling","Never having seen a Wes Anderson film before allowed me to witness a distinctive way to tell and present story. The way Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) charms everyone in this film and how loyally professional Zero (Tony Revolori) is makes these two a wonderful duo. I can't think of a film that tells an adventurous story whilst also exploring a mentor/protégé relationship so effectively. In fact it left me yearning for a mentor of my own that I have sought and failed to encounter in my own life.Telling a tale in a fictional country that draws upon the culture and history of several countries was very clever Mr Anderson. It is a great device to enable a slightly unbelievable, slightly magical, slightly silly and overall enjoyable story to unfold without us criticising historical accuracy. Yet still the film is presented in a serious enough manner for us not to dismiss everything a stupid. The achieve such a solid balance takes great talent.I only have two complaints with this film:Firstly, the ending is rather abrupt where very major events occur in Zero's life off screen. Why? It prevents us from sympathising and valuing Zero's story to the maximum possible capacity. I can think of multiple reasons but nevertheless it lessened my enjoyment of the film.Secondly, casting F.

"Colours, fetishism and many many famous actors","Above all, what makes this movie exceptional is how beautifully shot it is. Every scenes is a pleasure to the eye, be it because of the arrangement of the objects on screen, because of all the fetishist display of vintage early XX century objects (such as a key, or a camera, or a pair of glasses), because of the actors' expressions and gestures, or because of the colours. Lord, how beautiful the colours of this movie are! All the scenes are so colorful yet carefully arranged, I want to live in this world!I think, that's pretty much what this movie is about. Making you wanting to live in that world that got lost in the WW1 trenches. The story is constantly surrounded by an aura of nostalgia, of a lost world (though it is impossible not to think of the other part of the world that this movie does not show: all the contradictions and inequalities of early XX century Europe, the main cause of all the ""isms"" that fought at the World Wars). I imagine that someone spent a lot of time in flea markets trying to look for props for this movie, and I would have loved to be that person.Regarding the story in itself, it is not necessarily unforgettable. It almost seems as if the plot was just an excuse to depict the world in which it takes place. But it does keep you entertained, with many bizarre scenes and many hilarious moments. But hey, it does have one hell of an amazing cast, and it is impossible not to keep noticing ""Hey! Look who that is!"" every now and then. Some of the amazing actors that acted in this movie, like Harvey Keitel, were impossible to recognize; I would only think to myself ""That guy seems familiar..."", but I would have never been able to tell it was him until reading the cast list.

Recognizable Wes Anderson - nevertheless catchy,"Anderson likes to play both with characters and actors, and the result is a peculiar yet distinctive movie without ""normal"" persons. However, by no means, they are comedies, but rather dramas with comic elements; the same applies to The Grand Budapest Hotel where you can't have big laughs, but there are various opportunities for giggling and snorts. After all, background events and fates of characters are mainly dramatic. But joyful colors, symmetry admiration, the English language in the German surroundings, and lots of poker-faced characters provide the movie a surreal visual.The cast is splendid as well, with lots of winners/nominees of important awards spending less than 5 minutes on screen, and introducing a fresh young face such as Tony Revolori as Young Zero Moustafa. The star of the movie is definitely Ralph Fiennes as Monsieur Gustave H (both elaborated character and performance), but the most peculiar roles were performed by Harvey Keitel as Ludwig, Edward Norton as Inspector Henckels and Tilda Swinton as Madame D (the latter was barely recognizable).A must-see for Anderson's fans, and for all others without petrified approaches on cinema and depiction of ""serious"" events.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

magical,"A masterpiece of cinema. A respectful adaptation of Stefan Zweig's literature. The man might have approved of this stylish and imaginative work.

""Hadn't Mr Gustave's world disappeared long before he was born"", the film concludes.

Shifts in Society and Ski Resorts,"In his latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson does an incredible job of telling an ugly story taking place in an even uglier time in a beautiful and light-hearted way. Receiving a 93% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, The Grand Budapest Hotel is not only loved by fans, but also critically acclaimed. Taking place in the 1930s, the movie tells the story of a lobby boy, Zero, and his mentor, M.Gustave. M. Gustave manages a fantastical ski resort where he spends time meeting the needs of the hotel's old, rich, blonde occupants. Coming from zero, Zero is an immigrant who fled his war-ridden home to come to Zubrowka, the fictional European country in which the film is set.
 Alongside the adventures of Zero and M. Gustave is another story: that of the violent shift of culture in Western Europe during the World Wars. When the movie starts, it depicts a society of structure, nobility, and social hierarchy. From the beginning, Anderson portrays a hierarchy even within the hotel, with M. Gustave near the top, staying in a grand room with a grand bed, and Zero at the very bottom, living in a room the size of a closet. Everyone treats each other with respect, and everyone knows their place in society. Everything is structured. As the movie progresses, this theme is still apparent, yet things begin to change. For example, while traveling, Zero and M. Gustave's train is stopped in the middle of a barley field. It is then boarded by militarized police, who are seemingly ready to arrest Zero for lack of legal documentation. However, before they can do anything, they are stopped by their chief, who is a friend of M. Gustave's and gives Zero a note stating he is legally allowed in the country. This scene hints at the shift in the current society. At the end of the film, the plot makes it apparent that the shift in culture is nearly complete when a similar train scene is displayed, with Zero and M. Gustave's train car stopped again, but this time it is boarded by a stand-in for an SS death squad. Yet again, they are about to arrest Zero, but this time M. Gustave hands them the letter from their last barley field pullover. A member of the death squad proceeds to shred the note and bash Zero with the butt of his gun, symbolizing the near completion of the shift in society. 
 The beauty of the cinematography ude of a light-spirited sense of humor, although contrasting the ugly themes portrayed in the film, make the movie very charming. The excellent use of still and tracking shots, symmetry, colors, and beautiful sets allows for a stunning style of film that grants each shot an oil painting look. For example, at the beginning of the film, Anderson launches a colorful long shot of the hotel, giving a sense of its size and grandeur, followed by a tracking shot from the gondolas all the way through the resort, displaying the world it contains. Additionally, the humor is consistently subtle and funny, with skits ranging from the mysterious Society of the Crossed Keys, to the hunt for a strange yet priceless painting, Boy With Apple. The inclusion of humor and cheery tones in the film allow The Grand Budapest Hotel to be very enjoyable and fun to watch, even though the film tells a story of violence in a violent time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wryly Humorous Evocation of a Bygone Era,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is one of the best films I have seen in recent times. On the surface it is a comedy stuffed full of brilliant one-liners: Ralph Fiennes, as the concierge M. Gustave, gets the chance to play comedy, something he actually does very well. The plot is a picaresque combination of the absurd and the entertaining; I particularly enjoyed the prison-break sequence through the sewers, spearheaded by chief convict Ludwig (Harvey Keitel), and the climactic sequence where Gustave and his sworn enemy Dımitri (Adrien Brody) become involved in a shooting-match in the hotel, where everyone seems to be firing at everyone else with no real sense of purpose. Yet Wes Anderson's film is also an elegy for a vanished way of life; that bourgeois European world of dowagers and countesses, whose indiscretions would be carefully hidden from public view by discreet concierges like Gustave. The settings are quite breathtaking in their grandioseness; the Budapest hotel, with its profusion of exterior windows and restrained pink interiors, the dining-room covered with a blood-red carpet, and the lobby full of pillars, evokes a world of opulence and style. Together with cinematographer Robert Yeoman, Anderson evokes a world of precise geometric shapes - the rectangular pillars set against the rhombuses of the troops; the precise arches of the door-frames and the exquisitely placed dining-tables, turning the hotel dining-room into something resembling an examination hall in a school. The impression communicated is one of a world precisely ordered, both architecturally and socially - which is completely destroyed by military interventions. When the young writer (Jude Law) visits the hotel much later, and encounters the elderly Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the building is on its last legs, a remnant of a vanished world. Hence the film's last sequences assume a poignant tone, especially when we learn what happened to Gustave. Based on material by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig (1881-1942), who was forced out of Germany on Adolf Hitler's coming to power, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is an elegy for a world blown apart by military invention. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

On par with Moonrise Kingdom.,"Very well done. Each of the characters have a well though back story. The main character, M. Gustave represents the typical Concierge for a large full service hotel. Every guest loves him and he know each guests personal life, much like any modern concierge. He accomplice, or protégé, Zero has much to learn before one day taking the reins. The movie goes very slow throughout, yet Wes Anderson has a unique way of continue the story in a slow paced motion while continuing to advance the plot quickly. The narration was short, sweet, and to the point, not overdone or to an annoyance. The only issue I had with this movie was that you have to pay close attention to the subtitles and declaration of time. There is a lot of jump back between Past and Present.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Tons of Fun,"Wes Anderson movies are always a blast and The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different. This movie is so much fun. The set design here is insane and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. The performances all have a perfect balance of humor and heart to them. The movie is purposely campy and over the top but that adds to the charm. It's shot and directed to perfection. The sound design adds to every scene and the editing here is sharp. The movie has extraordinary pacing. The script is really well written. I think sometimes the characters talk too fast (but that's just kind of Wes Anderson's thing) and the whole storybook idea wasn't really all that necessary, but those are my only complaints. I think that this is a great movie and it's highly entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Taking Wes Anderson's Humour and Comedy One Level Up. Not hysterical but definitely Hilarious.,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) :
Brief Review -Taking Wes Anderson's Humour and Comedy One Level Up. Not hysterical but definitely Hilarious. I didn't expect such wild and crazy humour from any film of 2010's decade and here comes a complete shock that brought smile on my face instead of a frown. It's a freaking crazy heck of a ride that doesn't give you a chance to lose interest throughout 99 minutes. What makes it such a good going thing? It's Writing, Acting and Direction. Three strong pillars of this Humongous and Lavish Hotel hold the burden of expectations quite well. It may not make sense sometimes but it ain't got any loopholes or uncertain spams in the writing. After a slow start and losing 12-15 minutes before the main character's arrival, this film tunrns into a hilarious sighting from which you get an adult, spoofy and capricious humour. Ralph Fieness as Mr. Gustavo is as crazy and spontaneous as you can expect. The dialogue delivery by him makes the humour look even more whimsical. Tony Revolory brings cute dumbness through his character and the elder version of him is maturely played by F. Murray Abraham. The supporting cast is brilliant in every scene and every provided situation. The Grand Budapest Hotel has got a pacy storytelling because of which even some mistakes goes unseen. But not to forget the screenplay has so many variations and so many different funny situations placed and sown at right occasions. Wes Anderson has taken his humour and comedy level Up which certainly makes one strong reason to recommend this film. The other 2 reasons are of course Acting and Writing. It makes a rare combo of Crime, Thrill, Drama, Adult Humour, comedy, tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty etc. so add it in your watchlist if you are looking for any of these ingredients.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
The Grand Budapest,The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great movie that shows the rise and fall of a great hotel. It includes some of the most important incident in history without actually identifying them. It takes on some heavy material while keeping a light hearted feeling. This is one of Wes Andedson's best films that goes back in time to show what has become of the hotel. It shows how the owner first came to the hotel and that the only thing he could do is be M. Gustave's lobby boy because his family had been killed in the war.He becomes M. Gustave's right hand man. He inherits a lot of money and wealth from the death of M. Gustave but decides to buy the hotel instead because the girl that he loves always loved the hotel.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Strength of Contrasts,"The movie gives that feeling... you watch it and feel something like pain of looking at dirty truth although you would probably prefer to look at something more pleasant even if it were a sweetest lie. But you do not have such an opportunity. You just see the absurd and you understand that it is a film, it is an absurd, all is like pictured on canvas with pencil and paints. They use a pink filter for shooting (I can recall only one else use of pink filter, in 'La môme'), they show stupid gags and heroes are funny - to intensify contrast between beautiful pictures, nice heroes and ugly situation. And you want to cry of all you see. It is painful... Maybe, it is an effect after all our XX century history, who knows. If you could rewrite it you would do it.

so far the best Wes Anderson movie,"Movies by Wes Anderson are an acquired taste. I wouldn't call myself a fan, but i enjoyed some of his previous creations, although i wouldn't recommend them to everyone. In this sense The Grand Budapest Hotel is his most mainstream movie which aspire to be more than a comedy.As it usually is the case, we're following a motley crew of characters. Situated in Central Europe they tell their stories of love, lust and fraud. Only at the end of he movie i've seen that it had been inspired by writings of Stefan Zweig. I dare say, Wes Anderson successfully transplanted Stefan Zweig's longings from The World of Yesterday (Die Welt von Gestern) from pre-WWI into pre-WWII surroundings.The Grand Budapest Hotel speaks not only to alternative movie aficionados but also anyone looking for a pleasant cinematic time. It never turns mundane and communicates to a broader audience, although it stays firmly rooted in the domain of weird.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

On top, the most peculiar story provides the opportunity for the all-star cast (Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Eward Norton, tilda Swinton among many others) to shine bright.

This film caught my attention and kept it the entire time. I love the weird and odd directions Anderson takes the movie, and truly makes it his own. 1/2. Also reminded me of Fantastic Mr. Fox, but this was had less ""meaning"" when I reflected on it. After watching Fantastic Mr. Fox, there were clear values that were exhibited in the film. Here, there are significantly less which deprives me of my ability to overanalyze.Aesthetic/Cinematography: (How film was made?) Wes Anderson will forever be known as an unconvetional director due to his unconventional movies and scenes. Every scene was either symmetrically beautiful, stunning to the eye, or just interesting. Easy 2/2Spiritual/Ending: (Beauty of film/inspire towards the transcendent) Loyalty is the number one thing (IMO) that this movie promotes.

Nope, there's a reason they get paid and I don't. 1/1Score/Music: (Goosebumps/complement scenes?)

Completely Charming,"Wes Anderson is an unequaled cinematic treasure; or at least, that's how I view him and his work. Anderson is a filmmaker whom plenty of cinephiles adore, but a few find him to be too pretentious. To those who think this film is pretentious, I say 'bah humbug!' It's not pretentious; it's refined. This is a film for people who love stories, more specifically, people who love books and the relationships we can form with their characters even if we don't meet them and about longing for a time that we've never known.Though I enjoy all of Anderson's films, if I'm being honest, I think this is Anderson's best. As far as story goes, it's certainly his tightest and most intriguing script, and it has some of the most delightful and well-developed characters, and the charming world that he crafts in this film is one that I love so much I would be willing to live there (quite seriously).

The Wes Anderson Experience,"I enjoyed this film. It was a classic Wes Anderson experience: I do not mean this in any derogatory way, merely that this film had all the hallmarks of a Wes Anderson movie. I went in to see this film without any preconceptions or having read any background information and it was clear from the start that this was a Wes Anderson flick. And I really enjoyed it.Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as were all the starring and supporting actors, the story clipped along apace, the scenes were all beautifully shot and choreographed, this film is a great piece of art. The story may appear fantastical because of the way it is told, however the underlying tale is believable, not ridiculous. The small cut- scene animations that give the film some of its quirkiness are perfectly proportioned to keep the story moving along, explaining the action without slowing down the plot. Some of the characters are one-dimensional, but this fits in perfectly with the telling of the tale.A very enjoyable movie and one that will be even better on the second viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A story of a man...,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an adventure movie in which we watch a man who tells us the story of Gustave H who was a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka. We also watch a boy who works in this hotel as a lobby boy trying to keep his job in this hotel and eventually becomes the best friend of Gustave H.I liked this movie because it had an interesting and different plot than the other movies that I have watched. I also liked the direction which made by Wes Anderson and it was very good. One more thing that I have to mention is the music which was very beautiful. About the interpretations I have to admit that Ralph Fiennes who played as M. Gustave was as I expected from him outstanding. Some other interpretations that they have to be mentioned are Edward Norton's who played as Henckels, Tony Revolori's who played as Zero and F. Murray Abraham's who played as Mr. Moustafa.Finally I believe that ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a great movie to watch because it has something that we can not find in many movies and that is a new angle of view. From this we can see things different, this movie has color, has ambition and gives us motive to do many things.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
As far I know only Wes Andy can do magic like this.,"One of the director I always look forward to his movie release is that Wes Anderson. Well, who don't like his movies if they are aware of his masterworks. He's one of the unique filmmakers with extraordinary ideas. I always love his screenplay, especially his miniature cinema sets. He believes in those technics and presents on the screen awesomely than completely done with computer graphics. In this movie as well he used them very nicely and gives pleasure to watch it.As usual this movie too a comedy with director's traditional actors in it. A comedy that set in the backdrop of a hotel theme and their employees. This hotel is called 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' located on the edge of the Alp mountain in a fictional EU country Zubrowska. The story proceeds with the two layers of flashback to the years 1968 and 1932. It unfolds the life story of Gustave, prestigious hotel's caretaker and his pupil Zero, a lobby boy. Theirs struggle over the accusation of a crime and the other side world war is on a verge to invade the nation. Whether they successful to defend against the charges or not is the remaining story speaks.Nice story and performances with eye catching visuals. Easily one of the best of this year. It looks very ordinary if it was a usual style movie, but Wes Anderson's touch made all the differences. The adventures are the highlights in all of his movies and so in this movie. Lots of whites and pinks you can see on the screen which is kind of trademark of this movie. In this humour movie violence partially attached, but safely avoided all the cruelties. With the lend of Saoirse Ronan character the story exploits a little bit youthful romance side. The introduction of other characters in the middle of the storytelling made more venturesome in the later parts.I kind of doubt to suggest it if you are unfamiliar with Wes Anderson's earlier works. You should better start with them before committing this movie. There's a reason, because you may not indulge it like my friend who saw this with me who never hear the director. Otherwise, it is..., of course it is another masterwork by Wes. Anyway, I loved it and waiting for his new project announcement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
My rating: 8,"We've seen movies about hotels - beginning from the distant thirty years, and getting to one of the titles of Tarantino. But I must admit, a film about the hotel dedicated to the writer I had not come across until now.Dynamic, humorous, theatrical, fantastic. The plot is about the history of a building, which embodies the history of the 20th century. Actually, these are hard times affecting all of us; that shaped modernity. ""The past is not over, in fact is not past at all"", who said that? Film that shows when high manners are in place. Namely, when they are from kindhearted and benevolent people. When politeness is a manifestation of humanity, and we are all people, but we are not all polite. On a pedestal were elevated loyalty and long lasting friendship. Below all this, there are the small details that are the glue of our society. Their presence is not a question of luxury, it is an indicator of a highly developed culture. Alas, their disappearance shows only savagery.A polite criticism of the worst part of human nature, served delicate and serene. Film like that, from the past year (let us remember - century passed since the beginning of the First World War) is a great achievement. Resembles the films inspired by the writings of Agatha Christie and The Artist.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Quick paced, quirky and hard to take your eyes off","I tend to avoid finding out too much about the actual plot of movies I'm going to watch as possible, as I am easily distracted and it helps me focus on the story. As with most Wes Andersson movies though it turned out I really had no need to worry - whatever I thought I had figured the movie to be about beforehand was not even close to what I'd find.
The movie didn't have a single slow moment, always something going on. Camera angles, colouration and characters are quirky and swift as is Wes' characteristics. I'm not the biggest fan of Anderson myself, though I did also enjoy Moonrise Kingdom which this movie do have similarities too both in how the story is told and the characters, but this is a movie I believe will do well even with the people that might not be into the slower, more artsy movies. Not only is it pretty to look at but there is also an epic adventure taking place that keep your eyes glued to the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A Great Watch! 8/10,"Review: What a brilliant movie from Wes Anderson. The storyline goes down so many different avenues which keeps the movie interesting throughout. The cast was amazing and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as the lead. Like many other Wes Anderson movies, the film is very original, with a punchy script that is funny throughout. The sets were amazing, along with the different costumes and the whole look of the strange and mysterious hotel. It's one of those movies were you will see something new every time that you watch it because of the attention to detail and the many different characters who have there own individual backgrounds. In all, it's a movie not to miss, but you do have to have a certain sense of humour to enjoy it. Brilliant!Round-Up: This role was definitely made for Ralph Fiennes, who played his part extremely well. The chemistry between him and his bellboy was great and I liked the way that he dealt with Tilda Swinton at the beginning. The cast must have been a joy to work with because there are so many big names who bring there own unique styles to this masterpiece. I've always been a fan of Wes Anderson's movies, but this one is close to his best work. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch if you want to see something original and extremely witty.Budget: $31million Worldwide Gross: $167millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about the different goings on in a hotel. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
An excellent story with a disappointing ending,"An old man tells the story of his youth at the famous hotel to a young writer, together with its adventures and perils which ultimately led to his position in the present day. Then, he worked as a lobby boy for a very odd but perfectionist concierge, which involuntary gets involved in a dodgy testament, filled with crimes and murders.Their adventures are told in an unique way, funny, entertaining and unpredictable, having a hard time keeping even a single moment of sobriety. Although interesting most of the time with its dark atmosphere, it disappoints me with its simplistic and inconclusive finale. Its actors play superbly, especially the concierge, which puts a lot of soul and hard work into his character. It's a very good movie, worthy of an Oscar nominee, if not more, which brings some well-rounded characters and together with a good story, managing to create a truly great movie, if you count out the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Excellent staccato stylistic.... style, and much anti-American","I didn't have any prerequisites before seeing this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the very central European look and cinematic style by US Director Wes Anderson. The very stylistic staccato type of acting,the beautiful (almost Art Deco) coloring and scene setting was a welcomed change to the infamous Hollywood style of instructors, and seeing the full line-up of star actors doing these low key parts was simply a joy. The cinematic style reminded me of the of french instructor (Amelié, Knick-knack, Delicatessen for the prison escape scene) and many of the non-verbal comedy facings of the actors might even be inspired by cartoon TV-series Miniscule of little creatures acting without wording (race scene, closeups)- but it absolutely Works ind I enjoyed every minute of the film.Definitely worth keeping for a second review and a major candidate for Best Film of 2014 :-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Wes Anderson's Best Film (for a non-fan),"I'll be up front about something: I don't like Wes Anderson movies. I don't think they're necessarily bad, but they've never actually entertained me. I recognize his talent, and would never say that his films are poorly made (there's no doubt that the man is meticulous,) but he's never grabbed me with anything he's ever done. So imagine my surprise at not only liking, but indeed LOVING this movie.The film (in a somewhat complicated fashion) follows the adventures of a young lobby boy named Zero and the legendary concierge known as Gustave. The two find themselves embroiled in a series of events that threaten not only themselves, but the titular hotel that has become the center of both of their worlds. Hijinks ensue, and I prefer to leave it at that.In pinpointing what I loved about this film, I was able to nail down three things that it has that I feel Wes Anderson's other films do not (or at least no other film has all three.) Firstly, it has a likable protagonist. Most of Anderson's main characters I find either too self centered or too emotionally stunted to connect with or root for. Gustave however is endlessly charming and fun, and a loyal friend to those he feels deserve it. Secondly there is an audience surrogate in the form of young Zero. He asks the questions that rarely get asked in Anderson's movies, basically by being the closest to a real world character who stops and says ""wait, what's going on?"" when the audience needs that same question answered. And finally there is an actual plot and story that is interesting unto itself, whereas most of Anderson's films don't have plots as much an excuse for the eccentric characters to be put in a room together. These three factors added to Anderson's masterfully crafted imagery makes for a truly splendid film.Though Ralph Fienes completely steals the show as Gustave, there isn't a weak performance in the film. Everybody is operating with wonderful energy, and even as things turn dark from time to time the film is aggressively funny. There's a wonderful screwball atmosphere to everything going on that doesn't let things feel dour and serious even with some events could have been quite dark.For somebody who's never really gotten into Anderson's work before, this was just the perfect marriage of material, directorial approach, characters and actors. All the perfect elements come together to form this wondrous film. It doesn't suddenly make me like Anderson's other films, but it does make me glad that he made them since they appear to have been leading up to this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
7.5/10,"Effortlessly entertaining and aggressively likable, the movie has many elements that deserve high praise. Firstly and most importantly the visual coherence and beauty of this movie was flawless. I was constantly looking at the screen trying to take it all in, there's just nothing, not even the most tiny little thing, wrong with the aesthetic aspect. Production design and cinematography complete each other and add up to a simply delicious framing, that is explicitly reflected by the wonderful looking cakes in the story. I wasn't always thrilled with the tension scenes, but there is one in particular in the mountains that was extraordinarily magical: shot is such a stylish, thrilling and original way I was genuinely on the edge of my seat. I really can't speak enough of the visual aspect of this movie. Just as good is the acting here, especially Ralph Finnes' performance, delicate and artificial, yet the standouts are everywhere and there were some truly hilarious characters, watch out for Wiliem Defoes' performance. All in all this was a technically brilliant and stylish movie, but I just think that it fell short of something more because of a slight emotional detachment from the story. I have to admit that the central drama of the film, although fairly entertaining, isn't just as fascinating as the initial scenes in the Hotel. What is missing here is the genuine emotion and sentiment of a ""Moonrise Kingdom"", not to say that you aren't involved in the turn-out of events, yet I was always feeling the weight of the movie in my head, something that didn't happen with Anderson's previous film and unfortunately with the exception of some iconic scenes the movie is quite forgettable. This speaks to the missing deep sentimental element of the movie that made Moonrise Kingdom so unforgettable. Despite this lack I still had a great time and was actually surprised by some turns the movie made both in the story both in the style.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Stylishly Unique and Strangely Compelling: Wes Anderson at his Best,"To use the word ""quirky"" to describe a Wes Anderson film is like using the word ""wet"" to describe water, ""hot"" to describe fire, or ""horrible"" to describe Adam Sandler's film Jack and Jill. That being said, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes that very recognizable element of Wes Anderson's well-established style and embodies it in the most thoroughly enjoyable way yet. I would go as far as to say that this is his masterpiece. It has a fast-paced, humorous, and stylish cleverness to it that pervades nearly every setting, character, costume, and piece of dialogue contained within it.The entire aesthetic of the film, particularly the hotel itself, is so vivid and energetic so as to border on surreal, while being so uniquely stylized as to be completely distinct from anything else you've ever seen. The music for the film is also a tonally perfect match, being equal parts mysterious and playful. All of this brilliantly complements the revered, nearly mythical status of the strangely compelling lead character, eccentric hotel concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), who carries the film on his shoulders with great enthusiasm with his loyal lobby boy at his side.The film's universe and characters also have a distinctly ""out of place, out of time"" feeling to them. They feel just realistic enough to not be complete fantasy, but so fantastical so as to not feel real. The actual mechanics of the plot are compelling in their silly simplicity, revolving around a valuable painting known as ""Boy with Apple,"" yet the adventure that surrounds escalates into fantastically amusing absurdity. Even the villains are filled out in such a way so as to function as effective, intimidating villains yet still be surprisingly funny and almost cartoonishly nefarious. There is also a looming, somewhat nonspecific war on the brink of breaking out in this fantasy world (reminiscent of World War II era Europe), that threatens to tear it apart. Additionally, the way the story is set up is such that we know in the beginning that the glory days of this great hotel and its legendary concierge will, with time, come to an end. These elements add hints of melancholy and longing for a bygone era, which gives the film a bit more punch and substance than it might otherwise have.At its core, it's funny, fast-paced, witty, and weird, yet surprisingly simple and enjoyable. It will almost certainly win you over if you're interested in seeing something that isn't too heavy or serious, but still satisfying and full of substance. My only really complaint is that occasionally the Wes Anderson signature ""quirky"" style shines through so strongly in some of the more comedic scenes as to be cringe-inducing, but this is merely a matter of personal comedic taste. That being said, I think this movie maintains a wide appeal, even amongst individuals that haven't been a fan of Wes Anderson in the past. After all, this is probably his most universally liked film, having a unique and imaginative aesthetic and a fantastic leading performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
A fantastic original idea told in a surreal way,"Storyteller/Director Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) without fail would be one of my favourite directors, his artistic eye for detail and storytelling has a life all of its own, he has a way to draw you in and keep you engaged even when there is really nothing happening, with his unique style of camera work and his absolutely gorgeous locations, he has a unique ability to reinvent colour so that his sets are a world within themselves and so inviting. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a tale within a tale within a tale, the film begins acknowledging that on the farthest eastern boundary of the Eastern continent: The former republic of Zubrowka once the seat of an Empire a young girl walks up to and stands in front of a monument covered in hotel keys and holders, she reaches into her pocket and adds her own. A plaque reads ""Author"" ""in honour of our National treasure, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a book with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel written across its front, she then turns the book over to reveal a black and white picture of the ""Author"". The picture turns to colour and the Author begins narrating the story from behind his desk in 1985. He begins to tell the story of a hotel he once visited many years earlier in 1968 the hotel of course was The Grand Budapest. Set in a fictitious place the hotel stood in Alpine Alps somewhere in Europe. The young Author talks about how the once Grand Budapest hotel is now in a dire state, run down and looking a lot worse for wear. Whilst bathing he meets the current owner a mysterious and sad looking man, he soon learns this man is the current owner, he learns that he was once the richest man in the world who owned all the riches one could ever imagine. The owner invites the author to a meal and begins to tell his story. The owner agrees and begins to tell his tale of how he arrived and now owns the Grand Budapest Hotel. Flash back to 1932 and the owner now a young lobby boy begins the tale once more for the author he begins to fill the ears of the Author as he is whisked away to another time and into a life of murder, theft, love, sex, art and riches.. Visually this story is stunning, plot wise the story telling is masterful, the camera shots used are vibrant and gorgeous, the score is an absolute journey from begging to end, the humour is endless, a little dark in places but still very typical of Wes Anderson's style. At times it did run a little slow in places but not enough to take anything negative. The cast was huge, so many big well-known names and every one of them played their character perfectly. Ralph Fiennes (Clash of the Titans, The Hurt Locker) as Monsieur Gustave H, was brilliant darling so charismatic and lovable. Tony Revolori (very new to the movie world) as Young Zero Moustafa was also amazing as Gustave H right hand man. F. Murray Abraham (Scarface, Amadeus) as Old Zero Moustafa. Adrien Brody (The Pianist, King Kong) as the vile Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis, Willem Dafoe (The English Patient, Spider-Man) as J.G. Jopling Dmitri's right hand assassin. Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park, Independence Day) as Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, add to this already amazing ensemble Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and a plethora of other very big names and you start to get an idea at how big this film really is. You would think having so many huge names could only equal bigger egos and a total mess, but it is the complete opposite. I loved The Grand Budapest Hotel it is unlike Wes Andersons other film in the sense that this one has much more of a plot which of course only helps. I would recommend this for anyone who can look beyond big bangs and actually enjoy a real film. If your idea of a great film is Die Hard or something else as crass and pointless I wouldn't bother because you actually need to be slightly intellectual to really enjoy this one. Better yet if you don't like films with subtitles stay away, not that this has any it'll just make you think more than you normally would like to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Why you are likely to enjoy the Grand Budapest Hotel,"Some people seem to wonder why The Grand Budapest Hotel has garnered so much attention, praise and box-office success compared to other, arguably better Wes Anderson films. I, for one, have to say that I found The Royal Tenenbaums or Moonrise Kingdom better, more complex films. But I do understand the appeal and on reviewing this film will try in my very humble opinion, to dispel the mystery.Having watched 99% of Wes Anderson's filmography I would say this is by far his more accessible movie, both in the story and narration of it. It's a simple, pretty linear story, easy to follow, charming from the beginning. What I found makes this film different and easier on the viewer is that much more streamlinedThe Royal Tenenbaums had a lot of intersecting stories, as did Moonrise Kingdom and here every characters seems to serve the purpose of telling ONE story: how the aging Mr. Mustapha came to own the Gran Budapest Hotel.As always in Mr. Anderson's films, the concepts of family, friendship and loyalty are explored with nuance and subtlety as young Mustapha befriends the hotel concierge, Mr. Gustave H (played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) in a relationship that will change both of their fates. Young Mustapha, a lobby boy at the hotel, is being tutored by Mr. Gustave, and finds himself in the unique position of having to help his mentor when he's accused of murder. What ensues is a cat-and-mouse situation as Gustave is being chased by the police and assassins while he tries to clear his name. Although it sounds dramatic, the film is mostly a comedy that revolves around the two main characters and how their relationship evolves into a friendship that will last a lifetimeas they try to stay alive.For those familiar with Wes Anderson, you'll find some of his trademarks here: colorful supporting characters who make brief appearances with long-lasting impressions; tremendous attention to the detail of each frame, beautiful symmetry in the shots and a visual style that is all his own. One particular element that enhanced the film this time is that it was filmed in Europe so the shots of pre-war European towns totally add to the general feeling of nostalgia depicted throughout the movie (it's set in the early 1930s).I read somewhere that this resembles more a European film in that explores a social world that does not and did not exist in the US, and I have to agree. The myriad of British actors present add to that feel: Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and of course Ralph Fiennes.I honestly think that being much more accessible to wider audiences than his previous films, friendlier if you will, this is a movie that will appeal not only to Wes Anderson fans. It's just a beautiful cinematic experience, both narratively and visually. It actually reminded me a lot of Ernst Lubitsch's ""Ninotchka"", in the humor, wit and nostalgia. Add to that the bonus of seeing F. Murray Abraham in a prominent role again and you're set.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"Somewhat self-indulgent and some other problems, but excellent in parts","There is a bit of the King's Magic Suit Of Clothes about this film. A bit like ""modern art"", lots of people will pretend that they like it when in reality they don't. It is self-indulgent for sure and at times Anderson is clearly amusing himself. There is a similarity of style between Anderson and Jean-Pierre Junet (Amelie etc) but Junet has real style to go with his wit whereas Anderson is lacking in these subtleties a lot of the time. I also had a problem seeing what was going on for some of the time. Everything was very dark and perhaps my cinema has a poor projector, but I have never encountered this problem there before and I go frequently. Also the editing was very erratic - some shots needed longer because there was lots to take in that was relevant to the plot. Others were indulgently drawn out. I think I need to see this film again because I think I missed some of the plot and some of the clever ""only on for a second"" shots. On the plus side, the characters and the actors were excellent. The sets were stunningly brilliant. The story is fascinating and some of the dialogue sparkles with humour. Some of the shots such as the red lift scene are beautifully made and the actors and camera movements are clever before they become repetitious.So, don't expect a European-Quality film but it has way more quality than the vast majority of US films. If you go to see it, I would sit fairly close to the screen in a good central position and be prepared to watch very closely so you don't miss anything. You'll probably really enjoy it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
What if Hergé met Wes Anderson?,"The movie consists of consecutive tableaus. One cinematic comic book style dollhouse backdrop after the other. Never closing in on a reality anyone has ever seen.

Wes Anderson does it again,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an experience like no other. Never have I seen a movie so original, creative and beautifully made.Wes Anderson is a director who clearly understands his craft and knows what he's doing. The camerawork is simply sublime. Every shot feels artistic in some way and works well with the time period the film's set in. The set design is gorgeous. The wide range of bright colours creates this joyous and retro feeling. I love the change of aspect ratio as the time of year changes. Each one is respectable and used to its advantage during each time period.The acting overall is just outstanding to say the least. Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance in years as M. Gustave. He adds so much charm and wit which adds a lot of likability to his character. As a debutant, Tony Revolori was brilliant and is a great accomplice to M. Gustave. Two other characters which I thought were amazing were Jopling (Willem Dafoe) and Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). Both actors portrayed them perfectly and brought some of the most precious moments in the film overall.Wes Anderson's script was something you've never heard before. He adds so much interesting and investing dialogues which embellishes the characters completely. Anderson doesn't stop his imagination from running wild. His story has a mixed bag of darkness, excitement and humour to keep the viewer from getting bored at any point. Accompanied with his stylish direction, the costumes, cinematography, score, set design, acting and crisp editing this fairy-tale like film is a one of a kind experience that has to be watched at any given cost.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

Attractive picture book,"As soon as I saw the poster of the movie, I was captured by its unique and artistic colors and picture. And as a person who especially enjoy mystery films, I couldn't not watch it. And it was as good as I thought it would be, or even better. There is a unique aura throughout the movie that takes the viewer into a different world- one like a fairy tale or a picture book because of its cinematography and effects. (Although it wouldn't be at all for children) The color scheme is beautiful and very visually appealing. Although the story might be predictable and the development of it slightly sudden and unusual and even boring to some people, it is entertaining and it was not tedious at all for me with its short running time. There are many scenes that are darkly comical and it's almost like you're in a game in some scenes such as when they escape prison and are being chased. Like this, this movie is truly peculiar and is not just a commercial film. It's beautiful and attractive like a piece of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
"Extremely R rated, yet a masterpiece for production learning.","A few extremely vulgar scenes that someone decent would wish to unwatch, but damn! The set design, the composition, the frame adjustment and perfect movement of subjects according to the grids of frame! Absolutely stunning production and post-production.I did find jumps at some points. Even in one or two scenes, the lighting control didn't play the role right in contributing to storytelling. But again, the perfect composition of shots has made me realize how intriguing a scene can be if one doesn't take the frame grids for-granted. The choice of colors in different sets was stunning. I believe set design, frame composition and color grading are the reason I used to wonder on seeing any clip of this movie randomly on social media that ""Of what movie do these clips belong to"" ?The rating deducted is ... because of the unnecessary vulgarity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Trans-Europe Express,"Writer/director Wes Anderson knew early on what he wanted to do with his life. Already as a child, he began making silent movies with a Super 8 camera he had borrowed from his dad. While attending the University of Texas he then met Owen Wilson, a talented young actor Anderson would team up with in many upcoming films. Not least in his first masterpiece ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"".Wes Anderson began writing the screenplay for his magnum opus back in 2006. After failing to finish the story, he instead set out on an extended train journey around central Europe in search of inspiration. During the trip, he read the Austrian author Stefan Sweig's famous novel ""The World of Yesterday"", which gave him the vision he needed to complete an 18-page shooting script.The movie tells the story of a concierge at a large European resort somewhere in the Alpine region. The piece deals with unexpected, sudden death and the battle for an immense family fortune. Everything takes place during the violent first half of the 20th century.In preparation for the film Wes Anderson gathered a large ensemble cast in Germany. During principal photography they stayed in the border town of Görlitz, all in the same small Gasthaus. To increase cohesion in the group, the director invited his players to have dinner together every evening. For the same reason he also ordered that all make-up and costume fittings be done together in the main lobby.And it worked. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" premiered at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, where many critics praised the actors for bringing the story to life in such a convincing way. Will Anderson was not forgotten either. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" won the festival's prestigious Jury Prize. The movie has later been called one of the greatest comedies/dramas of the 21st century.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"

"A quirky, well-acted and funny dramedy","This is a nice movie of Wes Anderson's. It follows the ""story within story"" structure, and does so successfully. It's primarily narrated in first-person, which alternates with dialogue when necessary. Additionally, it's divided in parts, a fact that makes it very original. It has the characteristic palette of pastel colours which the director uses, and even if I haven't seen any other movie Wes Anderson has directed yet, I found it very interesting, funny and touching as well. The story has some twists and turns that make it exciting, the performances are great, especially that of Ralph Fiennes, but also Tony Revolori, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan deliver very good performances. The direction is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful and the film carries a message about the historical buildings, and even monuments, that get demolished basically for money. Even if the ending may not be the happiest possible, this one remains a fun and ""colourful"" movie that you can enjoy, with a surprisingly nostalgic look to the past, uncommon for the director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"
Philosophy made slapstick,"This is a 'Marmite' film. You will either love it, or hate it. I loved it.

Those mistakes are like pineapple on delicious pizza. Although the film was way too good in editing, sound quality was amazing and was a complete experience of an artistic cinema.

The sets are very beautiful, and certain scenes have an almost animated aspect. The movie also has some very funny characters, with Ralph Fiennes absolutely stealing every scene he is on screen. The relative new-comer portraying Zero also does a great job with his many scenes opposite of Ralph Fiennes. The re-occurring poetry scenes were hilarious as well as the Prison scenes.
