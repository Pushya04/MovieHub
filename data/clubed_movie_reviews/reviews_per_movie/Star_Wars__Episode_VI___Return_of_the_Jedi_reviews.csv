I love this trilogy,"The incredible ending to the story of the original Return of the Jedi trilogy turned out to be epic and large-scale, and we will also see how the storylines of many of our favorite characters end.A truly iconic part, the second half is one of the best in the history of Star Wars. I want to revise such a film, not episodes 7-9... That's where the story should have ended and not continued!I would not say that there are more impressions than from the fifth episode, it is still darker and better. However, I watched the sixth episode with great enthusiasm and I advise you to watch it!My Rating : 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A touching end,"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks!  True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears.  It's perfect.  The end could not be better.  I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.  It's very effective.  Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man.  He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!).  Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant.  It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a lovely conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies of all time,"This movie might not be as flawless as the first two but everything involved with those throne room scenes were some of the highest points in the entire saga, the conflict between luke and vader, the emperor himself finally showing up for the first time and he's so good at being this manipulative evil, the final lightsaber battle is just breathtaking with that amazing music by john williams and the beautiful ending of the film that brings everything together, those moments alone makes this one of the most underrated in the whole franchise and in my opinion it's the second best movie behind the empire strikes back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most peculiar Star Wars and under appreciated,"Totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! A very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters, more truths and the epic Emperor Palpatine! I love all the majestic forest aspects. Still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. The bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. Quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite ending of all time.,"There's a reason why Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader is my favorite character of all time. Even after everything he did, he still fulfilled the prophecy and brought balance to the force. The scene where luke takes off his helmet makes me tear up all the time. Poetry.Not only that, but the story of Luke Skywalker is also told flawlessly. As with obi wan, he was never seduced by the dark side.Truly an amazing movie. Not as good as Empire, but outstanding nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Boy Who Loved ""Star Wars""","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Age helps final episode of sci-fi saga,"Perspective is a good thing.  Since the release of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: ""Return of the Jedi"".  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga.  Following on from the conclusion of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts.Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire.  Now swathed all in black, Luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn.  His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest.  While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty Sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga.  Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke's destiny is played out on screen.ROTJ really is Luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original.  His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate.  The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow.  The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in ""Empire"".  In fact only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion.  This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction.  The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader.  The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from ""Star Wars"", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else.  Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles.  Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series.  Ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all.  Fisher's Leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about...  Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects.  The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance.  Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", John Williams' score is as much a part of ""Star Wars"" folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made.  Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again.  ROTJ works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made.  Is it already?  The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series.  This is why ""Return of the Jedi"" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fitting closure to the 'Star Wars' series, now out on DVD.","My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track.My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"36 years and 737 reviews later, what is new left to be said?...","...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.It just takes itself too seriously. ""I know he's OK....I can feeeel it!"". Oh, brother. Talking about The Farce being with you. And no I did not just misspell that word. Obi Wan returns in spirit form to rewrite some history so Luke did not just get thrown over for Han Solo because girls just love the bad boys, but there is some reason and purpose behind it. ""So you told me a bunch of lies?"" Luke asks his one time mentor. ""Well that depends upon what your definition of the word ""IS"" is""...being the gist of how Obi Wan answers him.And we have a fairly meaningless chase through a rain forest, and the most commercial purposeless creature ever created in cinematic history up to that date - the Ewok. Be sure to ask for a miniature for your kids when you order a Big Mac and fries.I've been hard on Episode VI in light of how great IV and V were. I'm giving it a seven because compared to other films, that is what it is. Compared to its two predecessors it is probably a six. Compared to what Disney has done to the franchise, though, it is probably an eleven!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows the Jedi and Luke needing to save their ally, Solo, who even after being saved will need to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire. For them to be successful, Luke will likely need to face his father one last time.This movie is directed by Richard Marquand (Jagged Edge) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Blade Runner), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Batman), Ian McDiarmid (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) and James Earl Jones (Conan the Barbarian).The entire Jabba the Hutt opening is always one of my favorite sequences in the series and a great way to start the movie. Harrison Ford was hilarious both in his lines and his body language. He couldn't have been better cast. The escape scene in this is everything you could want and every scene on Endor is magic. The chase through the woods opening and the mystery and unveiling of the Ewoks was super cool. The final two battles involving Luke, Vader and the Emperor is classic science fiction gold and a wonderful depiction of the force and the dark side.Overall this movie doesnt get as much credit for its greatness that it should. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One Of The Best In The Series,"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
...and the trilogy is finished with yet another great film.,"After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular finish to the Star Wars saga.,"After watching A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, it's time to watch the final chapter of the Star Wars film franchise, The Return of the Jedi.It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, etc.The Empire is more than halfway through construction of a new Death Star - almost twice as big, but more than twice as powerful. When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the Rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) soon finds herself in the gangster's hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba's palace, hoping to secure his friends' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader's soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader's boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire's triumph - unless things start to change quickly.I thought it was a great end to the Star Wars series.But in 1999, the story took itself back into the beginning with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and ended with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.So far, I'm finished with the Star Wars original trilogies, and there will be more reviews in the summer.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The least effective of the original trilogy, but packed with charm and excitement","As a child, I owned all of the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS, purchased when 'remastering' was all the rage and the iconic sci-fi saga found itself on the receiving end of a much-needed cleaning-up. This was, however, before George Lucas tampered with his already- near-perfect legacy, adding unneeded special effects and elongating certain scenes for seemingly no other reason to show how far CGI had come (although it now looks incredibly dated). Despite the perfection of episodes four and five, my go-to Star Wars movie on a boring Sunday afternoon was always Return of the Jedi, the third instalment now widely remembered as the poorest of the bunch. I don't quite know what it was about Jedi that always caused me to reach for it. It certainly wasn't the Ewoks, those cuddly fur-balls shoe-horned in to sell more merchandise, although they aren't as annoying or distracting as I remembered.Jedi is most certainly the least effective of Lucas' creation, but there's still plenty of charm and excitement to solidify the entry as, at the very least, a satisfying closure to the saga, despite Disney's welcome efforts to further explore the Star Wars universe. The Empire Strikes Back broke up its characters but managed to keep a firm grasp on the various story-threads. Jedi does the same again, but is less successful at holding all the action together. Nevertheless, the characters get to enjoy an early reunion at Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, where the slug-like abomination hangs Han Solo (Harrison Ford), still frozen in his carbonite prison from the last movie. C- 3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) all arrive at various intervals as part of a rescue operation, as does Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the latter having completed his Jedi training and going about his business with a brooding confidence.A horrific car crash may have robbed Hamill of some of his boyish good-looks, but it did nothing to dampen his skills as an actor. Skywalker's newly-found intensity, which no doubt stems from his flourishing grasp on the Force and skill with a lightsaber, is matched by Hamill's execution. He stops by to see Yoda (Frank Oz), who confirms that Darth Vader is indeed his father and a fallen Jedi, and has a brief chat with the spirit of his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Skywalker's thread is by far the most interesting, inevitably heading towards a showdown with his father and the puppet-master behind the Empire, the rasping Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). Although Vader's brutality has been turned down as he plays lap-dog to his boss, audiences back in 1983 must have been holding their breath as the Emperor tortures Luke in an attempt to turn him to the Dark Side, and Vader is clearly shown to be wrestling with his allegiance.The rest of the action fares less well, as Han Solo and Leia find themselves captured by the community of Ewoks who seem to want to eat them, while C-3PO bares a close resemblance to the God the little critters worship. Their aim is to take down a generator controlling the energy shield of a brand new Death Star - yes, they have somehow managed to nearly complete a bigger, meaner planet- killer in a remarkably short space of time. Lando and the remaining Rebel Alliance are forced to repeat the climax of A New Hope, and while it's certainly a spectacular battle, it can't help but feel like more of the same. Jedi is best remembered as a series of memorable moments than a truly great film. It's easy to forget the film's messy narrative and cynical desire to boost merchandise sales, especially as a child, but it's hard to forget Leia in a gold bikini, Jabba's grotesque rat-like pet, the high-speed chase through the forests of Endor, or the shockingly crap death of fan-favourite Boba Fett. Nowhere near the annoying child-pandering misfire some believe it to be, but also some way off the magnificence of its predecessors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Underrated, and completely satisfying","Some people have disliked this film, and I truly don't see why. ""Return of the Jedi,"" does not, contrary to popular opinion, ruin the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy but rather ties it up in a perfectly satisfying way. The opening scenes at Jabba the Hutt's palace are well done. Jabba is a much meaner and scarier villain here than the short clip in the 1997 re-release of ""A New Hope"" showed him to be. Luke Skywalker is forced to make his most difficult choices in this film, and the intensity of the film's last half-hour is some of the most compelling film-making I've ever seen. The themes and messages of redemption and good vs. evil are superbly done here. ""Return of the Jedi"" is a very exciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times, especially now that Episode III has been made.

Remembering,"I first became a Star Wars fan with the help of my father who would sit with me and watch the entire trilogy together. I always loved A New Hope [which I always called Star Wars up until the re-release because we had the original VHS set], had a semi-dislike of The Empire Strikes Back [but, I have grown to like it now], and absolutely loved The Return of the Jedi. My favorite scene was always the ending scene of Luke looking at the three Jedi Masters of his life.And now I after watching the DVD edition, I miss Sebastian Shaw, the original Anakin Skywalker. Now, I am forced to watch Hayden Christensen take his spot. Yes, he is who portrays Anakin before and during his fall to the dark side in the beginning trilogy, but I feel that Mr.Lucas should have left Mr.Shaw at the end of Return of the Jedi. It is almost like forgetting that Darth Vader turned away from the dark side and became part of the light in the end.Unfortionatly, my family no longer has our original VHS of RotJ due to over watching.

A fine ending - especially after having seen Episode III,"When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padmé and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired from Raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very, very good.In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always Lucas' forté so that is really to be expected. The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax.The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Last Jedi,"Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO and R2-D2 go to Taooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the powerful criminal Jabba the Hutt. After many fights, they are well succeeded in their mission. The group returns to the Rebel Alliance base while Luke heads to Dagobah to finish his training with Yoda; however the Jedi is dying and he confirms that Darth Vader (David Prowse) is his father and Luke also learns that he has a sister, Leia. Meanwhile the rebels discover that the Empire is building a new Death Star more powerful than the first one that is protected by an energy shield generated by a generator in planet Endor. Luke and his group goes to the forest in the planet to destroy the generator while Lando and the rebels wait for the right moment to attack the station. The group in Endor teams-up with the inhabitants, Ewoks, to fight against the Imperial troops but they are captured in a trap; Luke is brought to Darth Vader but he refuses to fight against his father. When he meets the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid), he tries to bring Luke to the dark side of the Force. What will happen to Luke and the rebels?""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is the last episode of the fantastic saga. In 1983, this film was a sensation and now, in 2015, it has not lost the impact. On the contrary, now watching the episodes in sequence the viewer can see that George Lucas had the whole story in details in his mind. And now let's see the next episode. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Retorno de Jedi"" (""The Return of the Jedi"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An excellent way to end the saga. It's full of adventure and it puts closure on the dark side.,"""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983 was a great way to end the ""Star Wars"" saga the film was a blast as the Rebels and Jedi Knight(Luke) finally won the civil war against Lord Vader and the evil empire. From the start this film begins with action and drama as Skywalker returns to his old stomping grounds his home of Tatooine, but a special mission in plans that's the rescue of Han Solo from the slimy Jabba the Hutt. Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang are along side Luke for the journey that after the defeat of Jabba they land on the forest moon of Endor, it's here that Lucas introduced us to furry little creatures we loved that's the Ewoks! The Ewoks join up with the rebels to fight the empire, though Luke must handle his own business against Vader and the evil that is tempted upon him. The showdown between Luke and Vader is classic as it's over before the death of evil a final sad good bye is said, and Luke gets to see his father without the mask. The torch has finally been passed and the rebels are free and Luke the Jedi Knight rules superior. Really again a super film from Lucas with drama, and action and excitement from start to finish he picked a good way to end the saga. We will always remember George's creations, his characters, plots, and the musical scores of John Williams will never leave your mind, and final thanks to Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill who all were magnificent in all three legendary classics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie of the Star Wars Trilogy.,"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealedI would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy)  Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add,  it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at  (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that ""Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see."" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as ""just another sequel"") to trash the movie such as ""This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!"" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mediocre,"First of all i would like to add that i am a big star wars fan.Star wars have been a big part of my childhood and i have had great experiences watching the movies and imagining myself in the star wars universe.I have seen all movies several times and i like them all. But when i compare some of the essential parts that make a trilogy, and what later became six films, it just doesn't add up. This movie is just a disgrace to any sci fi movie. Its infantile structure and ridiculous twists are just too much. The word Ewok should say enough....How in the world could a great empire like the empire build by Darth Sidious and of course Lord Vader be destroyed by a few weird looking small bears. I mean, a new hope wasn't that great, but this just takes the cake. Flying into the most advanced weapon of the galaxy and destroying it without almost any casualties is so extremely unbelievable, but a few midget bears killing storm troopers wearing blaster armour that can withstand the most advanced blaster shots is just too ridiculous to watch, i cringed several times because of this.I have watched this movie several times, i think around 12 times. Every time i get so disturbed by these extreme uncredible appearances that i totally disgust this movie.Nevertheless i still rate it a 6. That is only because i have read all the expended universe books and i respect this movie and its predecessors to be the founding fathers of this great franchise and all the fruits it has produced.Mediocre film, do not watch unless bored.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The end of the Star Wars saga?,"The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years, until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review, Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure (although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects), and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005, the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977.The Return of the Jedi is the film in which we are introduced to the hideous Jabba the Hutt for the first time, as well as a score of other repugnant creatures. When I first watched this film, the first thing that struck me was an enormous increase in the level of gruesomeness that is seen in the creatures in the film. In the first film, even the antagonist creatures were at least mildly pleasant, but now we see Jabba, we see Jabba's disgusting sidekick with the snake things growing out of his head and around his neck, that tooth-riddled pit in the ground, as well as scores of other sickening things. We also get to the first glimpses of the badly damaged Death Star, whose post-explosive appearance is probably even more famous as an image in film history than its original appearance.The Death Star is the focus of much of the conflict in the film. The Rebellion is making an elaborate attempt to destroy the Death Star, a nearly impossible excursion that involves timing an attack perfectly so that star-fighters can make an internal attack on the Death Star at just the right moment that their rebel partners are on a nearby planet, shutting down the defense mechanism that the Death Star is deriving from it. Clearly, this is not going to be an easy thing to do, and the majority of the film presents the efforts to get all of the forces coordinated to pull this task off, with the ultimate climax occurring as the rebel attack coincides with the revelation that the Death Star is fully functional as a weapon despite massive damage (a little secret they have tactfully decided not to reveal), and that they are already aware of the impending attack and more than capable of squishing all of the attackers like a lot of space-bugs.Great story, I think. And it's a good thing, too, because there were at least a few other things that I was less than impressed with about this particular installment in the Star Wars saga. The Ewoks, for example, just didn't strike me as something that belonged in a Star Wars film. I am more than willing to accept them, if for no other reason than the fact that they are now one of the more recognizable things from the old Star Wars films (although it seems like there are thousands of recognizable things from the old Star Wars films), but there were several battle scenes that failed to generate much excitement due to all of the cuddly little snuggle bears running around. Besides that, the Ewok costumes were some of the least impressive outfits in any Star Wars film to this day. You could almost see the seams along the sides, the faces were about as realistic as any stuffed animal, and the pads of the feet, which occasionally were in view, were just as toy-like. They were little more than cheap Halloween costumes.On the other hand, the rest of the film is so entertaining that I am willing to forgive things like this. It's 1983, for crying out loud, so I'm not about to downgrade the movie for something like that, even though both of its predecessors had universally better costumes despite being older films. It's clear throughout the film that we are watching the conclusion of the conflict between the Imperial Forces and the Rebellion that we saw develop in the last two films, which is why it does not quite reach the same level of stupendous excitement and entertainment of them. There are a lot of fascinating characters and creatures introduced here, and some of the battles scenes in space far surpass anything in Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but despite the fascinating story, there is just too much an element of conclusion and tying up loose ends for this movie to be as fresh and exhilarating.There is great concern in the last act of the movie with the metaphorical presentation of the dark side and the, well, the light side, I guess. Maybe the bright side? Yeah, the bright side, that sounds better. The dark side and the bright side. Luke is being held captive by Darth Vader and the Emperor and being forced to watch his friends careen helplessly into a battle, unaware that they have no chance of winning. As this happens, we are just itching to see Luke go for that light saber and strike someone down with it and do something heroic, but then the Emperor starts trying to convince him to do this. He encourages Luke to give in to his anger and officially become part of the dark side. It's easy to see how Vader was seduced by the dark side, if all it takes is the killing of someone that you bitterly hate because they are forcing you to watch the deaths of your friends. Throughout the entire Star Wars saga, one of the things that I always wondered about was how exactly Vader was seduced by the dark side, and in this scene I found myself seduced by it because I so badly wanted to see Luke do exactly what the Emperor was asking him to do.Clearly, the story of The Return of the Jedi leaves very little to be desired, with the exciting battles that come from the struggle between the Rebels and the Empire, and with Luke's struggles against the dark side as well as his interaction with Vader as Vader lay dying in his arms (another heavily metaphorical representation of the dark and bright sides). And despite a few elements of the film that prevent it from really rising to the level of quality and pure entertainment that it could have risen to, this is a powerful installment in the Star Wars saga. Given the relatively cheesy end that we saw in this film, with all of our heroes partying and hugging at an Ewok party in the woods (and with Luke giving the stereotypical grin to the ghostly images of Obi Wan and Yoda and the image of his father before he became Darth Vader (?)), I am curious about the future of the Star Wars saga. I've heard rumors about the production of Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, which seem a little far-fetched at this point, but it also seems almost as far-fetched that old George would end one of the greatest film sagas of all time with the closing scene of The Return of the Jedi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gets worse with age,"Rented the DVD to see if I still found this movie to be as disjunct and trite as I thought it was in '83- it's worse than I remember.

Little did we know that we'd be begging for the Ewoks after meeting Jar Jar Binks in Episode 1 and 2.

HOWEVER... don't believe all those Ewoks haters ! They aren't that bad at all. In fact, they're way better than Gungans and Porgs combined...✴ fantastic conclusion !✴ THE BEST SPACE BATTLE E V E R !✴ the last 40 - 50 minutes is the best of the Saga. DEFINITELY 👍👍👍✴ I don't know how in heaven is that possible that JW didn't get another Oscar for AMAZING score (Oscars 1984)✴ it feels like ANH and TESB combined, witch is true from action / budget / special effects points of view !✴ this is not just a movie... It's a STAR WARS movie, and the amount of heart and soul here is simply astonishing. This is very very rare type of film that you ""receive"" more by heart and soul than with mind, which is simply WONDERFUL !✴ after all this years still looks GREAT (2011 Blu-Ray release) along with Ep IV and Ep V of course ;-) but this one is the richest both audio-visually and emotionally...✴ amazing movie made in 1983, with budget around 33 mln $, PUTS IN Big BIG SHAME today blockbusters with oversized budgets of 250 - 300 mln $ and VFX of X-Box One / PS4 quality ! Hollywood should be ashamed of itself 👎😑✴ almost perfect mix of action, adventure and plot !✴ that unique 80s feeling with some added scenes / digital enhancements from Special Editions, which put fresh air and makes entire OT timeless classics !✴ great climax and superb atmosphere !✴ very memorable characters, scenes, dialogues and ACTION sequences !✴ from the time perspective, the Saga should have ended HERE, without flawed as hell prequel trilogy and / or very disappointing sequel / disney trilogy 👎😑✴ the movie is - at times - 80s fantasy fable, at times is as dark as TESB (or even darker), interesting dialogue-driven exposition (essential !), chaotic yet unique ground battle, Luke vs Vader in front of Emperor himself and hi-tech confrontation in the skies... I LOVE THAT MIX - and it works very very fine with each one m and every single view(ing) !✴ I wrote it earlier, but it must be written again (from different point of view ;-)) : positive energy, mysticism and spirituality here are the very best and the STRONGEST in entire SW Saga !✴ RotJ takes all the best ""ingredients"" from two previous movies, mixes it and adds some brand new quality - and that's one of main reasons why is simply the best 👍👍👍That's all for today.

The Best of the Series,"As tends to be the case with a lot of movies for me, I disagree about the majority opinion of ""Return of the Jedi"". This movie tends to be looked down on as the worst of the original trilogy of Star Wars films. I find it to be just the opposite. This is my favorite movie of the franchise. IMDb ranks ""The Empire Strikes Back"" above ""A New Hope"", with ""Jedi"" coming in a distant third. I'd go in reverse order, arguing ""Jedi"" and ""Hope"" are better than ""Empire"", which to me just feels like an interlude between the two main films in the series.That little bit of polemics aside, what I love about this film is that unlike ""A New Hope"", ""Jedi"" has a lot going on--the story is comparatively complex and fast paced. To me it stands out as the funnest of the three films, and also the best storyline.But the real thing to love about this movie is the climax--Luke's confrontation with both Darth Vader and the Emperor. That showdown brings the entire six movies into harmony--and dare I say, the Force finally finds the balance that the prophecy foretold of (just through Luke rather than through Anakin--although perhaps Anakin did bring the balance...you could have quite the nerdy discussion about that).I also like the spaceship battle scene in this movie. It's arguably the best of the original trilogy. And the Ewoks! I know they get criticized, but I think they're cool.All that said, my scores for the first five Star Wars movies (having watched them all now, in preparation for ""The Force Awakens) are: 7, 8, 9, 10, and 7. And, finally, for ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"", I give a perfect 10. It and ""A New Hope"" are the best. I like them all (although, honestly, seeing those scores, I think I'd even put ""Phantom Menace"" above ""Empire""), but ""Return of the Jedi"" takes the cake. Bravo, Mr. Lucas.

The Weakest of the Originals,"""Return of the Jedi"" is the weakest of the original trilogy. Though the visuals are fantastic, the light saber fighting is improved and the characters are still top notch, the film feels a bit jumbled. The pacing is off with the Jabba scene lasting too long and the forest moon of Endor scenes lacking real substance. I found myself bored in this movie more than the two predecessors.All problems aside, the character growth by the trio, with Luke in particular, is masterclass. Watching him grow from a whiney boy on Tatooine to a full blown Jedi Knight is remarkable. His force sensitivity is intriguing to observe, though I would have liked to explore Leia's relationship with the force a bit more.The finale is strong, unfortunately everything leading up to the third act climax is a little weak.Additional Note: I love the scene with Leia and Han on the bridge. It truly shows Han's growth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Is this the same movie I saw in the theatres?? What's up with all the cutesiness? And the myriad issues extend far beyond the infamous and very problematic Ewoks. The whole thing is just cheeseball bad. It's very poorly put together - poorly edited throughout, Boba Fett's demise is cartoonishly out of place, did I mention Han Solo is a complete waste of space?

Muppets in space!  A good film but weak by comparison with the two before,"Han Solo has been captured by Jabba the Hutt, but C3P0 and R2D2 come to rescue him with some other help too.  Once free from Jabba, Han joins with the Rebels to prepare to launch an attack on an all new Death Star being produced.  Luke goes for further Jedi training with Yoda but is later captured by Vader himself. Battles rage in space but also on the moon of Endor as the Rebels try to prevent the Empire taking over the Galaxy.This should have been the best of the series  the Jedi striking back after getting a kicking in part 5.  Indeed the battles and plotting suggests that it could have been.  Certainly the final confrontation between Luke and Vader could have been even better than the end of part 5, however it just doesn't feel as good as it could have been.The focus is very much on Luke and how he has changed since his discovery of this father.  Now he is dressed all in black and seems more ruthless than before.  This is explored reasonably well but it isn't as dark as it should have been  I never really believed that Luke could go to the Dark Side. The rest of the story is spoilt by one thing  Muppets.  This was supposed to be the big climax of the `three' films, we get that but we also have lots of puppets.  The Ewoks are OK as characters but the whole film has far too many puppets in it to be good.  Coming off the back of a much darker empire, Jedi is like walking out of a dark place into the light  it's just too bright and cheerful.  It should have had layers.Hamill is good as Luke but I wanted more depth  that said was good here but not as good as in Empire.  If you watch his three films together then you see him change which makes you appreciate him more.  Ford has little to do  it's like we've seen his space cowboy act before.  Fisher is the same but has more to do.  Ian McDiarmid is good  but again I appreciate his character even more now that I've seen parts one and two.  Yoda is cool but after Empire his screen time seems cut down (mind you part 2 made up for that).  Darth Vader is interesting  it's a bit sad but how many other characters have been played by three people (at the same time  not at different ages).  Vader's body is Prowse, his voice is Jones and his face is Shaw.Overall this is good  simply because it's a Star Wars movie and has plenty of action and thrills.  The muppets and brighter mood stop it being as good as the two before but at least now the Phantom Menace has shown us what a bad Star Wars film is like, now we know that Jedi isn't the weak link in the series.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"At this point, it was starting to get gimmicky.","""Star Wars"" was without a doubt a masterpiece, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was still good but one has to wonder why they continued the story, and ""Return of the Jedi"" was sort of gimmicky. Granted, it's good that they wanted to show how everything would turn out, but it almost seemed more like a video game. The Ewoks were funny, but not much else. And why did they dress Carrie Fisher like they did early in the movie? Oh well. Life goes on. Now that we've had episodes 1-3, we see where this all originated. Or to put it in Yoda talk: where this all originated we seen have. Worth seeing, but don't interpret it as a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

a lousy conclusion,"Every time I tell people how horrible I thought Return of the Jedi was they give me this puzzled look and say, ""but it's Return of the Jedi! You can't hate Return of the Jedi!"" However, this movie really bothers me every time I see it. The creativity of the first Star Wars made it a great movie, and the shocking twist in Empire made it quite possibly the greatest sequel ever. Yet this incredible scenario presented at the end of Empire was wasted in a movie full of rehash. First of all, could Lucas really come up with nothing better than a SECOND Death Star??! And just like the first one, the movie ended in an all out assault on it. Luke and Vader fought with light sabers (again!). Not to mention, in a desperate attempt to recapture the emotion created in the audience after Vader said his famous ""I AM YOUR FATHER"", Lucas made Leia turn out to be Luke's long-lost sister. Give me a break! A little competition between Han and Luke might show some semblance of conflict among the good guys. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean it can't be somewhat realistic in character presentation. Vader's unmasking was disappointing. Instead of Lon Chaney unmasked as the phantom, we got Uncle Fester with acne. Carrie Fischer can't act worth $#\&*! Although I could go on and on, I'll give just one final reason. Three words: Ewoks! Ewoks! Ewoks! I hate those furry little muppet wannabes. They were added for one reason and one reason only, so Lucas could line his pockets by making Ewok stuffed animals, talking Ewok toys, Ewok lunchboxes, and even an Ewok TV show! The bottom line is, this is the most OVERRATED movie in the history of Hollywood!!!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

the perfect resolution to the perfect trilogy.,"never has a sequel much less the third installment of a trilogy ever captured the hearts and minds of the people of an age as well as the ""definitive vision"" of george lucas' star wars: return of the jedi. some so-called ""fans"" of star wars dare to call this the least effective of the trilogy; they argue that everything was too simply resolved. to these overstressed cynics and self-proclaimed critics i ask simply: have you ever actually sat down with a bucket of popcorn in your lap and a pepsi in your hand and just enjoyed the greatest science fiction movie, if not the greatest movie of all times. the final resolution between luke and his estranged father could not have been portrayed any better than it was. luke ""found"" the good in anakin long after all else had given up on him. also, the scene in which luke severed vader's hand and looked at his own robotic hand caused him to recall the lesson he had learned in the dagoba system in ""the empire strikes back""; he had learned in the cave as he faced the imaginary vader that if he struck out of fear and hate vader's fate would become his own. the unmasking of darth was the perfect solution. lucas took the ominous and evil vader and, by removing his helmet, exposed a vulnerable and kind man.Finally, in response to certain dogmatists' complaints that all conflicts are settled to perfectly, this is only because of george lucas' incredibly ingenious plot and plot line that without effort or omission of theme finalized itself in a most incredible manner. One must also remember that this movie and movies like it are, in literary terms, considered ""escape fiction,"" which, unlike ""thematic fiction,"" centers itself around plot. in escape fiction the watcher, reader, or listener expects to ""get away"" into another time, place, or even universe, and when the spectator puts himself in the position of the hero he doesn't like it to end in a negative way.in summary, if you don't like happy endings go read hemingway; however, if you enjoy action-filled, thought-provoking, suspense-building, adrenaline-pumping sagas with visual effects and plot-lines that paved the way for science fiction as we know it. go out right now and rent or buy the greatest movie of all time: Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

HOW TO MAKE AN EPIC CONCLUSION,"I know this movie is considered the weakest of the original trilogy, but to me it's always been my favorite ever since I was a little kid. The entire rescue sequence is so creative, so well thought out. The ending is amazing. I love the ewoks, who might look weak and little, but in a group together with the rebels are brave and strong, that's a message that Star Wars always has. Luke being tempted to hate but strong enough to resist is such a cool thing to see. The entire battle between Darth Vader and Luke is classic. And then their last emotional moment is just...wow. The original trilogy contains only masterpieces and joy. When I think about it, I transform into the kid who watched star wars for the first time, not knowing what it is, and then getting a feeling of true passion. And George has passion. We even see it in the prequels. And since Disney runs the show, things have not been quite the same. The magic dissapears. Vader, Luke,etc are milked dry until the spark is gone. They're not special anymore. That's what Disney misses. Force Awakens had it, but it hasn't been quite consistent. GIVE US STAR WARS BACK DISNEY!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Fine Conclusion,"I personally enjoy this one the most of the original trilogy. My wife, who is watching these for the first time, is finding them quite underwhelming. To be fair, as she pointed out, the original movies provide very little context for what is actually taking place in the Star Wars universe at this time, which makes it more challenging to follow without fully exploring all the additional media.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Has anyone else noticed a certain trend ...,"`Star Wars' ended with Luke Skywalker's assault on the Death Star.  We followed Luke and Luke alone.  `The Empire Strikes Back' split the action at the end into two streams: we saw Leia and Han fighting for their freedom, and Luke Skywalker confronting Vader.  `Return of the Jedi' split things three ways: Endor, Death Star, rebel fleet.  And what do you know, `The Phantom Menace' divides the final action into FOUR streams.  If this trend continues things will start to get silly.  They already have.It's tempting to view `Return of the Jedi' as a sour omen of things to come. Lucas hired Richard `""whatever you say, George""' Marquand to direct his third Star Wars movie, which accounts for the general sluggishness.  He threw in pointlessly cuddly Ewoks.  Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher abandon the more adult romance of the previous film in order to play unconvincing second fiddles to all these furry things.  While John Williams's score retains its power, his source music is pretty weak.  Compared to the first two movies the dialogue is bland.  (It would get much blander come 1999.)  The story is an unimaginative re-hash of earlier work, except for Lucas's idea that bigger is better.  If the rebels have to do THREE things at once to travel INSIDE the EVEN BIGGER, DEADLIER Death Star with MORE SHIPS THAN EVER BEFORE in order to achieve an EVEN GREATER victory, it will surely make things more exciting - right?  Whatever you say, George.Special effects are particularly disappointing.  They're actually weaker than in the first two movies, with unbelievable - and I mean, literally unbelievable - muppets strewn all over the landscape.  (The blue vinyl elephant thing in Jabba's court gets my vote for most ridiculous alien.) Oddly enough the digital adjustments of 1997 only made matters worse.  The computer-generated pop singer Lucas created looks every bit as fake as that stupid animal with the big lips it replaced - it merely looks fake in a different way; and, furthermore, the presence of the computer creatures makes the puppets look more fake than they would otherwise look, and vice versa.  Perhaps it doesn't matter very much.  The special effects, creature effects, costumes AND art direction, had all deteriorated, with or without digital vandalism.Yet despite all this the release of `The Phantom Menace' makes `Return of the Jedi' look better than ever.  The chief difference between the two is that the latter, unlike the former, has a reason for being made in the first place.  The story begun in the first two movies needed a conclusion.  It DIDN'T need a prologue.  If the conclusion stumbles a bit, well, we must take the rough with the smooth: obviously the story had to end SOME way.  In any event, `Return of the Jedi' isn't a bad movie.  It coasts on the energy of the early movies, but it gets where it's going.  If you've just watched the earlier films this one still brings a lump to the throat.  Yes, it could have been much better.  Be thankful it wasn't worse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant. It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Revenge of the Teddy Bears,"How can any adult who enjoyed ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" possibly find anything entertaining, or even interesting, about this abysmal, unimaginative travesty?  A genuinely bad movie, truly awful in every possible way, ""Jedi"" features a screenplay aimed squarely at four year olds and absolutely terrible acting from an understandably embarrassed cast; in addition, the film offers us the shoddiest array of cheap, plastic-looking space aliens since Irwin Allen's ""Lost In Space"" tv series. Yes, I realize it is this very cheapness that endears the movie to a legion of kitsch loving fans, but, as a direct follow-up to ""Empire,"" one of the most entertaining and inventive fantasy movies of the last twenty years, ""Jedi"" comes across as a particularly insulting spit in the face from George Lucas.

Very good but inferior to the others,"The third parts of trilogies tend to be inferior to their predecessors. This applies to ""Alien,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Austin Powers,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Mad Max"" and other film series. Then there are the few that come along -- such as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" -- that are actually the best of all three.Unfortunately ""Star Wars: Episode VI - The Return of the Jedi"" fits into the former category -- it is far inferior to its predecessors. I've always enjoyed ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the most of all three, and ""Return of the Jedi"" the least. It is arguably one of the earliest signs of things to come for writer George Lucas, who employs a band of child-friendly (and marketable) ""Eewoks"" to join Luke Skywalker on his quest against the Empire in this installment. After ""Return of the Jedi,"" Lucas never really got back on track, and particularly with the recent ""Star Wars"" prequels it is apparent he has sold out and lost grasp of how to make a good film. The Eewoks aren't very far off from Jar-Jar Binks.That's not to say ""Return of the Jedi"" is a bad film -- in fact it's very good. But we all remember, ""May the force be with you"" from ""Star Wars,"" and ""I am your father!"" from ""The Empire Strikes Back."" There's nothing particularly memorable here -- it is not one of the greatest films ever made, just a very satisfying (if occasionally goofy) conclusion to the trilogy. It is not as bad as ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" for sure.Han Solo (Harrison Ford), now cryogenically frozen by Jabba the Hutt, is being held captive. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) both try to rescue Han, to no avail, and Luke -- now a Jedi -- ends up being thrown into the pit of a dangerous beast, which he defeats to the surprise of Jabba. Jabba then decides to have all of them murdered, but Luke and co. make a daring escape with the help of all his pals -- C-3PO, R2-D2, Leia and Chewbacca -- and eventually end up on a faraway planet where they arrive under the car of the friendly Eewoks, who help them with their attack against The Empire's new and improved Death Star. Luke uncovers a startling secret about Leia, revisits the dying Yoda, and eventually comes face-to-face with Vader, where he is faced with a bit of a moral dilemma after the Emperor decides that Luke would be a worthy addition to their army.It's pointless divulging into the plot in-depth basically because everyone has already seen these movies. What can be discussed are the special effects, performances, and general plot of the film, as that is what most people will take from this film -- those looking for meaningful dialogue should look elsewhere. Released in 1983, six years after the original, special effects had evolved even more -- with a larger budget to expand upon director Richard Marquand tops off both prior films in terms of SF/X. There's an exciting chase sequence, lots of hyper-speed battles, space ship exteriors and ""lightsaber"" fights -- enough to wet the appetite of anyone looking for mere action.Unfortunately what ""Return of the Jedi"" lacks is originality -- ""Star Wars"" was unique when it came out, recycling old storytelling clichés in a modern update; the sequel was very dark and impressive with arguably the best performances of all three films; the only thing to look for here is Luke's sudden evolution from Jedi trainee to Jedi master. Oh, and the final showdown, which is still impressive, even by today's efforts.All in all, ""Return of the Jedi"" is not on the same level as its predecessors but it is an exciting movie that manages to satisfyingly end the series on a high note. About those prequels...well, they're just unfortunate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Annoying adjustments made to this one,"I think most consider this to be the weakest movie of the original trilogy, and it is, though it's not bad either. It has lost a star for additions to it post prequel trilogy, one of the worst of which turns that disgusting Sarlacc creature (sand beast that devours people dropped into it) into Audrey from the Little Shop of Horrors, and some other additions. I forgot about that particular addition, and it made me rage again upon seeing it when recently watching the movie on Disney+. It's original version was far more impressive, as a giant thorny hole in the sand, and much more menacing as a result. In addition I didn't much care for adjustments to the entertainment in Jaba the Hut's base, those moments seeming to be particularly disjointed. With respects to original elements, the Ewoks, while cute, do seem to be something of a mistake, in that they occupy too much movie time, with no meaningful amount of Ewok character development - there was indeed a regular one that popped up more often than the others, but they didn't go to any lengths to make that really resonate. Endor also seemed a location that had little meaning, in so far as that new death star's development was concerned - I suppose it would have been a tactically discrete location for construction, and testing maybe, but it didn't make all that much sense either, in terms of ramping up the stakes! Had it had its sights set on Tattooine, for example, the stakes may have elevated a good deal more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

11/10: breathtaking magical experience,"first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.How, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Last Of The Force, I Doubt It","About the only criticism I can make of Return Of The Jedi is that the film could easily have been two films. The story of Han Solo's rescue from Jabba The Hut and then the final confrontation with the Empire should have been two films. That would have been double the pleasure for fans of the series. As it stands now the folks there in that galaxy far away are in a happy ever after ending of their saga.The same old familiar faces from Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are with us again. Harrison Ford was betrayed by Billy Dee Williams to the Empire who turned him over to Jabba, but the others affect an escape helped by the selfsame Billy Dee who did not like being reduced to a hireling in what was his former planet.Mark Hamill as the budding Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker learns the true nature of his existence and of the temptation to go over to the dark side of the Force. The path of light might be rougher, but it does not carry the same burdens. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia finally chooses between Hamill and Harrison, although the script kind of makes the choice for her.George Lucas when he made additional films opted for the prequel showing how the situation came to be in the galaxy far away. He could still do a sequel, but unless he does this is it for the beloved characters of Star Wars.Return Of The Jedi got several Oscar nominations in technical categories all richly deserved.Something tells me we haven't seen the last of these people and the other creatures of their galaxy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Fun, cute, imaginative, iconic space adventure with a kick-axx cast","""Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi"" (1983) was the anticipated end of the original trilogy that began with the initial blockbuster from 1977. The trilogy is an epic, but simplistic space fantasy about an evil empire and the noble souls who dare to fight it. The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Ian McDiarmid (Emperor) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader) and Frank Oz (Yoda).This is an amusing, inventive, iconic space adventure with a stellar cast that upped the ante with edgy cuteness. While I prefer the adult-oriented space science-fiction of Star Trek, I can't deny that the space fantasy of Star Wars always grants you an entertaining couple hours.This one features lots of sci-fi action, cartoonish characters, great sets, Carrie Fisher at her fittest in an alluring costume, space ships, alien bogs and awesome forest sets (shot in the Redwoods of Northern Cal).

"More action and adventure, and a few surprises.","Here we go for yet another fantastical adventure in a galaxy far far away. I enjoyed this adventure more than 'The Empire Strikes Back'.Han Solo is still frozen in carbonite, and Luke Skywalker returns to his home planet to try and save him. He sends C-3PO and R2-D2 to bargain with Jabba, whom Han Solo owes money to and who captured him. The rescue mission doesn't quite go according to plan, but it certainly allowed for a great action sequence!In the beginning of the film I found there to be way too many weird and strange characters simply for the sake of being weird and strange. It was as if the creators wanted to show off their creative and make-up skills and for the first time I was almost tempted to hit the forward button, as these scenes were unnecessary and took up too much time.Fortunately, the film vastly improved and once again became an action-filled adventure with good practical and visual effects, with some impressive action sequences. The Galactic Empire is building another Death Star, which will be even more powerful than the previous one. Meantime, Darth Vader is still seeking Luke, hoping to turn him to the Dark Side.We off course now know Darth Vader used to be Anakin Skywalker - Luke's dad. Now he's more machine than man, and twisted and evil. There's also interesting reveals about Princess Leia. 'Return of the Jedi' is a bit deeper than it's predecessors, and at one point I almost felt sorry for Darth Vader.Luke, Han Solo, Leia and their freedom fighters are also on a mission to destroy the Death Star, resulting in plenty of gunfire, explosions, and chaos in the galaxy. At times the film looked like a cool video game. I must be honest, I didn't find the visuals as good as the first film, but they were nevertheless still excellent considering this to be a film that was made more than four decades ago!If you're into fantasy adventures, 'Return of the Jedi' is sure to tick all the boxes when it comes to being entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best of the Original Trilogy!,"People really need to stop being so harsh about this film. This film is very good and I liked it better than the first two in the trilogy. I liked the Ewoks and critics should stop finding faults with them. The opening scenes featuring Jabba the Hutt were slow but the the movie quickened it's pace by the end.In Return of the Jedi, it comes down to the final battle between the Empire and the rebellion. First, the rebels have to rescue Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba.I thought the acting is pretty good. It was nice to see Ian McDiarmid as the emperor introduced. The other actors were good as they were in the first two.There is more action here. There were some intense battle moments. Also, John Williams produced another rousing score.Overall, this is the perfect finale to the live-action Star Wars films. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
what a way to end a great trilogy!,"This was an absolute great ending to any movie. Many people put it down for not being so great but lets think about this, it had the final battle between Skywalker and Vader, the rebels destroyed the death star,and we visited new places such as Jabas palace and the moon endor and they included many new characters like Jaba, the ewoks, and Emperor Palpatine. Now what more could you ask for in a movie. It was a great and sometime underrated ending to a great trilogy. Not to mention it made more money then Empire Strikes Back. Lets just say its well worth watching over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Star Wars Movie.,"This is in my top 3 favorite movies, and i think it is the best star wars movie that George made.The movie is like the movies in one, it has a beginning then a middle part and a end part that comes together in one movie.I love how this movie is the first star wars to use a lot of lightsaber, and have the great scenes on the planets and a lot less space.George Lucas out did himself with return of the Jedi, and this movie even has my favorite lightsaber fight out of the entire series.This movie has been my favorite star wars since i was a kid, and i always think people underrate it as not being as good as the empire strikes back.This is the best scifi movie i have ever seen, and one of the best movies i have ever seen period, with all of the great things this movie is i say watch it.Star Wars is my favorite movies, and i think this one is the star wars to really watch and may the force be with you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force will be with you....Always!,"I grew up on the original Star Wars saga, and I still love it to this day. Has everything, a little boy could want: shootouts, sword fights, amazing creatures, beautiful women, cool vehicles, and magic. But what good is all that if you don't have a good story? Thankfully this saga successfully integrated that in so the eye candy doesn't overpower it all. This last installment has got a bit of a bad wrap due to its over-emphasis on action, and less on emotional pathos, but I disagree since it all wraps everything from the previous two up perfectly. Some have frowned upon the Ewoks, but I love them. They're cuddly and they prove very resourceful against the Imperial Empire (they're the Birnham Wood that came to Duinsane Hill). I actually adore Leia in the Gold Metal Bikini, very gorgeous eyeful!! My favorite part however, is Luke's last battle. Returning the favor with a hand slice finish, he prove's what a real Jedi is. My favorite quote is ""You failed your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me!"" The way Mark Hamill handles Yoda's death is touching, he's come a long way.

Am I the only one who thinks this double trilogy to be a tad overrated?,"Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy them. I wasn't born when the first two were released, and I was a baby when ""Return of the Jedi"" came out. Throughout my teens I was never in any rush to go see any of them either (I do remember seeing Return of the Jedi when I was about 7 or 8). Then, when they decided to make the rest of the movies, everyone was drooling and losing their minds over it. I just never felt the urge to go see any. So, anyway, a few weekends ago, I borrowed all six from my friend and watched them over a period of a week, or so. Now that I'm finished, I must say that I am a little bit disappointed. Maybe I missed the boat (or train, or bus, or wagon or whatever means of transport that Star Wars buffs take), but I just wasn't as engrossed in the characters as I hoped I would.I do realize that this movie has a cult following, and I will no doubt be bashed by a lot of the ""weaker minds"" here at IMDb; but, my original point still stands: I think the Star Wars series is good, but a bit overrated.I loved the last (or first) three movies that were put out. No, not because of superior special effects, but, I think the story was easier to digest and the acting was far superior (some scenes in the earlier movies were actually quite comical in their clumsiness). I think maybe the characters in the early movies threw me off the series (Luke's character wasn't really lovable as the hero).Overall, the idea of two trilogies was genius and both sets of movies could stand on their own. The overarching story-line is quite good as well but maybe a single trilogy could have sufficed. What thinks you?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing Finale,"This movie wastes what was a great villain in Boba Fett,and Harrison Ford's Han Solo character is hardly used.In 'The Empire Strikes back',Han Solo was a captain and yet now he is suddenly a General(?)as is Billy Dee Williams character who wasn't even in the army.This is bad writing and makes the film look amateurish.Luke Skywalker's main strategy is to get captured and then fight his way out(pretty silly writing).And the teddy bears,with their spears and stones,defeat the villain's army which is armed with heavy weapons.This is a very disappointing finale,not well written and the characters are wasted.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great conclusion, to the best trilogy","This movie holds a place close to my heart. I love the story, the character evolution, the villains and the action. Sure, this movie is repetitive in some scenes and maybe a tiny bit boring at times, but overall the movie still manages it very nicely. Luke learned so much in this movie, which was definitely noticeable. Darth Vader is more of a character in this movie. He is humanized and therefore, we get to relate to him a little. The ending was perfect. Too bad they had to do Episodes 7-9. Overall, this is a great conclusion and a very nice comfort-film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
the weakest i the origonal trilogy,Return of the jedi is easily objectively the weakest i the trilogy it just doesn't reach the same height as the other movies it suffers from major plot holes and a few pacing issues.

The best of the first Star Wars trilogy to run in theaters,"Jedi was a great mix of romance (not as sappy as Empire), adventure, suspense, action, and, best of all, humor (what would a Lucasfilm feature be without it?).This film has been highly under-rated, in my humble opinion.  It manages to resolve problems without getting too sappy and without giving fans the impression that the Alliance is completely out of the woods.  (Pun intended, for those of you who have seen it.)  Why else would this movie have generated as many sequel books as it did?  Some issues were left unresolved, and some were left to mystery.  The books deal with some of those issues.I, for one, am very disappointed that the third trilogy may never appear on the silver screen.  I want to see what happens next in Lucas's eyes, not in the eyes of the novels' authors.Postscript:  I don't care how many people hated the Ewoks!  They served exactly the purpose Lucas wanted them to--to be the bunny by the side of the road that saves the big bad monster from certain death.  Sometimes fairy tales just have to work backward, and usually those are the ones that are most interesting!  Those out there who are anti-Ewok just because the creatures look like animated teddy bears need to get a life.  Cuteness is a really dumb reason to hate something.  Nastiness--now, that's a different story.Again, all in my humble opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."" ""You're going to die here, you know. Convenient.""","Quite an amazing ending to the original trilogy. Little did I know when I was 9 years old watching this that this was not the ending to STAR WARS, but rather a door was open to create another 9 movies to date. This was my favourite film for a time being until I fell in love with another George Lucas creation in Indiana Jones.The group of rebels including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to name a few are now off to the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt's palace. The bounty hunter Boba Fett has brought him his new prized possession in Han Solo (Harrison Ford) frozen in carbonite. Meanwhile, the Empire is recreating the Death Star and yep she is fully operational. So Luke must turn and face Darth Vader to complete his Jedi training and also save the universe.I truly love the first 45 minutes or so of this film and really to me out does the amazing battle on the ice planet of Hoth from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. It really is an amazing way to open up a film. Quite action-packed. While there really are no boring moments in the rest of the film at times in a couple scenes it does seem to become dialogue heavy while there is very little visually going on. A very minor problem though, as it doesn't lessen the film really. Written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas with excellent score by John Williams.There are a couple scenes that were changed in 1997 that personally I prefer the original. First being a scene in Jabba's palace when in 1997 they added a couple very-CGI characters that sing a silly song. In this version it seems that the movie stops so it can go into a musical number. The second being the very end of the film. Even though the music in both versions are similar, I seemed to love the music from the original 1983 release. While the 1997 release added footage making it seem more universal.So, if you did enjoy the first two you must watch this one. You will likely enjoy just as much as the other two.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the Triology - not!,"Most Star Wars fans can't see, that this is really a semi-quality movie. If it was named Titanic II (and the story looks a lot like it) every fan would hate it.But when it is the sequel of the two excellent episodes A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK everybody thinks that it is a magnificent movie.It is not. I find it a waste of special effects and otherwise good acting skills. And the ending is ooh-aargh-toooo-much.

It's not aging well,"I've seen ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" twice in the theater. I saw it when it first came out (Floral Park, NY) and when the ""Special Edition"" came out (Fresh Meadows, NY). I've seen it a bunch of times on cable and video. I used to enjoy it quite a bit. Not anymore. A lot of the special effects don't work as well as they used to. They look very dated. That normally wouldn't bother me but as the look of ""Return of the Jedi"" diminishes, the weakness of the script becomes more pronounced. The acting by the three leads (Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford) isn't so hot either. All three of them seem to be going through the motions most of the time. Often when I watch this movie now, I feel like I'm watching a two hour toy commercial. There are still some exciting moments in ""Return of the Jedi"" but the bloom is definitely off the rose.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Subtle brilliance,"I must admit, when I first started watching StarWars, I was skeptical. I found A New Hope to be over hyped, and frankly subpar in the emotional connection (or lack thereof) that you have with the characters and as such, I simply could not get into the film. But I gave it another go and boy am I glad I did. In the trilogy, this was the very best yet.

My favourite in the series,"Now before you rush ahead and quickly mark my review unhelpful, hear me out alright? Return of the Jedi is the only movie of the trilogy I had no hopes from. I had heard of people saying that it's the worst in the series. But considering I got bored from A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back I thought this one is going to be even worse (why I got bored of them, that's written on their reviews. But still if you're too lazy to check it's because I always somehow get bored watching old movies). So I had absolutely no expectations from it. Turns out it has the most story of all the Star Wars movies.The movie began with answering the question as to what happened to Han Solo. He gets rescued by Luke and Leia. We even get to see the iconic Boba Fett in that scene. Later on we get to see Lando. Even though I haven't heard about him and I actually had to look up his name while writing this review, he looks pretty iconic. I don't know if this was a popular look or this movie made the look popular, but I guess the latter is true. There were many other NPC characters throughout the movie, but for me the selling point were the Ewoks. And I don't care what all the ""die-hard Star Wars fanboys"" say.The Ewoks are so adorable! I wanted to pull their cheeks. Their scenes were so cute and funny. The way they fought the Stormtroopers or treated C3PO like a messiah was really wholesome. I really wanted to see that kind of stuff in Star Wars movies. Just because it's set in space doesn't mean it always has to blast out laser guns or have huge flying ships. After all, it's set long long ago in a galaxy far far away. There could be many tribes living over there as well. And seeing them hold up makes me believe they still exist somewhere in today's time, having evolved into becoming teddy bears as advanced as humans.And finally Darth Vader's final fight scene in this movie, in my opinion, was way better than The Empire Strikes Back. We actually get to see what Darth Vader looks like, and he hasn't cut Luke's arm for this. This is the correct way of drawing out emotions. The one who is making the audience emotional should be in pain, and not the one being made emotional. Darth Sidious was really intimidating, and I really wanted more of him rather than the trash that Palpatine was.Star Wars: Episode VI is even today my favourite Star Wars movie. It doesn't matter what others say about it, it's gonna be the most OP in my opinon. In just 2.5 hours it managed to tell more story than the entire sequel trilogy combined. And the best part - the spoilers from this movie aren't even as popular as Episode IV or V, so I could watch it without already knowing what I'm about to watch. I'd absolutely watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Jedi is the clear third best film in the franchise (yes still better than Rogue One) and a fitting end to a remarkable trilogy.

The saga ended...,"weakly.This film has its good moments, but in many ways, it seems to be an attempt to tie up all the loose plot threads as neatly as possible.Overall, the notion is that Darth Vader redeems himself by turning on the emperor. Except we never really understand why because we never really understand why a supposedly good man (as Luke describes him) would support the emperor to start with.Conversely, we can't really respect Obi-Wan and Yoda. They are essentially setting this kid up to kill his father.Oh, yeah, and Ewoks. Did we really need the Ewoks? I mean, they were like little cannibalistic teddy bears? Were they serving Imperial Stormtroopers at that party at the end?In many ways, I think the Star Wars universe has deep philosophical implications that are hinted at and never explored.

"anti-climactic, yet a good finish.","Though disputably inferior to episodes iv and v ""Jedi"" makes for a fantastic finish to the trilogy and sends chills down your spine. It is, unfortunately, rather predictable from about half-way through, and I must say it was almost disappointing to see Vader's conclusion. Though cute and cuddly those ewoks just don't add believability nor remain in consistency with the tone set from episode iv. (They do however add appeal to females thus broadening the viewer spectrum.) What more can be said than that the action, special effects and general story can nor has been equalled by any sci-fi film in history.

Epic conclusion of the first trilogy,"When I saw this, it was the third film is the Star Wars franchise. Now it is the sixth, but it is not sixth in order of greatness. This film covers Luke's becoming a Jedi, and the rebels taking the fight back to the empire. Reviewing this film so many years after it came out, the only flaw I can see is the blandness of the lightsaber duels in comparison to the modern movies. That is all I can say bad about it though. People have enjoyed talking crap about the Ewoks, but those same people forget that these movies are geared towards families, and you need the cute to counter the ugly.

The red headed step child of the series,"This films functions far better as a predictor of the terrible prequels than as a sequel of the first two films. Several factors-the Ewoks are the lest of it-work to make this film exceptionally weak. It adheres too closely to repeating A New Hope ala Beowulf. The incest being retroactively added to Empire does not help. Worse the film is split into distinct sections that don't function as a story overall. This film is really two stories-the rescue of Han and Death Star 2.0. Neither one is given proper to time breath and they don't gel together.Nonetheless, the core of the film is solid. Luke's arch is brought to a satisfactory close and the various characters are given proper send offs. Even the final battle is rather serviceable despite the repeat from A New Hope. This brings the first set of films to a proper ending.This film is the most damaged by the special edition. All of the added material weakens the material and adding a ""noooooo"" to a critical moment is so artless that it nearly destroys the entire climax and thus story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A great wrap on the original story,"The third of the original trilogy of Star Wars warps up the story beautifully. George Lucas would write and produce two more trilogies - in a prequel and then sequel series. But this first series contains a whole story in itself. The next two trilogies are good, and sci-fi fans should enjoy them. But, as with other movies that been made in the past, nothing can match the originals for interest and enjoyment.The best action and special effects in this film have to do with the good guys battling the bad guys on Jabba the Hut's Tatooine. Princess Leia shows her muscle. Again, there are more creatures and weapon machines. The very young are probably taken most with the Ewoks on the planet, Endor. They do look a lot like scruffy Teddy bears.Here are some favorite lines from this film:C-3PO, ""If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hut, you'd probably short-circuit.""Jabba the Hut, ""This bounty hunter is my kind of scum.""Luke Skywalker, ""Your over confidence is your weakness.""

Sign of things to come,"The final installation in the original Star Wars trilogy and a culmination of an epic story about galaxy in peril, about the battle between two ancient factions, about the battle between good and evil, control and passion.Personally, I think it's a significant step backwards from the previous two movies. The story doesn't flow as smoothly, the ending climax isn't as exciting as the two previous ones (we have to blow the Death Star again?), the characters are not as good as they used to be and the new stuff, which there is still a lot of, to the film's credit, is not as good as in the previous one. In this film we see for the first time the signs and phenomena that would come to haunt us in the prequel trilogy.To go over a few of the highlights, we have the ewoks. Now, apparently they were supposed to be wookies, which would have been amazing. Chewbacca is a fan favourite, and we would have gotten to see his people, his culture, more laser crossbows, all that good stuff. Instead we have the elite troops of the Galactic Empire being beaten back by an army of teddy bears. I'm not the only one seeing the problem here, right?Plus, the characters. Luke, Han and Vader are still very good and especially Vader has some his best moments in this film, especially near the end. But Leia, for example, has been relocated to a complete support role, to the point that she really has no point in being in this film. She's a far cry from the nail hard, snarky, blaster-toting space princess she was in the first film. Not quite on the Padmé-level of chickification, but heading in the same direction. Ian McDiarmid also has his screen debut as the Emperor in this film, and while he is amazing and will pretty much carry the prequel films alone with his charisma, here his over the topness is a bit unsettling because you're already wary and looking for flaws because of the ewoks.Then again, the effects are still amazing, the battle scenes are exciting, the final confrontation with Luke, Vader and the Emperor is one of cinema's finest for a reason, the space battle of Endor is a good one and the story is by no means bad one. It just isn't as good as the two previous ones, which are two of the best adventure stories ever put on film. So go ahead and see the film if you've liked the trilogy so far. It's not as good, if you ask me, but it's still a fitting conclusion to the saga.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Superb Ending To One Of The All-time Greatest Cinematic Trilogies,"Just when you think it couldn't get any better, Lucas provides the final film of the (2nd) trilogy which beautifully rounds up the first two films. If I had to choose a favourite of the three I would say 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi'. Just like in the prequels, here the execution is excellent whether you're talking about cinematography, art direction, costumes, visual effects, sound, makeup, props, robotics, score and editing.This one has more of an adventurous feel compared to the first two. There's plenty of action, romance, humour and energy. Here the whole Han Solo-Jabba the Hut angle is wrapped up. There are plenty of amusing new characters which and the Iwoks are adorable and hilarious. There's also a brilliant chase sequence that takes place in a forest. The final consists of three major battle sequences: Luke confronting Vader and the Fall of the Evil Emperor, the defeating of the Second Death Star and the Battle of Endor all of which are filmed superbly and remain memorable.The growth of the characters, especially Leia and Luke, is depicted smoothly. Fisher's Leia is more sexual and mature. There's a motherly side to her as well. Hamill's Luke is no longer the boy he was in 'Star Wars'. He's ready to lead an army and battle evil. Han too is more responsible here.The cast is great. Fisher is much sexier in this movie (for obvious reasons) and she's charming all the way. Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are fantastic as usual. David Prowse and James Earl Jones (with his strong voice) are stupendous as Darth Vader. Frank Oz, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker and the actors playing the Iwoks provide fine support.Overall, for me, this is perhaps the most memorable of what I would call one of my all-time favourite trilogies. I'm a tad disappointed that it's finished but now that I have the boxset, I'll be revisiting it again and not twenty years later.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I know I have to forgive them for the special/practical effects but even then, it's hard to understand how this franchise is still so highly regarded by new audiences. The acting was cheesy, unrelatable, unnatural, the villains are comically evil, there's no believable character development that makes you go ""wow, that's some human emotions right there"" and the writing just never stepped up. Why should the audience feel anything for the characters and factions when they're not given enough context and backgrounds to seem real?There were tons of timeless masterpieces from way before the 70s. They stood the test of time because the stories were believable and the characters, good or bad, felt human. The exaggeration of emotions and drama was just right to be immersive while also making me think.Star Wars IV - VI just couldn't do it for me.

Most of the same characters from the first two films appear again, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Darth Vader and Chewbacca, but somehow they don't have the same impact as they did before.The main problems with Return of the Jedi are the general tone and the uneven script. The film is at its best when at its darkest, but unfortunately the film is less dark overall than the original Star Wars, let alone The Empire Strikes Back. Most of the film's best scenes are those featuring Emperor Palpatine, who is finally seen in the flesh for the first time. He exudes a believable aura of malevolence, and many of his scenes are electrifying (no pun intended).Return of the Jedi is hampered by an over-abundance of set pieces, which are entertaining enough while on screen but don't do enough to advance the plot, and are quickly forgotten as our heroes move on to tackle the next leg of their adventure.Unfortunately, a large chunk of the film is spent on Endor with the Ewoks. The appearance of these small furry creatures indicates that Return of the Jedi is aiming for a younger demographic than before, but in doing so it sacrifices much of the cross-generational appeal the series used to have.Return of the Jedi marks the point at which the Star Wars series began to lose its way. It undoubtedly has some memorable sequences, but there are also long sections where it becomes boring (yep, the Ewoks), an accusation that couldn't be levelled at the first two films. Viewed on its own terms, or compared with the more recent Star Wars films, Jedi's faults can be forgiven, but as part of the original trilogy it really should have been better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Point of no return,"The last movie is beautifully finishes the trilogy. Great ending for epic space opera and it would be great if Disney wouldn't massacre it.Movie keeps the same level of quality as in the Empire strikes back. Great and more complex action scenes, solid story with different lines and that feeling of mesmerizing adventure, very personal and local and massive and epic.The main and most important thing in the old movies and complete lack in modern. It had soul, I do believe in characters, their changes and motivation, simple story, but deep which gives that feeling of real adventure.Overall, one of the best movies ever made, fantastic story that would be remembered through decades.10 out 10 not because it doesn't have flaws, but because it stands aside and above many other movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Weakest of the original trilogy, too focused on conclusion.","Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.This film serves a clear purpose, to bring closure to the original Star Wars trilogy. That, it does, however it sacrifices its potential in doing so. The first act of the film could have been entirely separate and does feel like story buffer, despite the fact it is critical for the film to make sense. The characters don't see too much development, however it isn't necessary, as the previous film has already invested you in them. On the technical side of things, the bluescreens and the speeder bike battle scene don't hold up whatsoever, but most of the other aspects, such as Ewoks or spaceships do. The sets weren't as good as other films, but when the bar is that high, they outclass most other films. The first act had fun action, an exciting heist plot, a Rancor and a Sarlacc. It really managed to capture the grimy, crowded atmosphere of Jabba's palace. The final act on Endor was slightly repetitive, but still entertaining. But the closure is what this film was for, and it delivered a satisfying ending for this Hexalogy. Overall, this is the weakest of the original trilogy, but it's still a much needed, rewarding wrap up.73/100--Admin--

Rewatching Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, I find myself once again captivated by its charm and depth. While my opinion might align with most people's on paper-ranking the original trilogy as The Empire Strikes Back, A New Hope, then Return of the Jedi-I rate this film only slightly behind the first. The differences that make it a slightly lesser film are incredibly minute.One of those aspects is the Ewoks. I'm actually OK with them. Sure, they're cutesy, but I don't find them cheesy. Besides, I don't know why cute would be an issue with the way everyone's gone gaga over Baby Yoda in recent years. The Ewoks add a unique flavour to the film and contribute to its charm.For me, the real magic happens in the second and third acts. Luke's visit to Yoda in the second act is one of the best sequences in the original trilogy. It brings the feels with some truly touching moments, and like the big reveal in The Empire Strikes Back, it delivers some much-needed character depth. Yoda's wisdom and the emotional weight of the scene resonate deeply.Then we move straight into the third act. There's plenty of action, but for me, it's all about the confrontation between Vader and Luke. This duel remains my favourite lightsaber fight in the saga. It may not be as polished or visually impressive as the duel in The Phantom Menace, but it has far more emotion, amplified by John Williams' amazing score. The stakes, the internal conflicts, and the raw emotion make it unforgettable.Return of the Jedi is a worthy ending to the original trilogy, wrapping up the saga with heart and excitement. Its minor flaws are easily overshadowed by its strengths. The character arcs, the epic battles, and the ultimate resolution provide a satisfying conclusion. My rewatch confirms that this film holds a special place in my heart.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 7.0

One of the worst films to hold a spot on IMDb's top 250 list.,"Return of the Jedi is an example of a film that had to many changes before release.
Changing Chewbacca's planet to a teddy bear planet. removing Lucas's original idea of Luke going on a quest for revenge and replacing it with a reunion with daddy.
Jedi proves it's no simple task being a Star Wars film.
While the actors still give their all, the alien design is still good as are the landscapes.
It's the plot itself which kills it, not to mention some dumb character deaths (Boba Fett anyone?) Return of the Jedi lacked the darkness, depth and intensity of Empire.
I'll never be able to understand how anyone can rate this 9 or 10 stars. It's just plain bad.
I don't recommend it, it's a terrible ending to the original trilogy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Fitting End to Cinema's Most Iconic Trilogy.,"Return of the Jedi is widely agreed to be the worst of the original Star Wars trilogy. With forty odd years of this context in mind, I was struck by how much I really enjoyed this movie.It all starts with the makeup and visual effects. My God. It's been striking seeing how Star Wars went from a clearly lower budgeted independent film to what would've been the pinnacle of movie magic in the span of six(ish) years. The Jim Henson partnership really paid off; this film has objectively some of the most convincing, well designed, and impressive animatronic puppetry I've ever seen. The makeup for so many of these alien characters gives the universe a lively feeling and a sense that there's so much more to the world of Star Wars than we get to see.It's also a film chock full of fantastic action and set pieces, and I can't deny how much better a lot of the action is, even compared to the Empire Strikes Back. The opening stretch is iconic; full of kooky alien characters, giant monsters, a fantastic reunion between our characters, and the movie never really lets up from there. The final space battle and confrontation on Endor are great, as is everything between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor.There's a lot to love about this movie. However, it does represent a tonal shift that I think threw a lot of people off. The Ewoks are...controversial for a reason, even if I didn't mind them initially, I could see how someone expecting the ""sequel"" to the Empire Strikes Back may find them somewhat grating and distracting. I mean, could we have cut down on them a bit to give us more of Yoda? Sure, and it'd probably be the right decision.I also think the ""reveal"" of Leia as Luke's sister kind of went nowhere, and really only serves as a hall pass for Han to boink her without guilt - that's a funny sentence, I know, but realistically, that's the only thing that comes out of it in this movie.And yes, we can't ignore the COPIOUS ""updates"" made to this movie courtesy of the 90s re-release. It probably has the most egregious example of this, right at the beginning (the infamous musical number, the obviously CG beak given to the Sarlaac). A lot of these added visuals simply don't match the style of the rest of the movie and unfortunately, original and remastered versions of this and the other two original trilogy films are really hard to come by. But, they're not all bad and in fact, I think this movie has the best example of the ""retooling"" process working right: including Hayden Christensen's Anakin at the end. It brings the entire saga together and actually makes a lot more sense thematically.Despite its obvious flaws, I can't help but love this movie. This is all subjective, but this was one was my favourite as a kid, and I'm sure it was for a lot of other kids who saw these movies. At the end of the day, it's a film with so much legendary iconography, it perfectly wraps up the series (with an astonishingly simple story), and is just a joy to watch.

The most memorable Star Wars to me as a kid.,"While many don't like the Ewoks and creatures in this particular film, and while the two before this are much better imo, I personally really liked the scenes at Jabba's palace, plus the 3 ending battles all meshed together! This also has many emotion-stirring parts to it and awesome suspenseful battle scenes and I think that it's one of the best final films to a trilogy that there are and can be! Everything wrapped up well, and the crappy Disney sequel should not have been made since this was a great conclusion and how Palpatine ""died"" was perfect!

A Fitting End to What May Be the Greatest Trilogy of All Time,"While ""Star Wars"" laid the ground work and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" flipped the formula on its head, the final chapter of the epic Star Wars Trilogy brings everything full circle, at long last tying up the cliffhangers from the end of ""Empire"" in a perfectly satisfying conclusion to a truly remarkable series. Following an exhilarating rescue on Tattooine, the Rebels find themselves up against a Second Death Star. While the assault ensues, Luke Skywalker must confront his fate at long last, and face off against the evil Darth Vader, as well as the long-awaited appearance of the sadistic, tyrannical Emperor.As with the previous films, ""Return of the Jedi"" is a great movie. While it isn't nearly as dark as ""Empire,"" it doesn't have to be. It does its job just fine, wrapping up the trilogy in the most excellent way possible. The sequences in Jabba's palace and the speeder bike chase are some of the most enjoyable in the entire series, again showing how far technology advances from film to film. This is by far the most action-packed entry in the series, a high-energy movie that never leaves you bored.What makes this movie for me, however, is the climax. The three overarching battles are incredibly engaging, and a complete thrill to watch. The battle on Endor is a very enjoyable action sequence, the dogfight with the Death Star is the best space battle of the series, and the scenes in the Emperor's throne room are simply captivating, completely commanding your attention whenever they are on screen.""Return of the Jedi,"" while a bit lighter in terms of its tone, still retains that incredible level of ""Star Wars"" magic that its predecessors had, wrapping everything up in a simply perfect way.

"Pompous, Ponderous Cuteness","The last ""Star Wars"" sequel avoids some, but not all, of the pitfalls that the series had so deftly steered around before. Luke (Hamill) must rescue his friend Solo (Ford) & foil the Empire's latest diabolical plot while facing down the demons in his own heritage. ""Return"" undermines one of the great strengths of the series--the excellence of its villains-- by introducing not one but TWO new ubervillains. One is the Emperor himself (McDiarmid), an arthritic, dermatoligically challenged fugitive from ""Kung Fu,"" while the other, wholly unrelated badguy is the giant, sexually depraved worm (yes, really a worm) Jabba the Hut. After slowly building a tough damsel-in-distress under her enveloping costumes in the first two films, Carrie Fisher is reduced to a harem-girl plaything for the huge, slimy puppet Jabba, which has to be some kind of record-setting low for an actress. Hamill, though talented, doesn't have the presence to be an epic hero while Ford is mostly reduced to comic relief. Much of the film is taken up by events on the planet Endor, a Disney Adventureland inhabited by teddy bears. Except for the rousing theme carried over from the earlier films, John Williams's music is heavy & ponderous to the point of parody. Still, ""Star Wars"" is about spectacular, heroic action & ""Return"" delivers, with the opening battle on Tattooine & the climactic space fleet action making up for the mushy molasses of Endor. Billy Dee Williams helps take up any heroic slack left by Hamill & Ford. As with the rest of the series, ""Return"" isn't science fiction but outer-space fantasy adventure, so forgive any pretense of technological or social commentary. ""Return"" is aimed at devotees of the ""Star Wars"" but is still an enjoyable thrill ride for anyone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Continuing the tradition of excruciating dialogue and complete lack of subtlety...,"The STAR WARS films are a hallmark of our culture. Everyone who wants to study film should see them, because they display quite accurately how not to make a movie, and in particular how not to write a script. I cannot even express how much is wrong is these movies, in every possible respect. Obviously they are cynically manufactured with money in mind (Ewoks!? C'mon!), and obviously they wrecked the notion of film as anything but lightweight, even dull and stupid, entertainment. What even some of the series' detractors fail to see is how awful the movies would be with or without the hype.Let's start with the acting. I can't believe anyone ever took Mark Hamill seriously; meanwhile, Harrison Ford's attempts at emotion are downright laughable. Carrie Fisher does what she can, but like everyone else, she's saddled with some unspeakable dialogue. Far more offensive is the storyline that runs through the three films (and presumably the three prequels as well). You tell me with a straight face that no loser thirteen year-old who reads sci-fi comics couldn't come up with this tripe, and I will applaud you. George Lucas has created a masturbatory set of films in a remarkably self-indulgent attempt to take advantage of the notoriety he achieved with AMERICAN GRAFFITI. Let's not beat around the bush, these movies have one of the dumbest plots ever transferred to celluloid. ""The Force""? Wow, talk about covering your tracks... to try to avoid plot holes, Lucas creates this invisible dimension that can let people do anything, like pick up out-of-reach objects (as seen in the remarkable ""Luke retrieves a Kenner toy which you could go buy right now from the snow while he hangs upside down"" scene, the stuff of great cinema, in the second film). How exciting. I'd like to have a Force in my house so I won't have to get up to change the TV channel when this idiotic movie comes on.The script? Don't even get me started. To be frank, what little plot there is doesn't make much sense. And talk about episodic! It's just one toy commercial after another, from the completely pointless ""speeder-bike"" scene to the seemingly endless chunk of partying from the Care Bears or whatever those things were. Any fan page or even the IMDB will hold a nice collection of ludicrous quotes, and the fans will probably shiver with glee, while I sit and gawk at how a screenplay with no trace of talent to be found can gain the respect of millions. Most offensively, you've got a score that screams and manipulates like a sitcom laugh track or a Nazi anthem (but then, John Williams never offered anything but recycled schmaltz to start with).In essence, I remain fascinated by the fact that more people have seen this than will sit through the infinite number of films that have more imagination and emotion in a single second than the entire ""Star Wars"" series can muster. The worst part is, if you issue any kind of a dissenting opinion on this boring junk, a million raging fanboys will assault you for not showing the proper degree of worship to a supposed American classic. Jonathan Rosenbaum said in 1997 that destroying every print of the Star Wars films wouldn't solve any of the problems caused by them, but that he wouldn't shed a tear at the loss. I would agree. I don't claim to have any authority over anyone's love of the series, and if you genuinely love these films, that's great. I just don't understand why those who disagree are so frequently labeled ""flamers."" I apologize for not wanting my brain to turn to mush.My rating: 0/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is Where the Fun Begins.,"Where do I stand on Star Wars? Well, all 6 of George Lucas' films are strong, iconic, and technologically brilliant displays of childhood imagination writ large. Youthful space adventures bound together by universal themes. Fan Fiction entries aside, Star Wars is great. That said, the official end of Lucas' saga, Return of the Jedi, may be my favorite of the whole bunch. With a mix of the jubilant excitement of A New Hope, the sophisticated themes of Empire Strikes Back, and a surplus of new wonders from the mind of George Lucas, Return of the Jedi is the ultimate realization of the Original Trilogy.Coming off the to-be-continued ending of Empire, Episode VI opens with guns a-blazing, as it were. Luke is a Jedi, Han is frozen in carbonite, and the rest of the gang have descended on Tatooine to set him free. Right from the start, Jedi exudes confidence. It's Richard Marquand as the credited director this time, but the film is 100% George Lucas' DNA. The quirky world-builder he is, Lucas' imagination is freed in Jedi. Just as his first Star Wars sequel exponentially expanded the world of A New Hope, so does Return of the Jedi expand on Empire. One might have assumed that there was nowhere else to go after the previous film. No new characters or locations to match up with the icons that had come before. Enter Jabba the Hut, the giant gangster slug and his opulent palace, The Emperor, lord of all evil, Ewoks and the forest moon of Endor, and loads more aliens, creatures, and technology than Star Wars had seen previously. Even the places Return of the Jedi revisits, like the deserts of Tatooine or the halls of the Death Star, are given vivid life. Bigger, brighter, and more detailed in every respect.There is confidence in the special effects and action too. No longer can I describe any of the chases, battles, or duels as ""clunky"". They're all first-rate. Return of the Jedi is where technology and budget finally caught up with Lucas' vision. If the prequels would take his untamed subconscious into the digital infinitude, Jedi represents the most he could do within the confines of the practical world. The armies are big, the speeder bikes are fast, the space battles are sprawling and intricate, and the creatures have that particular silly Lucas-ian charm. For me, Return of the Jedi is clearly the most fun of the Original Trilogy and maybe the entire saga.Return of the Jedi is everything I love about Star Wars, all at once. It's the spirit of adventure, the childlike innocence, the serious themes, and the mythic grandiosity. It's the greatest example of the promise of George Lucas' world; of the brilliant colors and the strange worlds that A New Hope suggested. It's all here to experience. If one film had to stand for the entirety of the Star Wars saga, for the fableistic storytelling of the Original Trilogy and the liberating grandeur of the Prequel Trilogy, it would be that film in between both worlds.90/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I actually winced when he deliberately threw himself down so Luke could really give his old man a hiding. Darth looked like he'd put on a few pounds and was too tired to put up a good fight!

The addition of cuddly cutesy pooh bears was obviously for the entertainment of toddlers. Mr Lucas aimed this flick primarily at the youngest movie-goers, to the detriment of older audiences (those over the age of 8).The franchise has grown woefully tired.

Impossible to view this except through the eyes of my 5 year old self,"This is original trilogy Star Wars. This film is review proof. I cannot be objective.When I was about 5 years old and a school friend mentioned the time Darth Vader had a light sabre duel with Luke Skywalker, I confidently rolled my eyes, and corrected him; ""Vader has a duel with Obi-Wan, not Luke!"" His perplexed reply, ""In the OTHER Star Wars movie?"" is, to this day, etched in my brain. ""There's another Star Wars movie?!""
The original mind blowing.I loved Darth Vader as a kid. I idolised him. He was powerful. He was self-sufficient. He was all in black. I trace my mania for world domination back to him, and I just could not wait to see more.I urged my parents to rent the other Star Wars movies (this was back in the days of video stores). My parents cared little for chronology, and skipped over The Empire Strikes Back, and rented Return of the Jedi. Continuity issues were easily rationalised by my 5 year old brain; ""stuff happened in between. I get it.""To this day, when I watch this movie, I still (re)experience the thrill I felt as a 5 year old watching the final half hour for the first time. As the action cut between the three battles, on the ground, in space, and in the throne room, my heart near burst; what would we see next? What was happening? When will Darth Vader kill this uppity Skywalker? Eeeeeeee!!The emotions I felt as the final scenes unfolded was too much for me; ""Nooooo! This wasn't how it was supposed to end! Vader lives!""The following day, as we stood in the driveway, my mother explained that now we had to bring the movie back to the store, I began to cry.
Me: Don't bring it back. Let's keep it forever.
Mam: But then they wouldn't let us rent anything else.
Me: We don't need anything else. We have this!If I had known then there would come a day when I would have all eleven (Eleven!) (so far!) Star Wars movies in my pocket, I could not have understood. What I did understand was that Star Wars was where I lived in my mind, Star Wars was where I played with my friends, and Star Wars was where I dreamed of when I slept. The final fate of my favourite characters had wrenched me, and I could not part with that tape.My cruel, cruel mother insisted on returning it however, and I had to live only on the memories for a while, which I did, going over it all in my mind.
You can't objectively review a movie like that.
I can see that Star Wars: A New Hope, and The Empire Strikes Back might be better films in some ways, but I never again needed to hug a video tape so tightly, and for that, this remains one of my favourite movies, one for which I can still quote almost all the dialogue (""The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am...""), and which will remain tied to a joyful, tearful 5 year old me forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Jedi hard with a vengeance.,"I mean.. as I said with my review of ""A New Hope"" trying to objectively review a film that's been in my life for nearly 40 years and saying something new about it is near impossible. But I said I'd review everything that I watched, and here we are. I do have a couple of observations that hadn't hit me before.Though a second Death Star is nearing completion, and the war against the Empire is in full swing, several high-ranking figures in the Rebellion, and literally the only known Jedi left in the universe, risk their lives on a dangerous mission to rescue one decent pilot. Mon Mothma (Caroline Blakiston) must have been pulling her hair out!I do, of course, love ""Return of the Jedi"" another absolute classic of the original trilogy. I accept it's not as cool as ""Empire"" or groundbreaking as ""Hope"" and it's reusing the plot of the first film (at least this is the last time we'll see a planets size gun though... right?... right?).This is, I think, the first time I've seen the new ending and allow me to say ""booooooooo"". Changing Anakin to Hayden Christiansen is fine, even if it doesn't make sense as all other force ghosts look like they did when the died. I don't even mind the universe wide celebration, even though it doesn't really make sense as they'll be years spent battling the remnants of the Empire to come. The changing of the celebration music though is jarringly horrible though and I missed the nubnub song terribly.I've also never noticed before how essentially the film is just two set pieces. One, Jabba's palace, then almost immediately afterwards we see the plan for Endor and off they pop. Luke has a little detour but mostly it crashes on at quite a pace and that's before the expert triple finale of the battle between Luke and Vader, the space battle and the destruction of the deflector shields.I don't really have anything new to add but it's one film from my past that doesn't disappoint at a rewatch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A great DVD experience...but where's the movie I loved as a kid??,"I watched the just released DVD version of Return of the Jedi last night and I must say I enjoyed it. This is Star Wars after all, three of the most entertaining movies ever made.Since about everyone over the age of 12 knows the plot of the saga, I'm not going to restate it here, what I will talk about is why I was disappointed with the DVD.Let me say that I don't mind the special edition of ""Jedi"", the changes aren't extensive, save for the ending sequence and most of the alterations exist simply of some added visual effects or sharper appearances on FX elements like ships and lightsabers.Sadly though, I do miss the ORIGINAL Return of the Jedi, the version I watched probably too many times as a kid. The DVD version is great, but it's just not the same. It's too bad the original theatre versions weren't included in the release. I know many a message board are dedicated to this debate right now so I won't go in to a long tirade.I think the one thing that I dislike most about this version of ""Jedi"" and the special edition was the drastic change to the celebration song at the end. I much preferred the original song to the more syrupy tune in the new releases.Well, at least I still have my VHS copy of this film...which likely WON'T find its way to my trash bin simply because this has now been released.Take it for what it is...but it is ISN'T the original.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best OT film,"The effects don't age as bad as A New Hope, it's not cheesy like it either, and it handles a dark story better than Empire did.The Battle of Endor is one of the best battles in sci-fi history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The conclusion?,"STAR WARS: RETURN OF THE JEDI is the final chapter in a six-movie series that, although filmed and produced out of order, serves as a cap-stone on the whole thing.But does it? Rumors from many years ago suggest that at least 3 more films, and perhaps even six more films were planned at the start -- and with George Lucas' current age, we can pretty much assure ourselves that we will not see them. At least not as he would have produced them. George is, after all, George -- and George does not like other people messing with his universe.If I have a complaint about RETURN OF THE JEDI it is with Ewoks. I will not get into the things that bug me about those darned little teddy-bears, because most people that watch the film will see the problems for themselves. One can complain, I suppose, but STAR WARS is George Lucas' playground, and that is what he wanted to use. His call.Does this film do an effective job of ending the saga? For the most part, yes. There is a bit of a feeling of ""well, now what?"" that you get as the final scenes are putting themselves up on screen; and for those that have read the Extended Universe novels, there are some pretty darned good ideas for what could (should?) happen next. Would I like to see more Star Wars films? Most definitely. These are some of my favorite ""guilty-pleasure"" films of all time.

This was a big disappointment,The Return of the Jedi was a movie that was hard to watch.I was a big fan of the first two movies and was very much looking forward to this one. The qualities that made the first two movies so good were missing from 'Jedi'. The plot was unoriginal. The story had nothing interesting or new. The actors seemed like they couldn't wait to get it over with. The new characters in the movie were very boring. It seemed like the target audience for this movie was 5 year-olds based on some of the work of the background actors in the opening act and by many of the other characters in the film. It seems like the movie was sloppily put together. There are only two scenes in the movie that interested me and it was not enough to overcome all the bad. I wanted to like this movie as I had the other two. An overall bad movie.,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Ewoks taste like chicken.,"Okay, I give up.  Apparently George Lucas thought that Star Wars did so well because of the merchandising.  Thus, from his head did burst forth the Ewok. (Ewoks seem to be based on Australian tribes people, which is actually a lot better than the crazy Jar-Jar primitive race alien in Ep. 1.)  The story for this movie is excellent, the movie itself is just so half-assed.  I think the entire movie can be judged on the scene in which Luke is fighting off the giant monster creature in Jabba's lair.  The blue screen my weatherman uses looks better than that.  There was really no point in adding new scenes to this film, if not to clean up at least that one shot.  And although Lucas never expected to shoot Empire or Jedi, I'm sure that somewhere in the back of his head he must have been thinking that Mark Hammil would mature into an actor with a more Jedi-like screen personality. Please vote for this movie, I gave it a 5 out of 10, help get it out of the top 50 at least.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Fantastic End To The Original Trilogy,"To finish off the original Star Wars trilogy it is time to review Return Of The Jedi, a truly iconic film that had to really deliver as the payoff for the first two groundbreaking films and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker have to return to Tattoine to confront Jabba The Hutt in an attempt to rescue Han Solo, while Darth Vader & The Emperor are in the midst of builing a new Death Star in order to crumble The Rebel Alliance.Main Character
Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker gets his final run out as the main character of a Star Wars film and I actually think this is his best performance as the character in the original trilogy. You can see he has progressed plenty since his encounter with Vader in Empire Strikes Back and you see he is truly on his way to being a true Jedi. But as I have mentioned in previous reviews he still makes some mistakes and acts out of emotion, I think you appreciate his performance more after you have seen the prequels and seen how the Jedi act there it shows Luke has more personality and feels more human and easier to connect with.Supporting Characters
Harrison Ford & Carrie Fisher are back as Han Solo & Leia and they both do good jobs in their roles and still give their all to the characters, however, I think it is clear to see their characters aren't given as much time to shine as they did in the previous film. Reports were that Ford wasn't keen to do this film but they convinced him to do it and maybe that was the reason their characters weren't given as much to do. Now we get to such an interesting performance and character and that is Darth Vader, he is more then just the intimidating monster in this film. He has so much depth to his character and you can see how much turmoil he is going through due to his deep feelings and even though you don't see his face you know exactly what he is thinking and you can see that turmoil very clearly. Ian Mcdiarmid plays The Emperor in the film and he was the perfect big bad for this film, for the previous films you wonder how this guy has so much power but you see it in this film. He is the ultimate evil in the film and his complexity and motivations are really dastardly and it is really easy to hate him and root for Luke against him.Story
The story has some really interesting things about it, the turmoil in Darth Vader is easily the most interesting part of the film and easily the dynamic between Luke, Vader & The Emperor is captivating and keeps you interested throughout. However, my main criticism for the film is the lack of interest I have in the Han & Leia story on Endor and really my main gripe for the film The Ewoks. I know the empire are never really shown to be that strong in the films but I just can't take seriously that a bunch of bears can deal with The Empire. It also shows the first time that I feel George Lucas chose merchandise over the film by making the ewoks more child friendly instead of a legitimate threat, honestly, I feel like this film would have been better if they had just replaced the Ewoks with The Wookies and used that to give Chewbacca a bit more to do and I feel like this was a missed opportunity.Script
The script for this film was great, the relationship between Vader, Luke & The Emperor is handled perfectly in the film and the dialogue moves you incredibly. The drama is off the chart in the film and it is a perfect emotional end to the franchise, mixed with a bit of well placed humour, with mainly Harrison Ford being Harrison Ford.Style
The style of the film is great, the action scenes are really exciting and they are really varied from the venture to Jabba's palace to the final lightsaber battle on the Death Star. They are all exciting and look great especially for the time it was made, I loved how physical the lightsaber battle is and really uses the story to drive the fight as a very personal situation instead of the gymnastic style used in the prequels. Also even though I complain about The Ewoks I cannot deny the action scenes they are in are quite entertaining and feel very different to the previous two films. As the other films I watched the special edition and there is only one big difference that I really had an issue with but it doesn't cause the film to go down a rating.Overall
Overall this is one of the greatest final parts of a trilogy ever made, it really delivers on the stories that you care about and gives a very satisfying conclusion to the original Star Wars franchise. This for me is the weakest of the trilogy but is still fantastic and a worthy end to this trilogy.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars VI: Return of the jedi - May the force be with you!!,"Star Wars Episode 6 is the third feature film to be released on December 12, 1983. However, it is chronologically arranged the sixth part. It is a US American Space Opera movie, which means it takes place in a fictional universe. Famous actors are Carrie Fisher, who plays Lea in the movie. Unfortunately, the actress died early. Mark Hamill plays Luke Skylwalker and Hamson Ford is Han Solo. The Emperor is portrayed by Ian McDiarmind and Dawid Prowe plays Darth Vader. Other important figures are Yoda (Frank Oz), Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The production of the film suffers George Lucas.
In the sixth part, Lea wants to free her friend Han Solo, who is imprisoned by Jabba de Hut (a comic creature). But her rescue mission fails and she becomes a slave herself. Lea's twin brother Luke Skywalker, who is Jedi Master, rescue them with the help of his droids R2D2 and C3PO. After that, Luke goes to Yoda (his master) and learns that he is finished with his training. He's only supposed to face Darth Vader, who's Luke's father. Yoda then dies of old age. The plan now is to destroy the second Death Star. Luke, Lea, Han Solo and their loyal friend Chewbaca set out to save the galaxy from evil. Luke has to face his father. The emperor's goal is to turn Luke to the dark side of force. Will he make it?
Personally, I find the movie very exciting and action-packed. Despite the fact that the movie is ancient, the movie has a lot of good effects. The lightsaber fights are always fascinating again and again. I can only recommend the movie because it is a lot about friendship, love and also family. However, Star Wars is nothing for everyone, because the movies are very imaginative.
All in all, Star Wars 6 is a fantasy movie with lots of action. The three friends Lea, Han and Luke want to save the universe and destroy the Death Star. I won't tell you whether they will succeed. Watch the movie and find out. May the force be with you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

40th Anniversary,"40 years later, the conclusion to the original trilogy is still able to fill an entire theatre of people from different generations and backgrounds, truly a timeless trilogy.Return of the Jedi (1983) is my least favourite film from the original trilogy, yet it remains a satisfying conclusion to an incredible trilogy.The film takes a while to start, the entire Jabba sequence on Tatooine could've been cut a lot shorter, and Lucas's CGI additions are terrible. I am not a fan of the Ewoks; unfortunately, they are a large part of the film. Everything on Endor is really weak in comparison to what's happening with Luke, Vader, & the Emperor. The directing behind this film is perhaps its most lacklustre aspect, compared to the previous films.Ford as Solo continues to be my favourite character in the trilogy, even when you can obviously tell he doesn't want to be there, his line delivery is always great. Although Han and Leia don't get to do much this time around and take a backseat. Luke's arc is fully realised and the entirety of his story of battling the dark side of the force fits perfectly with the set-up from the two previous films.The overall production is incredible and it's apparent that the team at Lucasfilm now fully know how to make a Star Wars film. The costume, creature, and set designs are impressive and have aged well.

"Uncovering the Epic Galactic Finale: ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" Brings the Saga to a Memorable Close with Emotional Impact!","""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" offers an enthralling fusion of spectacle, passion, and resolution, serving as a victorious and emotionally fulfilling capstone to the original trilogy. The 1983 picture, which was directed by Richard Marquand, deftly ties together the various strands of the Rebellion's conflict with the despotic Galactic Empire. A visual feast that highlights the latest developments in special effects while preserving the classic appeal of the Star Wars world, the film has several memorable scenes, including the legendary speeder bike pursuit on the forest moon of Endor and the intense lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Return of the Jedi excels at striking a balance between dramatic character arcs and explosive action. A narrative tapestry that strikes a chord on both an epic and personal level is created by Darth Vader's redemption, the father-son conflict, and the final downfall of Emperor Palpatine. The film not only fulfills the need for massive space battles but also delivers a satisfying emotional climax, cementing its position in cinematic history as a classic and cherished finale to the original trilogy.

Jedi's ignored special effect,"I, like most others, have found Return of the Jedi to be the weakest of the three original Star Wars films, albeit with wonderful strengths that mostly make up for the failings. Yes, the Ewoks are just too cute, yes Darth Vader was way too evil to be be accepted into the fold just because he comes around at the end, yes Jabba's palace scene, the monster in the pit aside, was hoaky. But, each time I see this film, two things strike me as so perfect that I forget about the rest of the movie, and it seems nobody else comments on these. First, I find John Williams music to be spectacular but somewhat derivative, but nowhere else does he shine as brightly as the background music during the scene when Luke finally goes nuts and almost kills Darth Vader. This is perfect wrought mood music (it is understated but is key to making this scene work). Second, Ian McDiarmid's performance here must be just about his best in any film, and I think certainly the best in this movie. (Ian who? He's the Emperor). A quick check of IMDB's actor list shows quite a few other movies in which I can now recall his character, such as in Dragonslayer, Gorky Park, etc; (all bit parts). But his scenes in Jedi seem to me a master stroke of really hitting the nail on the head. The postures, the movements, the facial movements behind the make-up, the voice, especially the small details of lip movement and little sneers. The eyes like a raptor's. None of this seems to be due to makeup. I can't imagine another actor who  would have done better in this role, and for me it makes the movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Magnificent climax to the series!!,"Just in case you're thinking that I don't know my Star Wars by saying that ROTJ is the climax, I can tell you right now that there is a less than a 1% chance that the sequel trilogy will happen. Anyway, Return of the Jedi is definitely up to par with the first two (not counting Ep. 1). Though it may lack in a FEW places, it still is as great of a movie to have the words Star Wars in the title. My favorite parts are all the ones with Emperor Palpatine, the whole beginning involving Jabba the Hutt, and the fight scene at the end. I don't know why everyone hates the ewoks. They are a great touch to the Star Wars series. Besides, you need some charm in the final chapter in the series, just like you need some charm in the first chapter in the series (hint, hint: don't hate Jar Jar). ROTJ has classic moments in it, just like the others. Take the sarlacc for example, or the rancor. Those scenes have just as much in it for a true classic moment that the space slug did, or the sand people. All in all, ROTJ is the best climax to a series I've ever seen, and I'm glad that it had to be from the phenomenal part of culture called Star Wars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most beautifully moving moments of the saga cumulate to make ROTJ still the best SW film to date,"SPOILERS AHEAD: - if you have not seen this one yet, best to wait until after you've seen the film.This review is mostly intended to offer some fresh commentary for those who have already seen the film. Regardless of whether you've seen it 0 or 50 times, I hope this review can add to your appreciation of the film.
--------------------
The most beautiful moments of the saga are to be found in Return of the Jedi. The power of these good moments more than make up for the film's flaws.Return of the Jedi is a film that has really benefits powerfully from all the back story of the prequels. Despite all the happy and silly moments of the lovable characters throughout the previous films, the Star Wars saga is set against a pretty dark backdrop. In every film there is always this threat of impending darkness and a society and culture that is falling apart. Or we are in the depths of a very dark evil tyranny, where it is a thought crime to suggest that what the Republic has slowly morphed into has become very wrong.In ROTJ however, we finally come out of that darkness and we know the good guys will win. There is a celebratory vibe to the whole film, somewhat of a homage to everything that came before it. We know that everything is about to get resolved, we're going to come out of that darkness.We firstly have what for me is the best moment of the Original Trilogy, at least, for sheer exhilaration: - We find out that Artoo is holding on to Luke's brand new lightsaber (we were thinking does ""Luke even have a lightsaber anymore? Didn't he lose it in the previous film""), which Artoo fires high into the sky, for Luke to use The Force to pluck from the air. Yes, Luke now has own lightsaber which he was powerful enough to construct himself. It is green, not blue; Luke is his own man now, not in the shadow of his father. Luke instantly activates it and goes on to make easy work of about a dozen different enemies. After years and years of darkness, the Jedi have returned! And like Qui-Gon, Ob-Wan, and Anakin before Luke, the bad guys are powerless to do anything against a Jedi.What follows soon after for me is the most powerful and beautiful moment in the whole saga, thanks to John Williams and one of his very best pieces ""The Death Of Yoda"". Luke returns to be with his mentor, wanting to continue to grow as a Jedi. But it seems it might be too late, for Yoda's time has come. Luke is there for his great friend and mentor when Yoda passes away.At the moment of Yoda's passing, the strings of Williams' score swell in such a beautifully harrowing way, as if to hold back tears.As those strings swell, all of these happy and powerful moments of the past 5 movies flash through our minds. Yoda has been with us through it all, all those happy moments and happy times with the characters throughout the saga. The last of all that goodness and joy passes away with him. Luke is left alone, the last hope of what represents that good of the past, and he is left with a difficult task indeed. Those moments where it is just Luke and Artoo alone (before Obi-Wan appears) are so beautiful.On recent viewings these days, that moment when Yoda dies, I always choke up and shed a few tears.Later on we have that quiet private moment between Luke and Leia. Once again this scene is stolen by John Williams' beautiful score ""Luke and Leia"". During this scene, all the puzzle pieces of what has conspired over the past few decades are falling into place for Leia and Luke. This maniacal tyrannt Palpatine has been relentlessly tormenting the Skywalker family for decades, singling them out to subject them to such terrible evil. What have they done to deserve that?Yet another powerful harrowing moment is the finale, where Palpatine has decided he will kill Anakin's son in the most horrific way possible. Hamil's acting range is on display here, as he plys his trade to portray the extreme agony that Luke is in. Iit is difficult for us to watch.Meanwhile Anakin watches on as his son is being tortured to an extremely painful death - still relentlessly loyal after all this time to his friend Palpatine.Loyalty to this madman only led to the death of Anakkin's beloved wife. Now is Anakin just going to stand by while Palpatine murders his child?Then, something happens that the Emperor never predicted.One more lovely moment. At the end of the film, even though the future may be unknown, we are reminded that Luke is not alone as he moves forward into this new future. His mentors, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and now Luke's own father, will always there to guide him. Despite everything's that's going on, Luke's personal growth will always be what is most important for him.--------------For me this is really Hamil's film, with his wonderful portrayal of the boy who has now become a man. Luke is an introvert, intuitive, highly emotionally intelligent, deeply introspective and self-aware, deeply considerate of his friends, and ruthless towards his enemies. When the gang all head off to hang out with the Rebels, Luke goes off by himself, to work on himself as a man with Yoda and Obi-Wan. Luke really has his head screwed on straight. I am hard pressed to think of another hero on film who embodies this archetype so well as Luke and Hamil do in ROTJ.One area where the film is flawed of course is that the final battle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor is pretty rushed, considering so much time and effort throughout the saga went into it's context. Luke's training started late and his training was kind of rushed through. He's probably the one chance Obi-Wan and Yoda have got. Yet Luke is now expected to be powerful enough to defeat both his own father and Palpatine, all alone. More time could have been given to this battle given its weight - and less time to the Ewoks.Thank you very much for taking the time to read.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This One Needs To Be Watched Last...Period,"Among the Star Wars community, the endless argument persists regarding the proper viewing order of all six films. After watching this installment just recently, however, it become very clear to me that ""Return of the Jedi"" needs to be in that sixth slot due to the fact that it provides such a proper ending to the saga.For a basic plot summary, ""Jedi"" focuses on two primary plots: the final ""all in"" battle between the Rebels and the Empire, and the epic confrontation between father (Darth Vader) and son (Luke Skywalker).To be sure, there are some things that this movie struggles at: the Ewok characters are an odd choice, the Rebel battle is utterly predictable, and none of the auxiliary characters get much development. However, the Vader/Luke/Emperor scenes are so emotionally gripping and intense that they more than make up for any lag elsewhere. I consider those scenes to be the best of the entire saga (and that includes the incredible ending of ""Revenge of the Sith""). You will be cheering, crying, thinking, and remembering all in the span of minutes.Thus, I firmly believe that ""Return of the Jedi"" is the film that definitively ends the epic saga. Everything comes together in an emotionally gripping finale that closes out perhaps the most incredible film series ever created. George Lucas makes a few questionable moves here and there, but what he does right far outdoes anything else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

For the most part, it's done well. It's kind of shocking to see just how negatively this and the second in the series were received when they came out, and how much their reputations have improved.

This is not quite Bantha fodder.,"Following on from the freshness of Star Wars (1977) and the all round greatness of craft and story telling that was The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi was always going to struggle in comparison. That's not to say there are not fans who prefer it of the original trilogy, because there are many, and like minded fans of George Lucas' space saga shouldn't have a problem with that.However, it is the weakest of the three. The characters we have come to love, and to be a part of their universe, are performed with gusto - but they are mostly thinly written, reduced to playing second fiddle to special effects, while the dark heart has been replaced with - well - smokey hokey (furry teddy bears with sticks and stones, I ask you). Then there's the lack of sexual tension so evident in the previous two films. Oh we love Han and Leia because that's love! But one can't help missing the sparks that was once between them - and Luke of course, hmm...Yet for all that, of the irks and complaints, Return of the Jedi is still a thrilling film, the budget up on the screen to entertain the children and the adults with the child within. Characters and creatures wander into this wonderful world for super impact. The Emperor, Jabba the scene stealer, Rancor and Sarlaac, while the speeder bike chase, further lightsaber shenanigans and the space battle ensure the action is never far away - even if one can be a little underwhelmed by the big finale not being all it can be.Ultimately it was not without faults, but still it was one hell of a conclusion to a genre defining (then) trilogy. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The most underrated masterpiece of all time,"This is personally my most favorite movie of all time! As a kid, I've always wanted to see Luke defeat Vader in a lightersaber duel. The space battle of Ender was also incredibly amazing. The story is fun, simple and effective. Now that I'm an adult, I now understand this film even more! It teaches us that there's always a chance and a choice for bad people becoming good. This film is about redemption. I could go into more detail about everything I love about this film, but just don't have the energy right now.This is the film that basically made me love Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker has always been my favorite Star Wars hero.

Fantastic conclusion to legendary saga,"Return of the Jedi is so often characterized as the ""weakest"" installment of the Star Wars trilogy that some of the series' finest moments and set pieces are overlooked.  The entire sequence at Jabba the Hutt's palace is a tour-de-force in the grand tradition of pirate adventure films and the resolution of the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker storyline displays some tremendously powerful emotions.  Additionally, one might argue that the climactic light saber battle between Vader and Skywalker is the best duel of the whole series, combining brilliant editing, lighting design, and amazing music cues.  Finally, I can hardly imagine a more exciting cinematic thrill ride than the potent Endor speeder bike chase.  My favorite image, however, is the silhouette of Luke as the smoke from Vader's funeral pyre rises into the night sky.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

All of the StarWars Movies take you away from the troubles!,I only wish I could tell George Lucas how thankful of him that He has made so many movies to THRILL people the way movies were once supposed to be. Movies were made to take people away from there hardships and make them see life in a different way. Not to many out there do that. It's just a shame that the not so well off still have to wait to see it on video or not at all. I save the best Like George Lucas films for the theaters. Some never see his films until there butchered with commercials. I first saw Star Wars in a Drive Inn. I own two different versions now. Keep up the GREAT WORK! George!

"Oh my god, I've gotten older!!","Several months ago, a friend of mine and I sat down and watched the special edition trilogy of Star Wars films. Not surprisingly, the original I still consider to be one of my favorite films of all time... unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Return of the Jedi (although Empire actually seemed a LOT better than I remember).Both of us were shocked at how truly bad a film this is. The blatant catering to kids is just one of the short-comings (albeit probably the most annoying), but the awful acting of Harrison Ford, the terrible dialogue, the poor storyline all add up to a movie which really doesn't stand the test of time and growing up.Does it matter?

Return of the jedi gives us the most spectacular images filmed on a truly epic scale with some classic moments in it. In the end, the series should be watched as a whole though and not as seperate movies but with this cast it couldn't have gone wrong anyway.

Also, a group of freedom fighters (led by Han Solo), try to shut down a power base on the moon Endor that is controling the second Death Star.

A thrillingly titilating ensemble of talent and acting nous,"Jedi is a masterpiece, a far better film than its two weaker predecessors. It contains the greatest action set-pieces ever committed to celluloid. The plotline works not only on the microlevel, but also on the MACROLEVEL. Lucas is undeniably one of the great geniuses/visionaries of this century or any century. This is the film 2001 a space odyssey could have been. It surprises, it delights, it inspires. Highpoints to note: Sarlaac pit rescue (stolen by Hamill , using his thespian talents to give us the most convincing and devastating portrayal of a Jedi to date),the final scenes with Yoda( beautifully directed by Marquand; sensitive yet empowering),the climactic father and son confrontation (I dare anybody to say they didn't feel a chill go down their spine as Vadar hissed the word ` sister? '), Admiral Ackbar's scene-stealing charisma (surely the greatest performance ever given by an amphibian ), but it will surely be the Endor scenes which Lucas will be remembered for !! Who didn't leap out of their seats as the ramshackle collection of ewoks stole victory from the jaws of defeat, dismissing an entire legion of the Emperor's finest imperial troops? Kudos to the underdogs. It warms the heart. These little furry guys deserve their own movie ... Thanks, George. I'll carry them in my heart for...ever. (Sigh)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Underwhelming Conclusion To The Original Trilogy,"When it comes to Star Wars, the original trilogy reigns supreme. That being said, ""Return of the Jedi"" can be seen as an anticlimactic ending to the George Lucas' initial saga. In many ways it still satisfies, but standing next to ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" it also disappoints on a few fronts.First off, the movie's first chapter takes all too long. For the epic conclusion to the story of the Galactic Empire, the movie starts with nearly forty minutes of C-3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca rescuing Han from Jabba the Hut on Tatooine. The sequence is fun, with diverse new aliens all around, but it is utterly belabored.The characters march into Jabba's Palace one by one and purposefully get themselves captured just to escape at the last second. One wonders if an easier, more practical way of saving Han exists. Given that he is an ally of the Rebellion, and Jabba is no more than a desert-planet thug, you'd think a larger crew could just blow their way in-and-out of the Palace rather effortlessly.Anyway, this prolonged heist to rescue a single character - even if that character is Han Solo - feels far too small to kick off the trilogy's finale. It also writes off the underused Boba Fett in the lousiest way possible.Next, Luke heads back to Dagobah to reconnect with Yoda. Here we can rejoice at the return of Frank Oz's iconic puppet. In the brief but powerful sequence, the wise master confirms ""Empire's"" cliffhanging news that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father. At the same time, he also tells Luke that he must confront Vader, lest the Force remain imbalanced. It raises the stakes for Luke, as he now feels an even deeper connection with the villain, but also knows that the fate of the Jedi rest in his ability to overcome him.However, during the same sequence, the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (reprised briefly by Alec Guinness) reveals another piece of the Skywalker family tree that is a bit more... well, uncomfortable. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past thirty-seven years, you probably know what I'm talking about, but I will nevertheless abstain from spoiling for those privileged enough to be watching Star Wars for the first time.Then, there is the matter of the second Death Star and the Ewoks, the former of which feels lazy and the latter renders the film's third act childish. The second Death Star - literally a larger, unfinished version of the first one - just mimics ""A New Hope's"" ultimate threat in place of something more original. Meanwhile, the Ewoks are fluffy teddy bear creatures that save the rebels in their final battle on a woodland moon of the planet Endor. Such primitive creatures holding their ground against the Empire might be inspiring if they weren't so cuddly looking. As it is, the Ewoks render the trilogy's final battle quasi-farcical.The only part of ""Return of the Jedi"" that really feels like a worthy conclusion to what ""A New Hope"" and ""Empire"" set up is the throne room sequence, where Vader brings Luke face-to-face with the tyrannical Empire. Ian McDiarmid's performance as the arch-villain is superb, as his wickedness makes even Vader seem decent. Then, the final light-saber duel between Luke and Vader is epic, filled with all the emotion we'd expect from a father and son battling for their family's fate in the galaxy.Overall, ""Return of the Jedi"" accomplishes in completing the hero's journey. Standing next to its predecessors, though, it cannot help but come off as imperfect. Flawed pacing, an embarrassing family revelation, and those goshdarn Ewoks make it rank rather low in my personal list of Star Wars movies, and definitely at the bottom of the original trilogy.Still, it at least offers sufficient closure for the story of Luke, Leia, Han, and Vader. That alone is no small feat, and I commend George Lucas (along with director Richard Marquand and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) for never compromising these great character's dignities through the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Hey, still one of the best","This one isn't quite as good as Empire, but close.  It shows how cruel Jabba really is, shows Leia in a skimpy outfit and shows the climatic space battle at the end of the movie.  Sure the Ewoks might be cheesy, but go ahead and watch Phantom Menace and tell me who's less annoying - Jar Jar or the Ewoks.Ten out of ten.  I'd give it like a 9.5, but IMDB doesn't get that accurate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Return Of The Jedi,"Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film.Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff.Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring.Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best.5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Awww, those Ewoks are adowable! Now, er, can we get back to Darth Vader, please?","""Star Wars"" brought together elements from various works of art to create an eye-catching, distinctive, and fairly original film which took the world by storm. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" fleshed out the characters, gave us some absolutely terrific action scenes and beyond all that consisted largely of really, really great scenes and moments. ""Return of the Jedi"" was at a disadvantage in following ""The Empire Strikes Back"", not only a great piece of genre fiction, but a genuinely lasting work of art, and one which promised an incredible finale at that.I don't know if ""Return of the Jedi"" could have ever really been absolutely satisfying as the final film in this trilogy, but I certainly hoped that Lucas and Kasdan (who was primarily responsible for the great ""Empire Strikes Back"" writing-wise) would return with something other than thirty minutes of the insanely annoying (seriously, how does anyone like him?) Jabba the Hut, followed by a great action scene in which our heroes escape from him, followed by a seemingly sharp increase in the quality of the film, as the focus shifts back to Luke, his relationship with Darth Vader, Vader's relationship with the Emperor, and further immersion into the ""Star Wars"" mythos.Well, that's wonderful. They've righted their wrongs, the Emperor is creepy, and this is a lot of fun. Right? Ooops. I guess they weren't done with the puppets just yet. But that's quite alright, these muppets are adorable and cute and fun. Okay now. Hmmm, 20 minutes of Ewoks is a bit much, don't you think? Ah, there we go, the focus is now firmly back on Vader, Luke, and the Emperor. Right? Nope. Here come the Ewoks again. More not-so-well-shot action and puppets jumping around making noises. Er, are they ever going to go away? I mean, come on already. Ah, now there's barely any emphasis on them. Wonderful.What? There's barely ten minutes left?! That's it? Oh well, here's the epic final battle. It was great, and a fitting close to the series. The movie's ending is terrific, and fairly touching. Does it excuse the majority of the movie being made up of f***ing puppets making weird noises, and some awful dialogue and acting, not to mention the whole thing being a step down from ""Empire Strikes Back"" technically? Hell no. Does it excuse this script looking like it was written by a 12 year old except for the scenes with Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor? Hell no.Disappointment isn't the word. ""Return of the Jedi"" has a great ending, and a suitably epic final battle, but after two films which built up a great mythology, wonderful story, great characters, and promised a fantastic third film, we get two hours plus of f***king puppets, with a few good scenes here and there. The above barely qualifies as a review, I suppose, but I felt a rant was more suitable. The music's good, I guess.Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh4/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the best but certainly the most enjoyable of the saga.,"For some reason I, out of all the Star Wars movies, always enjoy watching ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"". Perhaps its because of the humor, the action and battle sequences, or the great new characters introduced in the movie, or the fact that everything ties up brilliantly at the ending, or maybe its due to the bright atmosphere of Endor. The real reason is possibly a combination of all those elements, plus some more.""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is a breathtaking action packed and fast paced science-fiction adventure movie. The movie never has a slow or dull moment. Still it also knows how to emote at the right moments. This is necessary because the story of the movie is quite emotional on its own. It's about the redemption of Darth Vader, the temptation of Luke to the Dark Side and about the downfall of the Empire and the Emperor. This are some heavy subjects which are told brilliantly and without ever making the movie go over-the-top.Still perhaps the biggest power of the movie are in its character. The three main heroes, Luke, Leia and Han all get their stuff to do again for the last time. Their characters are so incredibly strong, well written and portrayed by its actors, that all of them have become classics over the years. And not just they, many characters from the Star Wars universe has grown into well known movie characters. I think this says something about the brilliance of the whole Star Wars saga and how it is written and brought to the screen with lots of passion and talent involved, behind and in front of the camera. This movie also introduces some new well known characters, such as Jabba The Hutt, The Emperor (OK he also was in ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" but this time he is fully correctly introduced and used in the movie.), the Ewoks and many more memorable characters.Out of all the Star Wars movie this one is quite possibly the most spectacular, even though ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" comes close. It has many action sequences and the end battle is memorable as well as impressive. It's a three way-battle, where we have Han, Leia, Chewie, 3PO, R2 and the Ewoks fighting the Imperial troops on the forest moon of Endor, we have the Rebel Alliance in space battling the Empire and the Death Star II and we have Luke fighting on the Death Star II against Darth Vader. All three battles are just as important and are given just as many screen time. It makes the final battle sequences something unforgettable and totally awesome to watch. Especially the space battle is without doubt the most spectacular, tense and adrenaline pumping space battle out of movie history. Yes, even after ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"".The special effects for especially the battle sequences look better as ever before. But it are not just the spaceships that are made to look great. Also the sail barge, the Rancor, the battle for Endor with its AT-ST's..it all looks incredibly spectacular and convincing. So are the costumes and make-up. We get to see some crazy looking but oh so cool new characters this time.The whole totally imaginative world, characters and weapons is conceived brilliantly in the movie. Perhaps even better than in any other Star Wars movie. Most credit for this really has to go to George Lucas for creating and realizing all of it. Also an amazing amount of credit has to go to composer John Williams, who helps to make the imaginative world look even more convincing and likable and giving every sequence and character its own feeling and atmosphere through the music.Spectacular, humor filled, imaginative, action packed,...unforgettable.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Superb Anticlimax,"Return Of The Jedi is the sequel to 'Star Wars: A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back', two of the greatest movies ever. Jedi, is also a great film, though is definitely not on a par with the first two installments of the original Star Wars trilogy. The story is still good, and George Lucas' character development is still superb, but Jedi is still slightly 'less good' than episodes IV and V. Maybe its the Ewoks- Lucas' idea of the determination of primitive civilization to topple the mighty empire seems less of a good idea today. Maybe it's the fact that Darth Vader, so anonimously evil in the first two films, is revealed. Maybe it's just the fact that everything fits together seamlessly, and the dawning realisation is that it's all coming to an end. Perhaps the answer is with the force. All that is sure, is that Jedi is a valuable, nay, essential part of anyone's collection, and is still really great- a classic to many- but not AS great as the first two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst Star Wars movie from the original trilogy.,"So... this is what came next to The empire strikes back and is totally disappointing. The movie still has some great scenes, just like final battle with Luke and Darth Vader. Return of the jedi has some stupid scenes, just like the Jabba Hut scene, the chase between Luke, Leia and some weird clones and -of course- the horrible Ewoks. The Ewoks are what makes this film seem less important than The empire strikes back and more stupid. The way Ewoks destroy an entire squadron is just ridiculous. And even more considering that it is at the same time that we see the great battle with Luke. Has some great things, but some others are horrible.

Nice end to the original trilogy.,"Though it is considered by many to be the weakest of the original three (as do I) it is still a very good movie...and a lot better than the first two of the new trilogy.  The best part of this flick is clearly the rescue of Han Solo from Jaba the Hut.  These desert scenes are great and the flick is at its best here.  We also learn of the empire, which is constructing a new Death Star.  Then the movie gets to the weaker part of the film where they go to Endor which just looks like any North American woods rather than any alien world.  And we are introduced to the ewoks who are nowhere near the pain that Jar Jar would later become.  There is also a cool space battle with Lando in command while Han leads a team to destroy a shield generator on the planet.  Luke goes and confronts Vader as well.

"Weak compared to Episode IV, awesome compared to Episode V","Return of the Jedi is superior to The Empire Strikes Back, but is no where near as good as A New Hope.

And the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader was even better than the one in Empire. Even the Ewoks could not ruin this for me.

"A celebration of all things ""Star Wars""","""Return of the Jedi"" loves the Star Wars franchise so much, it even decided to bring the Death Star back for a second go-around. That's how much Episode VI is truly a smörgåsbord of all things Star Wars. We get new spaceships in the rebel fleet, a slew of new and bizarre creature/characters, better special effects and the climax of our hero, Luke Skywalker, on his journey toward his destiny.In the third installment, a new-look demi-jedi Luke and the crew save Han from Jabba the Hutt and then offer their services to the rebellion's plan to stop the construction of the second Death Star. All this time, Luke is aware he will have to confront Darth Vader, his father.Luke's maturity reaches an apex in ""Jedi"" that we got a sense of at the end of ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Only this time, he's not only confident, but got the skills to prove it. He becomes the true hero of the series, taking that cool guy spotlight away from Han Solo entirely. This is a film about him above all else and the way it unfolds does his story justice. The idea that we are to identify and transform as Luke does in the trilogy unfolds beautifully in the final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor.Visually, ""Jedi"" blows away the previous two films. The space scenes in particular are much more stunning. Other than that, there's not much of a difference. ""Jedi"" prides itself on continuing to add to and expand the Star Wars universe as well as your imagination.Whether ""Jedi"" is the best Star Wars film is simply a matter of which part of the saga resonates most with you. A lot of it will depend on your opinion of Ewoks, the fuzzy midget bear creatures that inhabit the moon of Endor. If you find them cute and entertaining, ""Jedi"" is probably your favorite of the saga. If you find them annoying and just a bunch of small, furry jokes for characters, ""Empire"" is probably your favorite film.A lot of it is also about what aspect of Star Wars lore appeals to you. If you're more into the Han and Leia subplot, ""Empire"" is better. If you're about the evolution of Luke and are riveted by his confrontation with the Dark Side, ""Jedi"" is about as good as it gets. Either way, you can't really complain with ""Jedi"" because it offers a lot to be entertained by.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Bears, Snares and the Final Shabang","Your best friend has been frozen in intergalactic concrete, you begin to suspect that girl you really liked and sexual fantasied about might be a relation, the most evil man in the universe has confessed he's your Dad just as you were getting ready to kill him, you've lost a limb and worst of all you're been pressured to take over the family business which would be fine were it not for the fact that this means the enslavement and oppression of the entire galaxy. Yes, Welcome to Return of the Jedi - the episode where Luke starts to dress like a guest at a wake and nearly gets eaten by an unconvincing stop motion animated monster.It all looked very bleak for Luke and company at the end of EMPIRE, and now its looking like game over as the Empire build a second Death Star, a moon sized can of whoop-ass. Return of the Jedi also sees the return of the incredible stupidity with which they quite reasonably had become associated, only this time its the Empire's turn to leave their brains at the door. Hedging his bets in a big way, the Emperor (Ian McDarmid), decides the easiest way to wipe out the rebellion is to tell them where the new Death Star is, how to destroy it and where they can disable its protective shield. The plan hinges on the ability to the Imperial forces to wipe out the rebel fleet. So why is he so confident? A look at history should have given all concerned a bad feeling about this. These are the troops that a hundred strong can't lay a single hit on an untrained boy and a taped down 19 year girl (A New Hope), these are the star-destroyers that can't capture a single ship (Empire Strikes Back) and hang on, aren't these the same Imperial forces that lost the original Death Star to a farmer with a penchant for bombing womprats 'in the caverns back home'? It all looks like a cock up of epic proportions and sure enough it is only this time the Empire is up against forces even more sinister than girls, farmers or old men... Say Hello to the Ewoks - Teddy Bears armed with sticks, rocks and swing ropes. An Empire this damn unprepared doesn't deserve to survive so their end must be a welcome relief for them as well as us. Admiral Needa certainly looks as if hes had enough.Jedi is a feel good conclusion to the original trilogy but isn't as tight as its predecessor. Before we can get into the meat of the plot they're is unresolved business with Jabba the Hut to get through. Thus the first 40 minutes of Jedi looks like an explosion in a puppet factory as Lucas and puppet director Marquand (bullied and undermined throughout apparently) opt for a child friendly environment at the expense of a harder edge, with one eye firmly on the cash tills. Blue Elephants, bletching alien frogs and a horrid creature that laughs like an evil old woman provide the 'menace', while Luke's rendezvous with the Rancor will scare all those who can stop laughing for long enough to watch.Once thats out of the way the story moves to Redeeming Anakin Skywalker/Vader, destroying the Emperor and camping in the forests of Endor. Lucas returns to his favourite theme of the a high tech enemy being overwhelmed and defeated by a low tech, god faring opposition (was he on the American's side in Vietnam I wonder?). Fans looking for the dark character dynamics of the previous episode have to wade through a lot of kiddie friendly cuteoids (its a word now, OK?), almost compensated for by MacDarmid's terrific turn as the Emperor. Vader's redemption seems a bit forced with the benefit of hindsight, taking just an hour of screen time, a bit of amateur reverse psychology from Luke and the sons impending death to reverse years of ingrained evil doing. There are precious new elements to the story too thanks to the decision to stick with the original climax despite it having been already used in Episode IV. So alls well that ends well and its good to know that despite having been complicit in the death of millions and being a right bastard for most of his life, killing the Emperor and saying sorry was all that was needed to join the happy glow-lucky Jedi afterlife.Gives us all new hope doesn't it?*Some notes on the 1997 Special Edition*The pit of carcoon looks a bit like Audrey II from Little shop of Horrors thanks to some ill advised digital additions and the musical number that Lucas thought ""might be funny"" in the middle of a Star Wars film, isn't. We all know what George's sense of humour can produce - the likes of Jar Jar Binks. The nights must fly by in the Lucas household. The extended finale works quite nicely, tieing the film to the prequel trilogy and makes for a more universally satisfactory conclusion. This is one film however that looks set to be in a constant state of revision. At time of writing in 2003 there are reports that Lucas is planning further additions, such as scenes of Padme being pasted in (during the Luke/Leia conversation perhaps?).

"After a darker film in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", George Lucas, perhaps thinking of the commercial return, wanted to make the film more accessible and child-friendly","Three years after the release of the excellent ""The Empire Strikes Back"", George Lucas returns to end his first epic trilogy. At that time several products were created with the characters of the saga were created to satisfy fans in the four corners of the planet. This time he returns as an executive producer and scripts the film alongside Lawrence Kasdan, who had already written the previous film in the series and who also had in his curriculum between the two films, the great Corpos Ardentes (1981) in which he wrote and he directed, in addition to the timeless adventure classic The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) by Steven Spielberg, which he scripted. For direction, Lucas again decided to cast another director to lead the final part of his series. Having directed only short films and TV series and having the only most relevant feature the good O Buraco da Agulha (1981), Richard Marquand is the one who takes on the responsibility of closing the initial trilogy with a flourish. Filming took place between January and March 1982 in England, California and Arizona.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) returned to his home planet, Tatooine, in an attempt to save his friend Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the clutches of the despicable bandit Jabba, the Hut. Luke is still unaware that the Galactic Empire has secretly initiated the construction of a new war space station, more powerful than the first and feared Death Star. When ready, this ultimate weapon will surely mean the end of the small group of rebels struggling to return freedom to the galaxy ... Luke and his friends manage to rescue Solo and escape escapes and, after rescuing Han from the hands of gangster Jabba the Hutt. Luke then returns to finish his training, this time finding Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) on the verge of death. Before he passes away, he confirms that Vader (David Prowse's body and James Earl Jones's voice) is Luke's father and moments later, the spirit of Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) tells Luke that he must face his father in order to become a Jedi Master, ultimately revealing that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is his twin sister. As Emperor Palpatine plans to personally supervise the final stages of its construction, the Rebels initiate a large-scale attack on the Death Star, to prevent its completion and to kill Palpatine, effectively ending the Empire. Luke confronts Vader in the presence of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who expects his son to kill his father and become his new disciple. The boy, on the other hand, struggles to rescue Vader back from the Dark Side of the Force.All the actors and their main characters are once again back to the conclusion of the series. The highlight is given to all, who manage to close the dramatic arc of each of them in a satisfactory way, and this is precisely the great merit of The Return of the Jedi. In fact, the closure is satisfactory, even though it is not daring. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker, Frank Oz, James Earl Jones, David Prowse, Alec Guinness and Billy Dee Williams are back. Even Harrison Ford, who with the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Blade Runner - The Hunter of Androides (1982), was in danger of not returning. Fortunately he can come back and his story with Leia can be finished.Firstly, it is worth noting the inexplicable translation. Translated as ""The Return of the Jedi"", it gives the impression of being someone, a person, and not the group of Knights who maintain peace in the galaxy. ""The Return of the Jedi"" is a great film, but inferior to the previous two. George Lucas chooses to end his saga without daring. Luke and his partners are at the height of the conflict between the two sides of the Force, and the battle of the rebels against the Empire has reached a turning point. After delivering a darker film in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", George Lucas, perhaps thinking of the commercial return, wanted to make the film more accessible and child-friendly. Out of that desire came the Ewoks, small, furry and fluffy creatures. In addition to them, several other passages also denote the greatest insertion of humor in the plot, as in the scene when 3-CPO is declared a deity and refuses to save his friends from the fire, or when the same 3-CPO says to R2D2 that ""no it's time for heroism ""in the battle on the planet of the ewoks. After the darker atmosphere of the previous film, fans expected something along the same lines in ""Return of the Jedi"", but on the other hand, it was the ending, the final chapter of the saga. Perhaps the dark atmosphere of The Empire Strikes Back was not the best way, although the infantilization in several scenes really bothers.The repetition of theme is also another factor to be considered. Again we have the Death Star as a threat. Something even more grandiose could have been conceived by Lucas for the great conclusion long awaited by all. The events of this episode also do not contribute much to the story. A full half hour of the film is lost in rescuing Solo from Jabba's hands. Only then, with this pending ""The Empire Strikes Back"", does the plot begin. And when it starts, we have ewoks that take some of the strength and urgency out of a decisive period of war. For wasting a lot of time, we have a limited expansion of that world, limited to a tropical forest where the Rebels must disable the protective shield of the Death Star and return to the Tatooine desert. On the other hand, the action scenes are all great and very well designed and work well, no matter how much we get the feeling of the battle between the giant machines and the ewoks that use prehistoric bladed weapons to fight the high technology of the Empire. The battle in the middle of the forest took on a more circus-like appearance at times. The mystery of how those beings managed to defeat the modern and powerful weapons of the imperial troops I believe can never be answered. This parallel plot does not have the impact it should. In addition to the scene with the ewoks, we have the other parallel plot that is the attack led by Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), which is practically a copy of the attack on the first Death Star, already seen in ""A New Hope"".But the film is also full of good times, like the third parallel plot of the climax. The crucial moment is at the end of the scene with Luke, the Emperor and Darth Vader on the Death Star. The tension and construction of the entire sequence of scenes is well directed. The Emperor shows Luke his friends being trapped in an ambush to increase his anger, trying to take him to the Dark Side of the Force, leaving the lightsaber at his fingertips. Luke's resistance is put to the test and his and Darh Vader's conflicts are exposed and the atmosphere of tension is growing more and more when the Emperor attacks the young boy. These scenes are the best in the movie.This is where we also have other important scenes, such as the controversial sequence in which Leia appears in a bikini to please Jabba during the rescue of Solo. Even with a more childlike focus, this more ""bold"" scene appears played in context. We also learned in this episode that, Luke was not the only Skywalker still alive. If it wasn't a revelation as bombastic as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", it also ended up surprising everyone.The edition by Sean Barton, Duwayne Dunham and Marcia Lucas again impresses agility with precision and is very competent especially in the scene of high speed chase in the middle of the forest. . Alan Hume's photograph adopts bright colors, reflecting the cheerful and daytime tone of the narrative, in the desert scenes, but maintains the darker and more intimidating atmosphere of the scenes that take place inside the Death Star and also in Jabba's palace, passing the intimidating climate of the two places. The art direction of the duo Fred Hole and James L. Schoppe once again excels, especially in the detailed scenes that take place inside and near the ships, in the scenery of Jabba's palace, in the visual of the various planets that celebrate the defeat of the Empire for the Rebelde group.The effects of ILM are even more incredible, in the visual of each of the beings present, especially those present in Jabba's palace. The evolution for the first film is even greater and even today it does not seem so outdated. The movement of the ships and the effects in the battles are also a spectacle apart.This last part does not have the same impact as the previous two chapters, but it still has some important revelations for the entire series, some striking scenes and ends well, without leaving loose ends one of the biggest and most profitable franchises in the history of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ridiculous,"Even when I saw it in the theaters as a kid, I thought this was a bit silly. Sappy stuff with the Ewoks, overlong, new creatures not that fantastical (Jabba), an emphasis on the chase scene over the dramatic thrust, a bit of self-importance, and a touch of weariness - the actors look tired and bored, as if publicly greating each other is the way to get audience cheers. Carrie Fisher really needs to quit smoking - sounds like they have too many Marlboros on that planet.  Mark Hammill is starting to look, well, not-so-good.  Not bad overall, but a clear sign of decline - not as precipitous as the next installment, but the first crack in the Jedi's armor.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Almost As Good As the Original, Equal to the Second","""Return of the Jedi"" is probably the weakest of the original three installments in George Lucas's series, but that is not to say that it is not still a very good film that more than delivers in the end.  Rebels led by Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Billy Dee Williams now come at the Empire with everything they have.  In the end it will be an all or nothing venture that will forever change the lives of all involved.  All the questions will be answered and all the loose ends will be tied together. Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and his forces will not yield easily though.  The screenplay is focused once again and the direction by Richard Marquand this time is smart and outstanding.  A worthy film to end the original trilogy.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the greatest films.,"Why does hardly anybody like this part of the trilogy? To be true, it's the first one I watched. It's a pity, I know. But I liked the battle scenes on Endor. And I made this film one of my favourites. But there's one thing I never understood. Why is it categorized as Sci-Fi? According to Isaac Asimov, there's two types of Sci Fi. The first one deals with science. And I would say the only real ""Science"" ""Fiction"" movies are Star Trek. And there's a lot of books- Jules Verne, Isaac Asimov himself. It has to do with science. The other type of SF Asimov meant is the one that deals with what could be in the future. There's a lot of these- Total Recall, Terminator, all these. It has nothing to do with science, but with future. But there's no future, there's no science with Star Wars. What is left is Fiction- the best there could be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Perfect Finale of Everything!,"What should I write here?The perfect way to end a trilogy. Or a 6-film story. This is it.

I started with Episode 1 when I was 14-15 and finished with Episode 6 at the same age. I had grown so attached to the characters, especially Anakin's, that the final scenes were beautiful, sad and happy all in the same moment. Several movies have done that to me and one of them is ""Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" (1983).A perfect ending, unique and interesting characters, great battles and although cheezy overall, the Star Wars saga is great and compelling.I recommend it to every teenager and every lover of beautiful cinema.Final score: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best of the Star Wars Trilogy.,"This is Episode VI, the last film of the Star Wars trilogy, and the third one to be filmed. And, it is, I think, the best of the trilogy. Here, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Chewbacca rescue Hans Solo from Jabba the Hutt, and are set to complete their mission of restoring freedom in the Galaxy. Joining them are the little furry friends called the Ewoks. This time, the Emperor himself oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Darth Vader. From there on, it is the fight to be finish, in an epic battle of good vs. evil. What results is another breathtaking action-filled movie, with great direction by Richard Marquand, awesome script by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, superb music score by John Williams and terrific special effects. This film offers hope and rebirth, character development and beautiful sceneries like the galactic city. In addition, there are two spectacular battles: one in the forest and one in the Death Star. Fast-paced and action packed - no boring fillers or sub-plots.This film unlocks mysteries of Luke Skywalker and the truth of Darth Vader. 3PO and R2-D2 are silly, yet courageous as they always get mixed-up in one battle after the next. The dancing scene in the beginning of the film is a treat. Ian McDiarmid star as the Emperor, as he did in the first three Star Wars movies of the trilogy.Overall, this is an awesome film and a great close to this epic trilogy. Not to be missed.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A muddled, but entertaining, trilogy capper","I hadn't seen this movie in a very long time. In fact, as a kid, this was my favorite of the Star Wars movies. It wasn't the Ewoks, but, I think, the whole climax and every other action scene. It is the most actiony of the original trilogy. However, upon my revisit, I find myself with a far more muted reaction, and it kind of makes me sad.The movie has no real dramatic structure. It seems to start in a similar way to The Empire Strikes Back with an extended sequence that feels a bit removed in terms of what will eventually come regarding plot but feeds into it well. However, it doesn't do that much. It does re-introduce us to our characters who have gone through some changes since the last film (Luke, in particular, is a far more confident and adept Force user), and it undoes the ending of Empire by rescuing Han Solo. And yet, once off of Tattoine, the movie just continues as though they hadn't been separated for months, Han has just been through a traumatic experience, and they just killed a major and notorious gangster. There's a disconnect between the first major sequence and the rest of the film that I simply couldn't ignore.The emotional core of the movie, as far as I can tell because nothing else gets nearly this much attention, is the relationship between Luke and Darth Vader. However, it doesn't get mentioned until about forty minutes in, and then it only occasionally pops up through the rest of the film. Almost the entire time on Endor, Luke feels like he's just on the adventure in the same capacity as everyone else until he suddenly decides to break off. Really, the center of my problem is from the moment the heroes land on the forest moon of Endor until Luke hands himself over to Vader. It's a meandering excuse for relatively pointless action sequences and the introduction of the Ewoks, which feels both unnecessary and laborious. The lowest point is when Luke talks to Leia about leaving to meet Vader. The scene is way overly serious and Luke's reveal to Leia and Leia's ""I've always known"" reaction feels like the writing of a pure amateur.The Ewoks get a bad rap because they were created to help George Lucas make more money from toy sales, and that's completely true. It wouldn't be hard at all to rewrite all of the Endor sequence, excluding the Ewoks entirely, and it still works mechanically. As it is, the rebels feel incompetent because they land somewhere and then seem to get immediately lost on their way to their target and need the help of the local teddy bears. And, yeah, the image of the teddy bears taking down an Imperial garrison never quite rises out of silliness. The most embarrassing bit, though, is what becomes of Han Solo. He's gone from rogue who shoots first to pining over a woman's kindness to another man, ready to simply step aside and not fight for the woman he loves. He's become pathetic.And yet, there is still quite a bit to like. When we are dealing with Luke's conflict between Vader and the Emperor, it's handled quite well. It's not perfect and could use a lot more screen time, but it works. The special effects are easily the best of the series. There are individual sequences that, when taken out of context, have appeal. The opening sequence around rescuing Han from Jabba makes a really good Star Wars short film with lower, but more emotionally meaningful, stakes and ends with a great action sequence. And the final battle (controlling for the Ewok silliness variable) is huge, complex, and really quite exciting.Suddenly looking back at the trilogy at this point in my life, I've begun to wonder if Lawrence Kasdan was the great creative force that I thought he was. Yes, he wrote Empire, but he also wrote this. Maybe it was Gary Kurtz, who quit the franchise after Empire, who was pulling it all together, and Marcia Lucas, who divorced Lucas during Return, who cut it into the right form. Losing those two gave us a purer George Lucas, unfiltered by people who had greater understandings of how storytelling actually works.Oh well, it's a bit of a downer to revisit a childhood favorite and discover it's not as good as it was when I was a kid, but it happens.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent Story; Loved the Characters and Special Effects.,"WARNING: MANY SPOILERS AHEAD!After ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" this is my favorite Star Wars movie. None of the prequels can compare to this gem, arguably the weakest of the original Star Wars movies. The plot's okay: the heroes rescue Han Solo from the evil Jabba the Hutt, then go on to destroy the Death Star's deflector shield on the wooded planet of Endor, simultaneous with an attack on the Imperial ships orbiting the planet. Luke Skywalker must confront his father, attempting to bring him back to the Light Side while also dealing with the Evil Emperor, who covets young Skywalker's power and wants to train him to be a Sith Lord, like his father. All in all, the movie ties up loose ends nicely, although any viewers may think the heroes have incredible advantages that couldn't possibly work. Lighten up, it's a science fiction fantasy adventure! Good wins, case closed.I enjoyed the sets, filming locations, and characters much more than the story. One of my favorite scenes is when the heroes are in Jabba the Hutt's castle, surrounded by an odd assortment of life forms and monsters. Jabba himself has become an indelible science fiction icon, though not as much as Darth Vader. I personally loved the PUPPETS and stop motion effects MUCH, MUCH more than the computer generated imagery in the prequels. The monster Luke has to face in Jabba's pit is beautifully ugly, and is a stop motion masterpiece worthy of Ray Harryhausen's accolades (this creature---or something very similar to it---would be reincarnated as a threat to Beldar in ""Coneheads""). I also liked the much hated Ewoks. Yes, they're cuddly teddy bears, yuk! But I liked George Lucas's attempts to bring primitive hunter-gatherer cultures into the sci-fi mix and include them as heroes. The sets were fantastic, like Jabba's creepy castle and the Ewok village high in the trees. Lucas chose lovely settings for this movie, from the sand dunes east of California's Imperial Valley and Anza Borrego Desert, to the redwood forests of northern California. It's a way of translating our real world into that of fantasy.Oh yes, the guys will watch for Princess Leia in that metal bikini while she's a captive of Jabba. Today, I'll bet Carrie Fisher is more remembered as Leia wearing that then for the spiral buns and white robe of the original film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite Star Wars movie,"Even though The Empire Strikes Back was the better constructed film, THIS is the one I love the most. Why? Well, let's just get the nitpicks out of the way.Ewoks. They are cute... and somehow serve a purpose, but my GOD how I wish they were Wookies or something. That said, I didn't find them INSULTING and though it lacked a bit of maturity, there is still a strong message of science vs nature, wood trampling steel.Bike chase. Though pointless, still really cool and maybe that's the best word to describe this movie, ""cool."" I would have liked it so the last words were Luke saying ""May the force be with you."" in the final scene but I think that's an idea that came too late (though I wouldn't mind Hamill or a Hamill sound alike adding in that last line).And... Actually, that's it in terms of nitpicks.It might not be as strong as a film overall compared to Empire, but it has the most powerful moments. Leia and Han reuniting and professing their love (in a very unique way I might add), the whole Jabba scene somehow never overstayed its welcome despite being too long, it was still well paced, designed and acted... And of course, Leia's slave outfit, enough said.Luke finally understanding his family was a real thought provoker and believing that his father might still have good in him is beyond inspiring. Then there were the show stealing supporting characters, like Jabba the Hutt, Mon Mothma, Wedge Antilles, pretty much all of the Imperial Officers and of course, Admiral Ackbar! The face that launched 1,000 memes. The late Erik Baursfeld gave a magnificent performance as this galactic fish, you somehow felt he had a history, that he knew what he was doing and that nothing would shake him (except for one moment which ANYONE can understand) and his rich, gravelly voice was just perfect for him! Then, there was the Emperor... Oh GOD! He looked like something out of a horror movie! That deep, crackling voice and his presence is just HELLISH! Yes there were times when he was a bit ""goofy"" but it worked in a way that just makes you uncomfortable. just when he first meets Luke and says ""You no longer need those""-it is just UNSETTLING! Ian McDiarmid played the role perfectly.On that note, Return of the Jedi perhaps has the best acting in all of the Star Wars films. THIS is the one where Hamill deserved an Oscar nod at the very least, just the final moments alone where we explored Luke's rage, then his conviction, it's just a marvel to watch. James Earl Jones' voice performance made Vader very three dimensional here, this is the movie where we started to understand Vader more and perhaps even feel sorry for him as well as completely fear him, it leaves you vexed in the right way. Frank Oz as Yoda... What more do I need to say? he was splendid, thought provoking and heart breaking.Ford and Fisher were splendid as always. Williams especially showed more depth as Lando Calrissian in this film, showing his sense of honor and faith in his friends despite going through the worst of it.Which brings me to the last part: The action. All the fighting that happened with Jabba was practically perfect, though I do wish Luke used the force more often in the rancor fight but that's more than made up with one big thing: The battle of Endor! It is easily still the greatest battle in all of Star Wars and perhaps in the running for the best in all of Sci Fi. The space battle was constantly thrilling, you felt like you were there. The battle on the ground was equally as exhilarating, even scary at times (even with the Ewoks) and easily the best looking saber fight in the original trilogy. Though the drama lasted longer in Empire, this is the where it looks like they are trying to strike each other rather than simply tap swords. The other reason why this action is so amazing, besides the amazing visuals and choreography is that the emotions all match perfectly! You can feel Lando's frustration during the battle, you can feel Han's desperation mixing with his confidence in his abilities, you can see Leia's courage and pain, then of course... Luke's inner struggle. Even the side characters and extras, all of it is on par with the leads! That's what makes Return of the Jedi so great: The problems aren't that big of an issue because everything else is so good, even perfect in some spots. The ending is very fitting, especially the 1997 edition extension (not the DVD version, that was an insult to Sebastian Shaw).Obviously this gets 10 stars from me. It is my favorite Star Wars movie for a good reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best of the series,"Yes, I freely admit that I consider this the grand champion of the series. ""A New Hope"" was pretty good and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was good but not great. For my money, ""Return of the Jedi"" is the one to beat.The plot ties up all the stories and loose ends that we've seen develop and also provides the best ending in any of these six films. The others either ended on an overblown note or a bittersweet one. ""Jedi"" has a nice, subtle happy ending. The story this time is that the Death Star II is nearing completion which leads to a final showdown between the Empire and the Rebels. While all this is going on, Luke becomes determined to redeem the soul of his father-Darth Vader.The performers are simply terrific. Mark Hamill does a great job (probably his best on-camera performance) Carrie Fisher turns in another great job as the beautiful yet spunky Princess Leia and Harrison Ford, although somewhat superfluous to the main story, turns in another first rate job.The veteran actors- Alec Guinness, Sebastian Shaw and Ian McDiarmid- are all perfect although I consider Shaw to be the stand-out. Last but not least, Frank Oz as Yoda who goes out with one of the best death scenes ever.With a few exceptions (the Ewoks, the slave girl outfit) this is a fantastic film with great characters, slick special effects and a touching story.

The speeder bike sequences are terrific action and the space battle is great. The allure of the dark side is powerfully shown. The only drawback are the Ewoks. They simply look too much like teddy bears and speaks to Lucas' need to play to the kids. Some at-st destruction seems too unlikely. It's like a kid imagining fun silly ways to destroy his toy at-st. Those are minor problems. As for the Special Edition changes, most are fine and unnecessary. There is one glaring, horrifying change. The song and dance at Jabba the Hutt's palace is undeniably bad.

Weakest of the original trilogy: still enthralling,"Return of the Jedi has a number of difficult responsibilities. It has to wrap up what was, at the time, the most impressive trilogy of films in the history of cinema. It had to follow Empire Strikes Back. All loose ends had to be tied, and be a cathartic conclusion. What's impressive is that it handles such mammoth tasks admirably, and is for the most part let down only by odd choices and vast ambition.Picking up following the uniquely dark ending of Empire, Return of the Jedi is split into two parts: first, the quest to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt; the second to stop the Galatic Empire plot to build a second Death Star. The latter part simultaneously shows the rebels fighting to destroy the death star and Luke's confrontation with the dark side of the force.One can immediately say that Return of the Jedi is an ambitious conclusion. The sheer amount of minor characters across the film develop a much larger world. Even minor additions such as the extra red cloaked guards that accompany the Emperor add depth and world building. Scenes are larger and bolder. The many areas, ships and buildings of Jabba's 'base' show a sense of scale more clearly than the tricks of size that Empire (and to a lesser extent, New Hope) used. Consequently however, the use of effects has to be increased, and in a way that hasn't stood the test of time as well as the earlier two films. 'Green screen' type scenes are somewhat more noticeable, though they in no way detract from the experience.What certainly does work is the cathartic finale. While making the film the lightest of the trilogy was disjointing after the darker-style Empire, it certainly allowed the conclusion it has. Jubilation doesn't feel out of place. As an aside on 'out of place', one can single out the Ewoks, who -just about- work because of this. And so the general arc, beginning in Episode IV, is satisfying and more impressively works, where so many successful trilogies fall at the later hurdles (Matrix being the most glaring, but also The Godfather, Pirates of the Caribbean).It's instead the choices that are made elsewhere that are at fault. The most glaring is the 'recycled' death-star idea; the twists in that story don't take away from a lazy feeling. But its more the quasi-retconning (if not factually, emotionally so) that seems odd. The 'sister' revelation seems (and considering the changes from the original drafts, is) out of place. Luke's sudden mastery of the force and his Jedi powers are unexplained, if necessary. The decision to sideline Vader, and make the Emperor the main antagonist, is questionable (though brave) considering how strong Vader's presence has been throughout the earlier two films. The Emperor exudes evil, but without the backstory of Vader appears merely two-dimensional. That's not to fault Ian McDiarmid, who commands the screen.The most problematic part is the decision to have Lando being the only known character to fight in the dogfight against the Death Star. Already the most minor of the primary characters, it lacks the emotional weight of the original Death Star run. This, and the incongruity between the lighthearted Endor section and the darker Jedi element, mean the final climax is a bumpy ride of frustrating editing.The film is rightly regarded as the 'weakest' of a successful trilogy, but what exactly does that mean? It's not as much of a criticism as it seems- this is no Godfather Part III. It simply doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. Which was not an easy task in the first place. It may not end on the peak, but it ends on a high note.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the greatest endings in movie history!,"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, more commonly known as just Return of the Jedi, is the third and final installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, and the sixth Star Wars in chronological order. This film is a definite showcase of how the third film in a trilogy should be, it maintains all of the things that made the original two so amazing while adding more on and ending with a very satisfying conclusion. As always the acting, special effects, directing, editing, production design, etc., it's just all top notch, easy to say it is a well made film. There really isn't anything bad to say about this one, everything is just perfect like the other two in the original trilogy. A new addition to the Star Wars universe is the teddy bear-like creatures known as Ewoks, they add some great comedy and in the end help deliver a great message.

A Rare thing of a sequel being as good as the prequels.,"I have been a Star Wars fan for about 6 years now and no saga has ever been as great as the Star Wars saga. Everything is good about this movie, from meeting Jabba for the first time {Although I meet him for the first time in Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope Special Edition}, to the speeder bike chase on the forest moon of Endor. The only complaint that I don't like about this movie is the small teddy bear-like bears called the Ewoks. Now most people thought that this movie was a disappointment because of them, but I think there not that much of a burden, it's just a not so great idea from writer George Lucas.One thing that is an interesting fact is that Mark Hamil, the guy who played Luke Skywalker, did all of his stunts in this movie, unlike most movie stars. And speaking of acting, one other interesting thing is that the droid R2-D2, a small robot like creature who's about 3'8 inches, is actually played by an actor! I always thought that R2-D2 was done by mechanics or something and was controlled by a remote control, like those racing cars that you see being advertised on T.V.With the exception of the Ewoks, I truly believe that this movie is the greatest and it truly is a must own for any avid Sci-fi fan. There will probably never be a Saga quite like Star Wars. Thanks a billion George Lucas!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure nostalgia,"I'm sure anyone who's been a fan of these movies has (by now) been brow-beaten with the imperfections of ""Return of the Jedi"" in pop culture; another Death Star, the story doesn't even get going until half an hour in, just a bunch of Muppets, Ford and Fisher going through the motions, Ewoks. And you can't escape the Lucasfilm merchandising muscle when watching this.But for me, this just taps right into those days before I was cognizant of most of these complaints. That's right, back when I was a kid. I can't tell you how big a jolt I still get when Luke ignites that green saber (man, that sound!), and to see him stroll onto the screen in full Jedi Knight regalia and badass calm is always a treat. And ILM is at the top of their game here; the attack on the Death Star (which is a really cool image in its unfinished state) and space battle trumps everything Lucas did in the prequels. The Speeder Bike chase, the Endor atmosphere, this had such a cool look to a lot of it.""Jedi"" doesn't reach the adult heights of ""Empire"" or the classical thrills of ""Star Wars"", but its power lies in its ability to timelessly transport me back to being a kid. There's no pretense here.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force Has Left The Building,"Does anyone ever watch this movie pure, without any preconceptions? Without seeing the earlier films; without having some degree of personal investment in the ""Star Wars"" franchise of movies, books, videogames, and the rest; without having some knee-jerk reaction of contempt about those fuzzy Ewoks?I doubt it. I know I didn't, when ""Return Of The Jedi"" was released in theaters in the spring of 1983. By then, I had watched ""Star Wars"" on videocassette many times. I fantasized about how I wanted the story to end, who would end up with whom, what would become of the droids, and who got to kill Darth. I wondered if the filmmakers would forget about that guy Wedge that was flying Rebel craft in both the first two movies, figuring they would.I guess I left the theater feeling impressed and disappointed. Impressed because the film played with my expectations some, and managed to bring the story to a satisfactory close. Disappointed because it wasn't more than just satisfactory after all the imaginative aspirations I had invested in the film going in, that the ending felt too neat by half, and that I wouldn't be seeing any more of the characters who pulled me into the world of ""Star Wars"" nearly six years before.Watching ""Return Of The Jedi"" again reminds me of the title of the Robert Graves memoir, ""Goodbye To All That."" It's a sloppy piece of work when seen with adult eyes, horribly acted by performers who seemed to have lost interest in the franchise that made them stars. The story has none of the sweep of the first two installments, that sense of a band of outlaws riding through the night of space one step ahead of Imperial predators; it's all formal with lots of talking-head scenes. Director George Lucas seems to be carried away by his desire to connect every character through some familial bond, but his new role as an epic-ologist leaves little room for the entertainer I enjoyed. And yes, I STILL hate those Ewoks.Goofy dialogue, too: ""Soon I will be dead, and you with me."" I mean, rilly...But you know what? ""Return Of The Jedi"" is not a bad film. It's actually pretty good. It is entertaining, throws all the fans their bones (like Wedge for me), wraps the series up on an up-note after the downer that was ""Empire Strikes Back,"" and manages to have its share of funny moments. I love the scenes of Darth Vader hotfooting the construction process of the new Death Star with some of his subtle pricking: ""Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them."" Leia in that slave outfit is a hottie highpoint, and the final attack on the Death Star is still an apex of special effects work.Even those Ewoks. Still worse than Stalin with herpes, don't get me wrong, but they do make a nice point about technological progress not being everything. If cute was so bad, why aren't more fans up in arms about the constant presence of R2-D2? It's funny to read that Lucas was stuck for ideas for the first half of the movie. Definitely it's underdeveloped, with various heroes popping up here and there, but the battle around the Sarlacc pit is a terrific thrill-fest, with a line by Lando (""Hey, wait, I thought you were blind!"") that still kills me after more than 20 years. Jabba is the one cool new character in this film, a slimy blend of menace and humor. I kind of wanted the rest of the film to keep going like that, but Luke had to seek out his Jedi destiny and break up the team once again.The changes Lucas made to the later editions of the film seem improvements to me, taking out lousy music and bad special effects. Too bad he couldn't do anything about the acting.There's a lot of things that bother me about ""Return Of The Jedi,"" but at least it answered the questions I had and sent the series out on a happy note. Now if only I could pretend he never went back to the well and did those prequels...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Highly Underrated Star Wars film,"I don't understand why when I ask people to rank their favorite Star Wars films, this one is constantly at the bottom? Is it because of the Ewoks?

A Bitter Disappointment,"I have always been sad that the Trilogy ended with such a weak effort. There are so many things wrong with Jedi symbolically, story-wise and even from a design point of view that I could write a book. All those die-hards (and believe me, I am included in that category in every respect except for this deviation) who proclaim this to be equal or better to the other two are only kidding themselves.

"Garbage, the beginning of the end of Star Wars films","What I can say about this film, is that it is truly a work of garbage and sh*t all balled up into one. George Lucas gave the audience a peek of what was to come in his future Star Wars films. Poor action, script, annoying characters, such as the ewoks. The Jar Jar Binks of the early 80's, and total boredom. Such as the prequels bring to us today. What's good about this film... nothing. Lucas lost his magic, excuse me, luck in the seventies after The Empire Strikes Back which was made in 1979. I can't believe those Star Wars idioits worship this muck. A truly awful film of any kind. It's sad that all the hype that surrounds Star Wars, out of all five films that were made, only the first two films of '77 and '80 are the only ones that are worth watching. ROTJ is a film that begs the question, ""What the hell were they thinking?"" * out of ****.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The final battle for the freedom of the galaxy!,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is an amazing movie filled with action, humor, and romance. The acting is great and the music is phenomenal. Well, seeing how John Williams wrote the score it is guaranteed to be good. John Williams is an award winning composer and created the score for other famous movies like Jurassic Park, Super Man, Jaws, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, and Indiana Jones. If you want to sample his music you can listen to a compilation by Moosebutter called Star Wars on Youtube. Return of the Jedi is the best Star Wars movie. There are furry creatures called Ewoks that are funny and adorable. There are intense lightsaber duels. There is a major plot twist that will blow your mind. If you like good movies I know that you will like this movie. I have no idea why you wouldn't like Return of the Jedi! The one reason you may not enjoy this movie is because it is a Sci-Fi movie, but it isn't like your typical sci-fi movie with killer aliens trying to take over the world. It is about freedom from an overpowering galactic empire and man's struggle with good versus evil. The movie has a great storyline with good acting and pretty cool special effects.Richard Marquard was an excellent director and guided the actors expertly. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher were perfect actors to play their characters. James Earl Jones displayed his unique talents and became an icon as the voice of the dark sith lord Darth Vader. Everyone should see this movie because it is a great source of entertainment, it has many Wilhelm screams which are my favorite, and the plot and acting are fantastic. Star Wars 6 is a movie with epic space battles and insane lightsaber duels that you will be thinking about for a long time. After you watch Return of the Jedi you should expect to want to watch all of the other movies in the series. I promise that if you watch this movie you will love it and become a crazy superfan who wears Star Wars swag at every opportunity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good movie, but...","I love the entire original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and I grew up watching them. And as a child I did like the ewoks a lot. But now having grown up I find it way too much that the military-trained forces of the Galactic Empire were bested by the primitive ewoks.The whole segment with Tattooine and the events with and around Jabba the Hutt were great. Although I always found Boba Fett's fate to be very anti-climatic.Story-wise then ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is good fun and wholesome entertaining. The love romance between Han Solo and Leia Organa comes to a good conclusion, and Luke Skywalker's journey to become a jedi knight also holds some good events and surprises.The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" did great jobs, as they had been doing since episode IV.""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" has lots of great creature designs, vehicles, spaceships, characters and atmosphere. All in the spirit of the ""Star Wars"" universe.I am rating ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" nine out of ten stars, since the ewoks (despite their cuddly cuteness) does bring something silly and childish to the movie. And the movie had fared better without the teddybears.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great ending to a great trilogy,"This film was amazing and great end to a great trilogy. It made some of the choice that I didn't like in empire strike (expect for Darth Vader telling Luke he is his father) seem tiny. The first half the movie was alright very much guilty pleasure of the trilogy. Only one scene i cringed was the leia slave scenes with her underwear they just went a little too far. It could have made leia look like a damsel in distress or just not a confident person but nope they make her fight even more than begore which is good. But other than that, just was alright guilty pleasure. The rest of this film was so amazing that the first half looked okay but just okay. For example, the space battle was so good that just made me feel good and joyful and then rebels one it was an awesome still though, cool looking at the empire with awesome vehicles and ships and all. Also, the lightsaber battle was so great just felt like you were on your edge of the seat though I already have seen the movie it was still great seeing Vader turning after Luke finally understand why the Sith sometimes win. That the sith are not about love or compassion but evil selfish and angry and so gives vader an opportunity to finally defeat darth sidious once and for all ever since the beginning and really at exegol in the comics but with compassion more so than mercy. I also love the emperor in this and how ruthless he was and of course we know the next part of the story for him, but in the meantime, he will be shaking his fist at the skywalker family like Stalin in the real world. I loved the Ewoks just so cute and cuddly lol they are so cool hope we learn a lot more in canon. I loved everything at the end especially seeing the other planets the vader funerial and the force. Just a great end to part of the story but we have last part which will make this very interesting lol. Overall, i loved this film expect the leia slave scene that was cringe but over than that I loved the movie.And overall, the ot is an amazing classic trilogy it had a down but other than that i loved especially the Ewoks and hot battle and endor battle, expect maybe for the Leia slave scene that was cringe lol. Honestly it might be a little to hyped up but ither than that it still amazing classic which is Star Wars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Saga Ends...Until The Sequel Trilogy!,"Episode VI is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke(Mark Hamill) rescuing both Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all...For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'.

"Duh...I am George Lucas, I am in control of Never Never Land","Return of the Jedi is a serious twisting pain after the highlight, both in storytelling and power, of Empire Strikes Back.  Lucas thinks he knows so much about such topics as military tactics, politics, religion, and so on, but he is no more than a teenager with an overactive imagination.  He doesn't understand these concepts unlike more mature filmmakers like Oliver Stone and Ridley Scott.  Lucas' head is so far in Never Never Land that reality, even in his Star Wars universe, becomes something he constantly changes the rules to fit his needs.  He isn't a smart creator.  James Cameron was the same way with The Abyss, but that product was ten times better than this.  Both of them have their naive fantasy traits locked in this series, but Cameron has gone to the modified Heavy Metal routine.First of all RotJ tries to go in an Indiana Jones-style of film akin to the original Star Wars (""comic book hedonism"" as Pauline Kael called it) and dumps any true emotional power for merchandising and dollar power.  How else to you explain the ewoks and plethora of new characters and hardware?Secondly, Lucas hires a sap to direct.  Obviously this was so he could keep pulling the directorial strings while remaining ""creator"", ""writer"", and ""producer"".  I am sorry for the production.  The visuals are uninspired and ineffective this time around and Jabba the Hutt is as threatening as colon cancer.Overall, the weakest link in the original trilogy, the ball only falls harder from here on.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It's hard to know where one stands on this film...,"Back in 1983, Star Wars was the hottest thing that had come out of Hollywood. Ever. Children were lining up in droves to get their hands on the toys (which were actually well-made in those days) and adults were either lining up with the children, or buying tickets to see the film. Repeatedly.Sadly, it didn't take film studios long to realise after this film had finished its theatrical run that merchandising, not ticket sales, was where the real money could be made. This fact is quite wittily referenced in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs, but today, we have really bad films with childish merchandising like Harry Potty, or really great films on which some mediocre merchandising is based, such as The Lord Of The Rings. Or really mediocre films on which good merchandising is based, such as Tomb Raider.After The Empire Strikes Back was mostly done without George Lucas' creative input, he threw a tantrum and basically promised the world that he'd never let go of creative control again. A real tragedy, I am sure you'll agree. While Lucas was still vaguely aware of his creative deficiencies, and he hived off the direction and writing tasks, he just had to slip more merchandising tie-ins for the benefit of the audience, and his wallet.Most of these merchandising tie-ins weren't too bad, however. The Ewoks made for good symbolism, with an evil, technologically advanced empire being defeated by midget teddy bears who have only the forces of nature (and the Rebellion) on their side. The creatures in Jabba's palace were an example of Lucas at his most outrageous, but the Special Edition of 1997 turned them into a farce. However, what I really craved at the time, and I still do, is a proper scale replica of the Super Star Destroyer. Sure, the cost would have been horrendous, but it would be worth it.The conclusion of the whole Skywalker saga is surprisingly effective, if a little sappy in places. The motivations and the acting are done well, but some of the dialogue is utterly appalling. Half the time, I didn't know whether there was going to be a lightsaber battle or a Blues-Brothers style Christian revival meeting. All they needed was for James Brown to come out from behind the Emperor's throne and all would be lost in a sea of madness.One area where the Special Edition is an improvement, however, is the celebration scenes after the end of the battle. With the Emperor dead and the entire galaxy liberated, the original theatrical release just got plain silly. Many overzealous fans have claimed that the lyrics of the original finale music translate into something like ""Have some droppings, bad actors, but please pull the burrs out of my butt fur"". Seeing the revelry in all the places we've visited in the previous two films, as well as Coruscant, makes for a far more satisfying conclusion by comparison.Okay, it's not a perfect film, but at least in 1983, George didn't insist on complete control over the films, and that is exactly where the new episodes are going wrong. Sure, the special effects are a thousand times better and the lightsaber duels make those of the earlier three films look like old men hitting each other with their canes by comparison, but at least they managed to make us care about the characters in this effort.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A slightly different beast to the first 2 films, but just as good in my opinion","After being captured by Jabba The Hut, Han Solo has now been frozen and is a trophy that is purely there for Jabba The Hut's amusement. Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance must first set out to rescue Han Solo from Jabba The Hut's clutches before they embark on their ultimate mission; to destroy the second death star that the Empire has built....One thing you have to know going into this 3rd film from the original trilogy is that it does have a slightly different feel to it than the first 2 films; for a start it isn't as dark as its predecessors and it's evident throughout that director Richard Marquand has applied a more comical approach to the material. This won't sit well with all fans, but for me I actually thought it worked really well and made a 2 hour film pass by fairly quickly. If I was to be super-critical I would probably say that The Empire Strikes Back judged the balance between humour and serious plotting to better effect, but Return Of The Jedi clearly deliberately used a different approach (which was risky, but for me was a risk that paid off).The cast are on good form again, but here they get to have a bit more fun and send themselves up a bit more; Chewy's 'stomach' as it were getting them into trouble and the idea of the Ewok's worshipping C3PO as a god was also an amusing touch.Comical elements aside Return Of The Jedi still plays out more or less the same way as its predecessors resulting in it still being equally as enjoyable.

"Better than the first, not as amazing as the second.","Return of the Jedi is a step down from The Empire Strikes Back, but still a huge upgrade from A New Hope. (Anyone else notice a pattern here? Lucas directed A New Hope, but not the other two? Curious)First of all, let's just get the annoying characters out of the way once and for all. R2D2's constant beeps and whirs got on my nerves. Chewbacca is still pretty annoying. C3PO? Annoying, but at least far less than The Empire Strikes Back. Perhaps the most annoying one, though, was Jabba the Hutt. I mean, his disgusting physical appearance was bad enough, but the fact that he spoke nothing but ""Huttese""? The inability to interpret his speech really got on my nerves. Lucas should've been more careful as to what characters spoke plain old English.The acting was superb! James Earl Jones has this really neat, powerful, and consistent voice. The trio of Hamill-Ford-Fisher was splendid as always. But one of the film's highlights was the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). He is more powerful and more menacing than even Darth Vader, and McDiarmid absolutely eats up the screen every moment! His creepy laughs, enjoying his sadistic form of torture, were as bone-chilling as Dath Vader's constant heavy breathing.The action scenes were epic. They were much better directed than the original (the same pattern here curious), more thrilling, easier to follow in many ways.John Williams' music is absolutely amazing. The guy is a genius.

Lazy,"As a kid ROTJ was my favourite SW film because of the special effects. However, as an adult, I see ROTJ as the weakest of all 5 films. Shock! Horror! Yes, even worse than The Phantom Menace. Why? Let me explain...ROTJ is lazy script-writing and feels uninspired and really doesn't compare well to the other films. Although TPM seems very shallow, it does have very dark undertones and almost every scene is setting up or heralding the themes and ideas to be explored later in the series. Whereas ROTJ is just a video game, with the exception of the Vader/Luke confrontation.However, I'm by no means saying this is a bad film. The end space battle is mind-blowing and the redemption of Vader is probably the highlight of the entire series. The trouble is, The Empire Strikes Back was character driven and the characters seemed real, but in Jedi they revert to the comic book caricatures that they were in A New Hope. In other words, ROTJ was a step backwards in character development. For example, in the previous film, Lando betrayed Han and condemned him to what could have been an eternity in carbonite. It would have been nice for Han to at least say to Lando ""Hey buddy, thanks for rescuing me."" But no. Perhaps spending all that time in deep freeze scrambles your memory. Seriously though, it would have added a much needed depth to these 2 characters which is severely lacking in this film.And as for the Ewoks...well, they're not as bad as Gungans. In fact. I've got a lot of respect for any teddy bear that stands up to a stormtrooper.Score 2/5",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A little disappointing,"After watching Star Wars for the first time, I'm a little disappointed with this ending to the trilogy. The first 30ish minutes was a terrible watch with Jabba the Hutt. It's really just a gross feeling and un-entertaining part of the film. The rest doesn't feel so original or different enough from the first two movies. The Emperor was also a let down. It would've been a lot cooler to just have Darth Vader be the sole villain. But I do understand that they wanted to show Vader's sense of vulnerability throughout the movies in the sense that he wasn't the dominating force. And the whole trying to get Luke to turn to the dark side was very forced and could've been more developed.However, I'm still satisfied with the overall ending. The Ewoks were also adorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars movies are crap,"I'm sitting with my 11 year old daughter and 5 yr. old son watching what they were sure was the mother of all Star Wars movies based on the hype of the most recent installment of the Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith. Once again I am appalled that this movie was made and worse, made money.Don't get me wrong, I loved the first Star Wars and respect it for the tour De force it was for the genre. Unfortunately, the rest are rubbish. The problem (and there are many), is that Muppets belong in Manhattan and not in a galaxy far far away.Jabba may work. His minions are crap. His pet, the worst. The guards look like rejects from The Dark Crystal. Most of these creatures should have surely bought the farm a millennium ago according to Darwin's theory. The acting during these scenes is so bad it makes soaps look like Shakespeare.Ewoks are the undying joke of this movie. The costumes are total crap. I would definitely not put ""Ewok costume designer"" on my resume. Their movement is that of midgets in furry costumes (political incorrectness intended) with casts on both legs. Darwin would have been out there clubbing Ewoks himself so as to not embarrass his natural selection theory. Again the acting in these scenes is terrible. Only Chewbacca has any credible acting in this portion of the movie.The rest of the film plays out as a regular B movie. Even the latest installments, with all of the latest special effects, are sabotaged by the stupidest characters (JarJar Binks) and terrible acting (Samuel L. Jackson, et Al), a running curse for these movies.Some say I'm over critical. I don't believe this. I am however, a stickler for details. A great movie, The Hunt for Red October, was ruined for me when the Russian under sea map had English in parenthesis, under the Cyrillic, cow towing to what the producers must feel are the more feeble minded viewers. If the actors say they are heading towards such and such a place, why wouldn't I assume that when they point to the map, in Russian or not, that this is not what they are talking about? I just think it's sad that I have to recommend Star Trek, Next Generation and the Aliens trilogy as the better examples of science fiction to my kids.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The good guy wears black,"Men in Black don't have anything on the man in black... Luke Skywalker.Why this movie doesn't have a higher rating, I don't know. Maybe it's because of the ewoks (that's why my mother doesn't like it as much). I say: those ewoks had very little to do with the creative genius of this movie.It was a masterpiece. It all came together perfectly and seamlessly. It even started off terrificly with Luke Skywalker showing off his full fledged Jedi skills. There is action, humor, action, honor, and more action... and the special effects... whew, light years ahead of its time. We were treated with two epic battles: the inter-galactic battle between the federation and the rebel forces, and the smaller but equally important battle between Luke and the Emperor, Luke and his father, and Luke and the Dark Side. Luke was in a perilous struggle internally with his feelings. You could see as he was slowly being poisoned with anger, concern, and perhaps a bit of fear. The Emperor had a very grand plan in mind for Luke and the rebel forces. That plan was all coming to fruition except for the will power and intelligence of Luke and Han Solo.As a child ""Return of the Jedi"" was my absolute favorite bar none. Well, Since childhood ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has toppled it. I'm a little older now and being more knowledgeable, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a bit more intellectually appealing. Even still, ""Return of the Jedi"" ranks extremely high with me and always will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the first Star Wars trilogy,I personally feel this was the best Star Wars of the original trilogy. It had great action and CGI. The performances of the cast were great. The story was amazing. Definitely a great end to this trilogy.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"While not quite as strong as the last two films, Return of the Jedi is still a great end to the trilogy after 40 years","After the events of the Empire Strikes Back, Luke, Leia and the others attempt to free Han Solo from his frozen carbonite state while dealing with Jabba the Hut. Also, they would befriend the Ewok tribe on Endor in their final battle against the Empire. Meanwhile, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine create the second Death Star in their attempt to triumph over the Rebel Alliance, leaving Luke in a struggle to free his father from the Dark Side.When I was a kid, I remember watching the movie on a rental video tape a couple of times and it had me engaged. As a young adult, this is still a great movie. Yes, it does lack the spark that made A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back perfect, but it's a great ending to the trilogy.The story is very good and it wraps up the loose ends that were established in The Empire Strikes Back and provides an emotional resonance and pathos. As for the Ewoks themselves, I've learned that many people didn't like them as much. For me, I didn't actually mind them at all. They were a great addition to the movie as they represent Nature triumphing over Technology (the Empire) which was very interesting. Not to mention it resolves the conflict between Luke and Darth Vader, his father due to a scene before their final lightsaber duel against each other that Luke tries to see the good in him. As the other characters, they're still likeable and also fleshed out. Especially Han Solo, who volunteers in the Rebel Alliance which shows that he has progressed in his character development after what happened in the previous film as did Leia who allies with the others in their final battle against the Empire.Everything else is great. The cinematography is well crafted, the action sequences are stellar with the Battle of Endor and the final lightsaber duel being the highlights, the acting from everyone involved is great with Mark Hamill and James Earl Jones being the best while Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still providing some good chemistry. Even John Williams' music still soars as it retains the cues from the previous two while balancing them with the new themes.Overall, Return of the Jedi may not have the spark that A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back had, but it's a great conclusion to the trilogy after 40 years of it's release. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Conclusion to the Original Trilogy.,"Return of the Jedi is a great conclusion to the original Star Wars Trilogy. It ties up all the loose ends and also has a lot of memorable outstanding moments.Luke and Leia travel to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, where he is still trapped in carbonite. The Emperor meanwhile is overseeing the construction of a larger and more powerful Death Star. Also he is planning on assisting Darth Vader in turning Luke over to the dark side of the force.The characters are great once again. Luke is great as a true Jedi Knight and really has matured greatly over the films. Leia continues to be a strong female character which pleases feminists all over the world. Solo comes full circle and truly is helping the rebel alliance as well as others and learns to care for others instead of just for himself. Vader also gets to develop more of a good side as he talks with Luke.Once again there are a lot of great new characters as well. Jabba the Hutt appears for the first time. Huge, disgusting, and vile, he really is one of the most memorable characters from Star Wars. Overall I think Jabba may be the most disgusting character from a film and makes for a unique style of villain.The Emperor makes his first physical appearance in a film in this film. (Empire Strikes Back he is in but just as a hologram so this is his first real appearance.) As a bad guy he is legendary. Completely obsessed with the dark side of the force, there is nothing good about him. You do not get characters more evil than this.There are a lot of great scenes in this film. Like the entire sarlacc pit scene, Luke's battle with the Rancor, the speeder bike scene, and tons of other scenes. The effects in this film are great for the time it was made.One complaint though. THe Ewoks show up for the first time. While I think that the one Ewok, Wicket, is cool, I really can not stand the rest of the clan. THey are just little furry bears that I think do not fit in the film. The entire idea of them being able to hold their own against the Empire's troops may seem like a good message of determination and courage, but I think it is a joke. I could have gone without the Ewoks, they make it seem too childish.I do not want to say too much about this film, it is great though. Not as good as The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion but easily the second best from the original trilogy and one that I highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A great movie one of the best trilogy ending...,"I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The worst original episode,"The final episode starts with the most hilarious sequence of events you could come up with for a Star Wars movie. It's unnecessarily long, awkward, strange, convoluted and just ridiculous. It then continues on in this spirit, killing off interesting characters like they were nothing, showing off Luke's acquired strength at every turn (he's indestructible, but still seems like a clumsy kid), but that isn't to say this movie is bad. It's just not as good as the other entries in the franchise. What saves it is the storyline leading up to the final scene with Darth Vader, which is incredible. The rest of the movie isn't. The Ewoks especially are terrible. Not only do they look like puppets, they feel completely out of place. It's the only Star Wars movie during which you're taken completely out of the immersion by the movie itself, and it does this repeatedly, only to be saved at the last moment. Storm troopers are a joke.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Maybe it is not as good as it's predecessors but it's still a great film that gives a satisfying ending to the trilogy,"Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi is the third movie in the original trilogy.The film was not as good as it's predecessor but it's still an amazing film that gave a satisfying conclusion to one of the best trilogies of cinema's history.The characters in the film are damaged by the events of the previous film and are changed by them.So the characters are developed and emotionally complex. The protagonists that we know and love are also dealing with new problems and the antagonist is more lovable and three dimensional than before.The tone is lighter than the previous film,the plot has some problems (there is a big subplot about the second Death Star that is similar to the first Star Wars film) and it doesn't take risks so it feels less mature but it is still very enjoyable.It goes without saying that the practical effects are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.The performances are good especially by Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones(fun fact: besides doing the voice for Darth Vader in all of the three films he was only credited in Return of the Jedi)In a nutshell,Return of the Jedi is a great film(rated #75 best film of all time by IMDb) with great characters,amazing visuals,incredible music and unforgivable moments that gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy despite being the worst in it(I don't say that it is a bad film I just say that it is not as good as the other two films in the trilogy).If you haven't seen it you really should but I am sure that you saw it a billion times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Of The Trilogy!,"Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi is the best one of the trilogy. George Lucas had a good idea to make a third movie.  The Return of the Jedi has great action.  The first two were good, but the third was the best because the special effects had developed more.  Another reason is a lot of information was released in Return of the Jedi.  You got to learn that Luke and Leia were brother and sister and you learned that Darth Vader was Luke's father. When the special edition started to come out I thought that maybe A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back would be better, but then Return of the Jedi came out and it still reigned as the best star wars movie yet.  Now in a week Episode I: The Phantom Menace is coming out I think that might knock Return of the Jedi out of the number 1 slot for best star wars movie. There is one thing that Return of the Jedi will remain as in my opinion and that is best of the original star wars movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Most overrated franchise in the history of mankind,"If I were to review the entire Star Wars series as a whole I'd say it's the most overrated movie franchise to ever be put on the big screen. Yes the two original movies were awesome but that's where it stops. The rest of them ranges from mediocre to straight up horrible, yet it's selling tickets and merchandise like never before. People are still lining up whenever there's a new Star Wars movie on the horizon despite the fact that the last decent Star Wars movie released over 40 years ago.. Some people just never learn. As for this movie in specific, it falls under ""Mediocre"". It was nowhere near as good as it's predecessors and the only reason it's rated 8.3 is because of biased fanboys with clouded judgement. It had great music and cool visual effects but that's about it for the positives, same thing goes with any Star Wars movie made after this one.

The Movie that nobody wanted to see end,"But I guess it had to. That final scene between Vader and Luke is the most touching scene ever and the saddest for me it's worse than seeing Old Yeller get shot or watching Bambi's Mom buy the farm when I was a youngster. I guess the point was that no matter how evil or unscrupulous a person is they can always be saved if not in this world then the next. The Emperor is so unfathomably twisted it's sick he's worse than the Wicked Witch of the West, the Evil Stepmother, and that kid from the Omen all rolled into one. But damn he's so cool. I guess that's why he's in every Star Wars movie except ""A New Hope"". Lucas probably had a field day dreaming him up. I still can't understand why he didn't make the top ten villain list he deserves a spot no doubt about it in my mind. Maybe since the last three they will realize they have made a mistake and put him in. He's a really good actor probably the most talented of the bunch.

There's a poetic symmetry to the way Jedi reflects the familiar plot points of its 1977 beginnings, giving us a clear look at how much our heroes and villains have grown and developed over the saga and showing us how much has changed in three short adventures; and culminating in a finale often imitated but never replicated in the annals of cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is where it started to go downhill,"The first disappointing entry in the series (if you take the order in which they were released). The rescue sequence at the beginning is drawn out far too long and the second you think about it, it's utterly absurd. And then the movie slows to a complete crawl, with very little in the way of action, and the most awful and obvious merchandise placement. This is the downward slide from a Fantasy Fiction (note not Science Fiction... Star Wars has absolutely no science in it) that adults could just about admit to liking... to something that would barely be green-lit as a children's movie today. The ending cranks up the action a bit, but it's all so poorly choreographed (more obvious on repeated viewings). Oh and the acting... and the dialogue. Pure cheese... and not in a good way.

Today's movies, including the Disney sequel trilogy, spend time building and subverting expectations and avoid entertaining, making you not care about the people in the movie, and trying to add too many twists and turns and surprises that are annoying and unnecessary. This movie had some surprises that add to the story but don't distract or take away from the story that came before.

'Return of the Jedi' is a Disappointment Compared to Its Predecessors but It is Still a Solid Movie,"This was everyone's favorite as a kid but for me I never clicked with this film until I was older. ROTJ had always been a mixed bag for me up till recent years where I actually paid attention to the deeper story at hand. The storyline between Luke and Vader is so profound and so powerful that it's conclusion will stand to the rest of time. The low points in this film for me is everything surrounding that plot line. Jabba's Palace is way too long, almost like a short film as the beginning of this film. The Ewoks subplot slows the pacing of the movie but the space battle is highly entertaining.
Overall, this is no 'Empire Strikes Back' nor 'A New Hope', it is a great solid conclusion even if it can be messy throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fitting end to a great saga,"Jedi is considered by hard core fans to be the weak link.  I don't think so. It's exciting, it's never dull and it neatly takes care of all the loose ends that Empire gave us.  The movie starts off by showing the new Death Star and a very serious Darth Vader.  Then it's off to Tattooine where Luke and company escape from Jabba the Hutt in a great light saber/blaster shoot out.  Yoda confirms Luke's fears and Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must confront Darth Vader.  The speeder bike chase, the blooming relationship between Han and Leia and that forest battle!  Wow!  But the main crux of the film is between Luke and Vader, and The Emperor.  The duel between Luke and Vader is spectacular, and when Luke loses it after Vader goads him into it is just amazing.  In defeating Vader, Luke stands to become him.  Vader turning on his Emperor is outstanding.  The force theme swells on the soundtrack and the Emperor is tossed down to the bowls of the Death Star. Quite a comeback for someone who was pure evil in the last two films.  Throw in one hell of a space battle and you've got yourself a film that will entertain you and blow your socks off.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Four bananas make a bunch and so do many more""","I never bought into the Star Wars hype machine so didn't see this until the 1997 revamp. I remember warning some ardent fans back in '83 that it wouldn't take too long for the much vaunted special effects to wear thin and start curling at the edges, to be met with almost universal scoffing. I felt vindicated when looking at it again to discover thanks to cgi cartoonery it's become almost laughably ludicrous, or it would be if the story wasn't so dull.Not freedom fighters/terrorists up against the Empire/baddies yet again, pulleez – or as C3PO says Here we go again. The four heroes Hans, Leia, Luke and Chewbacca are off again in their corny quest for victory against the Dark Side. There's an interminable affray with Jabba, space dogfights, cute Gummi Bears on parade, bits that make the old UK TV advert for Smash mash look stylish, I was even fondly recalling Za Za the cat out of Hector's House too. Shame they couldn't have got Stevie Nicks out of Fleetwood Mac to take over the part of Leia from the cardboard stereotype on view, but with cgi anything is still possible! It all looks and feels so olde and tired that I wonder how jaded and faded the original version is now, but maybe many millions of people would lose part of their childhood if they did see it. This is now a monument to Revision, Lucas altered the look of the original work of Art to extend the life of the franchise. After all, even the great painters did it! But why not have done with it and run the revised opening credits to the Muppet Show or maybe more aptly the glorious Banana Splits TV show theme? There's some good imagery, pitifully few though eg Vader meeting the Emperor with a starry backdrop, some good slapstick eg dopey Chewy inadvertently entrapping them all in the Care Bear net - or should that be Snare Bears?At the time of the original hullabaloo it was generally considered the weakest link of the three movies, the rose-tinted spectacles used by an ageing generation who saw it when they were children have imbued it by now with a mystical worthiness that really is unwarranted. I understand and appreciate the power of viewing favourably as an adult the precious things of youth, but it never blinds me as to the real worth of the aforementioned precious things in the manner Star Wars does with its fanbase. And I see yet again just how inspirational and memorable Star Trek TOS was. It's merely OK as a time passer and much better than catching a cold; sadly I saw it too late to think it great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fitting end to the original trilogy,"After ""The Empire Strikes Back"" Lucas & company concluded the ""Star Wars"" saga with ""Return of the Jedi"". The film picks up where the last one left off, with the gang descending upon Jabba the Hutt's palace to rescue Han. Of course, there's also the Empire to contend with, including Luke's father, Darth Vader.The cast is virtually unchanged from the previous film and the characters had been quite refined by this point. Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter for ""The Empire Strikes Back"", returns here and brings Lucas's story to life with more of the same energy and humour. While some may consider the Ewoks to be a little too kiddie-oriented I don't see them as being particularly out of place.Richard Marquand took over the directing duties this time around and turned in a workmanlike effort that's not particularly worth remarking upon. Once again the special effects won a special achievement award from the Academy. Obviously, the effects are no longer as impressive as they once were but they haven't aged badly either.John Williams provided the score once again and was again rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Also, like its predecessors, the film features Oscar-nominated sound courtesy of Ben Burtt and his crew.In the end, the film provides a satisfying conclusion to the ""Star Wars"" saga. However, for most people it's their least favourite of the trilogy and I'm inclined to agree. Nevertheless, the film does contain elements that strengthen the quality of the trilogy when viewed as a whole.By the way, I strongly recommend that you watch the original version instead of the 1997 or 2004 'Special Editions'. Casual fans may not care much but those who grew up with the films may find some of Lucas's 'improvements' questionable, to say the least.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More of show than soul.,"The third film of the series unfortunately had less magic in it when compared to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. For instance, there was an obvious drop on both character expression and development along with a huge increase of special effects. The film was more of show than soul most of the time. However, I could not think of a better way for the story to go and maintain the soul The Empire Strikes Back formulated before this film. George Lucas did his best and I accept that. Among the best things I liked here was the Emperor's presence (he is VERY evil), Darth Vader presence until the end, the Ewoks and the special effects. Return of the Jedi's a great film overall, though a step lower from Empire.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I'm Sorry, What?","The rise of this movie on the top 250 - and the praise it receives - is as baffling to me as anything.While Star Wars (1977) is overrated in my view, it is still nonetheless a good film. This movie, on the other hand, is little more than mediocre. The first 35 minutes is spent on a drawn out rescue mission that is stretched to the point of tedium and has maybe 3 interesting or noteworthy moments. That's an entire third of the movie wasted on something that should've taken half the time. How anyone can call the opening of 'Revenge of the Sith' too long while defending this is anyone's guess.After that, we get some truly cringe dialogue and character interactions that make no sense. The one that hits you in the face like a sledgehammer is the relationship between Lando and Han Solo. Like, okay, I could understand Han forgiving Lando for what happened in episode 5, but for God's sake *actually include the forgiveness scene.* Han doesn't even seem to care that Lando was the reason why HE WAS TORTURED. They become instant best buddies chumming it up out of nowhere. It's like he's saying ""Hey man, I know you screwed us over and almost got us all killed before, but oh well boys will be boys amirite?""As for the climax, the space battle is pretty good, and the scenes between Vader, Luke, and the Emperor are the best parts of the movie by far. The fight against the Empire on Endor, on the other hand, is bloody awful. There are exactly 0 stakes in anything, and we essentially get a pack of teddy bears beating up the empire by throwing rocks. There's no tension, and the ""struggle to win"" is played as a joke.How is this the 80th best movie ever made? I bet you there are 10 thousand better films than this one (at least!)
It seems as though only episode 5 actually deserves the praise it gets - that movie is legitimately great. The rest of the original trilogy falls well short of the God-tier quality people attribute to it - and episode 6 is the worst offender by far. It seems like this movie is playing with house money; and not in any positive way where the story takes some risks. Instead, it feels as though not enough effort is put into this, and very poor writing choices are made with far too much confidence. This is a movie that doesn't attempt to hide its flaws, they are all out in the open and blatant - as if the bad writing was intentional.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Who could've come up with  a better ending?,"This is the MOST character driven film of the Star Wars saga. George said he wanted an emotional ending between Luke and his father and with the Emperor in the mix that is exactly what we got.The beginning of the film and another reviewer said serves mainly to reunite the main characters and tie up any loose ands regarding Jabba the Hutt and Han's 'previous' life. The tension really starts building up in the 2nd half of return of the Jedi and its completely unmissable! The effects are still stunning and hold up today. The simultaneous three way battle at the end (Luke/Lando/Han and Leia) is brilliantly done. The cutting between scenes is very appropriately done to alleviate and create tension at the right times making the ending that much more dramatic. Now as for the ewoks..some people don't seem to understand they are for comic relief...the battle between Luke/Vader/Emperor is so tense our poor little nerves can't take it and we NEED the comic relief provided by some of the scenes in that battle. And the fact that primitive simplistic ewoks defeat the technological over complicated Empire is very appropriate: reason overcomes technology...a statement on 20th century life.Back to the lightsabre battle. The action isn't as fast or breath taking even as in the Empire Strikes back. But that is good because it doesn't take focus away from the emotional centre of the story. That scene in the Death Srat is more, talking, goading and tension, rather than action which is appropriate. The Emperor's death is poetic justice at its most subliminal. How can anyone not grin as he falls down the shaft...well either grin or just reel back in shock that Ani has FINALLY done it...fulfilled the prophecy. This is why the links with the prequel trilogy are important. When Vader dies and we see him burning on the funeral pyre it is sombre yet surprisingly not too sad. This is because it fits; he is at peace and has come to his natural end. It was similar with Padme's death in Return of the Sith; she had had enough of life, she died at peace knowing she had brought new life into the galaxy and that there was good left in Anakin; for this reason her death was more sombre than sad per se. It is fitting that the deaths of Anakin and Padme are thus juxtaposed and linked.The ending...what is it but happy...the happiest and most uplifting of all the Star Wars films. It is really a complete and finished ending to a magnificent saga of films. I get choked up every time I see it. Reliving the many previous hours of emotions and what the Star Wars galaxy and I have gone through to get to that point.Absolutely brilliant sum it up?

Third rather than last...,"Ok. So this is the worst of the first SW Trilogy. It is the SW Trilogy we're talking about. Third is no disgrace. Having said that, it is some way behind the other two and the weak links are easy to pinpoint - Dance number in Jabba's palace, Ewoks and the repeat of the Death Star plot from Episode IV. But there are still so many more good points - The final confrontation between Luke and Vader while the Emperor looks on, the superb space battle scenes and the continuing revelations within the Skywalker family - these are all essential aspects of the SW mythology. Lucas' films were alays intended as adventures for children of all ages but to go from the dark, brooding (more adult?) second installment to this cuddly tale takes some getting used to. In the context of the trilogy it is an essential if weaker episode, while viewed on its own it is an epic, space adventure with few rivals.

No more Ewoks please.,"Return of the Jedi, episode six of the Star Wars universe, starts off where it means to push on. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is prisoner to Jabba the Hutt, so Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and friends (R2-D2, C3P0, Leia) set out to rescue him. After a successful mission, Han and Leia lead a band of Rebels to the moon of Endor where the second Death Star is being protected by a force field, whilst Luke tries to bring Darth Vader back from the dark side of the force. The long awaited last film of the Star Wars universe ends well but falters slightly on the way. Strong detail and a quick drive pushes the plot forward, hitting a bump when the Ewoks make their appearance. Han and Leia's mission's halted by the furry little creatures, spoiling what we want to see with what George Lucas wants us to see. The humans' story is sacrificed by the Ewok's screen time. At least a spectacular big space battle and Luke's personal endeavor compensates for the events on Endor. One small blip won't trouble the fans too much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"He did return, but he left behind all the wonder and entertainment, in short, almost all that was good in the others","I'm not sure where it went wrong. Maybe Lucas just did not feel right about the middle one being dark, so he made this all warm and fuzzy. I didn't care for it, myself. Going by that this is about ten times further down the #250 list than the first two, I'm probably not alone in finding this a letdown. Of course, if the tone was all it was, this could still be great... but, alas, in neither case is that true. Marquand presumably also deserves portions of the blame. I don't know if he just can't do action, I haven't seen anything else by him. This just never actually engages, it certainly didn't, me. The light-saber stuff somehow never goes beyond ""dull"" and ""flat"". I know that it should, but it doesn't. The universe... honestly isn't that heavily expanded in this. A handful of new creatures, several of which are at least one of the following... irritating, more or less poorly realized visually and too cute. Designs aren't that imaginative, for a few. Places and ideas are revisited and redone. The sound comes off as not very unique. The score is still magnificent. Situations tend to be silly, their solutions, as well as how they come about. There are points of this where it seems like George forgot he wasn't writing a script for Indiana Jones. The effects don't particularly get better from the preceding entries(though, admittedly, some do). The pacing is reasonable, the film runs fairly smoothly. This doesn't have memorable or quotable lines. There is little of interest in the characters and their development is basically all in episodes IV and V. The DVD has a commentary track and it's worth a listen. I recommend this only to those who really must watch all of the Original Trilogy. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A weak film - very disappointing,"I am baffled by the high ratings this film has received. It is actually quite weak, suffering from poor directing, a weak script with stupid (not corny) dialog and improbable situations. Enter the Ewoks, and the whole series ends in a blaze Toys-R-Us glory. The only story line of interest is the one pitting Luke against his father, but unfortunately Mark Hamill is not up to the task. The script calls for him to mourn the loss of Yoda, appeal to a (supposedly) conflicted Vader, fearlessly face the Emporer, be the matured, slightly aloof Jedi to his swashbuckling Solo and Calrisian, but until the very end, when Hamill finally pulls out all the stops, it is simply difficult to accept him as a mature jedi knight. The final fight between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is well-staged and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, one must traverse a lot of goofy material to get there, beginning with Jabba the Hut, who is wonderfully realized but his den of thieves and vagrants comes across more as a children's version of Ali Baba. The standout performance is Dave Prowse/James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, while Carrie Fisher is obviously looking forward to wrapping the series and getting on with her career, as it were. But enough. This film does not warrant deep analysis. A disappointing ending to what could have been one of the most compelling film series in historic.

"A good movie, not one of the best ever made, but still Star Wars....","A New Hope blew audiences away with original special effects and story telling.  The Empire Strikes Back blew audiences away again for doing the same thing at a superior level.  Return of the Jedi has come around to tie up all the loose ends the first two movies made.  The story, although similar to A New Hope, is not recycled.  The special effects are even better than Empire and they are the peak of that time.  The acting has stayed at the same level as Empire, which both are better than A New Hope.The acting in Return of the Jedi is about the same as Empire.  There aren't any real new changes except that Han Solo's character gets a bit softer as he realizes he does not need his gruff exterior among friends that love him. We also finally find out which side Lando is on.  However, the best addition and the best actor in Return of the Jedi is Ian McDiarmid, who plays the Emperor (aka Senator Palpatine, Darth Sidious).The story, while some say it is recycled from A New Hope (which it definitely is not), ties up loose ends.  The second Death Star is merely a backdrop for the main story of Vader and Luke.  In any case, the Death Star was already being built after the first one was destroyed, as a plan of the Emperors to destroy the Rebellion.  We get to see Luke, Chewie, Lando, and Leia go after Han Solo to rescue him.  Jabba the Hutt is wiped from the Universe, and they meet...the Ewoks....  I think the best plot in Jedi is the one with Luke, Vader, and the Emperor.  Luke tries to turn his father from the Dark Side and resist temptation from the Emperor.  It is the heart of the movie.Now, the Ewoks.  Like Jar-Jar, they have a hate cult.  Why?  I have never understood how people can have such a childish hate over fictional creatures.  They serve the purpose of the story.  The main reason is that the Ewoks overcoming the Empire's vast technology stretched believability. Maybe so, but hey, this is a sci-fi fantasy.  It was more fun to watch the Ewoks beat the crap out of the Stormtroopers.  Also, the Ewoks overcoming the Stormtroopers is more metaphorical.  Lucas always has a part in the Star Wars movies where technology fails, and it is up to the human (or alien) spirit to finish the job, not the technology (i.e., Luke when he destroyed the Death Star without a computer...).The ending of Jedi is the most rewarding of the trilogy, with a powerful and slam-bang ending to the best movie saga of all time.  Darth Vader becomes Anakin again, coming to his son's aid and destroying the Emperor, sacrificing his own life in the process.  There is just something rewarding seeing Anakin glimmer in the Force next to Yoda and Obi-Wan.  In all this is a good movie.  It is not the best Star Wars movie, but it is still Star Wars.  It still adds to the mythology, and therefore is a classic, Ewoks or no Ewoks.  However, I think the Jedi soundtrack is the best of the saga, so check it out.  See the whole trilogy! ***** stars (out of *****)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A solid, but flawed conclusion!","The original STAR WARS wraps up with thrills, excitement but some disappointment as well. Like the epic sequels of THE GODFATHER and THE DARK KNIGHT trilogies, the original STAR WARS has one of the greatest in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.

"The worst of the six, and especially disappointing after Empire","After The Empire Strikes Back, which built masterfully on the success of the first Star Wars film -- deepening characters, fleshing out the universe in grand and dramatic space-opera fashion, and adding more ambitious themes about the true nature of heroism -- Return is a significant letdown.On the plus side: it has some enjoyable action sequences and fun special effects. Also, particularly with some brief scenes added at the end after the prequels were made, it manages to do a respectable job of drawing the narrative threads to a close.On the minus side: the Jabba the Hutt episode at the beginning is overstuffed with wacky creatures that are not as interesting as the filmmakers seem to think, and is simply not compelling enough to justify all the space it takes up. (Princess Leia's infamous slave girl costume during these sequences, however, does get the fan-boy seal of approval.) The principle aliens that show up later on are too cutesy to take seriously, especially when they suddenly 'get religion' at a critical point in the narrative. Perhaps most disappointing, the beginnings of a deeper and more challenging characterization of Luke from Empire seem to have been largely abandoned in favor of rather slapdash moral drama. When the forces of evil try to trap Luke in an emotional vice near the end of the film, they are so heavy-handed and obvious about it that it's quite hard to take them as seriously as the logic of the story seems to demand. (I have a similar problem with Darth Vader's conversion to the Dark Side in Revenge of the Sith, although that film has a far more convincing tone overall.)If you're just in it for the gosh-wow, and love the wacky critters, you'll probably enjoy it. It does also feature the Millennium Falcon, which has to count for something.But, yes, in case you are wondering, I find even The Phantom Menace to be a significantly deeper, more compelling, and overall much more enjoyable science fantasy film experience. Give me Jar-Jar over Ewoks (they were supposed to be Wookies, dang it!) any day of the week. Besides, Menace has Qui-Gon, the most spectacularly pointless fusion power plant in the history of cinema (or whatever it is -- but notice how similar it looks to the interiors of the Death Star and to the underbelly of the Cloud City, also settings for crucial light-saber duels; I believe Lucas has dreams of this place), and an evil emperor (to be) who is a convincingly diabolical threat to everything good in the universe.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great Finale to the Trilogy,"In 1977, a movie came out that blew our mind...In 1980, a sequel was furthered our mind and how we looked at things...And in 1983, it ended...In its 6 years and 3 years of the original trilogy of Star Wars, it had attracted a fan base unseen by any movie of that time, it had shown people just how clever and well written Sci-Fi could be, instead of the weird, half finished stuff made before 1977, but most of all, it had so much to it that you could watch it multiple times and never get bored of it.In this film, we see the rebellion try to attack the seemingly defenseless second death star, and Darth Vadar trys to turn Luke to the dark side.The film was not as well written as the first 2, but it had the magic of the first 2.

Best of the entire series,"I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983),"I've finally come to the finale of the original trilogy, and although I still can't say I'm a huge fan of the franchise, I've really enjoyed all three of the original Star Wars films, even if there are glaring flaws that no one seems to talk about. Of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi definitely has the most noticeable problems, but it does end the series in a suitably ambitious and entertaining fashion. In Return of the Jedi, the Galactic Empire is building a second Death Star to finally destroy the Rebel Alliance, and Emperor Palpatine is personally overseeing the project. The Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack onto the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker attempts to bring Darth Vader out of the Dark Side of the Force. The action scenes in Episode VI are a bit more inconsistent than in the other movies, but I have to mention the speeder bike chase scenes. It's without a doubt my favorite scene in the series so far because it's so fast-paced, well shot and intense. It was definitely the highlight of the movie. One of the weaker action scenes was a bizarre set piece with the Ewoks. The entire scene was just awkward; I find it hard to believe that a primitive race of small hairy creatures armed with sticks could defeat the Imperial stormtroopers. Return of the Jedi also didn't improve on the cheesy father-son plot from The Empire Strikes Back. Watching Luke pitifully try to convince Darth Vader to step away from the Dark Side was groan-inducing. Nevertheless, the strengths of the Star Wars series are still on full display here. The utter imagination and detail put into the universe is incredible, and the film is just as exciting as its predecessors. Return of the Jedi isn't as competent as the previous films, but it is a satisfying and sporadically rousing conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Good, the Bad and the Totally Unnecessary","This, the first film ever to use Lucasfilm's now pervasive THX sound technology, is both a seasoned movie and a fresh one, not only as the one 1997 Special Edition that I did not see theatrically and recently saw (!) but also as the initial film. It ends the chronicles of the pivotal human characters in the series, mainly Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. It brings back other characters who seem either more or less than human, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, and the darling robots C-3PO and R2-D2. I wonder how fascinating it would've been for Chewy, 3PO and R2 to have arcs the way the humans did. After all, humans seem to be the minority in this galaxy: In this sixth and consummate episode in the Star Wars saga, we meet various inimitable characters, including the implacable Jabba the Hutt, who is like a goiter that was possessed with a life of its own and grew and took control as an evil leader of other strange beasts; the adorable, fuzzy Ewoks, the mammalian aborigines of the forest moon of Endor; a terrifying desert monster made of sand and teeth, and obnoxious little rodent creatures that hasten across the corners of the frame. And there is an admiral for the Alliance who's like a sapient dinosaur who began a career as a general and statesman. These are the most intriguing characters, to me, anyway, which is never more apparent to me in the original trilogy than in Jedi, with its overtly trite soap opera passages between Han, Luke and Leia that resemble General Hospital more than anything else.Regardless, one thing this film and its two predecessors never do is blow much time on establishing first acquaintances. Unlike countless visual effects and monster movies, where new creatures are introduced with elaborate entrance moments, each of these films immerses its alien creatures into the heart of the action right away. That's possibly why the film has such visual ebullience. Jabba's throne room, for instance, is peopled with countless oddball creatures, some of them just half-gleaned in the periphery of frame. The camera in this massive soap opera coasts nonchalantly past organisms that would supply the highlight for other movies.There's a whirlwind chase through a forest, aboard airborne motorcycles. After many of the bad guys have run into trees and gotten pulverized, you find yourself wondering why they couldn't have just flown above the treetops, but never mind, it wouldn't have been as much fun that way. You could probably guess that my favorite Star Wars film is Empire based on what I name as my favorite sequence, where Jabba and the bounty hunters take our heroes into the desert on his hover-barge to be fed to that terrifying sand and teeth monster, because I find great inherent tension in any scene where the characters are hovering above a depression in desert sand inhabited by this creature, in whose belly ""you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."" The director is Richard Marquand, whose previous film was the wonderful dramatic thriller Eye of the Needle which, aside from mainly being a great character-driven performance piece, evinced his deft hand for suspense.Now that I've discussed the initial film, I will close by discussing the Special Edition, the turning of a 134-minute movie into a 135-minute movie by means of a solid minute of garbage. I'm speaking mainly of two features that likely aren't news to anyone reading, the first being the awful dance sequence in Jabba's throne room early on. I cannot comprehend why one would wedge in a set piece that drags the pace and provides brainless shots of aliens doing modern pop dances. Maybe I'm a purist, but a film that was an unheard-of spectacle fresh to the technological vanguard in 1983 should not delude itself with modern-day trivialities. The second objectionable annex is the ridiculous Hayden Christensen superimposition in place of the original elder Anakin Skywalker's spirit. Why in hell would Luke see a vision of his father that he never knew? Other than that Lucas wanted to merge the external chronology of a series of films spanning several decades, it has no other purpose but to annoy me personally. My own little opinion of Lucas' career and what he's done to and for the film industry could be boiled down to this: Just because you opened the door for the next generation of filmmakers doesn't mean you have to hinge your career on opening more doors, because some or most or all of those doors will be Pandora's boxes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I know people thought the Ewoks were all cute and everything but come on folks!! I know its just science fiction but there still has to be a sense of some realism. There is no way with the fire power the Empire had that it could have been defeated by the Ewoks on the planet. Sure the rebels were there to help but the Ewoks could have been blown off the planet, and towards the end of the battle I was cheering for the Empire to crush the furry little pests.I am burned out with Star Wars. George Lucas needs to start directing other different types of films. Why he has not is beyond me. Maybe its because he has already made his money with Star Wars.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hoodwinked in the end.,"I remember coming out of the movie theater in 1983 and feeling disappointed with this movie.  I've seen it a number of times since on video and in the theater (Special Edition Version).  I was so pumped up after 'Empire', and at the time couldn't pinpoint what let me down.  Some of it was characterization. Solo wasn't Solo, Luke didn't really seem to live up to the title of 'Jedi' - he had to be helped by Vader to defeat the Emperor. Probably everyone has movies that they daydream about re-writing the ending to.  In my ending for the movie, Vader tries to throw the Emperor into the power core, gets slammed against a bulkhead, the Emperer comes back to finish Luke, and Luke finally figures out what Obi-Wan and Yoda were trying to teach him, and is able to deflect the energy bolts and push them back on the Emperor, destroying him. I thought the Emperor came off kind of like the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz - not as a powerful evil leader of the dark side.  He cackled a lot, and said things like 'well now, my young Jedi, watch your rebel fleet be destroyed, and your little dog Toto too!'. I kind of thought the Ewoks were cheesy, and yes, the battle scene in the forest asked that reality be suspended too much (two big logs coming together are going to smash an ATST and cause it to explode?).  I am looking forward to the three prequel movies, but now I hear what may be the unkindest cut of all. After all this, Lucas may not make episodes VII, VIII and IX because he says it would take too long, and he never had a story for those anyway.  So we'll get to see the prequels, though we know how those end up, but the finale to the series of movies will probably be the disappointing 'Jedi'. *Sigh*.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost a masterpiece,"Now this is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is a little bit better than A New Hope. A New Hope was a very good movie, but something felt missing there. The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece, and this one is also very good, but flawed. I think almost everyone agrees that the main problem here are the Ewoks, like I do. They are cute little fellas and everything, but they just don't fit into this movie and makes the story too light- hearted while it's actually pretty serious and it is shown in parts with Luke, Vader and the Emperor, and I think that part is a bit underused. Seriousness is what this movie lacks. Not to be completely dark and serious, but more like the previous movie, and the Ewoks don't help. And it's also laughable how easily can Stormtroopers be killed. I mean, like, Ewoks beat them down in a few seconds. What??? Luckily, those were the only bad sides here. Humor works really good for the most of the time, especially with C-3PO and R2-D2. I love them. The action is well done as always and while there are many goofy and light-hearted parts of the movie, it has some very serious parts which I mentioned above that are really well done. Luke Skywalker has really developed as a character and now he's one of the coolest characters in the franchise. Here we also get to see a more human side of Darth Vader and he has never felt so vulnerable, especially with the arrival of the new big bad:The Emperor. The actor who is playing him (I can't remember the name, I'm really sorry) was so awesome. Just the way he moves, the way he speaks, his face expressions, everything was just great and just enough not to be goofy and that's one of the best performances in the series. Overall, this is a satisfying fast-paced finale of the original trilogy, and while not as good ad it's predecessor, and considered by many people to be the weakest in the original trilogy is still a great movie and one more timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Trilogy Should've Ended Here,"The prequel films of Star Wars were good but not good as the original trilogy. Return of the Jedi should've been the last film.

Not Perfect But Pure Enjoyment,"A brilliant conclusion to a trilogy that would change cinema forever.Whilst not perfect (and certainly not when taking in Lucas' horrific later additions), the third Star Wars film still holds enough iconic moments for it to live long in the memory. Whether it be the love-them-or-hate-them Ewoks or Leia's metal bikini, there's enough content here to power pop culture references for years to come.A departure from the grittier Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi still has everyone's favourite characters, whilst adding some great ones along the way and allowing the likes of the Emperor a greater spotlight to claim the role of the true villain of the saga.Arcs of redemption, relationships and rebellion, there is something for everyone as action comes in all forms, mixed with a fantastic soundtrack, brilliant settings and a whole host of fantastic-looking creatures to give depth to the universe.Return Of The Jedi is a nostalgic 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The beginning of an end...,"Ok, Star Wars: ANH introduced us to the characters. Empire showed the strength of the Empire. And now In Jedi, David wins..again. It's easy to summarize this movie, first they go to Jabba's Palace for about 40 min. then Luke's of to Dagobah, the strike team on Endor,Luke surrenders, Battle of Endor. Now most people say they hate this movie because...then they list some technical comments like they were an avid critic!! Yoy! It's my favorite because of one thing: The Battle of Endor. On the ground, the Empire;s ""best legion of troops"" never had a chance, but in space you see the battle turn once the Executioner goes down. The lightsaber duel revealed a little too much of Vader-not enough fighting compared to ESB (even that didn't have enough)I was surprised how quickley Vader got worned out..oh well. The actual Death Star run was nothing like ANH but it had 2 other things going on and didn't provide that much drama. All in all this is the movie you should watch before you go see Epsiode I this summer-it's the most modern (of Eps. IV-VI) and has the most ties to the prequels.

Episode VI - Return of the Merchandising,"Like most kids from my generation, I grew up on Star Wars.  But if there is such a thing as guilt by association, then there also has to be undue credit by association, and I think Jedi has plenty of that.  As part of the original trilogy, it will always be a hallmark film, and it has plenty of good elements.  But its main contribution, aside from a happy ending, was cramming a record number of elements in the special effects shots.Let's face it:  a new, improved Death Star and a race of teddy bears?

Not A Perfect Finale But Not A Disaster Either!,"The third & final instalment of the original Star Wars trilogy, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi may not be as impressive as its revolutionary predecessors which at least had an interesting storyline at its core to fall back on once its visual encapsulation deteriorated in quality, as is the case at present, but it manages to cross the finish line before running out of fuel and is a satisfactory conclusion to the saga set in a galaxy far far away.Set one year after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi finds Luke Skywalker & his friends teaming up to free Han Solo from Jabba's captivity following which they learn of another Death Star being under construction by the Galactic Empire, this time under the supervision of the Emperor himself. With an opportunity to end the battle once & for all, the Rebel Alliance launches an all-out attack against the Empire while Luke & Vader confront for the final time.Directed by Richard Marquand, Return of the Jedi picks up the story from where the previous instalment signed off but takes its time to get moving. The whole sequence at Jabba's palace is overstretched & is at times cringeworthy. Being the final chapter, the film still finds time to meander on moments that should've ended up on the editing room floor. However, there is some solace in the fact that the arc of every character is brought to a satisfying conclusion, even if it takes a longer route to get there.The set pieces put forth by the production design team are more extravagant but the upgrades from one chapter to another isn't that big a leap, or at least it doesn't appear so. Cinematography continues to leave a positive impression with its inventiveness and the camera movements are a bit more energetic this time. Editing could've trimmed a few more moments to give its story a more compact structure & swifter pacing while John Williams once again delivers a fitting score that slightly enhances every moment.Coming to the performances, the cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams & others return for one last adventure and exhibit greater comfort with the roles they'd been playing for a while. The input by Hamill, Ford & Fisher is in tune with what's expected from them while the character of Darth Vader continues to amaze, and the finale is a fitting resolution to his arc. The first half lacks the sort of excitement that was prevalent in the previous instalment but the film does make few amends in the next half to finish on a fine note.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi neither has the freshness of A New Hope nor has the shocking appeal of The Empire Strikes Back and is definitely the weakest instalment of the three. A more coherent & tightly packed narrative in addition to a better pace would've resulted in a more enjoyable experience but despite all its shortcomings, it isn't entirely the disaster it was turning out to be in the first half. A scattered final piece that has its share of positives & negatives, Return of the Jedi may not be the perfect finale but it still bows out with its head in tact.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There's nothing better than a good ending to a good story and this movie is just that!,"""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is a great ending to the original trilogy and a cherished part of the popular culture ever since it's creation. The same thing I said for previous two movies applies here. If you want to critique the movie, you will find things to critique and if you want to love it, you will find things to love. In the words of Harrison Ford himself, this can either be a ""teddy bear picnic"" or a majestic culmination of the imagination of George Lucas, depending on your point of view. Also, this is the first movie of the saga that didn't face many problems in the production which a fun fact to know if you love the saga. All in all, this is, once again, an entertaining epic that does its job of being a legendary movie extraordinarily well.

Wasted time,"What a shame, that they wasted so much screen time on the little cutesy-wootsey bears!Gack.  This could have been the crowning jewel of the Star Wars films; a movie about how the galaxy finds its way back to the side of the good guys and out of the clutches of Evil.Instead, we get too much screen time wasted on cute little bears.Lucas should have stuck with his initial instincts, which is why he didn't put Chewbacca's home planet (which was a hugely forested place, with Wookies living in the trees) in the original movie.  (That, and a movie can only be SO long.)Instead, given the money and indulgence to put it into the third movie, he decided to throw in the Ewoks.  Yuk.In any case, it's still a decent movie, tying up most of the story lines and showing Luke's faith in the inherent goodness of his father was well-placed. Darth Vader's final act, to reject the Evil of the Emperor and join the Good Guys, rehabilitates him back into the Anakin that we should have come to know and love in Episodes I and II.(Too bad THOSE movies bit the big one, and never developed Anakin in the first place.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A movie like Pink Flamingos is good with bad acting, but a movie like this needs good actors.  The plot is thinner than that of Bloodsucking Freaks, and is completely unimaginative.

Coasting Not Soaring To A Finish,"I'm not one of those critics of ROTJ who hates the movie, but I do think it's quite obvious that when you watch the three movies together it's clear that the entire storyline that was established so wonderfully in Star Wars, is just coasting to a finish here instead of soaring to a powerful climax.I have always been convinced that what elevates ""Star Wars"" above either of the two sequels is the fact that it was the only one of the three films where Lucas seemed to be equally concerned about story development as he was about FX.  The trend toward FX over story starts to intrude in Empire, but in ROTJ it really sticks out like a sore thumb.  Lucas it seems spent more time concerned about showing a more elaborate cantina scene in Jabba's palace than he was about pacing a coherent and credible storyline.  Luke and Leia brother and sister?  Boy, does that make you go back and look at the original in a somewhat uncomfortable light.  This was something that required more explanation and a bit more depth.  And don't even make me comment on the Ewoks, the single most idiotic concept of the entire Trilogy. The manner in which they so easily beat a trained Imperial Army is enough to make you want to start rooting for the other side!The acting is also not up to snuff this time.  Ford is just coasting along, and Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor demonstrates how overly cartoonish the proceedings are getting.  All one has to do is compare McDiarmid's caricature performance with Peter Cushing's cool, restrained villainy as Moff Tarkin in Star Wars to realize what was missing this time out. *That's* what the Emperor should have been like.Of course, Carrie Fisher in that metal bikini is always enough to compensate for any of the film's shortcomings in the final analysis. :) Jedi in the end works, but it's not an improvement over it's origins.

Quite good. Too bad the storyline wasn't as interesting as the first two.,"I think this movie lacked, compared to Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The main reason: the Ewoks. Sorry, but I really don't care for furry little rates in a Star Wars series, with the exception of Chewbacca. They just made the movie short on action. We had to watch them worship C-3PO and watch them throw rocks at storm troopers. The rest of the movie was cool. The chase on the speeders in the forest. The sand-pit with Jabba. The final battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The destruction of the new Death Star. Those parts were cool. Forget everything else. Buy the Special Edition and look at the added stuff.

Good,"One wouldn't be wrong to assume the creators were getting tired of ""Star Wars"" near ""Revenge of the Jedi"", it even had to be renamed because ""revenge"" isn't characteristic of a jedi knight, but that word made its way to some old posters.This is a big combination of different things. Some are better than others, some are disadvantages. Alien creatures got much more screen time here, and with the way this franchise handles them, it isn't a very good thing. On the one hand, the big scene near the beginning uses all those different puppets well, big or small, funny or ugly, there is even a huge monster here. And since they are all in this one place that belongs to an evil crime lord, it makes sense they would look somewhat unpleasant. This is a bad place, and the heroes are nicely contrasted to how hostile and even scary it may be. Alien creatures are not the strongest aspect of ""Star Wars"", they can even be viewed as a problem. But ""Return of the Jedi"", in this one particular scene, manages to benefit from it. But then, on the other hand, there are those little furry teddy bears on the forest planet. Not only do they look cartoonish and childish, they also serve a very implausible purpose in the plot. Many hate the ""gungans"" from ""The Phantom Menace"", of course, and yes, they were cartoonish as well, but they were made using advanced visual technology, and they were an intelligent civilization with enough tools and weapons to be a serious force. Also, there are those silly walkers here again, only smaller, and the design is way different this time, a more mobile one, thankfully.The visuals deserve a little criticism in general. Of course, green forest is more beautiful than a desert, or an icy desert, or a dark swamp, but the forest action scenes, apparently, rely heavily on rear projection, and that does not look as good as one would hope.All that said, the movie does not fail. There is a lot of outer space here, and it looks amazing. The final battle is easily the best in the original trilogy. And that is a big advantage for this movie. But what truly drives it is the story it tells. Some would point out the similarities to ""Episode IV"", while they are not there to copy something. They are there to build on that which came before. That goes for the plot in general. It uses the material built and developed across the three movies, it is a satisfying conclusion. Leia, Han and Luke have made quite a significant journey. They all are different persons by the end of this story. Not to mention how the movie treats the villains, the strongest villains in the whole saga.""Return of the Jedi"" may have a handful of things to criticize for good reason, but none ruin either the visuals or the tale. Speaking of the tale, what should be mentioned is the pacing of the story here. It does not rely heavily on shooting, fighting or blowing things up, and has plenty of room to breathe and shine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

1) Having to blow up another Death Star felt a bit of a rehash of A New Hope.2) Those Ewoks screamed ""merchandising opportunity."" As others have pointed out, using sticks and stones to fight Stormtroopers bordered on campy at times.In my ranking of the nine movies in the three trilogies, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back ranks #6.

This movie should not have been altered.,"This movie is 9 stars in original form; 2 after it was re-released with CGI.We saw this today at the theater and it was nice to see it on the big screen again, BUT, and this is a huge BUT, the CGI absolutely kills the magic this movie had in 1983. It adds not a thing to the story, it stands out like a sore thumb when compared to the original sets and effects. The crazy thing is I totally get why they added the CGI to appeal to the millions of people who have not seen the movie before. They made some serious $$$ because for some reason, far too many people enjoy CGI. I must add to the story and not just be eye candy for it to work, which is extremely rare.What makes this movie still so great to me is the interaction of the Emperor between Luke and Darth Vader. It is still such an intense sequence what with how entirely evil the Emperor is.All in all, I did enjoy watching the movie even though I found myself dozing off at the CGI extended scenes.They did change the ending music and the ending itself which really bothered me.STOP MESSING WITH ORIGINAL MOVIES WHEN THEY ARE PERFECT TO BEGIN WITH.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the Trilogy,"Return of the Jedi surfs the thin line in between the darkness of Empire (Luke's soul searching) and the fun of New Hope (the Ewoks...hey! I thought they were cool!). I think it's the best of the series, but they were all so perfect, I won't try to defend it. They were all masterpieces.Nicely capping the story of our heroes of the Rebellion (for any extraterrestrials out there who don't know: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leiah, Lando Carlissian, Chewbacca, C3-P0, Artoo-D2), it also featers the fates of the dreaded Lord Vader and Emperor Palpatine. It does such a wonderful job bringing the trilogy to a full circle and featuring each character so that they are memorable (Jabba the Hutt was the man, and the scene in which Han lets Lando fly the Falcon is great!), that how can I do anything but suggest it was the greatest of the series?Watch this if you haven't, but make sure you watch the first two beforehand.

"Fathers, sons and Ewoks...","After the excellent Episode V, the original Star Wars trilogy comes to an end with a more children-friendly, yet still a bit tragic, third installment: after saving his friends from the revolting Jabba the Hutt, witnessing Yoda's death and learning new secrets about his origins from his deceased master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) prepares for the final confrontation with the Emperor and Darth Vader, aka Anakin Skywalker, the father he thought had died years before. He has a difficult choice to make: bring back his daddy or, in case that's impossible, kill him. In the meantime, the Rebels are getting ready for the ultimate battle against the Death Star, rebuilt after its destruction in the first film.The saga has lost none of its magic, as we approach the conclusion while still hoping it will go on some day.Now, let's talk about the one thing die-hard fans dislike about Return of the Jedi: the battle on planet Endor, more exactly the inhabitants of said planet, the teddy-bear like Ewoks (the originally planned Wookies were to expensive to achieve). They may have been created for business reasons rather than creative genius, and they may seem a little stupid since their technology ain't a touch on the rebels' or the Empire's. Still, they're cute and enjoyable, not to mention more memorable and better than a certain Jar Jar Binks...The Empire Strikes Back is the king, but Jedi is a worthy, though underrated, ending (?) for an amazing saga that began a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...9,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Second Best,"Return of the Jedi seemed to be much of an improvement over the Empire Strikes Back, which had some problems in my opinion.

Harrison Ford was probably happy that he did not have to do these anymore. The action was really good in this too. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The most emotional and powerful, but also the weakest and silliest.","Return of the Jedi is a 1983 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and is the third and final film of the original Star Wars trilogy. Return of the Jedi once again takes us back into the amazing world of Star Wars and continues the journey of the franchise's beloved characters. However, unlike the previous two which are considered two of the greatest films of all time, Return of the Jedi has a few flaws which unfortunately hold it back from continuing this impressive trend. While it does have arguably some of the most powerful and emotional moments of the original trilogy it also has both the weakest and at times even silliest, the main target for this are the infamous Ewoks which has divided fans, as a personal preference I find they add little depth too the story and at times are the cause for scenes to feel unimportant, unnecessary and often stall the movie, as well as the far fetched third act battle which adds my disdain for them. Another of Return of the Jedi's flaws is the inclusion of a second Death Star, which never seems to have the same weight, intensity and fear that the first injected in the Rebels and viewers alike, and primarily serves as the Empire's base rather than an actual powered battle station. However, many aspects in Return of the Jedi do succeed for instance the film once again expands the beautiful and fascinating galaxy of Star Wars also the hugely powerful final confrontation between father and son and finally the jaw-dropping battle sequences in the third act. The first act also shines through with a brilliant conclusion to the cliffhanger at the end of Empire. Many of the same brilliant and iconic shots and scores are continued in Return of the Jedi. However, again unlike the original and Empire a few shots and special affects do nowadays seem dated. Overall, Return of the Jedi is a brilliant and emotional end to the original trilogy-but not hugely satisfying due to the more immature nature of the Ewoks and the stalled pacing of the second act as a whole. Certain aspects and exposition of the disappointing future prequels did seem to seep into Return of the Jedi at times, but generally they do not hold back the movie and is still a thrilling adventure to be viewed by all. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as previous two,"While ROTJ is not as good as Star Wars and The Empire strikes back it is however still very enjoyable. It does though in my opinion feel like a lesser remake of the original, but with the added bonus of a fantastic light sabre battle between Luke and his father Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker. This film is heavily centred on Luke so my favourite characer Han Solo seems to fade into the background, stuck in a rediculous battle with the Ewoks on Endor, including I kid you not a ""Tarzan yell"" from Chewbacca! how did that get in there? Still this is Star Wars after all so there is more plus points than minuses, the plus points include a great space battle and an amazing speedbike chase. Also the emperor makes a great baddie, but the unmasking of Darth Vader was a mistake and I hate the way they got rid of Boba Fett.

A huge disappointment!,"Let me say at the outset (and the onset of TPM), that I am a devoted cinephile and a fan of Star Wars, so much so that even now I am waiting in line for May 19 tickets to the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC! Nevertheless, my being a fan of the series does not blind me (as others have been)to the fact that Return of the Jedi simply is not a very good movie at all.What the majority of ROTJ apologists in this posting do not take into account is that ROTJ is a film first and foremost and must be judged as such.  Plot, character, color, and pacing all have something to do with it. The only thing that carried this film (and the only thing that we all can agree upon) were the special effects.  The acting, dialogue, and plot were weak in the extreme, IF you could manage to look past the Star Wars gloss. I lay the majority of the blame at Lucas' door; he was the executive producer and had total control of the proceedings.  Marquand's directing, however, did not help.  The sad part is that Lucas betrayed his own myth and his own enterprise by producing such a clunker.  Events in the Star Wars universe were building to a fever pitch in the vastly superior Empire Strikes Back, and then all the air was let out with ROTJ.  If good taste and the fabled Lucas genius had been working during the production, rather than greed and the fabled Lucas business sense, it would have been a much better movie and actually worth all the kudos it has received.As if anyone needed proof of the elements that undermined this disappointing movie, I'll list some: The Ewoks.  The awful dialogue.  The upstaging of Darth Vader by the Emperor.  The habitual stupidity and consistent blundering by the Imperial forces (it really makes you wonder how they ever consolidated their Empire, doesn't it?)  The unbelievable destruction of the Executor.  The well-nigh cynical tone in the Luke/Leia/Han exchanges.  The under-development of every single character in the movie. And the number one reason why this was a kid's movie, instead of an adult one, was the lack of sacrifice required of the Rebels to win this war.  Let me get this straight: the Rebels lose two ships, some fighters, Yoda, and an Ewok or two, and the Empire is obliterated totally?  Well, that makes sense!  And now we have a Disney ending!  After all, there are sales quotas to be met.The few good points?  Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor--absolutely the only reason to see ROTJ; he's fantastic even though the repetitive and shallow dialogue lets him down.  Yes, the special effects:  the speeder chase, the destruction of Death Star II, the space battle.  The costume design.  The set design.  And the only scenes that moved me in the slightest were the Luke/Yoda farewell and the re-uniting of Han and Chewbacca.The outrage here is that if Lucas, Marquand, and their collaborators had given their audience any credit for brains at all, this would have been a much better movie.  And it could have been so easy, since Lucas had set up the last movie so well.  It was a no-brainer, and they blew it.  Oh, don't get me wrong:  of course the movie made a pile of money (and thus could be considered a success), and was a hit with the less-than-discerning general public, the kids (to whom it was marketed), and the die-hard, see-no-evil Star Wars fans.  Was the movie fun?  Yes.  Was it a dramatic work of art? Why even ask?Of course, this is a culture where Titanic wins Oscars, and fluff is substituted for substance, but it does make me think that I AM on a different planet when the IMDb user comments for ROTJ discuss the ""emotional father/son lightsabre battle,"" ""beautiful direction by Marquand,"" ""brilliant editing,"" and ""Hamill's thespian talents.""  I am as anxious as anyone else to see TPM, but after reading comments like these I get the uneasy feeling that even if the new movie is of the same quality or worse than ROTJ, no one will care and any critical faculties will be left outside the theater.  And that, like ROTJ's artistic failure, is really too bad.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beautiful finale,"Star Wars is a legend. Why? I started watching the series by asking myself this, but I wanted to watch it in the order of its release, not in chronological order. Because I want to watch movies the way the followers watch them. I wanted to experience the same things as those who followed the series. That's why I started. I wasn't impressed at all in the first movie, nor in the second movie. I mean, they were beautiful, of course, but it wasn't like that legendary Star Wars I was told about. It was very simple, the messages wanted to be given were shouted. Good men bad men, everything was clear. It even felt childish after a while. But this movie changed my perspective on the series.First of all, I don't understand much about effects, but since I know that the movie is very old, it may not be my right to say something. However, there was no effect that seems too old. Maybe just explosions. But for a movie made 30 years ago, I think the space scenes and aliens are pretty cool. Of course, it wouldn't be right to compare it with today, but even if we compare it with today, nothing offended my eye, except for some funny space suits (they look funny because the space suits used in today's movies). I think there is a very creative image in the movie. I really liked the music. I saved them on Spot. Right away, I'll listen to it later. This series has very simple but thematic and pleasant-sounding music. Since it already has very little music, I have no trouble understanding which music belongs to which scene.The acting in the movie is the point that upsets me, as in all old movies. It seems to me that this was how people actually talked in the 80s and 90s, and they were imitating them. However, it is clear that acting back then was not as professional as it is today. Or they are afraid of exaggerating and going crazy. I do not know. For example, Luke's character seems very dull to me for some reason. But actually, not as a character, but as an actor. It seems as if the character was more active, but the acting was like that. But this point that I'm talking about is definitely a minor case that stands out. So if we have to say something bad about this movie, we have to go into the details and get hung up on trivial things like that. Also, congratulations to the actor who played C-3PO. His movements look so robotic and natural.The 3rd movie of the series (whatever anyone says, this movie is the 3rd movie) impressed me the most was the ending. I mentioned at the beginning of my review, ""Was this the star wars that people are constantly praising?"" This movie answered ""yes"" to my question. After watching the first half of the movie, I was thinking that this movie is going to be a sitcom. Something bad happens to them and they escape. But it was like I didn't want to watch these friends get caught and save each other while there was a huge rebel and empire war going on. In the end, it had to happen. I watched 3 movies for this finale, but if you say was it worth it, I can say yes. I took a screenshot of the last scene and made it my background because I was so impressed. Also, I was so upset that I knew about the Star Wars spoilers that everyone knows. I thought that was what the movie had been hiding for so long, but it wasn't. I think it's worth watching just for the ending.I just finished the first Star Wars trilogy. It's time for the next trilogy. The last movie has raised my expectations a lot, I hope you don't talk about empty things and you continue to progress at this pace Star Wars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost as Stupid as The Phantom Menace,"This film is almost the same plot as ""A New Hope"". This time however Luke is now a Jedi and he must confront his father and help the Rebles once and for all destroy the Empire.Now I loved this film when I first saw it in 1983. In like ""Star Wars"" and ""Empire"" this film is not holding up. It has great moments but the Care Bear Ewok creatures are annoying for most of the time they are on the screen. There is a few moments that they are fine but most of the time they are just as annoying things that are just silent versions of Jar Jar Binks.Now as I prefer the original version of the film for many reasons. The fixes in this are minimal. The best fix was the dessert creature no longer looks like a giant vagina",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The weakest of the tribology,"The final instatement of the original Star Wars trilogy. The Return of the Jedi begins with a return to Tatooine where our group of heroes must rescue Han Solo from the Gangster Jabba the Hut. This first act is exciting, creative and holds your attention. The pivot of the plot in Return of the Jedi is that the Empire is close to completing a second death star which if finished would spell doom for the rebels. Since the second film Luke's powers and confidence have grown considerably however he now is put into a position of emotional conflict, he knows he must help to destroy the empire, but his father is part of that empire.Return of the Jedi is generally considered to be the weakest of the three films, though not by all. One example would be the character of Han Solo, after Han is rescued from carbonate his character has little else to do, yes he gets involved in the action like the other two films, but absent are any internal conflict. In A New Hope he struggled to put aside his selfishness and become part of something bigger. The Empire Strikes Back also has Han in emotional conflict over his feelings towards Leia and his desire to leave so he can pay off Jabba. The tone is slightly mixed up at points in Return of the Jedi, A New Hope was fun and exciting, The Empire Strikes Back was tense and dark. Return of the Jedi seemed to end up being a mix of the two, sometimes cutting between scenes of Wicket doing cute stuff and atmospheric tense scenes between Luke, Vader and the Emperor. The inclusion of the Ewoks has been controversial, some people feeling Lucas was starting to pander too much towards kids and merchandising, something he'd be accused of again 15 years later when he was making the Phantom Menace.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
None too good,"I'm afraid I have to say that Return of the Jedi is a shameful end to the trilogy. Not only is it far too cheerful, but the storyline was rushed and weak, the acting was appalling, the spaceships were uninspiringly filmed, the end sequence was cheesy to the extreme, the aliens looked rather....well, they were really bad. There is one redeeming feature...the speederbike sequence is good, even better than the Starwars trench scene. Other than that, I was disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An optimized end to the trilogy,"It seems as the common opinion concerning the Star Wars trilogy is that the third and final episode, Return of the Jedi, is not only the weakest in the series, but in fact a rather mediocre film. I've heard the arguments, and I agree that some things, such as the dialogue, are better in - for instance - The Empire Strikes Back. But I´ve never understood why the fantastic qualities that this movie actually has, aren't surfaced in the debate.What´s so good about ROTJ, then? Well, I must concede that my opinion might be based more on emotions than plain facts. What I appreciated in ROTJ when it came was perhaps most of all the incredible imagination it was built upon. For instance the first part of the film, which takes place in the castle of the villain Jabba the Hutt. The environment, the characters, and the incidents taking place there were all mind-boggling and awesome. And I still give the movie much credit for those scenes. Most of the special effects in ROTJ are - still today - simply incredible. Especially those in the speeder bike scenes, as well as those in the final space fight, which makes the scenes in A New Hope pale by comparison. Effects alone doesn't make a film great, but in ROTJ they help a lot.As a whole, the plot in ROTJ is a bit weak. What does work, though, is the wonderful build-up towards the inevitable fight between Luke and Darth Vader. The tension can be felt throughout the film, culminating in some fantastic scenes on the Death Star, when the Emperor shows his potential as a manipulator and persuader. He certainly embodies evil. The last 30 minutes or so of ROTJ is one of the most intense and fascinating sequences I´ve come across in a film.So, what is ROTJ most often criticized for?  I´ve overheard that the film is impersonal and illogical. Also, some fans dislikes the death of the popular character Boba Fett, as well as Yoda´s death. Another impopular scene is the one where Luke removes Darth Vader´s helmet. And then there are the Ewoks, the perhaps too cuddly bears living in the forests of the Endor moon. To me, those scenes perfectly portray the David and Goliath theme: size isn't all that matters. But sure, some of the criticism above is valid. Just don´t judge the whole film by that! Because ROTJ is a magic trip into another world, a fantastic spectacle, and an optimized end to the greatest film trilogy in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An ultimately disappointing finale,"Until the overblown Episode I made its belated appearance, this film held the dubious honour of being the weakest of the Star Wars films. Which is a pity, because the opening few minutes on Tattooine, with the rescue of Han Solo and the demise of the repulsive Jabba the Hutt are terrific. This initial high standard is not however sustained. Mark Hamill is frankly wooden in what should be the pivotal role. Harrison Ford's instinct that his character should have been killed off in this film is probably correct. Carrie Fisher has fun in a gleeful ripoff of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, although the ewoks are just plain silly, looking far too much like teddy bears to be taken seriously in what is supposed to be a desperate battle for the future of the galaxy.2 major weaknesses dog the resolution of this film. At the risk of major spoilage for anyone who has hidden under a boulder for the last 2 decades and hasn't seen this film, here they are:1: Darth Vader, who among other things ordered the brutal torture of Han Solo in the previous film for no reason other than his own amusement, suddenly discovers a shred of humanity after all on seeing his son Luke Skywalker being tortured by the emperor. This is supposed to be the villain that orchestrated the extermination of the Jedi Knights. It will take hard work by Lucas and Co in Episodes 2 and 3 to convince me that this is not inconsistent.2: The destruction of the first Death Star precipitated an Imperial counterattack that harried the Rebels to the farthest corners of the galaxy. The destruction of the second leads to instant victory for the Alliance, and peace. Okay, so the Emperor was killed as well, but is this enough to precipitate the total collapse of the Imperial forces - are all those generals wearing those bits of coloured plastic such mindless sheep? Oh, they are? Hmm.Unless George Lucas changes his mind and creates Episodes 7-9, this ending to the Star Wars series of films must be regarded as unsatisfactory. His dilemma is enormous: of the 3 leads, Harrison Ford is now a megastar and too expensive to employ, Carrie Fisher is probably not interested and Mark Hamill is a wizened shell of an actor doing computer games, though he could probably be understudied by Terence Stamp if a lookalike actor is required.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What an awful film,"I want 90 minutes of my life back! This is quite possibly THE worst film I have ever seen. What made it so terrible you may ask? Shall we start at the beginning where sound quality was so bad that it was near impossible to hear what any of the woeful actors were saying. There was obviously NO editing, as character development scenes were painfully long and pointless (although a good opportunity to make a cuppa!). The ""5 hot chicks"" were average, and if you're hoping for a bit of skin you'll be disappointed, as the best on offer is a passably attractive girl in skimpy shorts, fleeing for her life for about 10mins at most. The plot is barely existent, the filming dreadful, and there are simply not enough negative adjectives to describe this film. Did someone mention that this was made with ""just"" $35 million US? That would have to be the most destructive use of money since the ""eat a tapeworm to lose weight"" campaign in the 60's! I will finish by saying, I would rather eat the contents of my cat's litter tray than see this movie again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

After the first two it fitted in so right.,I certainly didn't love this one any less than the fourth one.  ofcourse good one but there was a twist to it and things that happened made sense in the story line.

"Very Good, but not great","When I was about 10, I use to think that ROTJ was the best movie of all time, why was that? Cos I thought the last 40 minutes or so was so cool. But 9 year later my option is a lot different. 40 minutes does not make a movie. I still am not 100% sure why I do not like ROTJ as much as the other 2 (not including TPM). There is just something missing. Maybe it's the Ewoks that were just in it for merchandising and I think that did let the film down a bit. Like you go from Empire which is really dark to teddy bears running around killing stormtroopers. Sorry, but it's too unbelievable. Another thing I haven't understood is the Space Battle. When The Rebels come out of Hyperspace I reckon there's probably about 15 capital ships at most. Ok yeah they blew the death star up again (something new would of been good) but Surely the Empires fleet could wipe out the small rebel fleet after the death star was destroyed. Then as the falcon has blown up the death star u see about 30 rebel capital ships flying away from it...sorry if u think I am being picky but there are a lot of flaws here. I can understand if people get bored of the movie for awhile. It starts of slow and after killing jabba too the last 40 minutes it's quite slow. Oh the last one is finding out Luke and Leia are brother and sister. And straight away you think of them sharing a kiss in Empire. Plus there was a more passionate kiss cut out as well (thankgod). The acting wasn't the best, I think Mark Hamill tried too hard, and Harrison Ford seemed really uncomfortable at times and was nowhere near as good as in Empire (maybe it was being around the ewoks) On the positive sides though, there are some extremely good battle scenes. I thing some scenes were well written where Luke told Leia he was her brother and then straight after that with Vader talking to Luke. I guess it's a little bit of a let down from the other 2. You just expect a better ending and justifying. Although the special edition ending was a lot better then the original. With a lot better music to end it then that silly ewok song. In the end I'd give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"1/2 a Great Star Wars movie, 1/2 laughable","I still give it an 8 because it's a fun movie. When more ""new star wars"" movies are made (and you know they will be) I hope Lucas hands off the franchise to someone who will start the next series *after* these classic films. Hey, the Dark Side didn't just disappear, and Luke could easily be tempted by the same lust for power that Darth was. There's still plenty of movie to be made after RotJ, movie that can't help but be more interesting than this dreadful (and pointless) prequel stuff we've been handed.As for the movie itself, well, let's just say the first part is great. I'll leave the Ewoks for other reviewers to trash. In the early going we get that fat slob Jabba at his best (worst), Leia in her unforgettable bikini, silly songs, ugly monsters, Han Solo shooting blind, and Yoda at his philosophical best. And, of course, Luke as the ""Jedi in Black"" who seems to be growing a great deal more sinister than this punk Anakin has managed so far. There's a kinda creepy sub-vibe going on in the first part of the movie, which shows that Luke may be more like his father than we thought. Lucas doesn't go anywhere with it (yes I know it was a different director, but if you think anything happens in a star wars movie without Big George's say-so, you're wrong). Lucas also doesn't develop the whole brother/sister thing with Luke and Leia which might have proved interesting given that Leia was just as Jedi-like as her brother. And you have to give him kudos for having Yoda die of old age. Don't look for anything as dramatic as that happening in any ""new"" star wars film. In fact, don't look for anything as interesting as the family dynamics of the original star wars, a key part of why the movies are so memorable, and what makes this one so good with the whole Luke/Darth battle.On a side note, I've never understood the apology for the Ewoks; that Lucas was making a more ""kid-friendly"" Star Wars movie. Coming after a half-naked Carrie Fisher, the Sarlaac (a gigantic carnivorous hole in the desert) and the death of the much-beloved Yoda, just what ""kids"" did George think he needed to pander to? Weird, and the primary reason why this flick seems to be two different movies--one brilliant, the other muppetish and stupid.Note to the ""New Hope"" and ""Episode 6"" people--gimme a break. This is the *third* star wars movie, not the sixth or whatever. Lucas had enough material for 2 1/2 great movies the first time around, and basically faked the last part of RotJ. Taken as a whole, it's great stuff. Don't try to ramrod it into the silly and fake six movie structure that the fanboys talk about. Star Wars, the Original Trilogy stands alone. These new movies have nothing whatsoever to do with the originals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An uneven but enjoyable ride,"RotJ is maybe the weakest among the first three Star Wars films but still very watchable and entertaining.

"One of the all time greats, helped a lot by its predecessors","Return of the Jedi is my personal favorite in the Star Wars saga, a masterpiece of directing. However, to be fully enjoyed, it really must be seen after episodes 4 and 5. Had i seen it before those two, i would have come out thinking it was only slightly above average. But the earlier films have built the characters and the fighting cause to such a climax that in the final scenes of this film with Luke and Vader you are left with sensory overload- because it all means so much to you. Acting as always is a top-knotch performance, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill deliver some fantastic roles, while the short appearance of Ian McDiarmid is a memorably acted. While some of the action scenes may seem a bit dated (such as the chase through the forest and the Rancor pit scene), this does not distract from the overall film and they are still enjoyable.

"Uneven, but still a fitting close to the original trilogy","Starry-eyed as my 22-year-old self was on opening day for what was then (1983) simply called ""Return of the Jedi,"" I recognized that the special effects wizards at ILM dominated this show. Given what we've seen to date in George Lucas' prequel trilogy, ""Jedi"" was a harbinger of what was to come: increasingly hyper-detailed CGI landscapes populated with sketchy characters. Nonetheless, this did bring the original trilogy to a satisfying, if uneven, close. The battles raging on the forest moon of Endor and in the heavens above the new Death Star, spectacular as they are, really take a back seat to a smaller- scale conflict involving Darth Vader, the Emperor, and a young Jedi that both are trying to bring over to the Dark Side of the Force, Luke Skywalker. It's this aspect of the story that gives the movie's title (which has a few meanings) its resonance.Oh yes, there are major complaints here. There's hardly a memorable image or scene to compare to what we saw and heard in the two previous movies; the dialogue is often dull when it's not forced. The Ewoks, while embodying one of Lucas' original concepts for ""Star Wars""--primitive warriors overcoming advanced technology--are at times just a little too cutesy. Worst of all is the neutering of Han Solo, who doesn't have a tenth of the swagger and brashness that made him stand out in what are now called Episodes 4 and 5. But all in all, as a resolution to the conflicts laid out in the first two movies, it gets the job done, and is still measurably superior to what we've gotten thus far in the prequels. As to the changes made for both the 1997 ""Special Edition"" re-release and the DVD, they're of a piece with the modifications to Episodes 4 and 5: some are effective, some detract, and some are of little consequence. Most controversial, of course, is the substitution of Hayden Christiansen for the late Sebastian Shaw in a brief visit by the spirit of Anakin Skywalker (the younger actor plays Anakin in the second and final installments of the prequel trilogy). It makes perfect sense and makes no sense at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best STAR WARS film in the franchise.,"STAR WARS EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI is the third film released in the saga, but was chronologically the final STAR WARS film, until STAR WARS EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS, which is releasing in December 18, 2015.The evil Galactic Empire, under the direction of the ruthless Emperor Palpatine, is constructing a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance. Since Palpatine plans to personally oversee the final stages of it's construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent it's completion and kill Palpatine, effectively bringing an end to the Empire once and for all. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, the Rebel leader and Jedi apprentice, struggles to bring Darth Vader, who is his father Anakin and himself a fallen Jedi, back from the Dark Side of the Force.The story is not the best story, but George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan wrote an amazing screenplay and it is really fantastic to see on the screen. Richard Marquand directed this film and he did such an incredible job. The movie is not bad, but it gets really good, with the 132 minute running time, the introduction of new characters, characters and everything else. The space fights and the lightsaber fights and the end of this film had a really good climax. My favorite scene in RETURN OF THE JEDI is the final fight between Luke and Vader.The acting is once again top-notch and this was a good conclusion, but I am glad Disney and Lucasfilm are now doing the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII - IX) and I really think that this was a great idea, because a lot of fans wanting these three since REVENGE OF THE SITH, came out in 2005.The music and visuals are once again good and the Special Edition made a few changes, but I still like both versions of this movie and the space sequences and the lightsaber duels could not have been worked out any better.So, overall, I love RETURN OF THE JEDI. I know this is the weakest of the original trilogy of films, but to me, it concluded the franchise and the original trilogy of films brilliantly and fantastically. There are major flaws, but I can still see why this is the best and worst of the trilogy. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

With the continuous evading of the galactic empire and the many space battles, what more could you ask for from a George Lucas film? The long journey in order to save humanity in the galaxy is action packed with the encountering of many new creatures as well as planets that will blow the minds of viewers. Viewers will fall in love with cute new little critters who seem to only have good intentions towards the fate of their habitat as well as the rest of the galaxy. Viewers will also find it very interesting to how the movie lays out a greater perspective to how other people/creatures feel about the evil empire in the galaxy.Return of the Jedi includes incredible acting as well as some family friendly humorous moments from top notch actors such as Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and Harrison Ford (Han Solo). One of the classic features in the Star Wars series that carries on into the Return of the Jedi is the use of positive and negative music. The film crew successfully displays foreshadowing at the beginning of every scene through wonderful or rather sinister music.A viewer may argue that the dialogue within Return of the Jedi is weak nor very complex. This makes sense considering many of the interesting creatures featured in the movie speak in different ""make believe"" languages that viewers can not understand. However, I believe this is the beauty of Return of the Jedi and the rest of the Star Wars series. This idea of ""make believe"" languages brings back the joy of childhood to many of the older viewers. This same idea may make easier dialogue for younger viewers who will understand foreshadowing through the tone of a creature's voice. Also, the lack of complex dialogue between the English speaking characters allows for a younger audience to be able to understand the meaning and plot of the movie more easily. Unlike many other high end films, it's almost as if the actions between the evil empire and the rebel republic itself do all of the talking, so there is no need for a well built script.Overall, I thought it was an amazing film. People who are new to Star Wars will appreciate the countless battles in the sky as well as the fun interactions between the various creatures featured in the movie. While people who are long time fans of the series will appreciate the fight scenes as well as the new key information that will allow the series to carry on into later episodes. No matter what your age or background is everyone's got room to enjoy Star Wars ""Return of the Jedi"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I'm In The Minority, But I Prefer It To Empire","Whilst a lot of people rate ""Star Wars: Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi"" as the worst of the original trilogy. I disagree, and even with George Lucas's tinkering I find it a lot more entertaining that ""Empire Strikes Back"" but accept I will be I the minorityPlot In A Paragraph: A long time a go in a galaxy far, far away the classic tale of good vs evil is heading towards it's conclusion, Our heroes set about rescuing Han Solo from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, whilst the rebels attempt to destroy a second Death Star, while Luke attempts to make Vader turn from The Emperor and the dark side of the Force.What can you say about this movie that has not already been said?? Princess Leia in THAT gold bikini, Luke's new lightsabre, A new Death Star, another revelation about Luke's family oh and the controversial Ewok's (I'm pro Ewok, as the rebellion would have failed without them) Once again the story is filled with the standard elements, (love, friendship, over coming your fears and good vs evil) but the movie is anything but standard and it is a lot more enjoyable than the preceding movie. Helped in no small part by the thrilling rescue of Han Solo taking up the first 30 to 40 minutes.I'll get what I didn't like out if the way first. Mark Hamill has ages a lot since the last movie (hardly his fault, but my young son questioned if it was the same actor) and Luke does a lot of waffling and moping about (to go with his new all black wardrobe) and I'm not a fan of Darth Vader saying ""no"" before screaming ""NOOOOO"" being inserted by Lucas!! Just leave them alone George. It's the longest running of the trilogy (yet it feels shorter than ""Empire Strikes Back"") and could have done with a little bit of trimming. We watch a lot of The Emperor goading Luke on the Death Star, and did we really need the Han Solo jealous of Luke and Leia storyline??Now that's out of the way.....This is my second favourite of the original trilogy. I loved the rescue of Han at Jabba's Palace, Luke's new green lightsabre, (the only time we seen a green lightsabre until the prequels) Lando, Yoda's scene isn't as sad as it should be, (but that's nit picking) the battle of Endor and the ""It's a trap"" attack on the Death Star. Oh all this and I've not mentioned Princess Leia in the gold bikini. The main stuff my early fantasies were based on.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is still excellent as the hero Luke Skywalker (Hamill is not to blame for the problems with his storyline). Harrison Ford is still perfectly cast as the cocky, but at times insecure Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks great in THAT gold bikini, and is OK in the action scenes on Endor. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's still James Earl Jones who makes Darth Vader.Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here.The score by John Williams is once again another valuable asset to the movie.All in all ""Star Wars: Episode VI: ""Return Of The Jedi"" is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for excellent entertainment and a perfect end to the trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Inconsistently Themed and Paced, but Fun and Immersive","Episode VI is the best looking of the original Star Wars movies. Great detail went into the sets and location work, which combined with excellent lighting, gives a real depth and gravitas to the surroundings.The cast is also much better and are given more meaningful lines of dialogue. Mark Hamill plays a genuine hero and gives his best performance while credit also due to all the extras in alien costumes. Certainly there a greater sense of the two sides and what the stakes mean to them.What lets this film down however is the extremely slow and odd pace of the first act followed by the rushed evenness of the remaining acts. The first thirty minutes feel like a completely different film done by a different director, and the transition is unclean and leads into the main story with a rushed and unsatisfying suddenness; breaking the movie into two. In addition there is a sense of creepiness to the first part, and it jars with the spirit of the rest of the film. This makes it hard to watch as a whole, and it's often preferred to skip the first act because of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A full step behind Empire, even with Star Wars for different reasons","Luke's allegorical phantom confrontation with Vader on Dagobah, the revelatory confrontation between the two on Bespin, and the drama of Solo's being frozen in carbonite set Empire above the other two in the original trilogy.  Empire puts flesh on the mythic bones presented in Star Wars, which is remarkable for the simplicity of its story -- a farm boy, a mercenary and an elder knight rescue a princess from a dark castle and dark lord, then return to disintegrate it!  Return of the Jedi perhaps had the easiest task of the three and did well for the most part.  The great escape from Jabba's sail barge is tremendous fun, if somewhat improbable (specifically, that Luke could foresee where R2 would be in relation to him to propel his new lightsaber to him; but that's the Force -- excuse me, talking bacteria in our blood now, after Episode I).  And the slow, sinister game of cat and mouse in the Emperor's throne room -- between the Emperor, then Vader, and Luke -- elegantly deadly with the iridescent arcs of lightsabers in the darkness, provided a triumphant close.  It was just the Ewoks that brought down an otherwise incredible second sequel.  Cuteness only goes so far when one is trying to portray a struggle for the fate of the galaxy; and unfortunately, Mr. Lucas succumbs again in Phantom Menace. Why, why would one use obviously phony aliens with terrible mock-Asian accents when the stern Englishmen aboard the Death Star in Star Wars performed so well and painted the Empire as a bland, starched, strict entity that -- with the Stormtroopers -- clearly evoked the Nazi regime?  Now we have Jar Jar and his silly tribe and a two-headed pod-racing/basketball analyst; and to make matters worse and as I mentioned before, Mr. Lucas has flayed the flesh from those mythic bones by reducing the Force to something that characters can only feel because of a strain of bacteria in them.  Not the mind, not the soul or will -- bacteria.  Superintelligent bacteria, no doubt, and wise enough to engineer a virgin birth (!?) at just the right time and place in the story's timeline; but still, changing the touchstone of the Force from humanity to bacteria was a poor, poor decision.  Episode I is a visual delight, the lightsaber duels light-years beyond those in the original trilogy; but the original had magic.  And that, I hope Mr. Lucas will understand, is something that all of the digital effects and funny, diverse aliens in the universe cannot replace.  The relevance of this long tangent, then, is that it enables me to say this:  when Return of the Jedi ends, as flames dance before Luke and consume his father's bier, cleansing the black armor and rising into the night, as John Williams' powerful composition presents the Force theme one final, stirring time, there is magic; there is myth and the closing of a cycle.  Treasure it, but keep what comes ""after"" separate -- in a galaxy far, far away. (Of course, it may be that Episodes II and III are able to find the magic again; the great questions remain unanswered:  why did Anakin turn?  how was his body shattered then armored?  I hold out that hope; 5 of 6 would be remarkable. Time will tell.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Episodes 4 thru 6 are my favorites, of course, being a child in the late '70s. However, after seeing Episode 3, I have a question regarding a conversation between Luke and Leia in Episode 6. I believe Luke asks Leia about their mother and she replies (misquote) ""she was beautiful, but sad"". Is Leia referring to their real mom, Padme? And if so, is that possible, being that Padme died in childbirth? Again, I am sure that many avid Star Wars fans know distinct details that I may have missed, but this one thing just stuck out to me.

Religious overtones abound,"There's no doubt that a large part of the appeal of 'Return of the Jedi' for me was the action-packed scenes and special effects. However, the movie is also a continuation of the classic battle of ""good versus evil"", with many religious and spiritual themes. Many topics such as greed, temptation, and redemption are debated in this film, and I've read that George Lucas admits that he injected religion into the 'Star Wars' trilogy (see Time magazine, April 26, 1999).For me the whole idea of the Force is fascinating and I suppose there are various ways in which it can be interpreted -- as God perhaps, or religion itself? Or could it simply be some profound level of meaning beyond our everyday reality; this is the interpretation that makes most sense to me. (Perhaps it could be compared to 'The Matrix'?)It may be that a Christian can see 'Return of the Jedi' and think he or she saw a Christian film, but it is Eastern religion that has been said to dominate, and I would agree. There are said to be many examples of Buddhist philosophy in the 'Star Wars' films and I look forward to reading a recently-published book on the topic by Matthew Bortolin, called 'The Dharma of Star Wars'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational,"In the conclusion to the original trilogy Return of the Jedi in many ways did just that While it didn't receive quite the high praise that the empire strike back did. Return of the Jedi did manage to bring a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It offers an emotional story while still Showing the Craftsmanship and Action that Star Wars Set the bar for a New Age of Sci-fi. In many ways the film does film more streamlined in the sense it doesn't have as many sets. The film does make up for that by having the Scenes stand out. Jabba's Palace with its more somber tone, reminiscences of the cantina in New hope. Endor with the final battle does manage to still mix a fair amount of action. It does have its problems one of the most notable being the Ewoks you either love or hate these things and it does fair of the film given how relevant they are to the final battle. It is a bit lazy for the goal to blow up the death star again. However, the action when it happens it still some of the most entertaining moments put to screen. Same with speeder bike on Endor with John Williams music accompanying it immerses you in this universe. The movie is without the funniest out of the three, and honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. We know the situation at hand and the movie doesn't try to be any more than what it is to still be a fun-hearted adventure. You can tell everybody is having a blast even Harrison Ford.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Final Chapter of the Star Wars saga!,"This is it! The final chapter of the George Lucas series of ""Star Wars"". Return of the Jedi is the movie that ends all drama for Star Wars fans. The characters in this movie gets bigger; I remember Jabba The Hutt from the 4th installment, then there's The Ewoks of Endor. Lando Calrissian(Billy Dee Williams) went from Bespin outcast, into a General for the Rebels to fight against the Empire. The Rancor monster in Jabba's pit was very fierce. And Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) was elegant in that metallic bikini when she was the slave of Jabba. Of course, she made him limp and lifeless when Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) jumps into action. The final showdown between Darth and Luke is a classic. Luke shows he is much stronger than his father when he became a Jedi. He didn't give in to the Dark Side of the Force. After Darth tossed the Emperor down the shaft, he became Anakin again; wounded, humbled, and redeemed. Seeing Luke with his own eyes was the sign of redemption and the facts are revealed. That part was a little sad that Anakin died, but he was with the Force again, and he joins the other Jedis. I would rather be a Jedi than a Sith, any day!

The best of the best.,"I'm sure that this is a movie that doesn't need commenting on, but I'm going to anyway. This, in my opinion, is the best of the Star Sars movies. It begins in Tatooine with the disgusting Jabba. Luke Skywalker displays his power of the Force and saves Han and the droids. Then the real adventure begins, with a seemingly dormant new Death Star. A battle with cute little teddy bears called Ewoks, a dazzling lightsaber duel between son and father, the revealment of the ultimate enemy, it reaches quite a level of excitement.The story is very good, the acting is superb, and the effects, like the other SW movies, are excellent, not only for then, but also for today.The costumes are also very good. The only thing in the movie that looked totally goofy was a blue alien that played for Jabba in the musicians section. It looked like a jazzed up stuffed elephant (probably what it was), but didn't take away from the feel of the movie.An excellent movie for SW fans, or those who like science fiction, or for those who are just looking for a good movie.

An exelent climax.,"This Star Wars film isn't as good as the other two, but still is very good.In Jedi Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is incased in carbinite and is in Jabba the Hutt's palace as a decoration when C3P-O (Anthony Daneils) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) arrive to warn Jabba to let Solo go.  Eventualy everyone arrives to rescue Han, and then kill Jabba.  By now Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han are in love as they reach Republic head-quarters.  Before he mets whith them Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamlle), now a very calm and collective young man who is almost a jedi, visits his former master Yoda.  He returns as the Alliance begins it's attack on the second Death Star which was in consruction.  The rest is an intense battle which determines who will win: the Alliance or the Empire. This Star Wars film has great preformances from Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee. Williams, And Ian McIndrid.  Hamlle's preformance could have been much better, but it was still not terrible.

"""A humble ending to the best trilogy of all time.""","Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is simply put a success, and the perfect ending to the greatest trilogy of all time. People complain constantly about how ewoks are a simple marketing campaign, but they are a needed value in this equations masterpiece. Yoda, was a tiny green creature who upon first glance, was nothing but. Yet upon greater inspection, he was the Grand Master of the Jedi. It's the little things that matter, and can overall make a difference. And return of the Jedi shows us this, with its inclusion. Making the presence of ewoks, not so much a scheme, but more essential than anything. And without homage to Yoda and this lesson, it would have been a lesson without anything learned. Without this contrast of something lighter, the movie is grueling with darkness. Luke heads to defeat his Father, and his Fathers master,on a suicide mission. Where he knows might be his final stand. We have the Emperor, a man consumed in evil, who is stopped by his agent of evil, Darth Vader.

My Personal Favorite,"As a child, this was always my favorite within the original trilogy of films. I suspect it was because of how often the lightsaber is used throughout the course of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". I specifically remember always being horrified by what Darth Vader looked like underneath his helmet. Spoiler alert: we finally see him unmasked, after all of the teasing George Lucas gave us in ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"".Han Solo is still frozen in carbonite at the beginning of this film, and there is a rescue action sequence for the first twenty minutes of the film (which is very, very exciting). Luke Skywalker has now become a Jedi Knight, and he is coming to save Han, his now longtime friend. Meanwhile, the Empire has almost finished building the second Death Star. The gang of heroic rebels must defeat the Empire in this finale to the ""Star Wars"" film saga.Like the latter two films, the performances are excellent in this movie. Luke has changed so much since the beginning of the trilogy that he is almost unrecognizable now. At the same time, I find Luke a much more compelling character in this film, because we see even more layers of him. There isn't much more to say when it comes to the acting, for all of the actors shine through in many, many ways. Even Lando (played by Billy Dee Williams) is fantastic in this movie.The special effects are--as always--phenomenal. I feel like the whole green lightsaber debate amongst fans is silly, but I must add my own two cents: I find the green (or somewhat lime) lightsaber color very extravagant and gorgeous. It is by far my favorite lightsaber design--hilt and blade together--in the entire six-film saga. Space battles and flying teddy bears look a little silly, most of the time, but they are still able to be overlooked for the very fantastic writing and dialogue.I'd say that this film remains my favorite for the fact that the message to it is outstanding. We all struggle with the dark side of mankind. This film gives an excellent portrayal of such an ideology.The writing of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" is enthralling, to say the least. I have to somewhat dislike the Endor scenes, but it was a nice change of scenery from the first two films. We have never had a jungle sequence, and I feel there was nowhere else to go. I also believe that many people would not hate this film (or sequence) if the Ewoks weren't a part of the film. I can relate. However, the dialogue is great in the film--and the events are just as great. I must say that the final duel between Luke and Vader gives me constant chills due to the acting, swordplay, and soundtrack.On another note that I always seem to forget in my ""Star Wars"" film reviews, the soundtrack is beautiful, especially within this film.When it comes to the set designs, I must compliment whoever built them. They did a fine job creating all kinds of realistic places. In all honesty, I feel like this film does a better job than any of the others when it comes to making the viewer feel like they are in a completely new world. It's very entrancing.Overall, I can't NOT give ""Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi"" a full ten-out-of-ten stars. The film has been my life since I was an infant, and I see how glorious it is, even in my adult years. This is brilliant cinema.Merry Christmas, and God bless!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Unfortunately for true Star Wars fans this type of thing carried over to episodes 1,2 and 3 (crap).Anyway the story is actually similar to the first one with the Death Star being destroyed but its actually a lot more involved. One of my fav scenes in at Jabba's palace which I think everyone enjoys. The middle of the film can be a little slow in places but towards the end it gets going again. The space battle is nothing short of fantastic and is possible one of the best scenes in all of the Star Wars movies.The Falcon flying out of the Death Start while it is exploding is awesome.Not as good as the first two but still one of the all time greats!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

You can feel the hate and anger building up in Luke as he gets closer and closer to falling into the dark side.  The music in the last light saber battle between Luke and Darth is superb, it just adds to the intensity.  Every time I watch it I think of the first Star Wars, as you see Luke as a regular boy, but he just wanted a little excitement in his life, but he never expected this.

Luke battles his father, Darth Vader. In 1977, Darth Vader was the epitome of evil, the devil himself. We accepted Luke, Leia and Han Solo as the focus of the story. As the story progressed, we see that the story is really about Anakin, that Vader is really a nice guy who made some bad choices. I had a problem with this.

Very underrated!! A satisfying ending to a wonderful trilogy.,"A lot of people complain about (Return of the) Jedi. Especially the Ewoks get much criticism. ""Only for children"". Also the countless aliens (""muppets in space""). And then there's the second Death Star and a return to Tatooine (""more of the same"")I seriously think Jedi only has 1 minor flaw. The scene where the biker scout gets tapped on the back as a distraction was really stupid. But that doesn't ruin the great experience this film is. This movie has as much action as the previous Star Wars films combined. It has everything: a space armada battle (lacking in Empire), a spectacular lightsaber duel, blaster battles, out-of-this-world creatures, humour and pace. There is also no lack of drama with the developed friendship between the main characters and Luke finally discovering his destiny. The ending could not have been better and was very satisfying.A lot of people tend to forget what sets Star Wars so much apart from  every other movie: design. There's so much design, of spaceships, vehicles, backdrops, numerous aliens, characters and outfits..and it's all brilliant, it's art! It's what makes the Star Wars universe so unique and such a wonderful place for people to spend some time in.

"""Jedi"" closes the trilogy with everything we would expect from STAR WARS.","My Take: As the original STAR WARS series comes to a close, this final chapter has everything fans have hoped for.THE RETURN OF THE JEDI (re-titled as STAR WARS: EPISODE VI-THE RETURN OF THE JEDI during its re-release) is the last (chronologically) of the original STAR WARS trilogy, and it is also a self rating chapter in the series. ""Jedi"" will always be ranked third best in the original trilogy (with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK being the best). It's not as dark and deep as ""Empire"", nor is it quite as original as STAR WARS (Episode IV: A NEW HOPE). Actually, ""Jedi"" owes more on the elements from the original film (including, of course, the Death Star and some of the Jedi duels). But I wouldn't complain, since if this was something else, I wouldn't have liked it. ""Jedi"" has everything I liked about the saga, from the exciting and comic fun of the original, as well as the deepened mythology of the second. Not to mention of course the terrific special effects work which were great, not just because of its innovation, but also the imagination it took to make them.One of the best examples of these wild imaginations in special effects are in the first half of the film which takes place on the crowded palace of the loathsome crime lord Jabba the Hutt. This place is filled with strange-looking beings and bizarre creatures which is almost twice as much than those featured in the Cantina scene in the original STAR WARS. The film opens with those adorable droid duo C3PO (performed by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 entering this creaky palace bargaining for the freedom of Han Solo (HArrison Ford), who is still frozen in carbonate block. This leads to, not one but, two battles between our hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and two gruesome monsters. One lives in a dungeon beneath Jabba's throne room. The other lives in a sandpit and slowly digests its victims for a thousand years, which is an enjoyable and exciting battle in tradition of other entertaining adventure movies. The entertainment continues on later on a battle in a small planet moon introducing a bunch of cute and lovable creatures called Ewoks (probably added to give the film more cutesy as well as irony, since these little bunch of teddy bear-like beings beat the butts out of Imperial troops), as well as a second attempt at yet another Death Star. But one of the most awaited sequence in the film is the final duel between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader (Dave Prowse; voiced by James Earl Jones), which we no know is Luke's Father.THE RETURN OF THE JEDI is the second STAR WARS film that creator George Lucas didn't direct, passing it once again to another director. This time, it's director Richard Marquand, who is really not a match for Lucas in the first film, nor is he definitely a match for Lucas' mentor Irvin Kershner who directed the second. But he still does a fine job, especially when it comes to adding a lot of fun on those exciting sequences, a grand tradition in the STAR WARS legacy. The imagination, both on the special-effects and the storyline, is still not left behind.I am ranking ""Jedi"" on par with the first movie. Though not as deep and cleverly achieved as ""Empire"", ""Jedi"" is still exciting, entertaining, imaginative and anything else positive about a fantasy film. It's just a lovable epic romp with its heart on the right place.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy; although not perfect,"This movie is iconic and deserves its spot among the best of the Star Wars movies; but a lot of the movie isn't very interesting, especially the beginning and some of the time spent on Endor. The action is entertaining, and the characters are great; Darth Vader remains possibly the greatest villain in cinematic history, and Luke Skywalker one of the greatest heroes. The cinematography is great - just as great as in the previous two movies. The soundtrack adds layers to some the more important scenes in the movie - particularly those dealing with the emotions of the characters.In conclusion, this movie was great, but lacking substance at certain moments; nonetheless, it is certainly still worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"""You've failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me""","Well here we are the final installment in the Star Wars trilogy and to an extent a bit of a disappointment, and some parts in the film are of pure quality. The Special Edition treatment does vastly improve the flow of Return of the Jedi and the ending sequence in the Ewok village after the celebrations of the crumbled Empire on Bespin, Mos Eisley and a nicely generated falling statue of the Emperor on Corruscant (Note that i am not explaining the storyline because you should have watched this film) Anyway back to the end sequence, the music allowed the ending to be very moving and the ethereal images of Obi Wan, Yoda and the now redeemed Annakin Skywalker is a nice piece as well. All i can say is this has many good points that the counteract the presence of the ewoks, and the unconceivable reason why all the main characters suddenly just appear (like house guests) at Jabba's Palace. The rest is good, good, good such as a great performance by Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Editing!,"I just finished watching the latest edition for DVD of the first Star Wars Trilogy, and I got two expressly great surprises in the ""Return of the Jedi"", both of which came within the last few minutes before the credits. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised though, after all George Lucas is a GREAT FILMMAKER, and this was GREAT. The first comes about 2:02 into the movie, after the fireworks on the forest moon, when you see the crowds gathering at Coruscant to rejoice that the Emperor is dead and the evil Empire is dissolved. You can clearly hear: Wesa Free! (and if you use subtitles, you'll see it too!) which shows us that JarJar Binks is still alive and kicking! Fun! What's he gonna do in Episode 7...And just a few seconds later... back at the forest moon, when Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin shows up, spiritually, it ain't the figure of Sebastian Shaw that shows up... but the face of Hayden Christensen...

Great Conclusion to an Amazing Trilogy,"Return of the Jedi is a wonderful and satisfying closing to the epic original trilogy. George Lucas set out to make something great, and he far exceeded any expectation that anyone had, giving the world a new galaxy to explore, bringing in a new age of movies, and movie watchers. Giving us characters like Yoda, and Chewbacca and plenty more that have not only stood the test of time, but have transcended it. Star Wars is an every day phrase now, and it's hard to find someone who hasn't at least heard of it, and the force. Blending real life morals (I'm not getting into the theological side of Star Wars) with outer-world settings, with sweeping action and emotion Return of the Jedi provides exactly what this third installment needed, closure. If the other trilogies hadn't happened, these three films would be among the elites of all trilogies. I wish the other sequel films could have captured the same magic as even just Jedi here (but alas at least we still have these to watch again and again), which still holds true as an epic ending to an epic trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"I loved the movie because it is full of great fun and entertainment. The scene close to the end with Luke Skywalker vs. Darth Vader is so intense and so entertaining. The original trilogy is much better than the prequel trilogy, by far. The effects are so realistic. It's hard to believe that this movie was made about 30 years ago. James Earl Jones was the perfect voice for the legendary bad guy, Darth Vader. He just fits the voice so perfectly. George Lucas is a genius. His films changed the world. But sadly this was the end of the trilogy. But don't get me started on Episode I or Episode II. Episode III is great, though, especially the end when young Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. Return of the Jedi is by far the darkest of the trilogy, but not really the best. It is still a great movie, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Utter Garbage,"This movie was the most disappointing thing since my son. With ESB being one of the greatest movies ever, Lucas and co. Thoroughly disappointed with this travesty.Han is neutered beyond belief (Harrison Ford clearly checked out), Carrie Fisher is just abysmal (probably too hopped up on cocaine to care about such things as 'line delivery'), and the movie meanders for 2 hours with pointless Ewoks and a dawdling Emperor. It then ends with a clear re-hash of a New Hope and has no suspense or tension.These actors received no direction, the characters were poorly written, and the plot moves along at a sluggish pace. It is a movie clearly directed at kids, but as a standalone movie and as a follow-up to an all time-great, it is the most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime.I cannot believe how many so called adults have put on their blinders and rated this movie well. It belongs in the trash heap along with the rest of the prequels.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The beginning of the end.,"Everything that fans criticise about the prequel trilogy starts here in Return of the Jedi. The screenplay lacks the humour of the first two films and the characters are serious and barely recognisable from their previous incarnations. Kasdan makes the fatal blunder of keeping our hero's actions mysterious in the first act making Jabba the Hutt the default lead of the film and confusing us as to whose story is really being told. The audience is left cold by Alan Hume's muddy cinematography and Richard Marquand's weak directing - especially in the action sequences which don't come close to those in the first two films. Lucas painted himself into a corner in this respect by quitting the Director's Guild and severely limiting the talent available to him. ILM, Ben Burtt and John Williams acquit them selves admirably as usual and the drama of the Luke/Darth/Emperor confrontation keeps the film afloat despite the rehashed Death Star attack and the goofy Ewok battle. The Ewoks are criticised for being childish and silly even though they are no less silly than say the Jawas in the first film, however the cartoonish alien elements were used as entertainment in the first two stories and didn't factor into the drama of the final battle sequences which is why I think audiences felt something was off in this story. Despite all this it is still our last true journey into the original world of Star Wars, a place we haven't been to since 1983.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Super phenomenal,"The Old trilogy was capped by a film so wonderful and magnificient it is hard to describe the great moments.  Luke's progression as a jedi was a sight to behold, his confidence and courage is one of the many things that made ROTJ so great.

The special effects are still better than most seen in todays films! The first two films in the Star Wars trilogy were fantastic and the finale HAD to be great.  I wasn't disappointed.

The Redemption of Anakin Skywalker/The End,"Here it is. The last episode of the Star Wars saga and the final step of the Skywalker odyssey is a fitting conclusion. The first time I saw this it immediately became my favorite movie off all time. I watched it every week for a year. Then I began to look at it critically. It's not the best Star Wars. It's not the best movie ever made. It's still my favorite though. The idea that Darth Vader can be saved is the reason I hold above the other two.This film wraps up everything nicely. Han Solo is rescued from the bowels of Jabba's palace. Luke returns to Yoda. Luke confronts both Vader and the Emperor. The puzzle comes together. Luke changes so much from the end of ESB to the beginning of this film. The battle with Vader at the end Episode V caused Luke to finally grow up. he becomes his own man. He becomes a Jedi. Darth Vader also has been changed by the confrontation at Bespin. We see Vader as more of a human figure, he's not just this evil machine. He was once a man, a teenager, and a little boy. We feel sorry for him. He's just a pathetic half-man in a cumbersome suit.At the end of the movie you actually care for him. You feel impacted by his last  words on the Death Star II. When you see Anakin with the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda you are relieved. Anakin Skywalker has been saved. Looking at this critically there are a few things that are a step down from the past two films. Harrison Ford seems to be bored with the job of Han Solo. The Ewoks seem like unnecessary addition to make the film more kid-friendly. As the original trilogy was being made it grew up. Star Wars was swashbuckling adventure. Empire was a darker more operatic film that added turmoil to the story and true emotion. In Jedi the most feared man in the universe is saved by his own son. He becomes a father. A lot of the originality seems to be gone because we're used to the material by now. Still this will always be the Star Wars that gives me hope. If Lord Vader can come back. Maybe we all can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The greatest Star Wars movie in my opinion!,"This is the movie that turned my world upside down!! I am an absolute Star Wars geek!! I have a huge collection of figures and even a tattoo of the Imperial logo on my leg. Return of the Jedi is what grabbed me and pulled me into the Star Wars galaxy. I absolutely loved this movie growing up. It's definitely my favorite Star Wars film. Empire is a close second though. The only thing that drives me nuts about the movies is when George Lucas had to ""touch it up"" and he added that horrendous redone band scene in jabbas palace.

"Awesome action, but not quite the overall quality of before","Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi has always been criticized for not matching the quality of Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980). While this is true, hardly anything matches the quality of those films. Jedi comes far closer than most, only failing through an over-simplified plot, some lacklustre acting from Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford (dumbing Han Solo down to a cartoon character, for some reason) and a slow midsection. Oh, and those bloody Ewoks. The teddy bear people are okay for five minutes or so, but far too much time is spent on them when there's much more interesting things going on.Luckily, we get to see much more of the cacklingly evil Emperor and Darth Vader, and Luke becomes a kick-ass Jedi to be reckoned with. The sets, costumes and special effects are superb, as always, and the score is stunning, especially during the Luke versus Vader clash at the climax.ROTJ may not be as good as the previous two Star Wars episodes, but it does have the most action of any of the films. More action than most films, as a matter of fact, and it's fantastic stuff. There's a big battle at the start, several fights and the classic deadly speedbike chase in the middle, and the mother of all battles at the climax - as there should be, this is the finale of the entire six-part Star Wars saga. The Millenium Falcon's attempt to blow up the Death Star is thrilling, as is the final lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader.With lightsabres clashing, laser beams everywhere, spaceships whizzing all over the screen and planets exploding, this is a fittingly spectacular end to a superb series.  If only the beginning, The Phantom Menace, was this good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Yet another great film,"This film continues in the same vein as Episodes IV and V and appeared initially to be more or less ""The End"". Rumors abounded that no more Star Wars films would be made. Of course, that turned out to be untrue and the series continues, but XVI (16) long years would pass between Episode VI and Episode I. Anyway, back to Episode VI. The SFX, basically unchanged since the first film 6 years earlier, are by now beginning to pale in comparison to other films, yet somehow, they are still adequate for this one. This film also marked the end of our now-familiar characters, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. Lucas sure left us hanging at the end of this one.

"Good Star Wars film,Adequate Conclusion.","While by far and away the weakest film in the first trilogy it has some things going for it. The opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt were very well played.The scenes are intense and gripping,Michael Carter's cameo as Bib Fortuna is a delight,and sorry anyone not pleased by the site of Carrie Fisher in the Slave costume must be embalmed. Its not the only reason to watch Fisher though, her performance in those scenes is very ,very, good. its a shame that she,along with Harrison Ford are barely utilized for the remainder of the film ! Ian McDiarmid is a joy to watch as Palpatine, this expert actor from London's Almedia Theatre is one of the finest additions to the Star Wars universe. ( as good as he is here he is even better in  Phantom Menace).With all the good things happening in the first two films though it seems that Lucas needed not a trilogy but a 4 part series, part 3 should have delt with Han's rescue and Luke completing his training. pt. 4 should have been the downfall of the Empire and Anakin's redemption.still its by no means a bad film but more,how should I say, a quick and enjoyable wrap up.

Awful beyond imagination,"While the pl-astic acting performances in the first two SW movies is outweighed by the plot, Star Wars 3 does not have that help. SW3 is the movie of the trilogy wherein Luke must confront his father. However, his father, now a sort of quasi-sympathetic greek hero, is not longer the Darth Vader we grew to love.As the movie develops we are forced to sit through some ridiculous jamesbondian recoveries and some muppets who are stubborn and cute and an unbelievable choice.I am always drawn to the scene where Leia must incapacitate the empire's scouts.

Entertaining ending to what became a formula series,"Star Wars series wraps up (at least Episodes 4-6) with mildly entertaining finale.

Forest planet of Endor becomes the focal point for final showdown between Empire and Rebel forces.  It's peopled (surprise) by cute little spunky, furry creatures.  By this time, story line has aged a little too much, and we're starting to see repeats of earlier plot devices.

Little furry Eworks native to the moon of Endor steal the show as adorable little fuzzy teddy bear- like creatures that hilariously worship C-3PO and attempt to roast Han Solo & Luke on an open pit.

Ambitious Conclusion Hindered by Lengthy Battle Scenes and Unexplained Plot Choices,"Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, unfortunately falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors. While the film has its moments of excitement and emotional resonance, it is marred by a few glaring issues that hinder the overall viewing experience.One of the main drawbacks of Return of the Jedi is the excessive length and pacing issues, particularly in the forest battle scene and the ice planet sequences. The extended battles in these settings tend to drag on, diluting the tension and impact of the overall narrative. The constant back-and-forth between the Rebel Alliance and the Imperial forces becomes monotonous, leading to a sense of fatigue rather than anticipation. The film could have benefited from tighter editing and a more focused approach to maintain audience engagement.Another disappointing aspect is the lack of proper explanation for the quick rebuilding of the second Death Star. The sudden appearance of a fully operational battle station without a clear backstory or reasoning feels like a missed opportunity for narrative development. Viewers are left questioning the logistics and implications of this significant plot point, which unfortunately undermines the overall coherence and depth of the story.While Return of the Jedi has its share of iconic moments and character arcs, it feels like a missed opportunity to explore deeper themes and emotional arcs. The film leans heavily on nostalgia and familiar faces, which may appease die-hard fans but may leave others wanting more substance and innovation. The Ewok subplot, while intended to provide some light-hearted moments, often comes across as contrived and pandering to a younger audience.Despite these criticisms, Return of the Jedi does have its strengths. The performances of the core cast, including Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine, are commendable and deliver moments of emotional resonance. The final confrontation between Luke and Vader provides a satisfying conclusion to their complex relationship and the overarching struggle between good and evil.In conclusion, while Return of the Jedi contains elements that fans of the original trilogy will appreciate, it is hampered by lengthy battle scenes that become tiresome, unexplained plot choices surrounding the Death Star's reconstruction, and missed opportunities for deeper storytelling. The film may still hold nostalgic value for some, but it ultimately falls short of its potential and lacks the same impact and innovation found in its predecessors.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Sci-Fi Ever,"This movie is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. This movie is the best of the original three star wars movies, each Sci-Fi masterpieces in their own right. The special effects are the most advanced of the first three. The thing that really got me, though, was Darth Vader. You can really see his struggle. The way he changes subjects whenever Luke mentions there is still good in him is a master stroke of script writing. He is such a dynamic character it is scary. Excluding the main character from Vertigo, I have never seen someone show their emotions in such a realistic way.

How is Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back higher on the Top 250 list than Return of the Jedi?,"First off, I'm happy to see that all of the original three Star Wars movies are on the IMDb's Top 250 movies list.  But to say that The Empire Strikes back is better than Return of the Jedi is ludacris!The Empire Strikes Back does have a nice fight scene in the Battle of Hoth, but other than that, the movie's plot unfolds too slowly.  Frankly, the whole Dagobah episode with Yoda is rather boring compared to most of the other scenes in all of the orginal three movies.  Add to that the fact that Return of the Jedi has arguably the best land/space battle of all time and it grows harder and harder for me to see how Return of the Jedi is ranked #105 and The Empire Strikes Back is ranked #16.I can't help but notice the order of the Star Wars movies on IMDb's Top 250 list is in the same order that the movies were released (A New Hope at #7, The Empire Strikes Back at #16, and Return of the Jedi at #105). Contrary to the overwhelmingly popular opinion, the quality of movies does not always follow the order in which the movies were released!I apologize for my harshness, but seeing the large gap between TESB's ranking and ROTJ's ranking gives me great sorrow - especially since I just looked at the Top 250 list for the first time today.For those of you who are die hard Star Wars fans I would ask you to re-watch both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Look at the movies as a whole and think about their overall plots.  Remember that in Return of the Jedi we find out Leia is really Luke's long lost twin sister, the second Death Star actually is quite fully armed and operational, and Ewok's can take on the Empire with their furry hands tied behind their backs.For those of you who haven't seen Return of the Jedi, go see it.  It is a great Science Fiction work of art.  Give it a rating of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just a personal opinion from a fan,"I will do this review simple. It had great special effects for the epoch, I must admit. I enjoyed this movie so much when I was little, and until now I remember the emotion I lived when I saw it. The fierce battles, the hope the protagonists had. Their emotions were easy to see, how they reacted against the Empire's attacks. Yet, the young Jedi was able to confront them, and finish all this universal war, thanks to his bond with his father, a bond too hard to break, not even the Emperor could. You can also experience the war with other living thins, like the wookies, something we can out in real life: we as humans, needed the animals for wars and battles, and now, is very helpful for our alimentation. There are many other things we can get from all the franchise, but it is up to you if you want to watch it. Yet, I highly recommend to see this fantastic movie, there will have some feelings and emotions that will go through you. You will love the movies, I can tell you from my personal experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fitting end to the the classic series,"Star Wars: Episode VI-The Return of the Jedi is a fitting ending to the original series of films, it keeps what we like from the first two but also adds in new things along the way. I did feel this isn't anywhere near the par that IV and V reach but still remains an important film in Star Wars and is also, not bad. The film is one I don't expect people to say is there favourite but I also wouldn't criticise someone if they did love this. I felt it to be firmly a sound movie and here below is why so.The story is not that fast but still gets a lot in for it's running time, the introduction of a lot of new features, characters and locations mean this is never a movie where your seeing double of the previous movies. It has good action and although maybe lacks the space fights etc we so often see spread out in other series films, it still manages to give you the right amount of thrills throughout. One more thing is that the story ties everything round nicely and it's fair to say this is one of the better film franchise endings.The cast remain strong and the main characters we like so much are also back with even more diverse roles and personality. I did feel the chemistry can sometimes seem strained maybe but by the end this is one of the only Star Wars originals where Harrison Ford doesn't out show everyone else. As for new characters well there not so much actual people so it can't be said it is acted well in that way but all credit to all the extras involved who play a vast amount of alien races.Richard Marquand comes in to direct on this one and although not ruining the already legendary series, he can't be said to contribute much and I have to feel slightly sorry for him to make a good film, just eclipsed by two amazing films before. Kasdan and Lucas do well with the script and the screenplay is pretty nice here but I did feel the actual playing out of the story is not that well pieced together. I felt this is better choreographed than previous, better duels, gun battles etc make this more fast paced in the action area and one of the better things about this movie.My main critical points are mostly about the film just never being THAT good but yet again I'm comparing it to it's previous two films. It just isn't as richly emotional yet also not as funny as the others, fun yes but lacks the smiles we need from the main cast. I also wasn't too keen on the ending, is it rushed well maybe but in any case it still delivers nicely, just not as nice as I think the proposed ending should be.I think die hard Star Wars fans will like this but I am not sure if they will love it, for the amount of criticism which was levied against Star Wars in the future prequels, this film is never seen as any less to New Hope and Empire when in reality it never reaches the others heights. For anyone not a fan of the series this is still fun and you should enjoy it as it is a fitting ending and really brings the story full circle in a way which is soundly done.Overall I felt it to be Firmly a Good film, not quite being near to very good. Yes with more Star Wars after this film we can safely say this is not the ending anymore but still serves an a finish to a classic three films in the 70's and 80's which to be fair, even if this movie isn't an instant classic, it is still part of an almost flawless original series of films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So emotional and great,"Return of the Jedi, the grand crescendo of the original trilogy that left me feeling the Force in every fiber of my being. The acting? Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill deliver iconic performances, breathing life into characters we've come to adore. Film editing? Lightsaber duels, space battles, and Ewok celebrations are woven together with the precision of a Jedi's saber skills. Strengths? Jabba's palace, the Emperor's malevolence, and the redemption arc of Darth Vader-all shining like stars in the galaxy of storytelling. Weaknesses? Ewoks may be divisive, but their teddy bear charm is a small blip in a saga of epic proportions. The music? John Williams' symphony captures the emotional spectrum, from the Imperial March to the uplifting notes of victory. The message? A tale of redemption, family, and the unyielding power of hope in the face of darkness. Cinematography? A visual feast that transports us from the forest moon of Endor to the throne room of the Death Star, creating a universe that feels both fantastical and familiar. 8/10 is a nod to its status as a space opera masterpiece, a finale that echoes in the hearts of Star Wars fans across the galaxy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
May The Farce Be With You,"Star Wars: A New Hope was a refreshing & adventurous movie with a rather simple story about good verses evil. The Empire Strikes Back was more of the same with more aliens until we arrive at Return Of The Jedi.By this installment, the story takes a backseat to the action & humor. In fact, the whole movie is played for laughs. The problem is the laughs involve the interaction of increasingly ridiculous aliens with increasingly ridiculous military machines. (Didn't they learn their lesson in the first movie to NOT build military transport vehicles with long legs? No, because they're back again, this time with a model sporting silly rabbit legs.) The special effects are shockingly cheesy involving a lot of blue screen, bad stop action animation on par with the Godzilla of the 30's, and Muppets. The story has dissolved into a soap opera with Vader turning out to be Luke's father & Luke actually believing that Darth Vader has some empathy in him, when Vader is supposed to be the epitome of evil, and the discovery of long lost family ties that are never explained. (Let's just say it's a good thing Luke never lay'd Leia in the first 2 flicks.) Just when you think the rebellion is finished (what with only Luke & the Princess remaining), all of the sudden, at the end, they have a huge fleet of fighters again. Where did they get the recruits? Where did they get the financing? Who the hell is in charge?? And always, there are those stupid white-armored troops running around shooting everything who are so inept, they only manage to wing Princess Leia by the 3rd movie. Their amour couldn't stop a spit ball. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing the new Death Star will hurry up & blow up OR the Empire will finally beat down the rebellion once & for all & make Leia Darth Vader's sex slave or something. And c'mon: a showdown with the supreme bad guy who can kill a person with psychic energy shooting out of his fingers? That's so B-movie clichéd. The dude's psychic energy turned out not to be very strong when he is killed just be being thrown down an elevator shaft by Mr. Vader himself. A real eye-rolling moment.At least it's better than the 4th, er, that is, 1st episode (whatever) which is sleep inducing.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""There's only one return, you f*****g morons, and it's not 'of the King,' it's 'of the Jedi!'"" - Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), in ""Clerks II"" (2006)","As far as I'm concerned, I think Randal's right. There's really only one ""Return"" that I prefer to watch over & over again and that's ""Return of the Jedi,"" directed in 1983 by the late Richard Marquand and is the final film in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. We should all know by now that Kevin Smith is a staunch ""Star Wars"" loyalist, so I won't fault him there.I honestly have nothing personal against the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy that was so meticulously constructed by Peter Jackson from J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark fantasy novels; it's just that I'm a life-long ""Star Wars"" geek and Jackson had it comparatively easier in trying to get those movies made, not to mention a deeply entrenched fan-base supporting his efforts. ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas had to start from scratch and fight an uphill battle almost every step of the way to get ""Star Wars"" (1977) and its sequels to the screen, with little help or backing from the studio and most of all, almost no one believed in his story or vision, creativity or ingenuity.And only now, more than a quarter of a century later, do people finally ""get"" the significance of ""Star Wars"" and what Lucas achieved in 1977.""Return of the Jedi,"" for the longest time, was probably my favorite of the original trilogy; astute readers will realize ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) is my favorite ""Star Wars"" film all around (2005's ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the best from the prequel trilogy, in my opinion). At different times, I've considered all the original films a ""favorite,"" but a long while ago I realized the towering achievement and perfection that was ""The Empire Strikes Back.""Like everyone else, I'll mostly agree that ""Return of the Jedi"" is by far the weakest of the original trilogy. But that does not mean it's bad or even remotely disappointing. In fact, it's actually very good and very much a thrilling science fiction adventure film from start to finish. I guess the primary reason ""Return"" suffers in comparison is because it appears to be somewhat of a step down in terms of what was achieved in ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" A lot of people seem to criticize the lighter, more family-friendly root that Lucas's story took in this film, most notably with the inclusion of the cute & cuddly Ewoks of forest-moon Endor (which aren't nearly as bad as some people would make them out to be and they do provide some light comic relief during the otherwise intense battle scenes toward the end) and the cleaner resolution for the overall saga. This was a swift change considering the darker story and direction that George Lucas decided to take with ""The Empire Strikes Back.""The film still flies high on its revolutionary special effects - which, 30 years later, still knock most of the CGI-laden spectacles of 2013 Hollywood out of the water - captivating story, entrenched multi-dimensional characters, and brilliant action sequences. ""Return of the Jedi"" is still a first-degree special effects spectacle.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best of Star Wars,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie. I know that a lot of fans say that it is the worst of the old movies. But I disagree.

It also have the best opening scene I've ever seen. The hole thing at Jabba's place is just great.

What more do you want from a film?,"This is a fantastic film. It provides the perfect end to the best trilogy that there will ever be. With everything from action, comedy, romance, adventure, suspense, and something for the kids how this film cannot be loved by everyone is beyond me.After doing the critically acclaimed Episode in Empire Strikes Back Lucas provides the ultimate fairy tale ending. The ultimate Good conquers Evil storyline and the ultimate movie franchise. He mixes an intricate storyline in with grand scale battle scenes that keep you gripped from beginning to end. Topping it all off the improved effects are amazing. Let's not forget this was 20 years ago. A trilogy that will survive all ages and always capture new audiences and gain new fans is given a perfect ending. I defy even the toughest of tough guys to not smile when an Ewok steals the speeder bike.

great film but flawed,"I thought the Vader star destroyer space shuttle thing was great!! However, I also think that they could have done away with those stupid, squeaky, annoying Ewoks! If anything spoilt that film for me, it was them. I mean, they were brave little fighters and all that, but they were - and come on lets admit this - annoying!! As for the plot, yeah, i agree, it was just like the first film. Maybe they could have come up with a bit of a different idea than another Death Star (Yawn!) For Heaven's sake! Didn't they learn their lesson in the first place. And anyway, whenever Darth Vader let the shuttle land on the moon of Endor, he knew he was in for it.Also, the Gamorrean Guard's of Jabba the Hut were not, i believe, convincing, as all they looked like to me were pumped up green pigs. Even the Rancor monster was obviously a model, and not very convincing at all. Oh, and let me ask a question, why did they have to blow up the station which controlled the energy shield with 'charges' as if they were in the SAS or something? Oh yes, and R2D2 sounded different. And why does Chewbacca not have meat and two veg. Doesn't he need to reproduce? That guy must be really frustrated, maybe that's why he keeps grunting all the time.Good points - loved the emperor - really menacing and evil. Thought the scene when Luke batters his father near to death was also quite awesome, with the emperor laughing in the background. etc. The scene when Darth Vader realises he's done wrong, i found quite moving also.If only it hadn't been for those stupid Ewoks!

Let me explain,"OK, I am going to catch heat for saying this..but this is my FAVORITE movie in the franchise. Now before anybody loses their minds based on what I've just said, please allow me to explain. First off, I love four out of the six Star Wars movies made...yes, four. But the reason this one is so close to my heart is because there is so much depth and cinematography in this film. first off, there is very little, but also very much change to characters in this episode. Obviously, Luke Skywalker being the main example of character progression throughout the series. In this film, he finally embraces the way of the Jedi and at the same time, carries many qualities of a Sith as well. He does have anger and hate, and that is what drives him to the conclusion of this movie, and that is what I love about it. Also, the progression of the relationship between Han and Leigha..absolutely amazing. You literally cannot talk about Star Wars without talking about that romantic side of the story. And it is perfectly revealed in this movie. Yes, it may not be the best written of the episodes, or even the best film of the episodes, but the elements within the film are enough to warrant this film a perfect 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Chief Chirpa,"So its now been confirmed that ROTJ is the final Star Wars film (although im willing to bet the studios wont be able to resist trying to squeeze a few more golden eggs from the Star Wars Goose. With or without GL's consent). So what do we think of the end of the worlds greatest saga?Well, the first thing that struck me was that Darth Vader is actually a bit of a pussy. One of the most dangerous men in the galaxy gets bested in a dual, has his hand cut off by a part time Jedi (two training sessions with yoda? Wow!) and dies after taking Sith lightning for half the time the said part time Jedi did. Although, he is More machine than man' so the lightning probably would have blown a fuse or two, so I can forgive him for that.Seriously though, I think ROTJ will stand the test of time. Yes the cloying Ewoks are insanely irritating (it is quite funny when they get blown up. Beechawawa!) but the battle of Endor is good and the speeder bikes are cool. The whole Jabbas palace bit is very good. Everyone tricks their way in and gets caught out and the sarlaac pit monster sequence is great.

I Have a Bad Feeling About This,"This movie does not get the credit that the first two movies get. It kinda lives in the shadow of the first two. I guess so many people expected so much out of this movie. Technology definitely had come some length from the first movie. The movie still heavily relied on human acting and emotinons, yet still maintained comical seriousness. But there is something about this film that just doesn't live up to the first two.I know a lot of people dislike the Ewoks. I do agree that they take away from the seriousness of the situation. Lucas did not direct this one either. The acting and storyline is still phenomenal and great.All the cast does a great job at portraying the characters. Yoda and Obi-Wan still offer guidance throughout. And Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are at there best.It definitely is a great Star Wars movie and great way to end the trilogy. But it burns me up so much to see that Lucas has went back and ""added"" CGI effects to the original trilogy. It ruined the prequels. I guess Lucas was just not satisfied with them. The original three could not get much better. And it makes me so mad to see Hayden Christianson at the end of this film replacing Sebastion Shaw as the ghost of Anikan Skywalker.

Nice conclusion to all the Star Wars sagas up to this point,"This movie got the unfair share of having to tie all the loose ends from the first two movies, and never reached the streamlined splendor of the ESB and ANH.The character designs aren't as polished as the first two movies that takes away from the polished appearances. The production probably moved little further away from Lucas' own hands and became more team effort. But compared to the Star Wars episodes 1-3, this is more of pure adventure, and we get to enjoy the action in unadulterated ways. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are great in this movie. It's kind of shocking to see how young Harrison Ford looked in this series.There's something special about the visuals of this Star Wars series. It instantly makes you feel good in some magical ways.This is somewhat of the conclusion for the long saga that continued from The Phantom Menace. I'm hoping that next trilogy will be made more in the spirit of this trilogy. I'm certain that another trilogy of Star Wars will be made.

Finally a story that improves the more they make movies about it.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, and the Empire Strikes Back it's now time for Return Of The Jedi. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better and so is Return Of The Jedi but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1983 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One that I thought was of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the eighth movie of eleven in barely 72 hours for me, next one today will be the series The Mandalorian as I saw they recommend you to watch it between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens if you want to watch it in chronological order. I'm sure the quality will be even better as it's so more recent, looking forward to it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Garbage. An unwatchable, defaced classic.","I begin this review by noting that I write it having just watched the only currently available version of the film on Disney + (July 2021) which is NOT the original.I also begin by noting that had I been able to watch the original, rather than the mucked up mess that is the current version, I would be writing a much different review right now which wasn't so focused on how the movie ends.Anyway, let me get right to my point: the ending sucks.To put this in context, I watched the whole original trilogy over a three day stretch. What I was really left with at the end was the feeling that I really hated the current versions of all three, but with Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back I at least had the consolation that they ended well mainly because they left the endings as they originally were. At the end of Star Wars, Luke and Han get their medals like they always did and the music and everything is the same. Its literally music to your ears, you feel good watching it. Likewise with Empire, Luke and Leia are still on the medical frigate watching the Falcon fly off as the Rebel fleet slowly limps along, the wonderful closing melody ending the film on a soft note of hope. I just love that ending scene in Empire, its one of my favorite movie closes of all time.The original ending of ROTJ was a pretty solid one. Luke burns Vader's body, then joins all his friends with the Ewoks for a celebration that also had the feeling of a cast and crew wrapping up party after 6 years of hard work making the most amazing set of movies ever produced. The Ewok music was nice and blended perfectly into the end theme, striking exactly the right emotional note that left you feeling good.Now that has all been screwed up beyond belief. They've added a whole new 90s song and dance number in there which features cutaways to CG shots of locations that appear nowhere in the trilogy. Its stupid and distracting and just sucks all the emotion out of the end sequence.Then to top it off they go and add Hayden Christiansen's force ghost to the final shot just to make you mad. That is the last thing you see as the movie ends. Hayden Christiansen. The guy who goes on about sand in Attack of the Clones. He wraps up the original trilogy now.So unlike the first two, where you can almost tune out the stupid add-ons and forget about them by the end, ROTJ doesn't allow you to do that. It leaves you with them front and centre in your mind. It just makes the movie absolutely unwatchable.Oh and also they added a lengthy 1990s song and dance number to the Jabba's palace scene, which is another thing that separates this movie from the others. Star Wars is the only other one with a notable musical number in the canteena and to their credit they decided to leave that one mostly alone.I really hope Disney will consider releasing the original versions at some point, Return of the Jedi in particular deserves better than what the currently available version of itself is presenting to the public. Its an embarrassment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"'Woks, Jabba, Alien Musicians - Fun for everyone.","This is my favourite of the Star Wars films. I'm referring to the original without the excess CGI. I love the Ewoks, especially Wicket.

Jabba himself is a delightful creation. Fortunately Yoda, who I found annoying in Empire, only has minimum involvement. There are humorous moments, romance & valour. The Ewoks have the right blend of cuteness & savagery. You can also watch them in ""Caravan of Courage"" & ""Battle for Endor"". The cartoon is good too.

Return,"Where do I start? A wonderful ending to a much loved trilogy of films, a magnificent display of science fiction visuals, and a master class in character development. It is a charming and fitting finale to the expanded universe of Star Wars; at this point in time anyway, we can only hope for a decent seventh instalmentWhile often considered to not be on the same level as episodes IV and V, episode VI at least serves its own purpose in the franchise; a fine purpose that all fantasy and adventure stories have a happy ending. We finally get to see the movie industry's greatest antagonist in a good light and we get more startling discoveries as the story goes on, but I won't mention any here, just in case of that one in a million chance that you're reading this and you haven't seen this movie yet.There's really not much to say that I haven't already said for the other two films in the original Star Wars trilogy. The musical score is top notch as ever, but I have to say that I much prefer the track 'Victory Celebration' from the film's re-releases than the song 'Yub Nub' which was used in the film's original celebration scene. I just find 'Victory Celebration' to be so much more ambient as everybody celebrates and reunites, and what a reunion scene it is, but once again I'll let you find out for yourself, though I am aware I could click the 'spoiler alert' button.But yes, the creative imagination of George Lucas returned with 'Return', so let's hope for the best for the future of the greatest Sci-fi series ever made!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very entertaining but flawed finale.,"Firstly, this is a very entertaining film. However, it doesn't reach the heights of the previous two films as story decisions seem to have been influenced by merchandising opportunities and performances by some of the cast are not convincing.The films first 40 minutes is absolutely thrilling, clearly setting up the situations of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, as well as the final confrontation between the Rebel Alliance and the forces of the Empire, led by Ian McDiarmid in a terrific performance as Emperor Palpatine. It is the trio of Palpatine, Vader (physically played by David Prowse, stuntman Bob Anderson and veteran actor Sebastian Shaw, and voiced superbly by James Earl Jones) and Luke Skywalker (well played by Mark Hamill) that hold the rest of the film together and this 3 way confrontation gives this film is heart and dramatic punch. The director this time around is Richard Marquand, whose previous experience was a couple of low budget, dramatic British films focusing in performances of the actors rather than big set pieces. Most of the action sequences were either visual effects sequences done by Lucas's ILM company or shot by the second unit directors David Tomblin and George Lucas himself. However Marquand seemed to understand what the real dramatic meat of the story was, and arc of the Emperor, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader where most of his energy seems to have gone into, and in this regard it was well worth it. These scenes play out with the drama and tension they need to, and make for a thrilling and emotional climax to the trilogy. It is also fascinating to watch the sub-relationships in this trio, the Vader vs Palpatine, Vader vs Skywalker and Palpatine vs Skywalker, which build particularly on events set up in the previous film. Hamill turns in a solid performance, and is best in the scenes with Vader, Palpatine and his brief re-unifications with Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi, again played with grace and gravitas by Frank Oz and Alec Guinness respectively.However, the other characters were given less development. Carrie Fisher was used more as eye candy in the first third of the film, and her character is far more passive and less interesting this time round. In the previous film, the romantic ménage a trois that is hinted at in Episode V is not explored to the fullness that it could have been. Finding out that Luke is Leia's brother doesn't come off as with the impact it should. Harrison Ford's character is similarly just along for the ride, and both him and Fisher seem less interested this time around, and their performances are either bland or too broad. Plans to kill some of these characters off, particularly Han Solo, would have been a bolder and more dramatic choice and would have built on some of the drama that we saw in Episode V and would see in spades some 22 years later in Episode III. In fact the characters of Han Solo, Princess Leia, R2D2, C3P0 and even Luke Skywalker all suffer because of the decision to have them entangle with a bunch of silly saccharine teddy bears called Ewoks. It seems a decision was made to aim the film at a new, much younger audience, which would buy lots of toys, rather than acknowledging the previous audience, which would have been growing up watching these films. After all, it makes a mockery of stormtroopers with loads of high tech sci-fi technology being bettered by Teddy Bears with rocks and stones!However, the space battle sequences, which is where Billy Dee Williams Lando character ends up (though no proper explanation is given how this outsider who struck a deal with the Empire would be let in so easily by the Rebel Alliance) works well as one of the secondary plots. ILMs work was again outstanding. Not surprisingly Richard Edlund collected his 4th Academy Award for visual effects (having been previously honoured for his work on the previous 2 Star Wars Films and Raiders of the Lost Ark), Dennis Muren collected his 3rd Academy Award, having previously won for Empire Strikes Back and ET. He would go on to win further Academy recognition with the films Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doon, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2, and the outstanding digital work on Jurassic Park. Ken Ralston one his first Academy Award on this film, and would go on receive more for his work on Cocoon, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Death Becomes Her and Forrest Gump. Veteran Stop-Motion Artist Phil Tippett won his first Academy Award on this film, would also win a second for his work on Jurassic Park.The shortcomings highlighted previously are also masked by other outstanding technical contributions. Alan Hume's photography is stylish, particularly the scenes on Dagobah and in the Emperor's residence on the Death Star. The editing team of Sean Barton, Dwayne Dunham, Marcia Lucas and George Lucas did a terrific job of creating a wonderfully paced film, that moves so quickly the flaws whizz by and its only when you think about this film afterwards do you realise that there were some serious issues. Norman Reynolds set design is yet again superb. John Williams who possibly is the artist who most understands these films, producing a wonderfully emotional and exciting score.Unfortunately the later digital enhancements went too far in Episode VI. While for the most part they are fine, the decision to replace Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen, was in my view a major error and for me spoils the ending. After all, how could Luke Skywalker relate to this apparition? It would have been better to leave the original actor in, of if a change was warranted, why not an older Mark Hamill or even a morph of Hayden Christensen and Hamil?Overall an entertaining but flawed finale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great finish,"Return Of The Jedi is the second best film in Episodes 4-6. I remember the first time was back in 1988. My mom rented it for me and we had a film festival with all the films in one day. My only problem with the film is that it wasn't dark like the second film and those damn Ewoks ! Damn the Ewoks, Damn them to hell!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underrated...,"By 1983, the market had become so saturated with Star Wars and science fiction clones that programs were beginning to fail left and right. Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.At its heart, Return Of The Jedi is the story of one boy who has (finally) grown into a man, and started to face his destiny. He starts off in this by demonstrating that he has mastered one aspect of the Force, in that he can reliably use its powers to his advantage. After doing so, he is told by one of his old mentors that he is just about to face the real test of resisting the temptation to use it in an overtly evil fashion. It's painfully oversimple at times, and sadly indicative of Lucas' tendency to see everything in black and white, but it works.What makes it work is not Lucas' creative direction, but rather the input of others. The climactic phase of the duel on the new Death Star is a perfect example of this. Here, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill, John Williams, and Richard Marquand all band together to deliver a performance that, in 1983, had every audience member holding their hands over their mouths in sheer tense panic at what they thought was happening. When it twists and turns back and forth to its climax, the surprise factor is enough to make the audience forget that it really is clichéd to an extreme. In other words, it works.It also highlights one thing that Lucas seems to have forgotten in the past twenty-two years. Namely that in any film, regardless of its theme, the human performance element is always the most important. In contrast to later films, the majority of what the viewer sees here was built on a set and could be interacted with in front of the camera while the film was being shot. In simpler language, the performances have more impact because the actors aren't struggling to plant themselves in the reality of a scene where they are almost the only things on the set.Another area where Return Of The Jedi excels is its sense of humour. The numerous booby traps and improvised war machines improvised by the Ewoks deliver some well-timed laughs. Peter Mayhew must have been glad at this time to not be the only person on the shoot who had to struggle with being covered head to foot in fur, too. Matter of fact, it seems the entire cast is more relaxed this time around.If there is one problem with the film, it is that dialogue which would have helped the human element of the story to some degree has mostly been left out. Questions like what Yoda would think of his last student going on such a major rampage against an admittedly despicable crime figure, for instance, are never answered.Delving for a minute into another slight problem, the special edition ""improvements"" were just a bit unnecessary. One has to wonder what the crew who invested countless hours into making the puppetry work for the musical number in Jabba's palace thought of the new number. Putting aside the annoying performers for a second, the number they chose is really awful. It seems we are going to have two competing visions of the future, music-wise. Lucas appears to support the Backstreet Boys version. Seriously, the number in the palace is so clichéd and predictable you can predict every repeated line without having heard the song before. Give me Basil and Zoë Poledouris' number in StarShip Troopers, any day.Overall, however, I felt Return Of The Jedi was worthy of nine out of ten. It was a slight improvement over A New Hope, and a slight letdown after The Empire Strikes Back. However, even compared independently of the prequels, it is a fun ride that involves a little higher thought on the part of the viewer, which is always a good thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it,"Some people have problems with this, but then again, some people have problems with anything other than Empire Strikes Back.  This movie is a mixed bag, thuogh it IS enjoyable.

my personal favorite,"i agree that this episode may be the weakest for true SW fans, but i still consider it the most enjoyable one. It's the only one that really never gets boring, while the other ones were. It's the only one that has a really good, emotional sword fight. The only thing that disappointed me was that there was again a Death Star to destroy, and the Ewoks were indeed annoying. The special effects are definitely improved, and the very last scene on Endor was very well made and it gave you that heart warming feeling that everything turned out ok.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A decent ending to the first trilogy.,"The highlight of this movie is of course, Lukes battle with Vader. It shows how the young Jedi has grown, as well as the point where he could destroy what's left of his father, and doesn't. Palpatine is quite evil and easy to not like, and the space battles are as usual, brilliant. The Ewoks show Lucas fear of technology and he uses them to show that nature wins over technology. (Reminds me of Tolkien who also feared technology). A fun movie I only wish the scene where Luke builds his new lightsaber was left in.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"An engaging, often resounding, finale which hits more notes than it misses.","The original Star Wars franchise here goes out with a bang and not a whimper, in the 'sixth' episode of the popular franchise, as it certainly deserves to. Conspicuously, the ""Star Wars"" brand name and its original trilogy had eluded me until a fairly recent point in my life, when a combination of chance and sheer bloody mindedness saw me finally sit down and see them. While it would be dishonest to remark that I share in the unabashed, unchecked and often maddening enthusiasm for the films that others certainly have, I cannot say I disliked them and the way ""Return of the Jedi"" rounded off loose ends; did well to keep fresh characters who might otherwise have become tiresome and told its own narrative, was satisfying.Principally, this Episode Six is a combination of what worked best in Episodes Four and Five: the old tale of a rebel alliance looking to destroy an intergalactic structure known as the Death Star is back, while a secondary narrative to do with the franchise's protagonist Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) simultaneously confronting Darth Vader and learning to conquer a mythic pseudo-philosophy known as 'The Force' props proceedings up. Action-packed and romantic do battle, in a sense, with contemplative and familial melodrama.What is, perhaps, most peculiar about the film is that it does not blast off into being a full-on action-adventurer until exactly the 50 minute point. Also quite striking is the fact that, from the moment C3PO utters his first lines, there is not a single instance of two characters that are not either robots or alien creatures communicating to one another for about forty minutes. On my first crack at the film, I did not even notice this but realised it suddenly on my second go - credit must go to those responsible for being involved in such fantastic makeup and costuming.The film's opening captions finally inform us that the war which has dogged the franchise is over ""freedom"", something the alliance fights for and something the Empire, seemingly, wish to do away with. A new Death Star is being constructed; the opening shots reveal it to look about 80% finished, so there is a sense of urgency to events from the off. Darth Vader lands on it, looking for answers on why it isn't finished - he speaks of the yet unseen Emperor, who runs the entire outfit, and reminds us that he's much nastier, which cleverly builds the off-screen character up through dialogue.The film's opening act is essentially a continuation of where we left off prior: Harrison Ford's Han Solo is still frozen-solid in a block of something-or-other, and is captive to a large slug-like alien known as a Hutt named Jabba, having been taken to him in-between episodes. Our heroes, led by Luke, set out to rescue him from Jabba's decrepit desert-set palace-prison with a scheme which seemingly involved Leia (Carrie Fisher) being caught as well; Luke doing battle with a giant monster in an inescapable pit and then later standing on a plank looking at oblivion in the form of a creature consisting of tentacles and a mouth buried in the sand. Was this all part of the plan? How did he know the entire crew would even be taken out into the desert at all?Eventually, differences are settled, one way or another, and the film moves on into territory perhaps more synonymous with the franchise when, as in Episode 4, the force behind the push to defeat the Empire congregates in a control room and deliberates a plan of attack. The Star itself is orbiting a moon known as Endor, which consists largely of dense woodland - the attack will break off into two parts: a fleet of ships will hit the Star directly while a platoon of soldiers, led by Solo, will infiltrate the moon in order to find and disable a power station allowing the Star to shield itself.This is all standard stuff, perhaps made a little less interesting than Episode Five by the fact Solo and Leia know how they feel for one another. More interesting is the character of Skywalker, who has an emotional heart-to-heart with mentor Yoda (Frank Oz) in which, subversively, the protagonist realises he must fight the antagonist, although does not want to. Luke is now a trained Jedi, so is no match for anybody in the combat stakes - in a lesser film, he would be the invincible lead too easily hacking his way to the endgame, but is here made vulnerable to falling, potentially, to the 'dark' side of the force thus undoing all his training. This being prone to something is vital for a sense of there being something at stake; for there being a sense the hero might fail. Scenes involving Luke; Vader and the Emperor on this strand are the best in the film. When the final duel arrives, it is as much a war of words fought in the minds and souls of the characters as it is between lightsabers.The other strand involves the rest of the gang gunning their way towards the power station, although are seemingly no match for a tiny race of neutral furry creatures known as Ewoks who capture them, but then befriend them. There is a peculiar moment whereby C3PO and R2D2 retell the entire Star Wars narrative to this point to these tiny animals, sort of a cross between a bushbaby and a Yorkshire terrier, in order to warrant their support and they listen on in absolute fascination - is the point here that WE are the primitive Ewoks, who have thus far fallen for all of it too? Whatever anything is supposed to point towards, ""Return of the Jedi"" is a ripping yarn which, say it quietly, even graduates into being halfway intelligently made on more than one occasion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Star Wars original trilogy finishes with a bang,"The first two films were enthralling; would the third carry it out? While not as powerful as the first two, Return of the Jedi does not fail to entertain.

The plot makes sense and delivers the same fun punch as the previous films. Seeing the characters evolve over the three films is a pleasure and the trilogy ends nicely here, we feel resolved by the film's happy energy, which is the best way to end a saga. In chorus with its predecessors, it remains a strong piece of storytelling and special effects.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"5.9/10 - Starts Well, Then Getting Too Silly","Now, after finishing this classic trilogy, I can say for sure: It's not bad, but I'm far from being the biggest fan. The first one was rather fun, the second one was pretty good, and now we're here. The closer. My expectations weren't high - I knew that this one is controversial, too - but they weren't too low, either. I just hoped for a solid closer for an overrated trilogy.Return of the Jedi is the third Star Wars film to come out, and the final segment of the original Star Wars trilogy. With the Rebellion being on the run from the Empire, Han Solo still a captive, and Darth Vader yet to be dealt with, Luke has a lot of circles he needs to close, lots of loose ends that need to be taken care of. Will he succeed and become a true Jedi knight?I feel like at this point I'm a little exhausted from spending so much time with George Lucas' mind child, so I'll be straightforward. This movie starts off pretty well - until the Dagobah scene, this scene included, I feel like things are pretty fun. The saga with Han and Jabba is interesting and fairly captivating, even if a little messy. The way that things unfold makes the plot flow well, overall, and it produces some iconic moments. After that, things get worse, but before that, let's address something else that's relevant to the entire trilogy: the CGI additions.Upon Blu-Ray release, George Lucas had decided to add some scenes, shots and effects to the original movies. Sometimes it's cool and subtle, sometimes rather cringeworthy. The scene with the dance and song that were performed for Jabba is a great example for the worst facets of it. It feels like it was taken out of Minions or something. It's not something that impacts the film in a drastic way, but I still can't help but wonder if changing an original cinematic experience to a point where this is the easiest version to find is the best way to go about it. Food for thought.Anyway, back to the movie. So, the beginning is pretty fun, but somewhere around the halfway point this movie gets so, so silly. I know that the Ewoks are cute, but don't y'all feel like there's a bit of a fan service thing going on here, lazy writing with not enough creativity? The Ewoks also appear in a section of the movie that's related to the climax, when the movie is going back and forth between two different locations, and the vibes are so unmatched there that it just feels weird and awkward. Not in a good way. Empire jumped between two plotlines as well, but still managed to hold a solid vibe. Here it's just all over the place.And talking about the climax - without getting into any spoilers - the climax of this film is peak silliness, at least when it comes to this trilogy. In the previous movie, the conflict between the Dark Side and the Jedi has much, much more weight, because the writers knew how to portray it. The struggle there was about aggression and offense vs clear-minded defense, and it was evident the most in the final battle of Empire. The bottom line is simple: if you succumb to your anger, you will end up hurting the people you care about, even if your intentions are pure. Here, on the other hand, it was watered down to only silly dialogue (""be angry."" ""never!!"" is the gist of it), which felt so repetitive and devoid of meaning. Sorry, guys, but this is not the way to go about it.Return of the Jedi starts in a solid way, but around the halfway point gets too silly to really do anything for me. The climax was especially messy (not in a good way), and yeah, couldn't say that the second half of this movie does anything for me other than being exhausting and cringeworthy, mostly. I'm feeling a 5.9/10 on this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great 'final chapter', but too much attention on the Ewoks...","This was it. The final battle. The exciting build up to the ending that we had all been waiting for after the Empire Stikes Back, questions to be asked that were finally answered: Will Han Solo be rescued from Jabba the Hutt? Will Luke Skywalker face Darth Vader a second time?Who is the mysterious Emperor? And what will be the final outcome between the Rebellion and the Imperial Forces? When i saw the film at the Odeon Cinema in the summer of 1983 as a boy i thought it was a brilliant ending for the Star Wars Trilogy, now that i'm older and wiser i can see that 'Episode Six' is full of half-baked acting, a kind of 'Let's get this movie over with i'm fed up' attitude from Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, moments that are mean't to be moving (like Yoda's death Scene) drag on forever and many more problems.One of the flaws is the lack of threat from Darth Vader, so imposing and powerful in The Empire Strikes Back, here he is reduced in screen time and only really comes alive again during the three way confrontation on the Death Star with Luke and the Emperor, which in my own opinion is the best part in the entire film.Also the Death Star space battle with the rebel fighters is brilliant as well, but i will be damned if i like those stupid Ewoks, which were invented to find an audience that loved the Muppet Show.George Lucas should have stuck to his original concept of Chewbacca's race: the Wookies. Instead he has silly little furry care bears. Think about it! legions of Stormtroopers versus marauding Wookies and laser blasting Rebels on Endor? Talk about lost potential!Return of the Jedi also has a terrible bad acting exchange of dialogue moment between Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams.It occurs just before Solo leaves for Endor he says 'Look i want you to take her' meaning the Millennium Falcon, Lando replies 'Don't worry Buddy, she won't get a scratch!' Ford turns away trying to express uncertainty at William's promise and almost stammers 'I gotcha promise now? Not a scratch right?' William's moos like a cow by exclaiming 'WOOUULD YOUUU GET GOOINNG YA PIRATE?'It looks like they used a rehearsed take on the actors rather than try to make it more convincing.That is evidence that there was a lack of conviction on this film, unlike The Empire Strikes Back where you see great performances as well as bang for your buck.But still, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying conclusion if not on a par with a New Hope and Empire to the trilogy.It is ten billion times better than the Phantom Menace.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
RATING (0 TO ****): ***1/2,"RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) features the same old cast as the first two STAR WARS episodes in a rehash of previous themes. Now with a cast this talented and material this strong, rehashing is not necessarily bad. This time the Galactic Empire's forces lead by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse acting with James Earl Jones's voice) has again build a Death Star and is still out to destroy the Rebel Alliance. This Death Star is, of course, even more powerful than the previous one and has the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) personally supervising its construction.You may remember from the last episode that Han Solo (Harrison Ford) owed Jabba the Hutt (Mike Edmonds) money so Jabba in a fit of rage had him frozen and sent to Jabba's planet. The film starts with the rescue of Han from Jabba by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). The rest of the movie is ostensibly about the destruction of the Death Star by the rebels, but actually the film is about the inherit conflict in the duality of man and the thin line between good and evil. Will Darth Vader turn Luke to the dark side or will Luke turn Darth Vader to the good? Each is confident, and until the end it is not clear whose power will prove stronger.The character creations in all the STAR WARS series are delightfully imaginative. Jabba and his minions are testaments to the grotesque and the obese. After being grossed out by Jabba's huge rolls of jelly like fat, I suspect a large number of people must have run out of the theater to hit the pay phones to call 1-800-OutFat or some such number. A better advertisement for fat clinics I have not seen. By the way, I thought one of Jabba's entourage was at least a kissing cousin to the gargoyles that populate the movie GREMLINS.Yoda (Frank Oz) appears again in the show to complete Luke's training as aJedi. Luke thinks he is already one, but Yoda admonishes him, ""Not yet. One thing remains. One things remains, Vader. You must confront Vader, and then a Jedi you will be."" I love the flowery language the writers (Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas) give Yoda. Yoda poetically warns Luke, ""Anger, fear, depression. The dark side are they."" Luke's training also needs help from his old mentor Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness). He appears in a vision telling Luke, ""You will find that many of the truths we cling to depend upon your point of view."" This is a show of secrets revealed, but you will not find them out here. See the movie.The sets (Norman Reynolds) and visual effects (Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, and Ken Ralston) are even more elaborate than in the first two episodes. My favorite is the little hover-bikes on which they go screaming through the California redwood trees. That they could control the bikes while traveling at the high speed they are going makes no sense, but hey, this is science fiction afterall. The special effects continue to be a great blend of the old and the new: bows and arrows vs. blasters (laser guns) and hang gliders vs. large mechanical dinosaurs outfitted with laser cannons.RETURN OF THE JEDI introduces sweet furry new creatures called Ewoks. They were a hit at the time, but I am surprised there wasn't at even a bigger marketing tie in with them. Looked like great toys for the age 2-9 set to me.The acting in the movie was good. My favorite was James Earl Jones. His voice must be the richest and most powerful of any actor living today. Hamill, whom I found to be a big disappointment in the last episode, has more energy and does his part less on autopilot in this one. His performance here still pales in significance to his work in STAR WARS, which is the only film he has ever been great in.Although the show was excellent, there were several letdowns for me. First and foremost, I missed the incredible humor from the first two. There are laughs in RETURN OF THE JEDI, but overall the writers and the director (Richard Marquand) approach the show too reverentially. Second, I missed the romantic angle. There was some aspects of it in this episode, but not much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Conclusion to One of the Greatest Sagas in Film History,"I have to admit that I am biased when it comes to this film. This was one of the first films that I ever saw at the cinema, back when I was five. For a long time it was my favourite of the ""Star Wars"" films, mainly because of the vast array of great creatures in it.The film continues almost directly from ""Empire Strikes Back"", as the evil Galactic Empire are building an even more powerful Death Star battle station, the heroes try to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the slug-like gangster Jabba the Hutt.The film is fast and exciting and the pace never lets up. The special effects are superb and there are some great action sequences. The film is also at the end, genuinely moving. It's not a flawless film though, the Ewoks (spear carrying teddy bears) have always been criticised as a blatant merchandising gimmick, but they're not that bad, and I thought they were great when I was five. Also the acting is pretty poor in places, but that's par for the course with these films.I've lost count of how many times I have seen this films, but I still find it as exciting and fun today as I ever did, and that's the hallmark of a lasting film. Also it features Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) in that famous gold bikini which is no doubt indelibly imprinted on the brains of 20- to 30-something men everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Return of the Jedi (1983) A fun ending,"The third film in the first Star Wars trilogy is that famous case of love it or hate it. This film divides many opinions. Some think it's a great ending and others think it's a very low point in the trilogy. Of course, this film is not better than its predecessors, but that doesn't make it bad. I believe this film is very good and very fun, managing to surpass the first one many times over in terms of fun. The story is very interesting and the characters have good development. Some old characters seem a bit excluded from the plot at certain times, but those who stand out steal the show. The special effects have aged very poorly and this greatly affects when rewatching the film today. The direction is weak and the photography is the ugliest presented in the trilogy. The film has many flaws, but it is still very good and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fitting conclusion to a masterful franchise,"After the technological innovation that was the original 1977 space opera Star Wars, and its convention-defying, unbelievably dark sequel The Empire Strikes Back, my expectations for the conclusion of the iconic franchise, Return of the Jedi, were soaring into galaxies far, far away. Not long after, I fell back to Earth somewhat wowed but considerably disappointed. Return of the Jedi is a solid end to the franchise, competent, alleviating, and without a doubt, intriguing, but simultaneously bland and underwhelming. To, yet again, quote Dante Hicks from the everlasting Clerks, ""all Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."" Of course, that's a vast oversimplification of what the film really features, but it's not an inaccurate statement. The last thing I ever expected to call a Star Wars picture is artificial-looking, but it must be said. Occasionally, the film will have points of sheer beauty and marvellous technology. Consider the briskly-paced sequence where Luke and Leia race through the forestry, evading a slew of enemies closely on their tale. Yet, frequently, much of the film looks like it was shot on the backlots of studios where the presence of a fully-designed set was dually noted. The mystifying qualities about space's contents and other-worldly galaxies seems to have been traded for modestly-interesting scenes, confined to solid land mimicking that of a forest preserve. It looks good. Not beautiful.The second issue comes when we spend much of the film either listening to Ewokese or dealing with the language's speakers, the Ewoks, which don't even seem to belong in a Star Wars. The past gangs of creatures we've had to see, whether it be the Jawas or the Ugnaughts, were at least interesting, mysterious creatures. The Ewoks possess a cute, cuddly, warm persona that feels alien (pun intended) to the world of Star Wars. Not to mention, they often feel like cute, cuddly distractions to the more interesting plot developments and set-ups we're dealing with here.For example, the drama between Luke Skywalker (reprised by Mark Hamill) and his newfound father Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) would've been the perfect thing to predicate this entire film on, rather than more or less shifting it to the side so we can watch the gaggle of Ewoks interact with their own culture and the new humans placed in the middle of it.Another thing I began to start to get frustrated at with The Empire Strikes Back is its focus on the cutesy relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia (Carrie Fisher). There's really no surprise that there is a relationship in ""the greatest franchise in history,"" but did it have to be this hesitant, restrained, and plodded out for three movies? Because both characters refuse to recognize their feelings strongly until the second movie, we get an abundance of joking dialog, senseless banter, and redundant little arguments between the two that easily become more obnoxiously spliced in than entertaining. This relationship either needed to not have begun or been greatly minimized here. Not shifted more towards the foreground.However, I fear I'm making Return of the Jedi sound like the worst movie-going experience this side of the Millennium Falcon. There are still scenes of genuine ambition and prevalent imagination here, and the fact that George Lucas co-wrote this picture Empire writer Lawrence Kasdan gives more of the vibe that Lucas wrapped this story up the he wanted to. While Empire, my personal favorite of the original trilogy, benefited tremendously from Lucas' bravery in welcoming new talent to the film, it's nice to see the original pioneer, regardless of my opinions on him, finish what he started and finish it the way he wants it. I can respect that above all. Even the director at hand here, Richard Marquand, is given a nice range of variety, regardless of whether or not it's good variety. There is still a respectable amount of creativity and life in this project, despite its gradual inferiority to its predecessors.The Star Wars films, as stated in my blog post before I finally sat down to watch them, formally stood as an annoying little blind spot in my rear-view that I was too lazy to wipe clean. When I finally did, I realized what I was missing. When you see this films in present day, there still is no lost wonder or the overwhelming feeling of datedness. It feels just as fresh, moving, and powerful as a thrilling sci-fi epic made in recent time. Return of the Jedi isn't necessarily the way I wanted the entire series to end (for, I would've rather had some more of the unrelenting darkness and bleak storytelling Empire used to its success), yet I simply can't bring myself to say I didn't like the film mainly because I feel that it's a pretty creative piece in and of itself. It's a fine movie that deserves its place in history, regardless of my opinion.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and James Earl Jones (voice). Directed by: Richard Marquand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Second verse, worse than the first!""","George Lucas brings Luke Skywalker and the gang back for one more round of good vs evil climax in the third part of the trilogy saga surrounding ""The Force,"" a mysterious religion that was lost (and not-yet-explained) some time before the movie-goers came onto the scene.Overall, the film was not bad, but it was definitely the worst one of all. Plots are revealed that should be obvious when you think about it.  And the final battle scene, although different characters playing different ""hero"" roles, strongly reminds me of the first movie, the one they now call ""A New Hope.""  As our hero wrestles with his conscious, his friends wrestle the bad guys in outer space and on the moon of Endor, where we meet the lovable creatures, the Ewoks, which added that comedy part to the film that we didn't see much of in the first two with the exception of R2D2, who still stole the show!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Easily the weakest of the original films, but not a bad finish","This for me was the weakest chapter of the original trilogy but it did what it set out to do. I have some friends who say it's their favorite; one of whom says he likes the space battle between the Rebels and the Empire. I used to like the space battle and used to watch those parts while fast-forwarding the other parts of the final battle while watching the movie. But now that I'm older I enjoy the lightsaber duels more. That for me is what Star Wars is truly about, and not just the space battles and the ground battles (like in Empire).The film gets a bad rap by many fans due to the Ewoks, while some say it's a ripoff of the first Star Wars. The latter seems a little unfair though sometimes the third chapter of a trilogy tends to mirror the first one. I used to like the Ewoks when I was younger and while I'm now a little older (and wiser) and I think they're a little silly, they're not as bad as the Gungans (see The Phantom Menace). But all in all, it's not a bad way to end the saga of the Skywalkers. There are still some better third chapters to trilogies out there (such as Toy Story 3 and Return of the King), so you might want to check those respective film sagas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fine end to a thrilling trilogy,"Though not quite up to the standards of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying end for the Star Wars saga. This one doesn't seem to have quite the same pace as the first two. It kind of meanders about with little bursts of energy here and there before it comes to its thrilling grand finale.When last we left our heroes and villains Darth Vader had just told Luke Skywalker he was his father and Han Solo had been frozen in carbonite to be taken away by bounty hunter Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Here, Luke will deal with Han first, Vader later. We begin on Luke's old home planet of Tatooine where we learn Han is being held, still frozen, as a captive of the giant slug-like creature Jabba. Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO will all be involved in a mission to free Han. Suffice to say things don't go quite according to plan and among other indignities Leia ends up wearing a skimpy bikini and chained to the monstrous Jabba as his slave girl. Soon Luke arrives and we see his powers with the Force have grown but not to the extent that he can avoid finding himself in quite a predicament himself. We end up spending quite a bit of time on Tatooine, perhaps a bit too much as the film struggles to really get going. Finally (and inevitably as otherwise we'd have a really short movie) our heroes manage to free themselves from Jabba's clutches and we can move on to what will be the central theme of the movie. Luke Skywalker's attempt to redeem his father, Anakin Skywalker, and turn him from the evil he has become, Darth Vader, back to the good man he once was will be the main focus from here on in.Before he can confront Vader, Luke returns to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training with master Yoda. Here he learns his training is in fact complete. All that stands in the way of his being a Jedi Knight is to confront (and presumably defeat) Vader. After the stunning revelation in the last film in which we learned Vader was Luke's father another branch of the Skywalker family tree is revealed here. Not quite as stunning but something that certainly will change the perspective of some of the key characters when they learn the truth and also change how the audience perceives them.Travelling with Han, Leia and a rebel party to the forest moon of Endor, Luke will be part of a mission designed to bring about the destruction of a new Death Star the Empire is constructing. Those on the moon will be responsible for bringing the battle station's shield down so the rebel fleet can attack and destroy the Death Star. If the mission fails it will be the end of the rebellion and there will be no hope of freedom in the galaxy.Unfortunately as we move towards the film's climax we get bogged down on Endor as our heroes encounter a band of Ewoks, tiny primitive bear-like creatures. While they certainly may appeal to kids (and therefore sell a bunch of toys) the Ewoks have no place in this story. They do not bring the requisite level of seriousness required considering all the serious things which are occurring around them. There it seems only for comic relief the Ewoks are in fact not funny. Instead they are incredibly annoying and the film slows to a crawl as we learn more than we could ever want to know about them and their way of life.Eventually, sensing his father's presence, Luke leaves the rest of the rebels (and their new furry friends) to confront Darth Vader and try to turn him away from the Dark Side of the Force. Vader may seem to waver a bit but he is convinced it is too late for him. Vader will bring his son before the Emperor, briefly glimpsed in the last film and now played wonderfully by Ian McDiarmid. The Emperor, determined to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is pure evil personified. Soon, Luke will be faced with a choice. He must turn to the Dark Side or be destroyed.Meanwhile, back on the moon of Endor, Han, Leia and company are running into their own problems. If they don't get the Death Star's shield down the rebel fleet will face certain annihilation. It all builds to a thrilling conclusion as we cut back and forth from the efforts of the rebels and Ewoks on Endor to the confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star to the rebel fleet's attack on the battle station. The ending certainly does not disappoint. It is dramatic, emotional and ultimately thrilling. The Star Wars saga ends with a bang.Return of the Jedi does have its problems, most notably a slow pace and the presence of the insufferable Ewoks. The performances of the actors aren't quite up to their prior standards. Harrison Ford at times seems to be going through the motions as Han Solo although that may have something to do with the fact he's acting with a bunch of little furballs. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia seems strangely emotionless, especially when faced with some rather startling news. Mark Hamill does do well to capture the earnestness of a son who never stops believing there is good in his father despite all evidence to the contrary. McDiarmid is terrific and even in voice only James Earl Jones gives a terrific performance as Darth Vader. Of course, the visuals and special effects are typically dazzling. After the majesty of the first two films, Return of the Jedi may be seen as a slight disappointment. But all in all it is a worthy conclusion for a grand, sweeping, epic saga unlike any other we have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Least Best Movie of the Original Trilogy,"While this is probably my least favorite of the original trilogy, it was still a pretty good movie. John William's score was obviously amazing, all of the characters were very well written, and were still enjoyable and likeable, and the ending was fantastic. The only thing about this movie is that it follows two of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time...7.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I still liked Episode V better, but this was very good too","The original ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" has rather impressing effects and a great story. When you see what they almost ruin this using CGI and other changes in the movie's later Special Edition, it makes you wonder why they even added things to the original movie.Although, the first half of the movie that involved the rebels' fight against Jabba the Hutt was originally pretty good, the Special Edition had added some poorly edited scenes into all of this. It was also a little slower when Luke whiteness Yoda's death, but the movie does get quite entertaining after Yoda dies.The movie gets rather entertaining, first with the rebels' planning to take down the new Death Star before it becomes completed. The group's discovery of the inner planet's Ewoks group, the concept was a little strange, but not bad. There is another entertaining scene when the Ewoks become help for the rebels in taking down the evil empire on the planet.The original trilogy has a rather nice ending in the fight between dying Darth Vader and the Emperor, along with Luke's realizing he has the same electric hand as he just cut from Vader, then using Vader's remaining positive force to saving Luke from the Emperor. After this, with the rebel's party to their great success, and Luke's personal burn of Darth Vader for a goodbye to his original father.They did make another mistake in this movie's Special Edition with the Death Star's explosion; it had made a lot more sense without the stupid ring going around the explosion of the Death Star, along with other added CGI effects like the scenes on other planets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An inconsistent, yet highly enjoyable, Star Wars film","The final film industry he original Star Wars trilogy is a mixed bag of excellence and ""iffy"" moments. First the good: the first act with the main heroes saving Han from Jabba the Hutt, the rancor, sarlacc and Boba Fett is absolutely fantastic as it,s a great introduction to the characters we love and features fun action sequences, cool monsters and new memorable characters like Jabba the Hutt. The Final third act confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is also phenomenal and is on par with Empire Strikes Backs finest moments, it's emotional, powerful and effective. However he rest of the film is not quite up to par. Not to say that it's bad but rather just ""there"" thee woks don't bother me as much as everyone else but they do feel more like toy commercials than pivotal characters. The endor subplot does feel rather forced (no pun intended) and just an excuse to give Han and Leia something to do for the films second and third acts. These scenes aren't bad, their fine, but they just don't do much for me personally. Overall, I'd put his film around he same area as he force awakens in terms of quality, it's good but not quite great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The 40th Anniversary Showing Holds Up,"I saw Return of the Jedi 40 years ago, when it was in theaters the first time. It was thought to be the conclusion of the Star Wars trilogy, and the end of a new era in film history. The film was good on that basis, although the least satisfying of the three original films. I am not sure anyone contemplated that the next 40 years would deliver a series of new and continuous projects around the Star Wars character and properties. This one held up. It is not the best or the worst of the Star Wars films. It has some great moments and some great emotional content. It held up on the big screen, and while there are not many changes or additions the film seems enhanced, rather than aged-so it looks good. Some of the Endor special effects are dated, but the rest is engaging and a fun time. It was nice to see it in a full audience with people that were not alive when the original series played on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best conclusions in motion picture history,"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The saga is complete,"When The Empire Strikes Back ended on a cliffhanger a sequel was inevitable. The audience wanted more and closure to the saga. Whilst Return of the Jedi was the weakest of the original trilogy, it is still a very entertaining film and Star Wars is one of the few trilogies which is a great as a whole.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamall) and his allies have to save Hans Solo (Harrison Ford) who at the end of The Empire Strikes Back sealed in carbonite and in the clutches of the gangster Jabba the Hut. Luke and his allies Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Baker) set out to launch an audacious rescue of the coolest pirate in the galaxy. When that business was taken care of they go back to the Rebels where they have receive intelligence that the Empire were building an even more powerful death and that Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) and the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) himself were overseeing the construction. The rebels have one chance of a surprise attack, which requires a ground assault on the forest moon Endor. This is led by Leia and Solo and they ally with the local, primitive tribe of Ewoks to destroy the shield protecting the Death Star. Luke is also on a personal mission, to try and save Darth Vader from the dark side to help defeat the Emperor, but the Emperor believes he can turn Luke. This leads to a mental and physical battle of the soul.Return of the Jedi is a very enjoyable film with great action sequence to match the first two. There is a very good light sabre fight and Luke's skills as a Jedi are truly expanded. There is a good battle which shows a futuristic force are having to fight a primitive race using spears and bows and arrows. There is a interesting battle of wits between Luke and the Emperor and shows this is more then a sci-fi action film, but a emotional battle for souls. There is excellent art direction in the film like in the first two film and there is more ambition in showing a wide range of alien race compared to The Empire Strike Back. But some alien designs were not as good as others, the Ewoks looked like teddy bears, whilst the Admiral for the Rebels looked ridiculous. The acting sticks to form with the other films, with Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones being the best performers and Ian McDiarmid was wonderfully slimy and evil as the main villain of the piece.Return of the Jedi is not as dark as The Empire Strikes Back, which in itself not much of a problem, but the including of the Ewoks made the film a little too childish. There were some interesting ideas to be had with them, but as stated they look like teddy bears that children would want to hug not a realistic alien race. As well the general plot of the film was basically very similar to first film, development of a Death Star, action set on Luke's home world and attack a weakness in the Empire's defends.Return of the Jedi is a very good and entertaining film which closes the circle of the Star Wars saga.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Episode IV, redux","George Lucas did not have enough money to do Episode IV the way he wanted to and Episode V, despite a superior script suffered, a 10 percent drop in the box office.  So he used Episode VI as an excuse to do the special effects the way he wanted to do it.  Despite a promising beginning, Episode VI pretty much ended like Episode IV--the enhanced special effects added little to the ending.  Also it was disappointing because we saw the ""departure"" of another beloved Jedi--although with hind(fore)sight we see this was probably necessary to fulfill a prophecy from Episode I.The only thing that made this movie worthwhile was seeing princess Leia in the ""slave girl costume"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect Finish to the Saga,"Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and until now I had never seen Star Wars. While most people's view on Star Wars nowadays is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on these 'classics'. I'm watching in this order: IV - V - I - II - III - VIThis is the final installment of an already legendary series. Everything ties itself together, the action is there, the tension is there, the laughs are there and characters are far more likable than the prequel trilogy,I don't know what else to say other than that this is my favorite installment in the entire six- movie-saga. It perfectly tops it all off in an intense and satisfying finish.I must even appreciate the nod to the prequel trilogy at the end of this DVD-version. I won't reveal what it is, but I welcome it nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
the BEST!!!,"the last episode of the star wars saga is the most spectacular and most enjoyable of the series. True, it's not as inventive or as original as the first two films, but the STAR WARS was just too hokey and hard to enjoy when you watch it today, and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was way too dark and sometimes even boring.

Hope better than empire and Jedi?,"No way is a new hope better than Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The first Star Wars has great special effects, but Empire has much better. The scenes with the millenium falcon are brilliant and better than any scene in Hope. Someone wrote how Hope has the best drama. You gotta be kidding me?The acting is really flat in Hope and Empire is much darker.  It's the darkest one.  In my opinion it is Empire is the best one and Jedi is right behind it.  Jedi also has better effects and a better Death Star battle.Let's just end any debate that Hope is better than Empire or Jedi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Definitely the worst of the series, but still very good","I think the reason this movie is considered the worst of the original trilogy is because of the Ewoks, and that's fair enough. But still this is a really good movie and a perfect cap on the series. It resolves everything, and ends on a triumphant note. Some of my favorite parts are the final 3 way fight scenes with Leia and Han fighting on endor, Lando fighting a fleet of star cruisers while trying to blow up the Death Star, and Luke fighting Vader and the emporor on the death star. Another thing that lingers in my mind is the sound of the speeder bikes as they fly past. Like I said this is probably my least favorite of the series, not just the original trilogy, but of all six films, this movie is fun, but also has some stupid moments, or it could just be that I didn't want it to end, this movie is awesome, just, not as awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A nice ending to a beautiful franchise,"Star Wars episode VI is just the icing on the cake, the Empire Strikes Back is a classic and George Lucas just adds to an already wonderful story, by giving us a happy ending that we did not expect. Here is where you get to enjoy the power of the force (i.e. when you are comparing this movie to its original two counter parts; A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back) as Luke Skywalker demonstrates true mastery of it, as he had become a Jedi Knight between the events of Empire Strikes Back and now and later after the death of Yoda he became the only Jedi Knight left in the entire cosmos. Episode VI's ending is one of the things that has made the Star Wars franchise a must watch and a must have.The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was something we all looked forward to, with Luke now a Jedi Knight, that battle was fun as now he and Darth Vader (his father) were evenly matched. The twist ending in the movie's story arc is just something you will come to respect the writers for, as they lead you on a good versus evil mind battle.The CGI in this movie was one that took me much by surprise it was impressive, it looked so well ahead of its time, with the acting portrayal of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was the best in the series so far this is my favorite imprint of him in my mind, ""Luke Skywalker Son of Anakin Skywalker and the last Jedi Knight."" After the events of the Empire Strike Back which led to the capture of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after he was frozen in a block of carbonite; Luke and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with the help of others formulate a plan to free Solo from the hands of the crime lord Jabba.After his freedom and escape from Jabba and his minions, the trio decided to take the fight to the Empire, as plans were in place to build another Death Star. This battle was the going to be the final battle between the resistant forces and the empires, with both having an ace up their sleeves.This battle is parallel though to the Sith Lord's intension to convert Luke over to the Dark Side, as he and Darth Vader waited patiently for him to come so that he too like his father in the Revenge of the Sith will face the test of joining the Dark Side.Return of the Jedi is the last in the first sequel and the last in the chronology, Episode VI is just a part of a must have when you go buying the Star Wars box set, which I believe every movie lover already have.The movie was actually meant to be titled the Revenge of the Jedi, but the name got changed later on. Talks are ongoing that Disney is set to release a new Star Wars, Episode VII (probably in 2015) and if possible a new trilogy, here is something I so look forward to.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An awesome finish to the original Star Wars trilogy,"I had gotten curious about the Star Wars saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the Star Wars saga.We now come to the last chapter in the Star Wars (original) trilogy. Luke, now a Jedi Knight, and his band travel to his home planet of Tatooine, to get Han Solo out of the palace of Jabba the Hut. But the Hutt has no intention in freeing the prisoners and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet; but Luke has a promise to keep, so he heads for Dagobah. But Yoda is dying - the end of his days are upon him. On his death-bed, Yoda tells Luke he needs no training; all he needs to do is face Darth Vadar. But Luke felt torn, he could not face his own father, who was once Jedi Knight Anikan Skywalker. Luke also found out from Yoda before his last breath (and Obi's spirit), that Leia is his long-lost twin sister! The two were separated from birth to protect them from both Vadar/Anikan and the evil Emperor.Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance had learned that the enemy is building a new Death Star space station - bigger and more powerful than the first one; and indestructible. With a shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. So Luke and Han formed a crack team to go to Endor, and find that generator, take it down so that the alliance could destroy the incomplete Death Star. On Endor, Luke and his companions meet a tribe of Ewoks, primitive yet intelligent indigenous forest creatures of Endor. With the help of C-3PO, they are able to forge an alliance with the tribe. Later, Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vadar. He confesses to Leia the truth about her and Vadar, and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. So like I said : That's all I could tell you folks, watch it and see how it ends.Overall, ""Return of the Jedi"" is an awesome finish to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. I thought all films in the original trilogy are really good, and I love the Ewoks, they're cute!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A sign of things to come,"The Return of the Jedi is the movie that shows the first signs that Lucas' creative well was starting to dry as the merchandising finally corrupted the Star Wars universe.The movie starts promising with the rescue of Han Solo from his nemesis Jabba the Hut. After this, everything plotwise goes downhill. It seems that they really wanted to end this thing, but didn't know how. They didn't know how to fit Yoda into the storyline, so they kill him (He seemed perfectly healthy to me and all of a sudden, he's dead). They didn't know what new evil could the Empire come up with, so they throw us a recycled, uncomplete, Dead Star to blow up again. And finally, the hated teddy bear like Ewoks whose only purpose in the movie is to sell more toys. Darth Vader's redemption was too nice, too easy, too fast. Fortunately some very exciting action sequences (like the ""bike"" chase scene) save the film from being a cutefest.16 years later, George Lucas releases his god-awful Episode 1 The Phantom Menace which resembles more the shallowness of this film than the good points.Jedi is still a great movie, but unlike the previous two, can't stand on its own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Weakest Link Out Of The Original Trilogy,"These original films out of the whole Star Wars series are indeed iconic and unforgettable. They wowed audiences in an age when primitive analog technology was the rage at the time. They set the standard for highly advanced technology in moviemaking which is highlighted to this day of CGI.I only wish it had more of a refreshing feel to it rather than digging up old plots that are too similar to Episode IV. Yeah, I refer to the infamous ""Death Star"".Sure, it's known that something indestructible such as that huge technological beast has a weakness, and sure enough, that's once again discovered by the rebels on that ""Galaxy from a long time ago"". Rebels lost their lives infiltrating the Imperial System to get the info for that dangerous menace, but why did they have to make heroic sacrifices for that? Wasn't it already made clear in Episode IV that all you needed to do was fire lasers at the core of that false moon? That was made obvious in the first film.All the old gang reunites for the inevitable confrontation with the same enemy forces and with Han Solo evidently given not much to do. He's thawed out of carbonite in Jabba the Hutt's desert palace but is not essential to the main plot and is just there to add to the link of good guys. A far cry from the potency of his Indiana Jones persona where he's needed everywhere.Princess Leah isn't given much to do either except having the highlight of being captured as Jabba's sex slave. She did look good in that metal bikini though there'd be a backlash to that with today's audience. Something like that would suffer from controversy if that was depicted now. Still, it was an intriguing situation she was in. I mean, what guy wouldn't be turned on by that?I remember this movie was mega-news when it first came out in 1983 and dominated the headlines by showing how devoted Star Wars fans were by camping out at movie theatres to see it right away. I, unfortunately, had no such luxury. I was living in a small and remote Northern town at the time with no movie theater and had to settle for reading the paperback novel instead that I bought from the local grocery store.Sure, that's a pathetic way to revel in the glory of this film back in 1983, but it sufficed for trying to know the story when it was a major hit at one time. I now have the DVD that I already watched several times before and admit it never gave the excitement like the novel once did.The notorious ""Emperor"" makes a grand appearance here, but the freshness and curiosity of that got lost in the prequels years later. The cunning and surprising show of his powers in this old film doesn't have the impact it once did. We already know what he's capable of.I admit the major low were those primitive teddy bears on the forest moon of Endor which the new Death Star orbited around. It clearly brought this series down to a kindergarten level with those cute things squealing and running around like mice evading a cat or officers from ""Animal Control"".The Cartoonish battle they had with the highly advanced technological forces of The Empire was laughable, considering those Ewoks had nothing, but sticks and stones to retaliate with. Still, they were cute, but too cute to be taken seriously. They were evidently targets of a production line for new Star Wars toys.The major interest was the space battle between the rebels and the imperial ships and that's indeed an exciting part. Han's old friend and former betrayer, Lando Calrissian, handled it with such superb piloting skills with the Millennium Falcon that you can't help but root for the rebels to win, regardless of the odds they were up against.There's of course, the father-son, situation between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader which hits a melodramatic soap opera level this time around with a more mellow approach than what was depicted in The Empire Strikes Back.Vader is also not as menacing and evil as he was in the previous two films either. He's more or less a ""Yes-Man"" towards the emperor once he appears. He does nothing but take orders from ""his master"" and acts humble towards him.To sum it up, I do like Return of the Jedi even though it's clearly the weakest entry to the original series. Episodes IV and V brought the ""Skywalker Saga"" to a zenith, but those prequels and sequels released afterwards were never able to compare to the quality that was once there.Star Wars was once a breakthrough film for its day, highlighting highly advanced special effects, but now in this era of extreme CGI, it's a yawn. The impact the original films once had with audiences will never be recaptured in the 21st Century. The era of wowing people with new and awe-inspiring film gimmicks doesn't cut it anymore. There's too much of that in movies nowadays.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great fodder for discussion of Good and Evil,"Now, in late 2023, I look at this film through different eyes. I mostly ignore the (merchandise-friendly) Ewoks; I focus on Luke's development and the pleasure of seeing Carrie Fisher in her prime (and yes, THAT bikini). Luke knows enough to be dangerous and even reckless, but he manages quite a mental balancing act given the mind games of the Emperor. The Luke we eventually see (in the final trilogy) is far more knowledgeable and powerful, but bears the scars of his failures as well, which gives him a tragically wise gravitas. Here, in Episode VI, Luke is in a transitional phase between gee-whiz wonderment and future Force guru.Personally, I find it interesting that the Jedi use trickery to minimize violence, and that they are looked down upon for this (e.g., the ""old Jedi mind trick"" as Jabba calls it). By contrast, the Empire simply relies on overwhelming firepower. The Emperor is the centroid of a deterministic (and ruthless) view of nature; whereas the Jedi are more enlightened, believing in free will and the power of a noble individual to overcome great adversity. Note how Luke emphasizes CHOICE when dealing with Jabba and his minions.{FYI, Free Will is essentially accountability; one can't believe in both a Heaven/Hell paradigm and ""Hard Determinism"". Chaos Theory (arguably personified by the Ewoks) can be a powerful ally in thwarting Determinism.}I rate this film at 8 stars. My deepest gratitude to Carrie Fisher (RIP) and Mark Hamill for a fascinating adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A triumphant conclusion or a crashing disappointment?,"Until the release of the Phantom Menace, Return of the Jedi was widely regarded as the worst Star Wars film. Topping the awesome Empire Strikes back was always going to be difficult but on some levels Jedi suceeds. With all the plot threads left dangling at the climax of the previous film there was always going to be a degree of exposition in this film yet George Lucas and Richard Marquand managed to keep the pace of the movie at a ridiculous level. Mark Hamil by this time has grown into the character of Luke Skywalker and easily walks away with the acting honours, easily outshining a seemingly bored Harrison Ford and strangely enjoying a better chemistry with Carrie Fisher than his costar. The Star Wars movies have always been associated with outstanding special effects and again we are not disappointed - the climactic battle over Endor still holds its own by todays standards. If you can forgive the inclusion of the ewoks then Return of the Jedi stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best space operas around, and makes a satisfying final installment in the original trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Holds up at a satisfying ending to the original trilogy,"Am I a terrible person for thinking this might be as good as - if not better than - the original Star Wars?Don't get me wrong, there's some dumb stuff in Return of the Jedi, it sags quite a bit in its second act (Yoda scene aside), and overall it's definitely not as good as Empire Strikes Back, but I mean... there are some great sequences in here.A lot of the Jabba stuff is great, and the final 45 minutes or so just doesn't let up, being absolutely packed to the brim with climactic action and special effects that by and large still hold up.While it's far from a perfect movie, there are enough fantastic scenes in here to make this one of the better Star Wars films, and as an ending to the original trilogy, I think it largely satisfies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What a conclusion to the original trilogy,"While Empire Strikes Back is by far the best in the series there is something about Jedi which is really special to conclude the original trilogy of by far one of the best franchises of all time and our heros must destroy the second death star and challenge the emperor and a personal battle of fates. What makes this entry in the series is that it further builds the universe that the other 2 movies have built up and we can see that with the begining of this movie that it picks up straight after empire and Luke,Leia,Lando,Chewie,C3P0 and R2D2 are trying to save Han from Jabba the Hutt the ganster that had Han frozen in carbonite and that for me is really good as it doesn't jump straight away rom whats happend it builds on the story already built which is some perfect film maker.
Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Billy Dee Williams,Harrison Ford,James Earl Jones,Anthony Daniels,Peter Maythew,Frank Oz,Alec Guinness and Kenny Baker return to reprise their roles and new to the cast was Ian Mcdiarmid who was the evil master of Vader and he was so spine chilling with his performance in this movie and he will always be one of my favorite parts of the movie.
This one and all of the original trilogy will always resonate with me as growing up these would be the movies i watched it growing up and so when i saw the ewoks in Jedi it would make me happy and make me laugh and yet the serious moments would also be something i would remember and the moments between father and son between Vader and Luke for me have sticked with me and this one with all of it's twists and turns will always for me be one of the best moments of my life watching all these moments in not just Jedi but all of the orginal trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining conclusion of the 'original' trilogy, countless everything to follow?","Entertaining conclusion of the original Star Wars trilogy later to be retitled as Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi in later years.

Not to worry for he is rescued by returning characters Luke Skywalker (who broods in a black outfit through the film), Princess Leia (the late actress Carrie Fisher) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). The remainder of the film sees the remaining rebel alliance fight off the construction of a new and even bigger Death Star by the empire.

Better than the last two films in the original trilogy.,"Honestly I liked how Luke was able to bring his father back to the Light side. Darth Vader was never the bad guy.

Darth Vader deserved a better ending,"Return of the Jedi delivers a really strong story with great character moments and solid acting. The emotional weight of Darth Vader's redemption, Luke's growth as a Jedi, and the final battle against the Empire make it a satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy.However, the practical effects feel really outdated. While impressive for their time, some scenes look old by today's standards. The fire and the sound in space also break immersion for me, as they aren't scientifically accurate and feel out of place.Also, Darth Vader's death... seriously? It could have been better than that.If this movie were made with modern CGI and better battles, it would easily be a 10/10, but because of the outdated visuals, I'm giving it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good movie with a disappointing end,"This film completes the initial trilogy of the saga, with the defeat of the imperial forces and the destruction of its military power. Directed by Richard Marquand, it has script of Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, and has most of the cast who entered the first two films.In my opinion, this is the worst movie of the saga so far (I have not seen the latest film yet), but that doesn't make him a bad movie. It's a good movie, but wasn't able to keep the expectations generated by its direct predecessor. The director fulfilled his role and the actors were very good although a little less inspired than in the earlier films. Action scenes are many, and continue to be worthy of merit and memory. The make-up and costumes also deserve the highest congratulations. The appearance of the aliens was quite well imagined, and we realize that the designers tried to think outside the box, with some great successes and some great failures. The ""bikini"" worn by Princess Leia in this film became iconic and was often copied in other contexts. The special, visual and sound effects continued at the highest level, although its possible to see some absolutely unbelievable scenes, due to lack of credibility. The soundtrack, unsurprisingly, remained excellent thanks to the work of the (already established) composer John Williams. The script is very interesting and closes, in a positive way, the cycle of events of these three films, without plot holes to solve. The climax is very good and it's full of action, holding the audience's attention. However, it's precisely in this moment that comes the factor that brings this movie down: the Ewoks, friendly and peaceful creatures, cuddly like teddy bears, which will be decisive in the final battle despite their weapons, rather than improvised, be the equivalent to that used for Humanity in prehistorical times. In fact, the simple interaction of the cast with these... animals, seems to have caused a great drop in the quality of their interpretation. These things are lovely, but they don't fit in the climax of an action/adventure film. It's like watching a Rambo movie and, in the middle of the final fight, the main character decides to become pacifist and supporter of the doctrine of nonviolence. Not to mention the end of the movie: it's ridiculous! I was expecting to see Bob Marley and marijuana being smoked there! This decidedly affected, by the negative, the quality of this film and make it disappointing to many fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

(PG)Third and final film in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy opens with an effort to free Han Solo from the clutches of gangster Jabba the Hutt, then sends the heroes on a mission to confront Darth Vader and destroy the newly rebuilt Death Star. Visually spectacular outing has oodles of creativity, sensational special effects, child-like wonder, technical credits to put most other crews/films to shame, but it lacks the dramatic fireworks it strives for and mishandles its own priorities by stranding most of the main characters on a forest moon for half the film, far from the ""real action"" in the stars above. Performances lack zip (clunky dialogue does them no favors) and, cute as they may be, far too much time is spent with those furry little woodland teddy bears called Ewoks. The climactic lightsaber duel is underwhelming compared to the one in ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but the space station assault, despite having a familiar ring to the climax of ""Star Wars,"" is still the most exciting and well-staged space battle the franchise has yet produced.

"""I am a Jedi, like my father before me.""","Of all the Star Wars films, this one was my favorite for the longest time. Critical viewers tend to admonish this film for showing an army of cutesy furry Ewoks turning the tide of the last battle. But I've always enjoyed this film for its subplot featuring Jabba the Hutt, the cool speeder-bike chase, its epic space battle over Endor (which comes very close to being my favorite space battle of all films, second maybe only to the battle of Coruscant in Episode III), and most importantly, for showing the final confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. All of the major conflicts are resolved in this film once and for all, and regardless of how unlikely it is for the Ewoks to overcome the Empire, I find the final fight between Luke and Vader to be very invoking, and the final space battle to be very awesome.The story is quite straightforward, offering just a little more insight on the characters and the previous films' loose ends, so as to answer any questions the audience may still have. It suffers just a little drag between the Jabba the Hutt scenes and the Endor scenes, but otherwise, the pacing is quite high. As it is with any major film trilogy, Return of the Jedi offers an excellent finale with excellent closure.The film is competently-made, with decent photography and editing. I still enjoy the actors' performances; Mark Hamill is probably at his most earnest here, while Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, and everybody else reprises their roles well. Writing is not bad. Production value features good sets, props, costumes, and special effects.

Great ending of the greatest trilogy ever.,"While Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the original three Star Wars movies, but it still packs a good punch and closes out the best trilogy of motion picture history. It begins with C3PO and R2D2 visiting Jabba the Hutt. They find Captain Solo (Harrison Ford) still in carbonite. Chewabacca (Peter Mayhew) is captured, along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who was incognito as a renegade bounty hunter. It is up to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to save the day. As a real Jedi, he is able to confound Jabba's men, destroy his barge, and rescue Leia, Han, Lando, and Chewie. The remaining two-thirds of the film deal with the final rebel assault against a new Death Star. Emperor Palpatine himself oversees the project with Darth Vader. As Luke and Han launch an attack to take out the defense shield from the moon of Endor, they meet some strange friends, the Ewoks. This leads to rollicking fun, great space battles, action sequences, awesome special effects, and Luke's temptation to join the dark side. I did have a few gripes with this movie. I know Lucas originally wanted to have the Ewok battle originally done with Wookies. I wished he would have stuck to that because the idea of stone-throwing teddy bears warring against storm troopers strained credibility. The only other strike was not introducing us to Emperor Palpatine sooner. He is only mentioned in the first Star Wars movie, and we do get a holographic image of him in the Empire Strikes Back ... but as the true master of evil he should have been brought in earlier. Nevertheless, Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie overthrow the Empire once and for all, restoring balance to the force and allowing good to triumph over evil.

Return of the Jedi,"This third of the original Star Wars films is probably my weakest. Possibly because the writing is not too tight but for me, more so because the ""Ewoks"" take over the thing and they are just stupidly annoying. What had potential to pitch the ultimate evil partnership against the Rebel Alliance became a toy-fight straight out of a Laurel and Hardy comedy - the storyline was infantile.

Just think of how 4,5,&6 would have came out if they did them in the 2000s. Yes I know that it would not have been the same because the actors that made the 70s and 80s movies made it great. However, I was just thinking that all the electronics that they used then would have been better with the current electronics they have today.

Great ending to the Star Wars saga.,"Though not as good as the first Star Wars, this is probably the most enjoyable one in the series. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker's final confrontation with the evil Darth Vader. This has the most complicated and darkest plot out of all the Star Wars films besides episode III, which makes it a lot more enjoyable to watch. However, it doesn't lose the feel of the first two, which is good. This is probably the best written and best acted of all the Star Wars movies, and the special effects have gotten better too.My only problem with the movie is the Ewoks. Their role isn't as important to the story as you'd think, and their part is way more drawn out than it needs to be. They kind of sucked the seriousness out of the movie.I'd also like to say that I enjoyed the DVD re-release as well. A lot of people complained that the new footage of Hayden Christensen as the ghost of Darth Vader was disrespectful and unnecessary, but I thought it was a cool way to connect the old trilogy to the new one.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Least favourite out of the original movies.,"Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) battles horrible Jabba the Hut and cruel Darth Vader to save his comrades in the Rebel Alliance and triumph over the Galactic Empire. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) reaffirm their love and team with Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the Ewoks and the androids C-3PO and R2-D2 to aid in the disruption of the Dark Side and the defeat of the evil emperor.This one does take a step down from the last 2 but it still makes for a amazing story. The set pieces are brilliant. Special effects and the visuals are always amazing. The writing the space battles and the lightsaber combat are so good! And the character Development is spot on! The only thing about this movie that I didn't really like was the romance scenes were not as good as the last movie. I was also not a fan of the Ewoks.Mark Hamill is still very likeable as Luke. Harrison Ford is still awesome as Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is still likeable and badass as Leia. Billy Dee Williams doesn't have much to do as Lando but he is still a very good addition to the movie! Frank Oz as Yoda is still absolutely the best. Ian McDiarmid is absolutely amazing as the emperor and is one of the best Villains of Star Wars!

"Safe, Inoffensive, But Still a Darn Good Time","Note: this review is based off of the 2019 version of the movie available on Disney+. I've noted this in my other reviews of the original trilogy movies, but there have been many different versions of ""Return of the Jedi"" that have been released through the years, and I believe that it's important to denote which version that I watched. I think that the original ""Star Wars"" has fared the worst through these re-edits, particularly the Mos Eisley scenes. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is left pretty much unscathed, with only a few changes made for continuity's sake. ""Return of the Jedi"" really only contains one change that I can't stand: the over-the-top inclusion of a CGI creature band in Jabba's palace. This fifteen second addition is just so out of place and weird. It doesn't really fit in at all with the rest of the scenes from Jabba's palace. I don't really mind the inclusion of planets introduced in the prequel movies to the ending. Some purists will disagree, but I think that it adds a lot of depth and scale to the universe of ""Star Wars."" I miss the Ewok celebration music, though.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) are all on a mission to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the clutches of the vile gangster, Jabba the Hutt. After the encounter at Jabba's palace, the crew join forces once more to attack a brand new Death Star that the Empire is constructing. Meanwhile, Luke returns to Dagobah to receive some final instruction from Master Yoda (Frank Oz). It is here where the revelation of the previous movie is confirmed, and Luke realizes that he needs to confront Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) in a final showdown. Han and the rest of the group land on the forest moon of Endor in order to shut down the shield generator that protects the vulnerable Death Star, which is still under construction. Lando pilots the Millennium Falcon and leads the Rebel Alliance in a space battle to take down the second Death Star.""Return of the Jedi"" lacks the charm and sense of adventure of the first movie, and it lacks the emotional depth and character development of the second. What it does give us is a satisfying, albeit safe and inoffensive, finale to the trilogy. Everything is wrapped up very nice and clean, and all of the characters get their own moments to shine. It's not any worse because of this; ""Star Wars"" as a whole is little more than fairy tales set in a unique space fantasy universe. I don't even really mind the Ewoks either. I think a lot of fans take these movies way too seriously, like they're supposed to be some form of high art. Take a chill pill -- you're watching a sequel to a movie that had a tiny green midget who lifted a spaceship with his mind. Suspend your disbelief.My biggest problem with this movie is really the middle third. The beginning and the end are both classic ""Star Wars."" The Jabba's palace scenes were some of my absolute favorite moments of any movie in the series growing up, and who doesn't love that ending? It's really just the middle, where we need to set up everything for the final battle, that the plot and the pacing slow down a lot and it gets really boring and dull. There's this strange little bit where the Ewoks think that C-3PO is some sort of god, and they are preparing to sacrifice the other characters to him, but this never really plays into the plot at all after the rest of the group is freed.Overall it's a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It's probably the worst of the bunch if you were to look at it through critical eyes. Some people don't like Harrison Ford's performance in this movie, but there are far more wooden and lifeless performances in this franchise. He does a fine job, but I will agree that he definitely lacks the charisma of the previous films. I think part of why people hate on this movie so much is the fact that it's really hard to match the highs of the previous two. Lightning struck twice with ""Star Wars."" It comes so close again in this one as well. It's not a bad movie by any means, I just think that it was going to be difficult for them to wrap up the trilogy in a definitive and satisfying way no matter which way they went about it (although this didn't stop Disney from producing more movies that expanded the story further).Watch the entire ""Star Wars"" trilogy. None of them are really worth bothering with after ""Return of the Jedi."" The ending is conclusive. There didn't need to be a set of prequels either, which pointlessly explained background information that we already knew through expository dialogue in the first three movies. Just keep in mind that these are silly action-adventure movies set in a space fantasy universe. Don't take them too seriously and just have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
an equal,"As a child, this was my favourite of the trilogy.  It had amazing creatures, a great racing battle scene, and the revealing of Darth Vader's face.  It was the best.I've read most of the comments about this film on imdb.com, and have found that the majority of them blast the film as the weakest of the three, mainly due to the addition of the Ewoks.Now, as a child, I loved the Ewoks.  Mostly because I had The Ewok Adventure & Ewoks: The Battle For Endor on tape.

A Decent Finish,"""Return of the Jedi"" has some of the strongest and most poignant moments of the entire ""Star Wars"" saga. There are moments of chilling visual symbolism. The climactic space battle is extremely well-choreographed, possibly one of the most well done special effects sequences in cinematic history. And George Lucas does well on finding a suitable climax for the series. There is a minority that says this was a cheap thing to throw in but I totally disagree. This scene is sad but ultimately touching, which I think will be made all the more so when the six stories are complete. The ending scene in the special edition is far more satisfying than it was originally.Which brings me to my complaints.""Jedi"" is slow-moving, from the long, drawn-out scenes in Jabba's palace, to the Endor battle with the Ewoks, an act in the film that is so poorly marred by bad pace and editing that you have to wonder whether the editors were suffering from severe attention deficit disorder while they were doing it. And let's not forget those Ewoks. Don't get me wrong, they are cute. But what in God's name do these little furballs have to do with the Force and the Rebellion?And then of course we have the acting. The one guy who seems to be really trying here is Mark Hammil (for once), who was never a very capable actor anyway but he does have some moments in which he shines here. I think what he did best in this one was actually underacting the role rather than playing the same old farmboy whiner (""A New Hope"") or the hero who thinks he can do anything (""Empire""). Then there's Carrie Fisher. I actually thought she was decent in ""A New Hope,"" and she was occassionally quite beautiful in ""Empire."" And she was attractive here as well, but man, that acting has got to go!!!I think this is the one film I did not really care for Harrison Ford, which is rather difficult because he is one of my top three favorite actors. Between the first two films we got the sense this character was changing, becoming a better man than the wisecrack we were used to. But in ""Jedi"" he's back to the same old wisecracks. In ""Empire"" he really started to look like he was caring for people, especially Luke- which is totally evident in the beginning of ""Empire."" In ""Jedi"" he's already back to looking down on him. Above all Ford himself seems disengaged from the film, bored with the material- something he admits, and something I do not blame him for at all.Again, there are moments of greatness in ""Jedi."" The score by John Williams is very good, some of the sets are impressive.These are the moments that illustrate to me the style that should have prevailed throughout the whole film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
