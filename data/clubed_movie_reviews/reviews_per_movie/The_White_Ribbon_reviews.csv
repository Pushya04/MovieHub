A careful and ambiguous analysis of evil,"Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'.The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events.In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games).'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work.These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity.One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children.Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Haunting Prequel to the Third Reich,"Filmed beautifully in black and white with subtitles, The White Ribbon is a movie that will leave viewers with a lasting residue long after it ends. The film portrays the residents of a northern German village, dominated by a baron, sometime before World War I.Inhabitants of this village, young and old, are sliding down the slippery slope of moral decline. The men in leadership positions - a doctor and clergyman, for example - are detestable, especially in their treatment of women and children. The most brutal scene in the movie, perhaps, was not one that portrayed physical violence, but verbal abuse towards a woman that served faithfully as caretaker, and more, for the town's widowed physician. As for the some of the children, although it is only suggested, it appears that they are budding sociopaths that perpetrate despicable acts against others.Weeks after seeing this film, I started thinking more deeply about the children in this town. I realized that they would become young adults during the time Hitler would rise in power. They live an incubator in which the cruelty that they experience they, in turn, perpetrate against unsuspecting victims. Their circumstances are such that they are being unwittingly primed for carrying out the atrocities that will come to characterize their future in Nazi Germany. The White Ribbon is a prequel for the rise of the Third Reich.Seeing this film led me to wonder about what present times are a prequel for.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is a movie against all extremisms,"In an interview with the French newspaper ""Le Monde"" on 10/20/09, published on 10/21/09, Michael Haneke has explicitly and unequivocally declared his intentions in making the movie ""The White Ribbon"":He intended to make a movie about the roots of evil. He said that he believed that the environment of extreme, punitive and sexually repressive protestantism in Germany, has laid the groundwork for Fascism and Nazism. He also said that he saw the same patterns developing in fundamentalist Muslim societies today, and that it is those societies that today were spawning terrorists and suicide bombers. Finally, he expressed the sentiment that ""The White Ribbon"" is a movie against ALL extremisms.Michael Haneke has directed his vision in a very masterful and artful way: the cinematography, the acting, and the script are all superb.The only problem I have is with the vision itself: The environment certainly plays a role, but to explain evil exclusively as the product of one's environment is simplistic and goes against common sense observation: The majority of people on this earth have grown up under repressive regimes and yet have NOT turned out to become murderers, mass murderers, terrorists or suicide bombers. Something is missing in the equation.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Exquisite and brooding mood-piece,"Few film auteurs can match the consistency of Michael Haneke, and once again the Austrian filmmaker has come up trumps with an exquisite and brooding mediation on repression, tradition and the sins of the father.Shot in stunning black and white, the film chronicles a series of mysterious events in a town leading up to the outbreak of WWI. The pace is slow and thoughtful, and the film is reference to August Sander while being a respectful throwback to the German expressionists whose work would come out of the horrors the film's narrative seems to foreshadow.The hallmarks of Haneke's body of work are all there – elegiac tone, clinical editing, wincingly frank dialogue – but in many ways The White Ribbon stands alone in the canon. It is a challenging work that will polarise audiences but represents a breathtaking new wave not just in the director's career but in European cinema.Some might say the film's inherent flaw is that there is no-one to root for, but this is perhaps its key strength. It's certainly plausible that this is Haneke's intention: he wants to position us as mute outsiders to a slowly creeping menace, unable to have a say in the invisible horrors that await us. The result is a deadening and thoroughly rewarding experience - a combination few filmmakers could hope to achieve.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nurturing Fascism Somewhere in Black and White Germany,"During the course of the year before WWI, a series of tragic and suspicious looking incidents take place in a small farming village somewhere in black and white Germany. The culprit or the culprits behind the crime wave will not be too easy to find.The doctor, the priest, the baron and the teacher who also narrates the film form the elite of the village. We get to know each one of them and a few other villagers along with children of this village, calm on the surface but deeply tormented by an undercurrent of brutality, envy, malice and apathy.The children's natural path to maturity is blocked by strict religious morality, cruelly enforced by the priest, thereby inhibiting their personal observation of the world around them. The priest feeds children with guilt and sexual repression instead of love and punishes even their most innocent mistakes. Certainly this environment will make it easy for them to not only accept but seek ruthless authority later in life.As might be expected, love in this town is restrained and uneasy, while incest and affairs are overlooked by villagers. The Baron employs half of the village in his farm, yet almost no one seems to be against feudalism, nor rise up against the accidents that happen in the workplace. Social justice is a stranger to town, yet villagers are entrenched in apathy.If adults do not face up the truth, however this truth might be against their convictions, rise up and take charge, then who will? And according to whose morality? Isn't fascism with racism, in short Nazism, misdirected popular anger and an easy response to deep injustices within a society ? Haneke observes mostly psychological, educational and religious roots of Nazism while leaving economic aspects mostly in the background.Visuals of the film are very solid. The symmetry in the shots and the tidiness of the houses, even of those belonging to the poor farmers hint at the discipline and rigor Germans are well known for. Acting is top notch by the whole cast, especially children's faces beam just like in Bergman films. Directing was superb.Haneke uses a village and a narrator similar in essence to Lars Von Trier's Dogville, still these two movies are clearly different.Das Weisse Band has also some similarities to Cache, but just one notch less satisfying than his masterpiece which had a slightly more intriguing and fulfilling story. This movie is made more accessible by Haneke with his choice of more obvious tips, where sometimes characters talk directly about the situation. But in a time and age when people are battling too many problems and drug themselves with TV and easy payoffs who could blame Haneke?Given the current global economic conditions and the fanaticism running high across all three major religions, this is a must-see movie for anyone caring about the future of our global village to avoid a Le Temps du Loup type of ending!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""A horror drama, free from horror images""","Stunningly beautiful, shot in the exquisite black and white, with the faces of the characters looking like the old pictures from the beginning of the 20th century, The White Ribbon has the longer title in German, Das weiße Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte -The White Ribbon - A German Children's Tale. The longer title gives quite a good idea behind the mystery of the troubling, disturbing, and shocking events in the film that did not have an explanation by the end of the film and left some viewers confused and unsatisfied. I think that the film is very clear and if approached with the open mind and readiness to accept the subtle details in the storytelling and implication, the open end will not disappoint. Anybody who is familiar with the work of Michael Haneke knows very well that he does not make pure mystery/thrillers even though his movies have a lot of mysteries and often very dark secrets By his own admissions, he uses the mystery in the White Ribbon to show the origins of the extremism of all epochs, and what could have been the beginning of the darkest times in the history of the country. Looking at the life of one small picturesque village in the northern Germany just on the brink of the World War 1, Haneke explores the malice, envy, apathy, hatred, and brutality that envelop the village like a web, and lead to the outbursts of evil that goes unpunished and will bring the larger evil in the future. While watching the film, I kept thinking how much it brings to mind the films of another master of grim and sad yet compelling and thought provoking pictures, Ingmar Bergman. Two of his films remind The White Ribbon especially. One, The Winter Light, a tragic and thought-provoking film about a village priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who can't give much comfort and hope to those who need them as he feels none for himself. Another - Fanny and Alexander, the story told from the point of view of two children, a brother and a sister whose lives changed tragically after their widowed mother married a local bishop, seemingly a charming and caring man. What would have happened to Fanny and Alexander, what kind of persons would they have become or would they have survived had they not had a big dysfunctional but loving family who saved them from the abusive, cruel hypocritical stepfather, Bishop Edvard Vergerus?Like Bergman, Michael Haneke does not make the horror films but the computer generated monsters are simply a joke comparing to the real monsters of hatred and evil that found a place to hide and grow in the souls and minds of the characters in his latest film. It is a serious, disturbing, and thought-provoking film. With all its darkness and pessimism, the film has sweet, touching and even humorous moments. They have to do with the only love story in the film and come to think of it, the only love story in all Haneke's films I've seen, between the film's narrator, the local school teacher and the 17 years old Eva, the nanny for the children of the baron, the most powerful man in village.One of the critics said that The White Ribbon is the film that will haunt the viewers for days and will be seen, discussed and thought of for the decades to come. I completely agree with that, and I feel I can watch it again and again. Yes, it is that good.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"the very definition of an ""art film""","Movies don't come much more austere or art-house friendly than ""The White Ribbon,"" a German film written and directed by Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke. With its stark black-and-white cinematography and deliberate pacing, the film has the look and feel of an old Ingmar Bergman picture - Ingmar Bergman crossed with M Night Shyamalan, that is, since its story centers around a village in pre-World War I Germany where strange and inexplicable things begin to happen. The town doctor is injured in a mysterious horseback riding mishap; the baron's son is found hanging upside down in a barn; a worker dies in a freak factory accident. All of this is narrated by the town's schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) who falls for a sweet, shy girl who works as a nanny at the manor house.The children - most of whom look like they just stepped out of ""Village of the Damned"" - struggle with thoughts of death and the guilt caused by a repressive society, while the adults - an emotionally rigid and unyielding pastor, a cruel, incestuous doctor - contend with their own inner demons, as they groan under the burdens of a class-conscious feudal system and the weight of their own conflicted desires. The theme seems to be that when people bury their natural urges under a crushing mountain of rules and regulations - whether societal or religious in nature - those sublimated urges will manifest themselves in other, demonstrably harmful ways (killing birds, destroying property, kidnapping and torturing children, etc.). The conclusion we're supposed to come to, I guess, is that it was from just such seeds that the war that was to come would eventually spring. I guess.I wish I could say that I liked ""The White Ribbon"" better than I do. It's certainly wonderful to look at, and there is something haunting and hypnotic about Haneke's vision of life in a small German village at that particular moment in time. But the plotting is so obscure, the pacing so funereal, and the overall demeanor so heavy-handed and pretentious that, I'm afraid, it takes quite a bit of forbearance and patience just to get through it all.Still, the mood and the visuals make it worth the effort.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The best film of 2009,"I find it incredibly difficult to rate a Haneke film, especially right after I watched it. His movies slowly grow on you and it takes a lot of time before you could fully appreciate them. When Michael Haneke makes movies he always has something to say, and he is truthful in every depiction he makes. Sometimes it's even hard to call some of his films entertainment. The White Ribbon is just another example of Michael Haneke's mastery in filmmaking. When it comes to the technical aspects there wasn't a single front that wasn't outstanding. The cinematography was so gorgeous that you could literally take any point in the film and make it the poster. This is probably the best looking Haneke film honestly. The pacing is slow but incredibly effective showing a very subtle growth of evil. The acting from everybody in this huge cast is outstanding, every kid actor in this movie is better than 99% of actors working today. Everyone was giving it their all and if you look at any person in any of Haneke's films you wouldn't spot a single actor that isn't doing a great performance.This movie is about evil and how it grows into something awful to come. It's super super subtle and kind of hard to catch. Michael Haneke is distracting us with the obvious evil so that we don't realize the subtle evil in front of us. So even though when I finished the film I was slightly underwhelmed when it ended, thinking back it was really harrowing. This is the closest Michael Haneke will ever come to making a Holocaust movie, and instead of giving you satisfying answers like Stephen Spielberg's Schindler's list it does something much more powerful and harrowing.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The unexplainable desire for purity,"The White Ribbon (2009)is a desperately dark story unfolding in a Protestant village of northern Germany just before the First World War. This microcosm is composed of a baron, a pastor, a doctor, ... and the plebs. Strange accidents will succeed one after the other, some worthy of a despicable barbarism, and will gradually pertain to a punitive ritual. The film is based on a few abject characters andMichael Hanekemasterfully films the darkness that ineluctably infiltrates the hearts of the fellow citizens from this German provincial environment, thanks to an aesthetic apotheosis and a cinematic sobriety. As a synthesis:The White Ribbon (2009)is a masterpiece. 8/9 of 10.",,Anonymous,History
Unforgettable,"The White Ribbon is a film that only Haneke could make. It's bleak, upsetting, perverse, and so true to the human condition that it's hard to watch, yet you won't want to look away. It forces you to think about how a society treats its children, and what those children will do when they've grown up and run the society. The cinematography alone is enough reason to watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stunningly bleak and haunting,"The cinematography is captivating and the people, adults and children alike look and act so convincingly that this film is truly remarkable. The dawn of an even more chilling new era of two world wars which these children are about to enter gives the events yet more deprh. I grew up in protestant northern Germany and remember the very old people in our village, who would have matched the ages of the children in their old age. The women continued to wear similar fashions, with only shorter skirts, the hair worn exactly like the girls in the film. The language, the houses and even some of the interiors I witnessed as a small child are very accurately reflected in this film. The film strongly hints at a brutalised generation which is gradually driven to extremism. This might be simplistic, but is worth considering. Overall a memorable masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterly Tale on the Circulation of Violence,"White Ribbon focuses on a pre World War I German town and surveys the evolution of violent, wild incidents resembling punishments indicted on certain individuals. We are provided access to the story from the point of view of the town teacher, whose recollective voice-over interposes throughout the film. The narration competently obscures the culprits, thereby attributing the responsibility for the rage, and its (hypocritical) social incorporation to the whole society rather than certain ""abnormal"" characters.In movie circles,White Ribbon is widely regarded as depicting the evolution of a microcosm of a proto-fascist society (which is to a certain extent viable by the way). However, the movie is a less Germany-specific and more universal parable on the socialization of rage and violence, on the evolution of the social circulation of rage and violence. The film follows a route from local (Germany) to universal, coming up with far reaching arguments, just as Foucault focuses on 18-19th century France and presents arguments on the evolution of prison and punishment systems.Considering Haneke's entire filmography, it is evident that the director has always been interested in philosophical takes on pschology and human interaction, without historicizing his filmic arguments strictly, i.e., without attributing time spans/societies to them. If we leave the mediocrity of the enterprise aside, Haneke's recent remake of Funny Games shot-for-shot, yet in a different society (USA rather than Germany) fittingly illustrates the point.After a span of work disappointing for many Haneke fans, the auteur returns with an influential and aptly argumentative film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Prolix, Overrated and Disappointing","A couple of years before the outbreak of the First World War, in a feudal German village, mysterious events happen. First, the local doctor has an accident when his horse stumbles on a hidden wire. Then a woman falls in a hole below the rotten floor of a barn and dies. The young son of the local baron is found hung upside-down and tortured. The retarded son of the midwife is found tied to a tree and brutally battered. In an environment of cruelty and abuses, the local teacher suspects that the repressed daughter and the son of the pastor are the responsible for the crimes.I was anxious to see ""Das Weiße Band - Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte"" and today I have finally watched this awarded film. Unfortunately I found it prolix, overrated and very disappointing and gives the sensation that the ending is missing.The black and white cinematography is top-notch and one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The performances are awesome and I was particularly impressed with the beauty and acting of the unknown Leonie Benesch. The screenplay is intriguing and engrosses the attention of the viewer from the very beginning. Unfortunately the story that has the obvious intention of showing the birth of the serpent egg of the Nazism and Fascism does not have a conclusion.Claude Chabrol, just to give an example, was specialist in films with intelligent open ends that forced the interpretation and the discussion of the viewers. Michael Haneke, on the contrary, leaves many questions without answers, even very simple points, like for example whether the teacher has married Eva or not; or the fate of the doctor and his family and the midwife. There are so many abusive and wicked characters that almost everyone would be capable of the evilness against the children. But I believe that the two adolescents with the white ribbon may be the responsible for the cruelties. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Fita Branca"" (""The White Ribbon"")",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Gripping, exciting, focused","Das Weisse Band represents the kind of cinema that is cerebral, cognitive and dialectic without deviating from the conventions of classic storytelling. In examining the origins and nature of terrorism in human societies and psychology, the film quickly resigns from a simple depiction of country rural life in 1913 and transforms into a sadistic 'whodunnit' thriller with the main protagonists being two conflicting generations: the elderly and the youth. Das Weisse Band takes the risk of setting off too many narratives in accordance to the individual stories that occur, but the utterly terrifying aspect and power-point of the film is what we do not see happening in front of our eyes. Gripping, exciting, focused cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Haneke produces his most timeless classic,"What do you do when you 'know' there is a very tangible threat but cannot point the finger? Recall, if you will, Jean. Julianne Moore's character in Crash: "" . . . and it was my fault because I knew it was gonna happen. But if a white person sees two black men walking towards her and she turns and walks in the other direction, she's a racist, right?"" Or the dilemma of Islam in Europe. On the one hand, we are impelled to protect the rights of the vulnerable minority. Protect their beliefs. Their innocence. Everything decent within ourselves that we wish to respect and preserve in others. But on the other, we are terrified of the prospect creeping Islamic militancy. We teeter on the brink of racism. Islamophobia. If we risk the sacred humanity in others we attack it in ourselves. And what if all the indications are wrong? What if all our beliefs are wrong? What if all the words led us astray? Too late, we know we have to talk about paedophile priests. Too late, we know we should have talked about Hitler (in the days before, yes before, he was the Bad Guy). Or even World War One before it happened. There are times when we cannot accuse. Times when it will do no good. But still, as Lionel Shiver might say, there are times when we know, 'We need to talk about Kevin.' Haneke confronts the paradox of confronting the unimaginable. Not in the Hollywood sense of 'too scary to think about.' Just confronting something that is outside the ability of the imagination to foreshadow. In Hidden, the format was an intricate art house film that appealed more to the cinema geek. The cult viewer. A brilliant film – but one you would probably need to watch at least twice before you could 'get it.' The White Ribbon is an altogether different genre. The mystery is laid out as carefully as any Hitchcock classic, albeit with the more restrained tones and iconography of Luis Buñuel. There is not the surrealism of his Exterminating Angel, but the clearly delineated social restraints that refuse to acknowledge anything that does not fit, they are all there. A small village on the eve of World War One. A fierce Lutheran Protestantism that will admit no way of thinking unless it is true to the cornerstones of its faith. Ignorance poses as innocence. And the horrors that can spring from deeply ingrained discipline.Somehow, within a community where everyone knows and trusts each other, a series of very unpleasant incidents occur. A wire is strung to trip the doctor's horse. A disabled boy is brutally attacked. A woman commits suicide. Unexplained arson. The seeds of deadliest emotions are there in a society that allows for nothing except goodness.Haneke carefully details various forms of patriarchal enforcement of this goodness. It might be righteous anger or compassionate punishment. I recall my philosophy teacher at university saying how some things can be learnt but not taught. Then another professor's dismissal of Aristotle's virtue theory on the basis that it cannot be 'taught.' In this Haneke world of black-and-white moral righteousness, those characters who seek no more than a least worst option seem to come, quite logically, to an untriumphant end. A boy who wants to save a wounded bird. A schoolteacher who wants to reveal with gentleness that which force cannot uncover.With Funny Games, Haneke shocked with intruders. With Hidden, he forced us to confront a barely solvable mystery. With The White Ribbon, his greatest work yet, a simple story takes on universal proportions. No intruders. No outsiders. We can no longer take refuge in any system of 'universal truth.' Whether it be the science of our sense or the dictates of religion. We must learn as we grow. This White Ribbon is no fairy tale story. It has no fairy tale ending. All is logical. Just that you might never, ever, be able to prove it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Enigmatic and disturbing,"A disturbing film about the youth of the generation that would be the adults of the Nazi period.As always by Haneke, beware for interpretations that are too superficial. Like the one that the authoritarian society and the authoritarian way the kids are raised had by force to result in the Nazi's rising to power. On you tube I saw a review that suggested a direct link between ""The white ribbon"" and ""The zone of interest"" (2023, Jonathan Glazer). I think this is too straightforward.Another interpretation (as usual Haneke gives no clue as to what interpretation he had in mind) is the inherent evil of the children. Also this interpretation is too straightforward. Eichwald (the village in which ""The white ribbon"" is situated) is certainly not a ""Village of the damned"" (1960, Wolf Rilla), in which the evil of the children originates in their supernatutal powersThe old ""nature or nurture"" discussion, but then focused on the origins of evil.There is only one thing we know for sure with respect to this film, the black and white photography is marvelous.Reading ""The name of the rose"" (1980, Umberto Eco) for the second time I was struck by the similarities in the narrative structure. In both film and novel an old men is looking back on the crimes he witnessed when he was much younger. In both cases the old man is more concerned with what these crimes say about the sign of the times than with the identity of the perpetrator.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Really good and interesting, but not great","My initial response was that Haneke was exploring where the support for Nazism came from and how the treatment of many of the village kids helped to influence this movement. As the schoolteacher says, ""They could clarify some things that happened in this country"". After watching the film though, I looked up some interviews only to learn Haneke denied that this film says anything about Nazism/fascism, so I realized I had to amend my reading of the film. I then came to the conclusion that Haneke was more interesting in exploring the repressive social order of the village and its effect on its inhabitants. While I wouldn't say this is a great film, I'd definitely say it does a great job at painting a bleak portrait of the village, one which is a lot more nuanced and complex than one would expect from reading a summary of its themes.In the village, the father figures hold the most power, controlling their kids and sometimes even going against their wives. The baron lies at the top of this social order. He has a paternalistic attitude which he displays throughout the film and occasionally lectures to the villagers. Though he isn't popular, most of the villagers are dependent on him. Since he's the employer of half the village, he has the power to fire and refuse to provide work to all the members of a particular family, shown by what happens to the farmer and his family. The next prominent character is the Pastor, who ranges from strict puritanism, seen by how he restrains his son to his bed after he finds out that, to authoritarianism, shown with his physical punishments of his kids and even his wife, to a degree. The film's title comes from how he ties white ribbons to his kids to remind them of their innocence and purity, but this motif later symbolizes the oppressive constraints placed on the kids concerning how white ribbon is used to tie the pastor's son to a bed or how ribbon is placed over a kid's eyes after he's savagely beaten. In spite of this, the pastor shows middle ground given a couple tender scenes where he allows his youngest son to care for an injured bird or how he accepts his son's gift of a bird later in the film. Another prominent character is the farmer. While we get to see some of the control he has on his family, he primarily shows us what can happen to a family who gets on the baron's bad side and he reinforces the dependency the villagers have on him. The last prominent character is the doctor. Although you initially sympathize with him, he's later revealed to be emotionally abusive to his wife (and possibly towards his previous wife) and physically abusive to his daughter. Each of these father figures contribute to the film's themes in many different ways. Due to this, it's not easy to pick up on everything from a single viewing and it usually takes a few viewings to grasp everything which goes on.These father figures effect the children in a variety of ways, presumably causing them to carry out the acts of violence. The connection between these incidents are that they're caused by the repressive social order of the village. For instance, the farmer's son destroys the baron's cabbage field as he believes he was responsible for the death of his mother, leading to the other struggles his family undergoes throughout the film. The steward's son pushes the baron's son into the water as he was jealous of him for having a working flute (he likely had it due to his family's high position in the village) while he had trouble whittling one out of wood. The steward's violent confrontation with his son afterwards was the effect of that. It's likely that the acts we don't see are also carried out by the children. For instance, were the pastor's kids responsible for attacking the baron's son given how their Dad punished them in a similar way? Were the pastor's kids responsible for the rest of the incidents in the village concerning the conversation the schoolteacher has with the pastor at the end? The way the final act handles all these mysteries might disappoint some people, but I found the payoff to be quite unsettling. The schoolteacher's final narration stuck with me for a while after the film ended.With all that being said, I'm not sure why Haneke chose to make the schoolteacher the protagonist. Where does he fit into all of this? Considering how fleshed out and interesting many of the other characters in the film are and how much they add to the themes, the schoolteacher feels one-dimensional by comparison. His relationship with Eva, for instance, holds such little relevance towards the film's themes, save for an admittedly interesting visit to her family where we see that the repressive social order of the village occurs elsewhere. For the most part though, I thought he was kind of boring. I wasn't quite as bothered with his character the second time around, but he still acts as a detriment to the film and locks it firmly in the really good tier.In conclusion, I'd say this is an example of a film held back from greatness from one major issue which could've easily been fixed. In spite of that, the rest of it is truly excellent. I imagine I'll get more out of the film if I were to watch it again since there's so much to unpack from it in terms of all the character dynamics (I know I didn't say much about the steward). If you haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Who is Michael Heneke?,"I need to know! Not just who is Michael Heneke but also who does he think he is? The arrogance of his work is only comparable to its brilliance.

The truth is - this is a difficult one...I'm not familiar with Haneke's films but I'm interested in German cinema so I thought I'd give this acclaimed movie a go.The White Ribbon tells a different kind of story - one you are not ready for, and it tells it in a very different way. Hollywood this is not.Because I'm not German this film was pretty much lost on me first time around. I had to watch the interview with Haneke in order to get hold of it. Only Germans have this history - nobody else - so it is going to be lost on most non-German watchers.In fact, The White Ribbon is rather good. Beautifully filmed and superbly acted by ""innocent"" youngsters, this film really makes you think.It's nasty. You keep watching because you kinda can't bring yourself to believe the things that Haneke is showing you. It's subtle, unpleasant, but hiding in plain sight. I didn't like it - but that didn't stop me appreciating what the story was telling me, and that it is a good film.Overall I'm giving The White Ribbon 7/10 because whilst beautifully filmed it was a difficult watch. A little too inaccessible for me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A dark meditation on the nature of evil in human hearts,"An unflinchingly-nihilistic movie that explores the darkness of humanity and authoritarianism, The White Ribbon is set in a fictional village in Germany just prior to World War I and tells the tale of a series of strange events and crimes that upset the peace of the local society. Shot with a gorgeously bleak white-and-black color palette and heralded by excellent performances (special props to the child actors who all deliver genuine and convincing showings), this is a film that, despite having no scares in the traditional sense, is at its core a horror movie: less of the chainsaw-wielding masked-monster type, more of the depressing Shakespearian-tragedy kind.Like Haneke's earlier movie, Caché, The White Ribbon presents itself as a mystery and whodunit-type affair, but only as a framing device. It is less-interested in the solution to the crimes and is instead more about exploring the people surrounding the heinous events: how they are impacted, their reactions to the whole thing, and the implications that the crimes have on who they really are. By having the crimes subtly mirroring the actions and customs that the villagers have traditionally practiced and accepted as social norms, the movie cleverly and effectively forces the characters to face their own selves in a disturbing new light - even if only briefly, and even if they don't realize it.The pacing of the movie is on the slower side, and viewers that are seeking thrills or definitive resolutions are likely to be left somewhat unsatisfied. However, if you are looking for a visually breathtaking film that delivers a chilling commentary on the roots of human evil that will leave a lasting impact, The White Ribbon is a fine pick.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A cinematic novel about the evil side of human nature,"Michael Haneke's White Ribbon is surely not a film that anyone can sit through and maintain a steady focus throughout but that is not neccesarily a disadvantage. The slow pace of the movie serves to pull you in it's suffocating reality of moral degradation and degeneracy.The way the movie unfolds feel like a novel with the narrator guiding us through the dramatic space and time and offering us his information on the townspeople. The action is not really the centerpiece rather revolving around the development of the characters and the deeper understanding of their relations and dynamics.The story has from the start a certain ambiguity in the way that it's presenting leaving the judgement as to what is true or not up to the audience and using gossip and rumour as a literary artifice for not providing solid information. Even the ending of the movie is shrouded in a veil of mystery which seems to further stress out the fact that the plot is not really the point here.Haneke rather adopt a historical facade through which he can raise questions about our time. The underlying problem with which we are faced is the interaction between morality and justice and the decadence which is brought by their abscense. When the whole structure of a society is built upon the concealment of abuse and injustice people in their desperation find atonment and redemption violent revenge.But Haneke's search for knowledge doesn't seem to end with a structuralist explanation of injustice he rather seeks to find the root of it the elusive essence behind the phenomena. Simply put he want to understand evil itself. That is why he narrowes his point of focus down to the small rural community. The director's observation seem to link evil and violent behavior to strict discipline and repression. The hypocritical moral superiority of the figures of authority, pretentious virtue signaling and religious fundamentalism are all typical qualities of conservative community if you've ever seen one.The choice to set the action just before the start of WWI cannot be coincidental. Haneke seems to claim that you can apply the small scale psychological structure of a small community to explain grand historical phenomena like ultranationalism and fascism. This is cinematically demonstrated through the juxtaposition of the events of the community to the event of the world war.The visual storytelling bis reminiscent of Bergman which in itself is a huge feet in itself. The still shots offer a brief moment of serenity amidst the horror and are quiet frankly divinely beautiful. Also the shots where the villagers are gathered in church cluster information with profound efficiency.A masterpiece of german cinema but definitely not for lovers of fast paced movies .",8.0,Anonymous,History

The White Ribbon (2009),"Directed by Michael Haneke. Starring Leonie Benesch, Christian Friedel, Burghart Klaußner, Ulrish Tukur, Ursina Lardi, Steffi Kühnert, Susanne Lothar, Maria-Victoria Dragus, Leonard Proxauf, Fion Mutert, Rainer Bock, Josef Bierbichler, (voice) Ernst Jacobi. (R)Dismal but strangely fascinating meditation on the oppressive, nigh-casual growth of evil, from a director who has often presented a worldview of renunciation. Set in a small German village shortly before the start of WWI, the townspeople are at a loss over a series of seemingly random but methodical incidents of violence; loyalties split between the Baron's (Tukur) seat of power and the Pastor's (Klaußner) seat of influence furrow resentment and cause rifts of blame; the innocence shallowly represented by white ribbons cuffed to children gets smothered by the stern moralizing of the authoritarians. Its arm's-length approach to the material diminishes its resonance, especially at nearly two-and-a-half hours of gloom on the cusp of monotony. Regardless of the reductive qualities of its chilly mechanism, the film's point is clear while evading an emotionally satisfying conclusion (this ain't a whodunnit begging for a dramatic reveal during the final reel). Even those who are put off by its observational remoteness should find the gorgeous cruelty of Christian Berger's photography too incredible to dismiss.77/100",8.0,Anonymous,History
It just fails to be emotionally compelling.,"Widely regarded as the best European film of 2009, Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon centers on the birth of evil in pre-war Germany. A year before the breakout of the World War I a series of sudden accidents interferes with the peaceful life in one of German villages. This concept sounds much better on paper, and with Haneke's methodical approach The White Ribbon tends to be slow and mundane. Haneke cares more about concepts than characters. That's why he mechanically subordinates every event to his fatalistic thesis. To my surprise, it works really well introducing dense atmosphere of dread and tension into the film. While Haneke's examination seems relatively credible due to stark realism throughout the film, he keeps using his old tricks: the lack of climax and unresolved ending. They certainly worked way better in his metaphorical thriller Cache (Hidden) than in The White Ribbon that would benefit from the strong filmmaker's statement in the end. On the top of that, the latest Haneke's offering represents an artistic cinema with impressive cinematography, detailed set pieces and lavish compositions. It's just a major letdown that the film fails to be emotionally compelling. 6.5/10 (B-)",6.0,Anonymous,History

This incredible perfect movie (look at the amazing cinematography!) paints(sometimes It seems to watch a Vermeer's work turned into B/W) the human Evil. Cause - as Haneke shows with his other pictures - the Evil, the perfect blind Evil (with the capital E) belongs to human nature. ""DWB"" reminds me the best achievements of European masters from the North like Carl T. Dreyer or Ingmar Bergman.

The White Ribbon,"It all starts when the local doctor (Rainer Bock) is knocked from his horse by some wire carefully strung between two trees. Incapacitated and sent to the (not so) nearby hospital, his is just the start of some fairly brutal mishaps that befall this small rural community as Europe drifts towards the start of the Great War. It's a sort of feudal existence for this community were everything stems from the baron (Ulrich Tukur). When his young son is violently assaulted, tensions run high in the village and as more atrocities emerge they all start to turn on each other and suspicions run high. It might be, though, that the children of the pastor might hold the key. That's what the narrator, and rather naive teacher (Christian Friedl) eventually concludes, but as he investigates as surreptitiously as he can, we find a great deal more going on amidst a village of child molesting, cruelty, adultery and basically anything that could easily contribute to the negative mindset of those carrying out these acts of pretty calculated wickedness. Each of the villagers has their moment in the cinematic sun as we are taken, almost door to door, on a tour of their foibles and peccadilloes. It delivers quite a potent look at the almost, sometimes literal, incestuous nature of country life where people live in fear of losing their patronage and their survival depends on the harvest - and that depends on a God who is represented by Burghart Klaußner's enigmatically characterised pastor. This is a conflicted man more concerned with a status quo than necessarily with the truth. There is mystery here, but that rather fades into the background of quite a disturbing character study that is puzzling and intriguing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece most will not understand,"Just finished watching this at Melbourne International Film Festival 2009 with the girlfriend..She rated it a 2 out of 5, I gave it a out of 5..Both of us also saw a fantastic documentary called The Cove on the weekend which we both rated 5 out of 5..Just goes to show that anything that we emotionally and visually connect with is going to inherently going to rate better..The White Ribbon deals with our hypocritical society and really exposes how little we have progressed..Sins are committed by elders in the name of religion or parenting and the children bear the scars..Are we any better today in our behaviour? I think not..Haneke doesn't bother ramming it down our throats..Indeed, the black and white cinematography is exquisite and a major reason I felt why we couldn't connect with on a emotional scale..Perhaps Haneke meant that to be so?None of the characters overshadow each other and things move at a deliberate pace..Things unfold slowly so we may understand what is happening here..Elders committing atrocities, going unpunished for their behaviour, but the sins are being punished by crimes against the children, and in an interesting turn of events, questions are raised by the central character, The Teacher, that the crimes may indeed be the handiwork of the children themselves, punishing the parents for their repulsive behaviour...As per usual, nothing is laid out on a platter, not even the ending..remember Hidden(Cache)? A lot of quizzical looks around, muted applause and a lot of ppl like my girlfriend will forget about it by tomorrow..But as a lesson on what animals and monsters we hide and ignore behind the safe curtain of society's rules of hypocrisy, this is a monumental expose by Michael Haneke..Brilliant, thought-provoking, sublime cinematography and a movie-maker self-assured to let the movie slowly unfold and at the top of his game, yet another important addition to his existing body of work.. **** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,History
Spellbinding,"Many of the other reviewers have perhaps missed a larger point of what I think (IMHO) this masterpiece is about. They've attributed the pre-WWI straight-jacket, blinkered and regimented lives of the people in this village as explaining the rise of the Third Reich. Other reviewers have complained about the 'unsatisfactory' ending: that the unsettling events portrayed were not fully explained. The movie ends just before the onset of WWI. The writer's point is that evil cannot always be explained, but it always begets further evil (e.g. WWI - a horror in itself, and which in turn led to the subsequent horrors of the Third Reich). The many 'little' horrors committed in the village by unknown perpetrators are matched by other little horrors committed by fully known perpetrators. The ghostly quietness of this movie, the drabness (black and white frames only) of what should have been a gorgeous rural backdrop is very much in sync with the existential solitude, feeling of entrapment, and inevitability of something dreadful that lurks ... in all of us. More prosaically though, this movie contains all the ingredients key to any good story: the viewer wants to know what comes next; wants to get to the bottom of the mysteries; cares about the characters; the dialogue is spare and riveting; the acting, cinematography, casting and directing superb. Memorable, thought provoking, spellbinding. (If you only like fast paced action movies, or whodunits, then you'll hate this movie).",,Anonymous,History
Paedophile in disguise,"Michael Haneke's new film is a mystery ""whodunit"" without a tiresome detective Poirot summing up the situation and announcing his conclusion at the end. This can be an unsatisfying experience for the spectator, who may feel being conned for over two hours watching a drama without ending. It certainly is a very intriguing film. Strange that most comments in this forum like to associate this story to the genesis of Nazism, this seems to me far-fetched. The story unfolds in a small village in Germany just before WWI on the events involving children – who are aplenty in the film (it seems that every family in this small village has at least 8 children, except the doctor whose wife died after the birth of his second child). The mysterious occurrences in the village all seem to have appearances of divine retribution for the ""sins"" of the victims either in their present or their past lives.I am not convinced that this signifies the birth of the Nazism. Some commentators in this forum seem to complicate the story by reading too much between the lines and missing the obvious fact. I am surprised that no one made any allusion to the sexual deviance and paedophile behaviour of the Pastor in the film. Watch: instead of being enraged by the incest between the doctor and his daughter, the Pastor was secretly jealous. His apparent severity towards his own children in matters of sexual nature was his deliberate act to disguise his sexual frustration. When the teacher mentioned that the midwife had found out the perpetrator behind the torture of two children, the Pastor was visibly shaken, and immediately closed the windows to prevent the leaking of the news to the outside world. Has no one ever thought that this is a story about a sexually frustrated paedophile in the guise of a Pastor?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Michael Haneke does Bela Tarr better than Bela Tarr,"Had an unwatched bluray of this for about six months, and today I finally felt like watching it. Given it's two and a half hours long and directed by Michael Haneke (who's a talented filmmaker, but not always my cup of tea, and with a reputation for making depressing films), I had to seize the opportunity, because The White Ribbon is not the kind of film I'm often in the mood for.To no surprise, yes, it was quite miserable, but thankfully, it was extremely well-made misery. I think it's the most I've been engaged by a Haneke film so far, as while the pace is slow, it's still easy to get sucked into the rhythm of the film and its mysteries, the acting was great across the board, and the black and white visuals were beautiful.It centres on a small European town that's rocked by a series of strange occurrences, and the time it's set in itself isn't revealed until about 80% through the film (so it might possibly be a spoiler? Maybe). It's got some upsetting themes and scenes, but it never feels exploitative or tacky, being mature and carefully made throughout.Not a film that's easy to recommend, but it's a pretty great (though very downbeat) drama. Feels a bit like a Bela Tarr film except with a little bit more going on narratively.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Political allegory,"Filmmakers can be excellent in the visual narrative, the structuring of a movie or the staged play itself. Only a handful of them are able to handle these three qualities simultaneously. Haneke for example, although competent in the latter two, misses visual imagination. His movies are mostly too static to be relevant in say 20 years.Haneke's trademark is the hiding of the story beneath the surface and in this respect Das weisse Band can be seen as Caché 2. Besides heavy borrowing from his own movies there is also an extreme amount of copying from very diverse types of filmmakers.Most remarkable is the acting here, almost Scandanavian in nature (restricted, inside-out) and almost identical of that found in Bergman's work. The pastor's section is strongly reminiscent of Fanny and Alexander, both in style and substance. Also borrowed in this segment is Bergman's strong symbolism, although generally less powerful and more direct here (the bird, e.g.).The voice-over's diction and neutral tone reminded me of Dogville and Manderlay (von Trier). A lot of camera-work is also done by fixing the camera behind the character, showing his or her perspective in the story and mostly seen in work by the brothers Dardenne (and later Aronofsky's The Wrestler).Haneke copied the shock-editing from Kubrick, and it is almost strange to see so few other filmmakers use it, while it has become one of Haneke's major styles. The other major style is mentioned before: hiding the story, whereby the reverse consequence is that 'The camera lies all the time' (taken from DePalma).Das weisse Band also resembles The Village from Night Shyamalan, but here the overlapping is only superficial, as the political allegory about the dooming world war is more direct. The allegory itself, albeit intended powerful is relatively weak, as the mapping of events and institutions in the village is not always directly possible to the complex factors surrounding the start of WWI.The whole movie contains almost no music (except for some live music), the persons representing institutions in the movie have no name, things also present in La Pianiste. The tranquility of the acting and the slow pace all transform you to the beginning of the 20th century, but again copied from Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (both Kubrick and Haneke make also heavy use of Schubert).The problem is that Haneke's style is not innovative enough for me to be overwhelmed by his productions. In the first hour Das weisse Band comes a long way in setting out something new, but after all the typicality's of Haneke's movies are introduced, the interest on my side faded. I hope in the future he will act as another famous Austrian and ride more the waves of creative destruction.",7.0,Anonymous,History

He lives with his young wife and children. She hates it there and the kids are accepted grudgingly by their peers. In the village are a harsh Protestant minister, a schoolteacher, a doctor, and other figures of fierce authority, plus quite a group of children who have lived in oppressive conditions. We are mad privy to the humorless village where no one smiles and where common people live in fear of the future. Religion is presented as a venomous and ugly thing. The minister's children are routinely beaten and humiliated for their ""sins"" including an awful diatribe on the results of masturbation (sores, mental illness, and death). The boy is forced to sleep with his hands tied to the sides of the bed. It becomes likely that all this oppression is going to ultimately lead to some pretty bad results.

Two and a half hours of self-indulgent dullness,"Granted, the cinematography is breathtaking (and in b&w to boot!), what with the waving corn fields, the snowed landscapes, the oh so blond, so abused, so good-ole German children.

But, alas, in this film the spirits never come to life!For nearly three hours, we are exposed to a recurring series of genre paintings accompanied by trite dialogues that are probably supposed to reflect an atmosphere of repression, hypocrisy, social injustice and what-not, but remain shallow common places at worst and hilarious parody at best. A number of acts of violence thrown in now and then are arguably intended to provide a hint of a plot and -for the same price- conjure up the lurking-presence-of-evil-inherent-to-human-nature, but both their cinematic and philosophical potential remain undeveloped in the scorching light of the director's self-loving drive to show us how Germany really looked like.Haneke has no doubt read his Fontane and his Thomas Mann too. He probably expects his audience to have done the same and be ready in advance to put him in the same set, which he seems to get away with, if the ratings are anything to go by.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Andrew Wyeth meets Stephen King,"This was an unforgettable movie experience. I don't recall ever seeing such starkly beautiful cinematography, where every frame seemed like an Alfred Stieglitz black and white photograph. The artistic nature of this film seemed to combine the rustic simplicity of Andrew Wyeth's paintings coupled with the literature of Stephen King. The trailers seemed a bit pretentious, but the rave movie critic reviews now seem well deserved. The story itself had a slow but ominous development, where the people of a rustic pre-WWI German village are experiencing various accidents and wanton acts of vandalism. It's unclear who is at fault, and much of the storyline falls around who the culprits could be. I found the pace fit very well with the plot development. The movie really kept me on the edge of my seat. The dialogue and plot are all very good, and the camera work and photography are truly one of a kind.Many might find the plot too slow and the characters too harsh and unlikable. Yet the character development was excellent and the screenplay seemed as though it could have been written by Thomas Mann.

Artful analysis of evil's origins,"""My God, why won't you just die?"" The doctor to his mistress in White Ribbon.Director Michael Haneke seems quite comfortable with ambiguity, as I am, if you remember the uncertain identity of the clandestine videographer in Cache and now witness the strange events in a small northern German town at the cusp of the 20th century just before WWI. That ambiguity allows interpretations that range from original sin to the coming of the Nazis.Random bad luck such as a farm wife falling through rotten floor boards to a wire strung to trip a horse and its rider plagues a very ordered, even stern, small town without anyone being able to solve the mystery. The most plausible and outrageous solution is the children, but proof is non existent. Besides, as in life itself, many adults qualify. The allegorical implications of children being readied for Nazi crimes against mankind in the next half century are clear, so looking for symbolic clues among caged birds and repressed love is legitimate. You'll not see a better artful analysis currently about the origins of evil.The title itself refers to ribbons affixed to malefactors to remind them of their sins and the innocence from which they came. The similarity to Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter can't be overlooked as well as the Puritan environment that bred rebellion from authority and repetition of parents' sins. Rest assured, these townspeople are guilty each one of something.Although deservedly nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign film, it is also nominated for cinematography, perhaps its strongest technique. The simple farms, clean and straight like Amish settlements, highlighted by pristine snow, are waiting to be violated or can withstand righteous assaults enough to destroy whole civilizations. The black and white monochrome assures we know this is good and evil country.Although White Ribbon is too long by a half hour, it is a satisfying tour of a landscape filled with malice, deceit, malevolence, and a bit of romance to remind us of the evil's roots and the rebirth and irony of white-ribboned innocence.",,Anonymous,History
Would have been good at half the length,"A long and slow portrayal of a very conservative and judgemental Austrian village, just before the outbreak of World War One, in which some moderately interesting events happen to some dull and spiteful characters.The film succeeds in building an atmosphere of bleakness - if you want to know exactly what it feels like to live in a joyless, judgemental, protestant, Germanic society where traditional protocols are enforced by miserable dominant patriarchs then this is your film. If you want to get an impression of how German or Austrian society could have been gripped by the charisma of an obsessively judgemental fascist dictator, then you might think that this gives you some insight.Certainly, this film leaves an strong impression, although partly this is because watching it was such a miserable experience that I felt like I was actually there. Visually, is where this film excels, although there is a touch of emperor's-new-clothes about the choice of black and white film. There is very little use of artificial light which means that in the inside scenes are dim, but the contrast is beautifully balanced and details are retained. The wide aperture required in these low lighting conditions causes a short depth of field (only a short distance is in focus), which gives these scenes a certain realism and is sometimes used to add emphasis. In the night time scenes, the bold contrasts between light and dark are used creatively in conjunction with the narrative. A lot of the other technical aspects of this film are good too - set and costume design all create a sense of authenticity.The characters leave a strong impression too. Every one is poker faced. Dialogue is either formal, angry or judgemental. No-one cries or laughs throughout. They feel very realistic but superficial. We see how people are, but we don't see why they are that way. It is obvious to say that growing up in such a place is not going to do wonders for the mental health of the next generation, but I would have found it much more engaging to have had insight into at least one of the characters, or a character that provided perspective. Even the narrator is charmless and dull. Maybe the characters are not realistic after all, because in the world that I frequent, I occasionally come across someone that I don't want to slap around the face.The plot is meant to be intriguing but it happened too slowly and it happened to characters that I was quite happy to see go off to the First World War trenches. I felt mildly intrigued towards the end, but before all was revealed, the film ended. This was meant to make you think but by this stage all I could think about was getting to the bar.There is a chance you will find this film very absorbing, haunting and thought provoking, but in my opinion, life is too short (and it is arguably shorter than this film). Do yourself a favour: spend the time you would have spent watching this film down the pub talking to someone that actually IS interesting, and if anyone asks you what the film was like just say ""Oh it was a fantastic allegory of the rise of 20th century fascism."" Also mention that it was black and white which, naturally, adds 2 points to any film's profundity. Every one's a winner.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A brooding and messy metaphor,"""Das weisse Band"" is disappointing compared to other German productions I've seen recently and I've become quite a big fan of German cinema. The story in this movie is extremely slow. There's very little tension around the events happening, there's more tension about the impending First World War but even that turns out to be a rather non-event. If you're looking for the political tension that was present in previous German films like ""The Lives Of Others"" and ""Good-Bye Lenin"" you won't find it here. There's not a lot to like. The cinematography is quite nice, the whole film is in black & white which extenuates the time and place. A few performances stand out as being quite good but the whole movie is steeped and stewed in metaphor.The White Ribbon is put on the children who do not behave.

"Impressive, oppressive","Northern European literature is rife with family tales and coming-of-age stories told against the backdrop of Lutheran austerity. During its heyday - he 1970s and 1980s - Dutch and German filmmakers translated several of these novels to the silver screen, with reasonable results. But here comes Michael Haneke, an Austrian(!) director with the superb, original ""Das Weiße Band"" to belatedly capture Calvinist cinema's crown.Shot in stark black and white, ""Das Weiße Band"" transports us to a German village in the 1910s, where people work hard, pray hard and go nowhere, literally. If you squint, there's a touch of Twin Peaks here: Haneke's efficient script wastes no time introducing us to a variety of villagers, all of them struggling in one way or the other. Instantly, ominous things start to happen. Right from the opening credits, the atmosphere is captivating and believable. My grandparents grew up in the 1910s, and Haneke's sets look completely like their family photographs.Without giving away too much of the plot: this movie is very pretty, but contains some painful images. It is restrained and formal, but emotionally draining. It is not recommended for viewers who can't stand to see children get hurt. At the same time, it features some great, lighthearted scenes illustrating the social customs a century ago. The scenes with the schoolteacher and his fiancée are particularly priceless.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History
I love you Michael Hanneke,"One of the great pleasures of watching a film for the first time is the bubbling of thoughts and ideas going through your mind about where this will all lead and of what meaning is being imbued. The White Ribbon is magnificent in that it keeps this constant inner dialogue alive throughout. By not over-explaining events you end up having a beautifully filmed and edited slice of life at it's most interesting. In life it often takes a period of time until you become fully aware of events and people's involvement in them and it's nourishing to know that your own instincts keep working behind the scenes to help understand things for the future. I love the way The White Ribbon doesn't tie up all loose ends, and although I have only seen it once, I have thought about watching it again many times.My only disagreement with other 10/10 reviewers is the knife and fork linkage to Nazis. I think by inferring that the children of the film will be adults by the time of WW2 is clumsy and pointless. Michael Hanneke has on a few occasions held up the mirror that young people are not all harmless, lovable creatures and that innate fear by adults of this proposition is a much scarier vision than anything WW2 can conjure. It seems the English-speaking world are sick with the idea that nothing could ever be as bad as a Nazi. Hanneke knows better and so do I.",10.0,Anonymous,History

He doesn't give you the answers. Remember Cache and Funny Games? This film is no different.Accidents(?) happen and we don't have easy answers. Where is the evil coming from? What will be our response? Usually the response is an increase in authoritarianism. Witness the easy manner in which many Americans were willing to give up their hard won freedom after 9/11 to obtain some quieting of their fear. It is the same everywhere. We do not see the rise of fascism in the film, but we see the seeds being sown.The children grow up in a paternalistic highly religious society where rich and poor are strictly separated. Children are punished for the slightest infraction, while the adults practice adultery and incest with impunity. There is no love shown anywhere except between the teacher and the nanny.These are the children that will become the Nazis of the future. Is it this upbringing that caused that? This seems to be what Haneke is trying to say, but he leaves it to us to sort it out.The film was riveting and the time flew by as we looked at clues to determine who was the source of evil.

The mention of the war sounds like the kind of elements that foreshadows some role the major conflict would play, but if it's any spoiler, I'll say that war has nothing to do with the story and if you expect the kind of movie to provide hints or signals, you'll be disappointed... first and mesmerized after. This is an extraordinary journey in an atmosphere of nauseating and sickening suspicion without any resolution whatsoever.And the warning is necessary because if there's ever a genre to classify the film, it is Mystery. The word should even be used in the plural form as it features many incidents that punctuate the daily routine of the village, from a prank leading to a fall from horse, to a fire, from cabbage decapitation to child molestations, it is bizarre that all these deeds are strung together but that's because the movie brilliantly reflects the fullest range of human malevolence and that we never know who's committed each act is more disturbing than the acts themselves.Haneke fears violence like the next decent man but he fears it so much, he feels the need to anticipate it, to expose its in frontal nudity to better conceal its reversely sacred status, he's not a glorifier of human violence but an iconoclast. Whereas Hollywood is often timid when it comes to display real-life violence, using over-the-top depictions to better make up for their falseness, Haneke dares to show a dead body being toileted or the bloody face of a child who's just been molested, with macabre details revealed. It is ugly but it does justice to the moral fight against violence to show 'the enemy'.Violence isn't just physical, it is also verbal and sometimes with more devastating effects. There's a scene where a doctor confronts his nurse and what comes from his mouth is a flood of verbal bullying that would lure any fragile soul into suicidal candidacy. The man who speaks is the one who fell from the horse in the opening scene, when the animal's legs were stopped by an invisible cable tied between two trees. He's the first victim, but he' as capable as being pitilessly cruel as the monster who pranked him.The film is shot in black and white, but this is not just an artistic license, the early century was old enough to be captured in monochrome, whether cold photographs or silent archives and recent enough not to be depicted in bright painterly colors, it was indeed a time in black and white. But that look precisely invites us to focus on greyish parts, the shadows, what lies behind the curtains of respectability or that dusts off the ashes of evil. Because this is what the white ribbon symbolizes, not the so-called purity but the pretension to achieve it.The film circles around the lives of many villagers, from various ranks and backgrounds at a time where people were mostly defined by their jobs, a baron, a priest, a farmer, the doctor, the teacher, and every one of them tries to maintain a façade of dignity. In an intense scene, a priest delivers a long monologue to his elder children after they've come late home... this is a clear reflection of the kind of puritan mentalities that forged some artistic geniuses like Ingmar Bergman, the use of repression or symbols to conceal the demons. But Haneke is as explicit when it comes to show how laborious these rituals are as to demonstrate their uselessness.This is a village where moral and social conveniences end up poisoning relationships, aa farmer's wife dies because of a work accident but the husband can't complain because he knows it's a lost cause, the baron is the employer and you can't cut the hand that feeds you. A young optimistic teacher tries to seduce the baron's nurse but fails to convince her father to marry him, the priest's son prays God for killing him because he did something wrong, what he did we never know. Still, enumerating all the episodes would be futile and meaningless compared to the main experience.The real achievement is to create a journey where we can sense the presence of two forces, evil and guilt, but with cloud of uncertainty making impossible to associate them with the perpetrators, only the victims, and even then, there's a crucial point Haneke makes is that victimhood doesn't make you an innocent person. In the context of today, where there's a clear gap between victims and predators, you'd have serious troubles if you even dare to say that, but this is why German cinema is so cold and detached, it respects our intelligence enough not to take side, or flatter our moral conscience, it invites us to reconsider our certitudes.""The White Ribbon"" isn't an intellectual exercise, it's a film about people, men, women and children, caught in a sort of hellish spiral they don't know about. Trying to associate this pattern of violence with the rise of Nazism would be too tempting and reducing, because evil has no boundaries, we all carry it, we all have reasons to fear it as much as to commit it. What Haneke does is depicting violence to deprive it from any kind of taboo value, and by refusing to provide hints or answers, he makes both everyone guilty and everyone innocent, and you've got to figure out which option is the worst.We all have our 'white ribbons' our limits, and in the absolute no one would over cause harm to anyone, but these things happen, and just because they are irrational doesn't make them immune to a form of rationality, this is the country of Kant that established that for each cause there's an effect and inversely, and one effect becoming a cause, and maybe that's the perpetual movement of history captured in this microcosm of humanity",9.0,Anonymous,History
Decline of the West,"It seems that a consensus's been achieved at last if not regarding this movie's meaning, but its main theme at any rate - it's apparently meant to be an exploration into the origins of totalitarian mentality and conditions promoting its development with Nazism taken as an example. Haneke is also known to have claimed on multiple occasions that his movies are too complicated to reduce their supposedly multi-layered and exquisitely nuanced meaning to messages roughly formulated in a slogan-like way of bad criticism. Well, let's take the liberty of not taking the director's word for it and ask ourselves: what does this film say anyway? And is Haneke's persistent elusiveness an indication of profundity or cowardice and manipulation?First of all, let's admit the obvious - the nature of totalitarianism is hardly all about distorting ideals through turning them into a soulless absolute. Or rather this turning is the process's technical outcomes, not its underlying reasons. While the reasons, again, hardly constitute the binomial theorem. In which case, what would be the purpose of the movie's quite complicated construction and the essence of its hypothetically subtly nuanced meaning? Is it an attempt to provide an in-depth examination of the subject or is the author simply trying to dodge calling things by their right name and selling vagueness for complexity?I'm afraid that Haneke's most recent film is not so much more than just a brilliantly - which should be admitted - executed manipulation that fairly successfully accomplishes the shift mentioned. In quite cunning a manner the director fills this work with multiple ostensibly mysterious scenes and details that are obviously supposed to create an impression that they can be validly interpreted in several different ways. However, by means of that the author totally eliminates the possibility of a single consistent overall explication. As a result the audience is left with nothing better than the necessity to invent for Haneke the meaning - or meanings - of this indeed highly intricate construction which he has forgotten to put into.Or deliberately decided not to do so - at least in any articulate way. Even though he was talking about things which were, in fact, not that ambiguous at all. As well as he failed to think of nothing better than referring - though in a parabolic way - to a hundred year old events and some relatively ""innocuous"" at present nation to fabricate a simulation of an honest utterance on this indeed very serious and momentous subject. And did so now - when our world is balancing on the verge of a catastrophe, which coming into reality will inevitably make this subject even more relevant. Because it's much easier to assume the demeanour of an aesthete and deliver abstract judgement in respect of something so distant. And, of course, we are all against any manifestations of fascism and totalitarianism. But it somehow doesn't prevent us from accepting the Patriot Act.And it's so nice of the director to have avoided any didactics, too. Because how can we be bothered with telling us what is what without being provided with a choice to decide for ourselves whether we want to think so or not - or rather with an idiotic illusion that we do have such a choice - even if the audacity of an utterance just amounts to observing in a definitive manner that the sky is blue? And, surprisingly enough, guess what? This sickening ""political correctness"" conveniently applied to the process of perception of reality - so that anyone could lie to oneself and everyone around unrestrictedly regardless the degree to which this reality happens to be distorted along the way - doesn't somehow lead to neither increase in acuity which is employed in the process of observation nor to greater accurateness of its results.Instead we see every day how black is sold for white in ways so barefaced that they often happen to be not just beyond good and evil, but far beyond any boundaries of elementary sanity. And in this badly strange world, where all philosophical systems happen to be pushed out by vulgar kinds of phenomenology, where art suffocates from a reek being issued by the decaying corpse of post-modernism (the latter, frankly, never smelt too good, even when alive), in our completely screwed-up society where everything is faked - politics, economy, religion, communications, culture - such ""heroic intellectuals"", who come up with such daring insights, seem to know exactly what they do. To such a world they offer the art of imitation and an imitation of art - that is the only kinds of it that will be welcomed by those who chose to imitate their existence. Thus it may simply be about offering a product that is in demand and will be ""bought"" - consider a basket of awards won by this movie, while similarly impeccable in purely cinematic terms but also honest in terms of their messages Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" or Von Trier's ""Dogville"", for instance, were either completely misunderstood or pretty much disregarded.So what we are dealing with here is hardly a mercilessly honest investigation into the nature of violence, origins of totalitarianism or anything of the sort. Frankly, to a much greater degree it looks like a manipulative and cowardly exercise in political correctness, undertaken in the area of ideas, the apotheosis of our Western hypocrisy of today - albeit very skilfully disguised by the undoubtedly highly proficient director as something more dignified. While what we really need to do, instead of getting engaged in such exercises, is to say that ""2 + 2"" doesn't equal ""it's very complicated and depends on many things"" nor ""whatever suits you today"". It equals ""4"". It makes sense to say this today - if we still want to have this option tomorrow.",,Anonymous,History
Best In Show,"The White Ribbon was dark, mysterious, labyrinthine, a real puzzle. Doesn't sound a barrel of laughs does it?Nor was it. But it was a wonderful film. How can this be? My only suggestion is the remarkable balance brought to the screen. An excellent cast deliver a complex story challenging even my enormous brain to fathom out out exactly what's going on. But time and time again I ""lost the plot"" because I was transfixed by a fabulous shot of – a wall. Or – a field. Or – a road. Seriously.

"A beautiful, long, troubling, and dry experience, Germany a generation before the Nazis","The White Ribbon (2009)A brave, intense, complex, nuanced movie. It's got an edge of Ingmar Bergman to the quiet, rural, psychological edge to it, but it's also a big movie with lots of characters and a social theme fitting, somehow for German culture, or so it seems from here, New York.There are issues here that are daring for any movie--child molesting, patriarchy run wild--but it is put so thoroughly in the context of the 19th Century these themes are weirdly shocking. That proves if nothing else the persuasiveness of the movie and its mise-en-scene.Another brave aspect to the whole enterprise is the filming, in tack sharp black and white. This isn't the shadowy, silky, dramatic black and white of classic Hollywood of the 1940s, or of film noir, but a more precise and technically clean monochrome. Shadows are dark but with great detail. Highlights sparkle without washing out. It's a thrill to watch, and it gives every scene a documentary clarity and beauty that's bracing. And in keeping with the film's contents.There no question at all that many people will find this slow, obtuse, overly detailed, and even banal between all the short sensational moments. And the narrator might be wearing more than the voice of a reminiscing old man. But if it does click for you (and you'll know in ten minutes, for the pace and flavor does not change, beginning to end), you'll find a very delicate, razor sharp sensibility that is fresh, and refreshing. I can't say I loved the movie as a narrative experience--as a story, as a long two hours of immersion. But I did love aspects of it without reserve. This alone makes it worth watching at least part of. That's kind of a condemning suggesting, to watch half of a movie, but once you start you'll see what I mean.And it isn't giving anything away to say that the movie doesn't resolve everything by the end. All the loose ends remain loose ends, which is wonderfully disarming as much as it is unsatisfying, both good feelings, and rare ones. The acting is intensely serious, the sets and costumes have authority, and the tenor can't be anything but legitimate for the times, just before WWI.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An important film with exquisite photography and lots of food for thought.,"In this exquisitely photographed black-and-white film we meet the inhabitants of Eichwald, a small rural North German community, shortly before the outbreak of the Great War, as seen through the eyes of an 'outsider' young schoolteacher (Christian Friedel), and documentary-style narrated by Ernst Jacobi. The baron (Ulrich Tukur) is a powerful man; many of the local inhabitants work on his estate as tenant labourers. Many of the people have large families with many children.We quickly pick up that resentment is simmering among some of the kids. They are often treated badly by the overly strict adults. In particular, it is the children of the Protestant pastor (Burghart Klaussner) who get harshly treated, even physically and psychologically abused by their strict, sanctimonious father. It is the pastor who ties white ribbons to his children to remind them daily that they have to lead pure lives. It is a bitter irony that few of the adults would practise what they preach...The apparent bucolic tranquility is shattered when the doctor's horse runs into a trip wire and the doctor sustains injuries to land him in hospital. Shortly thereafter the young son of the baron gets abducted and beaten by unknown assailants. And then there is the case of arson on the baron's estate. Before long a mood of suspicion and paranoia pervades the community.One of the strong points of the film is that the focus is not on solving the mystery of who was responsible for the attacks against the 'establishment', but rather to let the drama subtly - and ambiguously - unfold, leaving us with important questions about the roles of religion, the social order and authoritarianism, and the nature of evil.I have to re-emphasize the truly splendid monochrome cinematography; particularly some of the indoor shots and snowy landscapes look as if they should be exhibited as works of art in a museum. The soundtrack is wonderful too; it effectively complements the austerity of the more sombre scenes, yet also the ebullience when enjoying the 'end of harvest' festival.The acting of the professional and non-professional cast is remarkable. It is particularly the young cast that stands out with their truly natural performances. Young actors that should be mentioned are Martin (Leonard Proxauf), Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and Gustav (Thibalt Sérié). Credit to the casting directors; apparently they have interviewed more than 7000 kids for these roles.Serious movie-lovers will enjoy the 'The White Ribbon'; it is highly recommended.

Out of time,"In Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon', a serious of dark, mysterious events overtake a German village in the year immediately before world war one. Haneke's portrait of life in this era is mesmerising but more poetic than realistic: the tyranny of aristocracy, the climate of sexual repression and the mask of everyday quietness and civility seem deliberately overdone, albeit in an understated way; the film's schoolteacher hero seems almost absurdly unauthoratitive, and it's hard to imagine such a person surviving in a real school in any age. Yet the film, shot in black and white, has a certain power, and remains watchable in spite of its length. The odd thing is that I'm still not at all certain what Haneke's purpose was in making it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
... and the award for most overrated movie of 2009 goes to ...,"... The White Ribbon ! The older I get, the more I continue being surprised with the amount of head nodding style online wannabe movie critics. It is enough for one guy to post a link to Roger Ebert's review (a famous critic who rated it excellent) to start an avalanche of praising, lots of which contains questions like ""hey, but what's is this movie about?"" in the same sentence. How can movie be great to you if you don't understand it ?To cut a long story short, I guess movie idea was mostly to show us what circumstances were in pre-WWI Germany, and how deranged family values led to evil youth generations which led humanity to the two world wars. I strongly disagree with this point of view and that's the main (but not the only) reason I rate it so bad. Families with strict parents existed, still exists and will continue to exist all over the world, not only in Germany. The reason we don't have so many wars nowadays is mostly thanks to the media like TV and internet, who entertains, brainwashes, and opens minds even of lazy people who doesn't read books.I expected good crime/mystery thriller, but all I've got is dumb incoherent story I don't buy at all, and without an end.",2.0,Anonymous,History
The White Ribbon: 8/10,"Obviously it is not an effortless film to enjoy, Haneke's HIDDEN (2005) is one of my favorite films of all time, in spite of that I admire his works, most of his films' frosty characterizations, restrained accusations are rather uneasy to follow and swallow. So is the case of THE WHITE RIBBON (his Golden Palm winning film in 2009 Cannes), in a completely black-white mode, the film no doubt stands firmly among the best of his magnificent opus.I found it extremely unsatisfying when the end-credits rolled over, there are tons of questions remain unsolved after 160 minutes while over 30 characters were introduced in the film, for sure Haneke doesn't want to give us any definite explanations of the crimes happened, the whole film demonstrates a ubiquitous mental abuse among the German village at the time before WWI (especially towards children), which caused abnormality in their thoughts, the power of poisoned minds was so overwhelmingly dominant so that it would ignite the naissance of Nazi among the next generation while a detectable overthrow of religious paternity was under the way.For me the ace of the film is the camera work by Christian Berger, darkness saturates in every corner of the village, leaves creepiness and shadows on almost every character. The pace is slow but not tedious, several fixed long takes are gripping. There are some excellent performance by Burghart Klaussner (the pastor) and Susanne Lothar (the midwife). Still, it is purely difficult to love this film other than admire it from some distance.Maybe the hidden truth is not important, as every audience has his own version of comprehension, nonetheless, with such a thorough reticence, I think Haneke does underestimate the needs of his audience this time, connotation can be obscure, meanwhile, the film itself hides too many clues, which is able to catch a title as an individual auteur, but for the reverent Haneke, there is indeed no need to take great pains to do so both for him and his devoted groupies.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Haneke's most balanced allegory,"What is it about this film that is so good? It's not easy to place my finger on it. But what I can say is that while watching it, I feel like I'm watching a flawless film. I'm not sure if there's many other films I've seen like that, perhaps a few by Stanley Kubrick or some of the old masters. And, this is the company that Haneke is now in.After all, he's now one of the rare winners of two best film awards at Cannes. I thought Haneke was brilliant in many of his other films, but I always found something questionable in them. Not so with White Ribbon. It has some of the trademarks of his other films, but this time they're rare and when placed between the rest, they stand out.In the other extreme Haneke also made Amour, a film that's even more different from his others, besides perhaps the end. Anyway, we're talking about White Ribbon so I will stick to that here.With all the problems with the youth in this film, the movie wins with the budding relationship that we are introduced to. It just offers something wonderful between the usual combination of weird sexual behaviour, murder and sin lurking beneath the surface. Yet, what for?I know why Haneke's made this film but being in Germany, I don't have to spell it out. Haneke didn't find the need to and it's best left unsaid as an allegory.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The narrator,"The idea here is to have one layer outside the film that is (conventionally) recorded , solid history, and use the actual film to examine mechanisms of the actual bleeding reality that gives rise to it. That history could be anything, since it is little more than a commonly agreed way to tell a story, Haneke simply chose something that hits close to home and almost always lends itself to sympathetic ears. And here we have a (fictional) story that is recalled by one of the participants, and in a way that is obvious it's only the commonly agreed version of what happened, if that.By now, it is all but common knowledge: we see the generation that would grow up to be the Germany that in its moment of despair flocked to Hitler and the Nazi party, as well as witness some of the childhood trauma that perhaps explains it, explains how a society could acquiesce to Nuremberg and Krystallnacht, some less reluctantly than others, would come to crave the grandiose vision, and went on to scatter the bodies of its youth across three continents and two oceans.On a broader level, there is a small , elusive aperture in the machinery of the universe that evil flows from, and depending on your predisposition, you will come out of the film with a few things about the nature of that evil.You may note ancient sin that mysteriously stole into the world and poisons its way through the generations, sustaining and replicating itself like a virus.You may note what in the Eastern world is known as karma, which is not a metaphysical proposition but a simple truth: every force in nature promulgates its reaction, and it is no different with mental pain you inflict (and had inflicted on you by your father's father).You may note that karmic cycle of sin as nothing other than ego and desire, that aspect of self that thinks the world including its own offspring should conform to its image, and spends a lifetime tinkering with that self-image - ambition, pride, vanity, hate, all means to control life that is ever-changing and flows.All of it true, but I like to settle for something else, which I believe explains deeper. The story is framed as memoir of an unreliable narrator, a schoolteacher.And this is the thing; we simply cannot trust the reason of recall that would allow us to see the narrative in its entirety, to fully and deeply experience, in a single moment, the truth of what has happened to us in a way that liberates from the need to repeat (and inflict anew) the thought that is memory that is inner pain that has to take form in the world as a hayloft barn ablaze. And no doubt, that was not the last Holocaust the world is going to see.It's a less exciting Cache, overall. The same set of gear, a set of images that form a world that we contrive to happen in order to have something to inhabit. But, this one has to labor at the same time under its own stark past and the need to exorcise it, much as Bergman did. One layer is simply outside the film, history, and that layer is its own multifaceted narrative prone to much analysis to be a powerful anchor.Ways to improve that? How about some of the kids are aspiring athletes, and we can see in the ferocity and dogged determination of their training all that is to come including the sculpted heroes of Riefenstahl's films.

The Best Horror Film of 2009,"Michael Haneke's super creepy and unsettling film about a small German village in the days leading up to World War I is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.Things are deeply wrong in this particular village, though they're wrong in ways that are hard to define and which no one will admit. We're introduced to a hard-core patriarchal culture in which men dominate women and children in whatever ways they choose and in which violence and brutality are so seamlessly woven into the fabric of the society they're not even worth commenting on. But the children are watching and learning, and when random, strange and cruel incidents start occurring, it's the children who are most suspect.I don't think Haneke's point is that child abuse led to the rise of Nazism. Of course it's significant that this film is set when it is, and yes, the children in it would be the right age to become the Nazis of the future. But I think Haneke was interested in broader themes and means for his film to be an investigation of how the atrocities of a people at one isolated point in time are the product of a complicated and dysfunctional past. In this particular case, the result of an unhealthy German culture led to the development of Fascism and Nazism. But apply the same scrutiny to other cultures at other points in history (yes, even to the America of today) and watch the skeletons come tumbling out of the closet.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Village of the Damned, German style","There should be a rule of drama that says, the more intense the buildup, the more the need for resolution. Sometimes loose ends work. But when the entire story is a loose end, I think it's taking art too far. If a story is going to be unremittingly morose, then it accrues a debt to the audience that should be paid off.A wise man once was asked what is the lesson of the Holocaust. He replied that there is no lesson. Sometimes there is atonement, sometimes not. Is this what Haneke s trying to say? I think that unloading a big downer on the audience obliges the auteur to explain himself.Compare this one to another German film, The Lives of Others. Both deal with the dark side of human nature (German culture seems preoccupied with the dark side), both leave evils unatoned, but Lives of Others leaves a beautiful grace-note. As beautifully shot, acted and edited as it is -- for which it earns my 7 -- White Ribbon leaves only a cosmic funk to wallow in.

Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte,"""The White Ribbon"" is set in the northern German village of Eichwald during 1913 and 1914, the months immediately before the outbreak of the First World War. Eichwald is a picturesque village of half-timbered houses, not too different from many similar English villages, and many of the characters would have had their English equivalents- the squire, the parson, the country doctor and the village schoolmaster. And yet it is difficult to imagine a film of this nature being made in Britain, or for that matter in France, and certainly not in America.A British film about country life during the 1910s would almost certainly be made in the ""heritage cinema"" style, with rich colour photography and great attention to period detail. It would probably be nostalgic in tone, with pre-war society painted as a relatively stable, prosperous and happy one; any reference to the coming war would be to an impending catastrophe, threatening to sweep away all that that society holds dear. This is emphatically not a film of that type.""The White Ribbon"" is not shot in colour but in a harsh, cold black-and- white, which seems designed to distance it from any nostalgic feelings; the society depicted here is not one likely to inspire nostalgia in anyone except the most hardened masochist. The story tells of a series of dark and unexplained events which plague the villagers. The doctor is injured in a fall from his horse, which appears to have been caused deliberately. A peasant-farmer's wife dies in an accident at work at a sawmill. The local Baron's young son is kidnapped and badly beaten and a barn on the estate burns down.Numerous villagers, especially those in some position of authority, appear to be hiding some sort of guilty secret. The Baron's wife is having an affair with another man. The widowed doctor is popular with his patients, but is having an affair with the local midwife and is sexually molesting his own teenage daughter. The village pastor is a severe and joyless puritan, who mercilessly beats his own children for minor transgressions- he is particularly obsessed with masturbation- and forces them to wear white ribbons as a symbol of their lost innocence and purity. The Baron's bailiff also thrashes his son. The one authority figure who appears to be a genuine man of decency and integrity is the young schoolteacher who acts as the film's narrator.The film bears the subtitle ""Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte"", ""a German Children's Story"". The word ""Kindergeschichte"" normally means a story written for children, but here it rather means a story about children, and it is very much the children and young people who are at the centre of the story. No solution is provided to the mystery of the various crimes which have afflicted the village, but there is a suggestion that at least some of them may have been committed by these young people, possibly in revenge for their mistreatment by the adult world or because they have learned this sort of callous behaviour from their elders and supposed betters.There has been a lot of discussion of the supposed political significance of the film, discussion which, I suppose, is inevitable in the context of any German film about early twentieth-century history, especially when it deals with that generation, born around 1900, who would have been young adults during the rise to power of the Nazis. One critic attacked the simplistic notion of trying to locate the seeds of fascism in religious hypocrisy and authoritarianism, but the director Michael Haneke never makes this explicit parallel, although some have seen the name ""Eichwald"" (""Oakwood"") as a portmanteau of ""Eichmann"" (""Oakman"") and ""Buchenwald"" (""Beechwood""). It may also be significant that three of the boys are named Adolf, Rudolf and Martin, as in Hitler and his deputies Hess and Bormann.There is no attempt to make the case, beloved of British historians of the Colonel Blimp school, that the Second Reich was merely a dress- rehearsal for the Third. There is no evidence of anti-Semitism or hatred of outsiders, no charismatic leader who could be considered a proto- Fuehrer. (All the authority figures in the village are singularly devoid of charisma). Certainly, the social attitudes on display here seem to us harsh and authoritarian, but such attitudes were by no means unique to Germany. ""Spare the rod and spoil the child"", for example, was once a popular proverb in Britain, and paternalistic landowners like the Baron could have been found in virtually any European country, including those where no significant Fascist movement ever developed. America was perhaps more egalitarian than Europe, but no less puritanical- in some respects, indeed, possibly more so. Indeed, one could interpret the film as making the opposite case, namely that Nazism represented a reaction against the values of Wilhelmine Germany rather than a continuation of them and that elements among the German people, tiring of a joyless emphasis on discipline, self-control and self-denial, eagerly embraced a world-view which allowed them to give full vent to man's baser instincts in their vilest form.Perhaps the best way of approaching would be to view it not as an explicit political allegory but as a wider human allegory about the dark, irrational forces which can lurk even in seemingly tranquil village. There can be no doubt that the atmosphere of the film is one of gloom and foreboding; the village seems a sombre, forbidding place even on bright summer days. It is down to the individual viewer whether he or she interprets this mood as a portent of approaching war and dictatorship, or simply as a sense of pessimism about man's capacity for inhumanity. ""The White Ribbon"" is not, unlike say ""Downfall"" or ""The Wave"", a film explicitly about Fascism or dictatorship, but all three films are evidence of the 21st-century German cinema's ability to produce original and troubling ways of responding to 20th-century German history. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Some comparisons,"These are some thoughts that come to my mind:Mode of narration is similar to ""Dogville"" by Lars Von Trier. The setting and story - repressive feudal early 20th century society is remotely similar.The ""alternative Heimatfilm"" genre (a Heimatfilm is a usually sentimental film with a regional background, although this film is certainly not sentimental) - is similar to Edgar Reitz' Heimat TV Series from the 1980s (Pre-World-War 2 stories in rural village near french border)The menacing atmosphere combined with visual beauty, created by the camera-work, reminded me of Ingmar Bergman/Sven Nykvist movies from the 1950s.The ending is open, and the message of the story is incomprehensible after all.This is unfortunately, also a hallmark of *any* bad movie that starts with high artistic ambitions but falls short of them.There is a hard-to-grasp touch of nihilism and moralism. This might be typical for Haneke. Both of these traits may be disliked by many viewers (or reviewers)All in all, this film is a piece of art that should be very sale-able on the International Film Market, and I guess making a profit was also one of the main objectives in making this movie. Nothing wrong with that.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Who's the Culprit, Who's the Victim?","Another winner from proficient writer-director Haneke.While the linking of parental oppression and abuse with national (in this case German) characteristics, that seemingly led to the horrors of WWI and later to Nazism, seems a trifle too easy a solution, this otherwise superb study of human cruelty comes up trumps.No other contemporary director is able to create such a compelling atmosphere of subtle discomfort and hidden menace while imbuing every scene with a sense of dread and foreboding. The black-and-white photography is just as marvellous as the impeccable cast (with some of the children particularly outstanding.) And the story-line is perfectly balanced, with Haneke's familiar refusal for clear explanations fully intact.Those who call Haneke's work emptily nihilistic should take a look at the world around them: It's much worse. And through the pair of young lovers and a bird-loving boy he shows us what's also possible: kindness and sympathy, features most of this pic's characters surely cannot cope with.9 out of 10 white ribbons",9.0,Anonymous,History
A cold kettle of fish,"This austere, ravishingly beautiful film by Michael Haneke ostensibly concerns itself with the German mystique that led to their involvement in two World Wars. It may well be that, but what Haneke accomplishes is nothing less than exploring the nature of evil itself that emerges from cruelty, forced servitude (in many forms), empty dogma and the corruption of innocence (that white ribbon that symbolizes innocence in the title of the film and is physically manifest as a real ribbon worn on the arms of children who would—in 20 years--replace those ribbons with swastika's).Universal in its scope it may well attain ""masterpiece"" status even as we watch. While the performances in this film are impeccable, it's the filmmaker's realization of what he's putting before us with such confidence and beauty that overwhelms. I won't pretend this is a movie for everyone since the subject matter alone will alienate many and the resolution leaves all that we've seen open. But isn't that true in life? The most horrible crimes are never completely understood even with intense study. How much has been written about the Holocaust and we still grapple with it even being possible. Haneke lays before us the origin of such evil, but we still find it hard to understand those who act it out.This is one of the few films that the subtitles spoil compositions on the screen. I hope the DVD edition places the titles off the frame. Great technical devices draw us into a world that is only half seen. The camera will fix on a physical composition and the action will take place off screen or half-hidden by some architectural feature, for instance a brutal corporal punishment occurs after we watch a child fetch the cane and disappear behind a closed dooronly the sounds of lashing and cries of pain are what we hear. Over and over, this technique is employed and rather than frustrating us from actually witnessing the horror of very cruel acts, we only imagine them and it unsettles us more.Walking out of the theater most of the audience was silent, but I heard one fellow whistle and exclaim, ""Boy, that's a tough one!"" Yes, tough and beautifully made and hard to shake off. But undeniably a rare achievement in the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History
hard cold mood,It's pre-WWI in a small German village. An unnamed man recalls strange incidents when he was the village school teacher. Someone had strung a near-invisible wire between two trees. The doctor is hospitalized after his horse trips on the wire in his regular ride. Then a tenant farmer woman falls to her death in an industrial accident. The village is a strict harsh place. The puritanical pastor punishes his children with a cane and ties white ribbons on his children as a reminder of their need to keep their purity. The strange incidents continue. The movie ends with the start of the first World War.I would have liked the movie follows one single lead as he/she experiences and investigates these strange incidences. The black and white photography is beautiful. The cold everyday violence is interesting. The movie portrays a very effective hard oppressive mood. However it is a lot of mood but very little drive. Sure this is not the regular North American movie but I just want to follow the police investigating these incidences. It feels somehow distant to follow the various villagers and the narration.,7.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful and Unsettling,"The White Ribbon is powerful and unsettling. Haneke's dispassionate look at a village and its unspoken problems only serves to heighten the audience's reaction to the systematic wrongs that are occurring. A sense of fear dominates every aspect of the film, and this is reflected in the general sense of apathy exhibited by all of the characters. The black and white cinematography gives the film a very distinct look, fitting for the film's pre-WWI setting while also adding to the uneasiness of the village's lifelessness. Overall, it is not always all that enjoyable; this is not due to a lack in craftsmanship but instead it is a by-product of the film's themes. That said, it is an important film that demands watching, even though it is not always easy to do so.Full Review at MacGuffinFilmReviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,History

"A great movie, but for who?","When I say that ""The White Ribbon"" is a great movie, I mean, only, that it's a movie made by a great director. And when I refer to Michael Haneke as a great director, all I'm really saying is, the man knows what he's doing. He's no hack.My problem – or, I should say, my issue – is with exactly that: what he's doing. If I seem ambivalent or undecided about this review, it's only because that's how I felt about the movie. It's a mystery/drama about a town on the Austrian countryside right before WWI. It has the appearance of a regular, idyllic town, but, some really bad things start happening. People start getting hurt, when no one else is around. It's clearly more than one person perpetrating these crimes, which start to resemble ritual punishment.So it's a mystery. But since this is a Haneke film, we know the ""mystery"" is unimportant. It's about what the mystery reveals about the town. This is the same storytelling technique he used for ""Cache,"" a movie that a lot of people spend a lot of time trying to figure out. I can't imagine why – the movie, like this one, offers no concrete solutions, only ambiguity, and since any definitive conclusions (about the plot) would draw too much from the viewers' imagination, and not enough from the film itself, such conclusions are rendered completely irrelevant to the film. It's sort of like the Philip Seymour Hoffman/Meryl Streep movie ""Doubt.""Now, thematic conclusions – those are abounding. And since Haneke pushes the plot so far to the side they can come off a little heavy-handed. This is my primary issue (problem?) with the craft of ""The White Ribbon."" Whereas ""Cache"" focused mainly on two wonderful performances (from Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) that lent the film a certain precision, ""The White Ribbon"" is about an entire town's worth of characters. Each is allotted less time, and therefore, fewer dimensions – and therefore, less precision, and morepredetermination. They come off as numbers in a thematic equation Haneke is calculating, or trying to.The ""trying to"" is the part I'm back and forth on. I haven't mentioned how starkly beautiful the film is, thanks to the black and white cinematography and compositions of Christian Berger. It'll remind you of Bergmans like ""Through a Glass Darkly,"" ""Winter Light"" or ""Hour of the Wolf."" The film is so visually arresting, if it was Silent, I might call it a triumph. Even so, there are ways Berger (or Haneke) use their camera that disturb me, and not, I don't think, in the way they mean to.I'm sort of dancing around – I know. Let me talk about one thing that really struck me about Haneke's film: the way he depicts his ""good"" characters. There are a few of them. The story is narrated by the town's resident teacher, much older, trying to make sense of the events that shaped his personal history. The younger version is played by Christian Friedel, and he's seen as ugly, weak and completely ineffectual. It's not quite his fault (it's society's!), but there is some intended frustration caused us by the character's complete inability to alter the course of his life or his town's. Another character, a farmer, is perhaps the only one in the film with a rigid code of honor he apparently lives his life by. He's got a lazy eye. There's an extended close up on his face where the focal point is the bridge of his nose, and his left eye points to the left and his right eye points to the right and he comes off as practically inhuman. Is Haneke saying to live righteously in an authoritarian society you must be a freak, or abnormal? I don't know – all I know is, if I was the actor with the lazy eye, I might be insulted.To call the film misanthropic would be overstating the point, I guess. It's about bad people. I haven't said much about what the movie's actually trying to say, because, after saying it, it seems almost pointless. ""Religious suppression and societal demand for perfection are the seeds of fascism."" There it is, more or less (read Ebert's review if you want a really meaningful dissection of the film's themes). It's the kind of thing you can sort of nod your head to, I mean; it makes enough sense within the confines of the movie. Is it an important statement on German/Austrian history or the beginnings of Nazism? I don't know enough about the history to really say.No one loves a movie, or returns to it, for what it's saying. ""Avatar"" didn't gross two billion worldwide because of its metaphorical criticism of outsourced American capitalism (well, maybe in some places). It's because of the way it looked, and ""The White Ribbon"" will be embraced by cineastes for the same reason, I think. It's well-made. Like I said earlier, it looks beautiful. Is it a great movie? It looks like one.SoI don't know. 7/10. I don't regret seeing it. It held my interest for the most part, if not rewarding it completely. How could it have, you ask me? I don't know. It's the right movie; it's the movie Haneke was trying to make. But I don't think I'd watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An accurate depiction of small village life in Pre WWI Austro-Hungarian Empire.,"I attended a screening of this marvelous film last night here in NYC and was mesmerized by its beauty and historical accuracy. This film has nothing to do with Nazis WHAT-SO-EVER! And to make any correlation to Nazi character or movement is insulting to the filmmaker and the film. I cringed in disbelief last night when the Q & A moderator asked such an idiotic question as this, lowering this film to the lowest common denominator = Nazis. Obviously some people have baggage they need to leave at the door before seeing this masterpiece. The film hit home for me personally because my maternal great grand-mother grew up in a small village like this one in Croatia near the Hungarian border. That village also had a land Baron that employed nearly half the residences as was depicted in the film. My great grandmother's brother was the town black-smith. The film's Baron was a carbon copy of what I know of my great grandmother's Baron. He was kind and concerned about the villagers by loaning money when needed and making sure the village had its social necessities. The film's story kept me riveted but the edgy character of many of the villagers was a personality trait that I recognized in many of my older Croatian relatives. If you enjoy period pieces that are like looking thru a time machine, this film is for you. I highly recommend this film. My own family history ends when my great grandfather was shot and killed by a sniper on the Italian front 2 days before the WWI ended. too bad...",9.0,Anonymous,History
Haneke: films for middle-class masochists,"Austrian film director Michael Haneke's latest, The White Ribbon: A German Children's Story, has already won the Palme d'Or. The chances are it'll pick up Best Foreign Film at next month's Oscars, too. Critics have heaped praise upon it, and art-house audiences have flocked to see it. You see, there's just something about Haneke's work that culture vultures can't stick their beaks into quick enough.Which, in its way, is puzzling. Not because Haneke is not a talented filmmaker. Far from it, in fact. From their stately structures to the languorous, deliberately disconcerting extended takes, his films are always painstakingly crafted. No detail is accidental, no thing unthought. No, what's puzzling about Haneke's popularity amongst those who take their films nearly as seriously as they take themselves is that his films are so desolating. Almost every review of Haneke's work gushes with the same adjectives: disturbing, disquieting, discomfiting. Haneke's films don't please, they unsettle. They are the artistic equivalent of middle-class masochism.Funny Games, for instance, was the heartwarming tale of a nice bourgeois family tortured to death by a couple of boys in tennis kit. The Piano Teacher was the groin-girding story of a nice bourgeois society driving a libidinous pianist to torture her genitals. Hidden was an endearing portrait of a nice bourgeois couple tortured to distraction by post- colonial guilt, and unfathomable surveillance. But it's not just the content that is so dismal. Formally, too, his films resist pleasure. Almost without fail they refuse to resolve themselves into anything resembling a conclusion. This is hardly surprising: agency in his work, whether that of psychotic kids or camcorder-wielding stalkers, is without reason. Bad things happen, that's all we on Earth can know.The White Ribbon: A German Children's Story is no exception to Haneke's rule of thumb – build something dispiriting and the plaudits will come. Set in a German village on the eve of the First World War, it centres around several inexplicable acts of cruelty and misadventure that perplex the small community. The local doctor is sent tumbling from his horse by a trip wire; a female labourer has a fatal accident at the saw mill; the son of the village baron is found hanging upside down in a barn, his backside bleeding following a severe beating. Misfortune and malice continue to afflict the locals. And they, along with us, have no real idea, but plenty of suspicions, as to who is causing this.The chief suspects are ostensibly the village children, a ghostly bunch that congregate near the houses of victims. Whether this is out of concern or cruelty we are never sure. But Haneke has a deeper motive than creating some Turn of the Screw-style ambiguity around pallid kids, or even a whodunit, with no who and little dunit. His concern, rather, seems to be with a society that breeds cruelty.Consequently, the village here functions as Haneke's view of society as a whole. It's a study in psychopathology, a portrait of a community in which cruelty is mundane and evil banal. Haneke seems to want us to see this village as an incubator for some coming monstrosity. Little wonder that every relationship is packed full of latent violence, each interactions pregnant with menace. And given the film's pre-First World War German setting, we can be in little doubt that Haneke intends us to see where and when the seeds of fascism were sown.The problem with all this is that it is so thoroughly hackneyed. The principle unit of socialisation here – the family – is portrayed as little more than a Freudian caricature, which, given that Haneke studied psychology in Vienna, is perhaps apt. Still, that doesn't make it any more edifying an insight. From the doctor 'fingering' his 14-year-old daughter to the pastor tying his son's arms to the bed to stop him from masturbating, abuse and repression is the familial norm here. And so it must be if Haneke is to reduce the brutal extremes of Nazism to a psychological sickness generated in the bosom of the family.Perverting the great psychoanalyst himself, one child, Erna, asks her teacher 'if you dream of something, really dream of something, can it come true?'. Her dream? The torture and near blinding of the local disabled kid. The suggestion is clear. The routine repression, often cruel, always damaging, is creating psychotic dreamwork, and dreams here, as the eventual torture and near blinding of the local disabled kid show, do become real.To Haneke, this is just how it is – 'the truth is obscene', he said in a recent interview. All he's doing is making us see. And what a vision it is. In Haneke's films, human society is sunken, rank, a place where mass culture is dumb, where people, turned on and tuned off by TV, are cruel and complacent, and where families will, for time immemorial, f*** you up. Socialisation here is virtually synonymous with corruption.Why is this vision so popular? What is it about this crass, aloof moralising that is so attractive? The answer lies in the question. In Haneke, every countercultural prejudice, from the perils of consumerism and mainstream entertainment to the denunciation of the family, is given a sophisticated artistic form. Never has liberal snobbery looked so clever.",8.0,Anonymous,History
punishment and guilt as sources of evil,"The full title in German of the film is 'Das weisse Band – Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte' – 'The White Ribbon – A German Children Story' which could translate as 'story for children' or 'story about children'. A story for children it certainly is not – Michael Haneke is the author of some of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, and if there is some sense in age rating of movies, I would avoid showing his films to children under a certain age to protect them emotionally. It is a story about children, and the film can certainly be categorized in the genre of these horror stories where the Devil seems to be incarnated by innocence, and for sure a good one in the genre. Haneke knows how to create and maintain tension, how to film the real while suggesting the missing, how to pass the anxiety beyond the polish of civility. But the film tries to be much more.We are actually warned from start what the film is about. The story happens in the year prior to the first world war, in a rural area of Germany, where the social and moral system in place for centuries seems to have little chances to change. Peasants work the Baron's fields and gardens, the priest and the Church defend the existing order and the morals, teacher and priests are not more than associates of the existing order. And yet strange things start to happen, some get obvious explanations in the human conflicts, other remain unsolved – accidents, deaths, violent deeds. As the story is told by the teacher of the village many years after the events we know exactly the location in time of the events, and we know that the storms of history will blow up the whole system and apparent tranquility of life soon. However, before war starts the life fabric seems to deteriorate from inside, the whole society and its institutions – church, medical practice, family fife – are deeply sick.The thesis of Michael Haneke is not far from the one of the American author Norman Mailer in his book 'The Castle in the Forest'. As Mailer goes back into the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler trying to discover the roots of evil in his family life and sins of his ancestors, Haneke takes a more general approach and tries to discover the roots of Nazism in the internal conflicts, the puritanism, the unspoken dark secrets of the family life of a constrained society. Obsession with order and discipline, education by punishment and guilt, tight guarding of the appearances of morality without deeds being true to principles do not necessarily lead to the order and quietness that is aimed, but long term can generate quite in the contrary. In a society where speaking the truth and revealing the evil at small scale are less important than keeping appearances of social order the freedom is in danger and evil can develop at bigger scale.All this is spoken in few words by the off-screen commentary of the village teacher who tells the story, but is not explicit in the cinema language of the film. The impact of the film would not have been that deep without the master cinematographic treatment that Haneke applies to the story. First the black and white image fits perfect the world that is being described, and not only because its a world still lit by gas lamps, but also because the lack of colors reminds the classic German expressionist films that caught in the epoch contemporary or soon after the action of the film takes place the same type of angst. Then the acting is simply amazing. Many of the important characters in the film are kids or teenagers, and Haneke had to do a rigorous selection to select his best actors. he succeeded at utmost, I have seldom seen such a range of kids characters, each of them different, human, true. They seem to belong to their time, and to live through the painful coming of age, which is their growth into maturity in a world which becomes ugly.The tension between the not so innocent childhood they are going through and the adult world that tries to educate them by oppressing their feelings, punishing and inflicting them a permanent state of guilt is well acted and described beyond words.Haneke avoids to make a harsh judgment. The whole fabric of human relations is not dark, we do have a love story between the teacher and nanny and we do have the innocent gesture of a kid trying to give consolation to his father by making him as present the most important thing in his universe, which say that even in the darkest times and circumstances there is still hope that a flame of humanity is kept alive. He does not completely solve the mystery of everything that has happened on screen. As in real life some facts remained unexplained, and judgments, even historical judgments need not be fully radical, and and good that such it is.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A beguiling 'trojan horse' full  of deep unease,"The White Ribbon is the latest from that master of creepy unease, Michael Haneke. But where Funny Games and Hidden were very much set in the urban present, this takes place in a vanished world, an Austrian farming village just before World War One.The village is dominated by three men, the unlovable Baron, the despicable doctor and the convincingly monstrous village minister. They are surrounded by a web of apathy, malice, brutality and envy. As the Baron's wife said! But in the midst of all this innocence blossoms, as the narrator, the young schoolteacher, falls in love with the even younger nanny in the big house.It's been shot in colour and printed in near monochrome, making each shot as worthy of framing as in any film-noir, and it benefits from the richness and subtlety of texture you'll only get with colour.Added to that is the sheer intensity of the story telling, beyond Ingmar Bergman at his least stagey. There are hardly any extras; half of the characters get to be fully dimensional, and there is never any sense of acting. In this sternly protestant village they are all trying to keep their emotions buried but we, the fly on the wall, get to see the subtle signals in their faces.The village is galvanised by a series of mysterious accidents and crimes, and these dramatic incidents link the whole thing together, but it's the fascination the camera has in these people that will hold your attention. It loves them all, the utterly vile as much as the sweet and tender. The White Ribbon is bookended by the longest fade-in and fade-out ever, and it felt just right at the end as we had been buried so deep in this other world.",,Anonymous,History
"Sorry, didn't get it!... This time...","Film critic Mark Kermode describes this as ""A subtitled black and white film about precision anxiety."" Personally, I'm still undecided about it. Maybe I haven't watched enough films yet, but I feel there's something I'm missing here. This film has had a lot of praise, even winning the Palm D'Or at Cannes, but I'm struggling to see why. I'm sure there's someone out there who can explain it to me. But I digress, here's a brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please guard the Baron's cabbage patch while I write the next paragraph).It is Germany in 1913, just before the outbreak of World War I. The setting is a small village in northern Germany, a place where the rather straight-laced residents are about to suffer several unfortunate and mystifying events. First off an accident which results in a serious injury to the village doctor has everyone baffled. Then the son of the Baron, who owns much of the land around the village, is kidnapped and beaten by persons unknown. And there are several other events that occur throughout the film, some of which are explained, but others that remain a mystery. I really cant add much more, there are relationship issues involving the doctor and a bit of a burgeoning love story between the teacher (and narrator), and the nanny employed by the Baroness, Eva, but I guess that's all I can say about the plot without giving too much away.Whilst watching the film I have the impression that the children maybe know something about the trouble in the village, but none of them are letting on. I guess it's deliberately left open to interpretation. Decent performances from all of the cast, in particular; Christian Friedel as The School Teacher, Leonie Benesch as Eva, Burghart Klaußner was particularly good as The Pastor and Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara.I feel a bit bad that I cannot give a higher score, I did want to like this film but it just didn't do anything for me. There are many out there, I'm sure, who totally get this one and I bow to your superior film knowledge. Maybe I will re-visit this one in years to come and see the critically acclaimed film I am supposed to. For now, only recommended for those who get it But I guess you won't know that until you've seen it.My score: 6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

"This film prompted me to view and truly appreciate the mastery of filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer and his ""Ordet"" 1955","Austrian writer-director Michael Haneke's films are always serious & content controversial, with complex emotions, mostly joyless and lacking in warm lovingness, never sentimental. So they are definitely NFE: not for everyone. In ""The White Ribbon"" 2009, delivered in stark black & white, the film is to the point of austere. Hence when a glimmer of love beckons, peering through all the somber, mind-provoking issues paraded in front of our eyes - like the rare occasional smiles between the two demurely cautious young lovers of the village schoolteacher (played by Christian Friedel) and Eva, his fiancée-former nanny to the baron household (played by Leonie Benesch), you'd probably try to hold onto that flickering candle light and keep it closely guarded throughout the film as the young man did, so to come out (alive) of whatever consequences the story results in. Though skillful cinematography by Christian Berger of natural landscapes, village scenes contrasting specific interior lighting of the characters and situations, contributed to the flow of the 'filmic' journey.The story is told with a narrator from the perspective of the schoolteacher recalling from his memories. It is true of Haneke's treatment here is likened to a mystery unraveling - but certainly not anything like what you might expect of the genre. He's merely providing 'facts' and pieces of information that could clue us in to what may be going on. Haneke has the polished sophistication of leaving it up to the viewers to contemplate the meaning of what we see on screen as he presents them. Yes, you might say going to a Michael Haneke film is in itself an introspective experience, potently emotional or provocatively intellectual (or both). Content is substantial, with multiple characters from adults to adolescents to children, doctor, baron, pastor, farmer, steward of a village community, and the turn of events keep coming one after another - intriguing more than entertaining. The film is in German with English subtitles, and dialog is not sparing at all (pardon the pun), mercilessly so. The runtime is 2 hours and 24 minutes.You can easily find the synopsis or plot points spelled out through reviews and discussions on the Web, including the official Sony Classics site at ""sonyclassics.com/thewhiteribbon"". Press Kit with Haneke Q&A is available as PDF download. You may relish more by seeing the film without prior extensive exposure to the story. In any case, I felt there are parallels to Dreyer's ""Ordet"" (Danish for ""The Word"") with just as many characters and relationships, sequence of events, community pressures, yet through anger, arguments, anxious anticipations, the radiating realm of faith, belief in God and that miracles could happen provided more positive energy with forgiveness and retentive love emphasized. In ""The White Ribbon"", such 'goodness' human elements seem obviously scarce - the single image of the schoolteacher and Eva riding the carriage together stayed with me, echoing their smiles as a slim hope of coming through, thick and thin.If you like Haneke, this is a must-see. If you want to try a Haneke film, go see it with an open mind and leave any figuring out of plot points after the movie, to discuss or further explore (or neither). ""Ordet"" of Carl Theodor Dreyer's? Yes, that is a must-see, whether you believe in miracles or not.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Village of the People Damned By Protestantism and Bad Sex Touches,"Austrian director Michael Haneke's icily beautiful The White Ribbon is a film very close to the perfection of a certain cinematic type. It lingers, it unfolds slowly and resolutely and unfolds further still when you start to try and unpack it after the fact - the film gets better in retrospect. Set in a small Protestant village in northern Germany in 1913, the film's various narrative threads interweave elegantly, obscurely, dreadfully until eventually, the bottom drops out underneath them all.The film is narrated by a school teacher (Ernst Jacobi as the elder, Christian Friedel as the younger) reflecting on the time he spent as a youth in the village of Eichwald. Picturesque and seemingly idyllic, the village is shaken when the town's doctor is thrown from his horse after riding into a wire strung across his path by dun dun dunnnn... persons unknown. Is it the weird group of extremely polite creepazoid kids? Is it the humiliated midwife? The resentful libertine Baroness? As the schoolteacher attempts to woo a young nanny working for the Baron, a series of strange events unfold, small mysteries playing out: a barn is burnt, the son of the Baron is kidnapped and abused, the Pastor's bird is killed, the handicapped son of the midwife goes missing. The mysteries pile on top of each other, each small and unexplained, dour omens. The schoolteacher is witness and participant, observing without knowing a revelation of the dark, anxious and cruel character of the village. While Haneke and the cinematographer and frequent collaborator Christian Berger do an astounding job of very very slowly ratcheting up the tension in the film, it eventually becomes clear that they're not particularly interested in the MacGuffin details of any of the small, petty cruelties the film documents. Instead, it becomes cruelly clear that the film, as Haneke himself has said, is about the origins of terror, a story about the lashings-out of a town in the repressive grip of the state, the church and above all else a moral code mandating repression, self-control and the keeping-up of appearances. Haneke's film with its worm-holes of petty violence, cruelly and sexual abuse mining their way through a very crisp, fastidiously maintained façade of order and control is his own architecturally constructed, logically designed statement on the specific human flaws that led a generation later to the rise of Nazism.Haneke's film is the rarest of things, a bit of very clever sleight of hand that doesn't leave its audience resentful or surly at having been misled, as the point of the film, its sub-textual ending-place is much much more interesting and a much better bargain than the film seems to be offering for the vast part of its textual bulk. This is something that Haneke does (but not always well - in his English-language film Funny Games he tries a similar trick and in that film it's incredibly irritating) and when it works, like it does in The White Ribbon or in his previous film Caché, we're given works that are the literal antithesis of so much disposable generic fare, one that offers unexpected insights and rewards careful attention, and offer more the deeper into them one digs.Thankfully, Haneke is a skilled enough craftsman that his film doesn't wait until its conclusion to offer up its rewards. It's not a lecture, or a lesson, it's anything but hard to sit through. It's arrestingly beautiful, shot originally in colour and desaturated in post, classically composed and beautifully lit. The performances match the script - minimal, ascetic and austere - and from this very careful control the film spins out slowly a very real, insidious, creeping dread and human anxiety, a Hitchcockian unease and suspense. It's smart without pretense, complex without disappearing into itself, slowly paced without boring. It's masterful, a dark pleasure to watch and even more so to unpack in the hours and days after seeing it, and if it's not the best film of the year, it's very very close. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Did it all lead to Naziism? No.,"A very interesting, atmospheric movie. It sticks in the mind long after you've finished watching it.However, I do taken exception to reviewers who try to connect the culture shown in the film--narrow religiosity, feudal social relations, stiff formality and discipline enforced by harsh punishments in family life--with the rise of Naziism some twenty years later. Most of those features were not at all unique to Germany but were present throughout Europe and North America. Think of the strictness of Dutch religious life, which never produced a Dutch Hitler, or of the sexual repression and cold, formal family life in Victorian Britain. Even in North America, in California, similar conditions were common, as can be seen in Steinbeck's East of Eden. The rise of the Nazis in Germany is well explained by events and conditions following the First World War, without resorting to these vague ""cultural"" principles.So what about the submission to authority, as shown in the villagers' unwillingness to stand up to the Baron? Does this lay the groundwork for later compliance with the Nazis? No, that had nothing specifically to do with Germany. Remember the experiment with high school classes in California, when they were divided into groups, one given dominance over another and pumped up with parades, flags, armbands, uniforms, titles, all the paraphernalia the Nazis used for their mass manipulation. The California kids, for all their tradition of freedom and independent thought, reacted just as enthusiastically and diabolically as many German youth did in the 1930s.No, I think this film is not about history and politics. It's about the forces that can appear anywhere and everywhere--perhaps even forces that are ultimately inescapable--that cause people to behave wickedly.",,Anonymous,History
fear and hope,"Michael Haneke's latest film is a very gloomy picture. This is in itself not remarkable, since his movies are never exactly fun to watch. But in Das weisse Band the outlook appears to be grimmer than ever. According to the director, its story offers an explanation of the horrors that the European continent has witnessed in the course of the twentieth century.The plot revolves around some dramatic, mysterious, even cruel events that upset a seemingly peacefull small town in southern Germany. The year is 1913, the first World War is, as we are informed by the voice over, close at hand.The film opens as the village doctor and his horse trip, at full speed, over a piece of string, tied across the road. The horse dies, the doctor is hospitalized. Is it a children's prank that was taken a bit too far or is it an attempted murder?To Haneke such a fall is almost a metaphor to life. His characters are prone to 'tripping' over unforeseen complications. The villagers however regard such an accident as fate. Everyone but the baroness (who found a lover in Italy) and the schoolteacher (who declined a prosperous future in the sowing-business of his parents) seems to have a genuinely fatalistic outlook on life. At one point in the movie the schoolteacher walks in on one of his students who is playing a very hazardous balancing-game. The boy explains that he gave God the chance to smite him. The doctors' fall is only the first of many disturbing events. Sometimes the cause is obvious, sometimes the cause is lost in the inky black communal conscience. Or do the children know more...?When the children are to inherit the future, then the apocalyptic scenario of two world wars is a fitting inheritance for this generation. Or so it seems in this film. I wonder if Haneke's outlook is not equally fatalistic as his morbid characters'.Still, it's not all fatalism or cynicism in this picture. Quite unexpectedly hope shines through time and again. In a little boy's offering his pet bird to his father, whose parakeet has been slaughtered. In the offering of music to a distraught soul. Even in a father's love for his children in the midst of a violent upbringing.Das weisse Band is a very balanced film. Which is remarkable, since it moves between extremes. It is also a beautiful production. Shot in high contrast black and white, which gives the impression of watching silent- movie-footage. And the characters are acted out with love and depth. It is a film well worth watching, and it will surely give you something to think about for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Staring Contest with Danger,"This monolithic piece is set in rural Germany in the years before World War I. All has been calm and resolute in this village for as long as it can remember. Baron, farmer, pastor, doctor, schoolteacher, tailor, servants, children, all perform their designated functions. It is a male-dominated, dogmatic community, that is, the form of community that was common at that time throughout the world. We are told the narrative by the schoolteacher many years after it happened. In the film, we see him young. The old man wants to recount with impartiality and efficiency. He won't deduce or speculate. He doesn't have the answers. He'll consult only the verifiable truth. The initial one is this: While out riding one morning, the doctor was injured when his horse falls over a trip wire. Someone set up the wire. Could they have been certain the doctor would be their mark? Some malicious power is at work in a small village, initially suspected in a chain of unrelated ""accidents."" This compels the villagers, who all know each other, to watch more cautiously. Is one of them responsible? How can that be? One person couldn't be accountable for all of these off-putting occurrences. Have many been overcome by a depraved contamination? We're conditioned to view such plots as thrillers. A film by Michael Haneke is never that cut-and-dried. It all may have been committed, but what if there appears to be no guilty party? What if misfortunes affect good people who are not as good as they believe they are? Haneke's sense is that we can never be sure.Other occurrences transpire. Each of these acts must've been done by someone, but the same person could not have competently done all of them. There is account of where certain people were on certain occasions. It's like an enticement to play detective and figure out the perpetrator. But the evidence never corresponds. Of what would evidence even consist? It might just be a matter viewed from the perspective of distrust. Life goes on in a conventional manner. The baron stabilizes his people. The doctor continues his work, yet he's shockingly callous toward his mistress. The teacher teaches, and the students study, and they sing in the choir. Church services are observed. The white ribbon is worn by children who have been immoral but will now try to be moral. The crops are gathered. The teacher charms the pretty village girl. And doubt permeates. There is an urge to resolve the enigmas. Arbitrary cruel deeds generate chaos and dismantle the people's faith that life falls into place. The idea that the verifiable truths cannot be made to connect is as disheartening as if the earth opened up under their feet.Haneke makes the mystery more intriguing than its resolution. It's too much of a cinch to suggest the film is about the birth of Nazism. If that were so, there would be many more Nazis even now. It is plausible to say that when the suppression of ""terrorism"" is valued more than the protection of freedom and independence, tyranny strengthens and becomes its own enemy. If we are to stop terror, someone must be leader. The role of course goes to those focused on exacting control. Accordingly, all not under control is evil and must be stopped, and that's how the benefits of the state become higher priorities than the benefits of the people. Maybe the gist is that we become so unnerved by threat or catastrophe that we'll forfeit freedom, even expect to. Do we believe we're safer in a totalistic society? Many do. But things eventually flare up, and the Berlin Wall falls, or we see the Green Revolution in Iran. The catch-22, as some philosophers have observed, is that activists become consumed with driving their cause that it becomes a vicious circle.For what little respect I have for a filmmaker who authentically slaughters an animal in nearly every one of his films, including this one, I have to accept that many admirable filmmakers have also done less than admirable things as people. Kazan named names. Gibson claimed Jews are responsible for all wars. Ford spent a career teaching a pivotal generation what to think of the savagery of Native Americans and the heroic superiority of their oppressors. Herzog authentically killed an assortment of animals in Even Dwarfs Started Small. We just have to judge their work for its own value, not how it reflects their character. Haneke's ingenuity lies in implanting deep ambiguities in films fixed on the day-to-day lives of everyday people. He cold-shoulders the clear-cut resolutions of most films, in which everything is resolved by the roughshod conquest of one side. His films are like twisted fables, professing that bad things sometimes occur merely because they occur. The cosmos ridicules man-made order and does what it will.The film is aesthetically excellent. It returns to the beautiful artistic density of Ingmar Bergman. It's in black and white, naturally. Color would undermine its impact. In terms of cast, the real stars of the film are the children, who are perfectly cast and oppressed by so few lines they evoke so much disheartenment and bewilderment purely in their faces. Purely as it is, The White Ribbon tells an elementary allegory in a village about little people and indicates that we must face the randomness and unavailing complexity of our universe and achieve equilibrium between doubt and refuge.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Riveting storyline,"This movie was very good overall. My favorite foreign film this year.The child actors are excellent as are the adults.The story-line kept me riveted to the screen, eager for the next clue to the mysterious and frightening events going on in this town.The love story between the narrator and the young Nanny in town is also very well done. In fact, many of the characters inspire a strong emotional response, which I myself enjoy in a film.The film leaves you with just enough to put together your idea of what was going on behind the scenes and doesn't spoon-feed the audience.Very much an adult movie, I wouldn't recommended it for young adults or children as they may find it hard to follow the significance of some seemly minor events.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""You must be very unhappy to be so mean""","A very sinister and disturbing work, fittingly shot in black and white, ""The White Ribbon"" quietly and insolubly shows a hand-me-down chain of wickedness and cruelty. Those who are powerful suppress and abuse the weak, who in turn do the same to the weaker.Simplicity of style, and the eerie black and white cinematography, often only showing the bare minimum, compounded to my frustration with the characters.Although incomplete, the story is still presented in a way that in your gut you know, you just know, what happened and who did what.This is an interesting movie exploring not what happened before WW2, but what happened before WW1 to cultivate a generation that was bred on ""malice, envy, apathy and brutality.""",7.0,Anonymous,History
this movie is a pile of cow manure,"I watched this movie because it was the winner of the palm d'or. (which casted serious doubt on my mind the value of such an endorsement) I think it's the same reason why the movie was nominated and won the golden globe and now was nominated (and probably will win) the Oscar. But it didn't change the fact to me that this is the worst movie I've seen in the past year (unwatchable is an understatement). I'm wondering how many people actually have seen it before they handed out the best picture vote to it? Because it's been winning awards (so it must be good)? Because it tried to look like Ingram burgman? (but it's not even on the same level). It's a make something out of nothing kind of movie. a story with no resolution or a reason to be told in the first place. It's a dumb movie and a waste of time. I like German films, but this one stinks badly.(post Oscar comment) academy wasn't blind after all. i'm so happy that they didn't just hand over the award to this movie. also the awards for best directing and movie 'hurt locker' were the most deserving!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely stunning,"This at once reminds of Bergman's trilogy, and of ""Through a Glass Darkly"" especially. It's little people, and everyone is little under such a huge theme as the nascence of violence and terror, that are almost fatalistically sent on their own trajectories. It takes skills as a dramatist to make something such as this, with complex ideas framed in place and time.But the big philosophical ideas apart, the technique, writing, the photography, the way the actors perform, the execution of this film is simply stunning. The voice over narration that begins sets the place but does not lazily tell, it is elusive and leads into the action. Like much else in this film it is superbly balanced, not too much or it would undercut the action.The set scenes between actors achieve a finely tuned naturalness and rhythmically counterbalance the forward action of the script and the interplay between the actors so another degree of interest is revealed and what it might lead to.It is not predictable, not with the range of characters, the events that occur and a very strong evocation of place in a film in quite some time, make this worth watching again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,History
144 minutes of bared nerve endings,"A horse with a rider falls, suddenly. So begins a series of events, some of them strange. We do get the answer; it isn't hammered in, it's hinted at, like most of what one can take from this. The setting is a small village in Germany, before WWI. Every character is a human being(flawed, not ""evil""; not all likable), no one in this is flat. The relationships are credible. We see under the surface in this, to the point where we realize the rot behind the pretty facade. The main turning points are three families, that of the doctor, the pastor and the baron(who provides work for many of the lower-class people there). We have a narrator in the 31-year-old school teacher(like all the adult males, only ever referred to by his title), and the growing love between him and Eva(every scene between the two is spot-on, the first is instantly recognizable) is beautiful. The acting is amazing, including for the children. Every performance is perfect. The themes of justice, retribution, guilt, shame, pressure and authority are explored impeccably well here. This has numerous long, largely static takes; nothing really ""changes"", in a sense. A lot of shots are rather dim, as well; not to be confused with ""poorly lit"", not at all... in fact, this accomplishes, like no other film I've ever seen, that feeling that there's something there, in the darkness(that we know from real life). The stark b&w is effective, albeit at times, it feels like they weren't planning for it(but decided on it in post), as a few bits are a little hard to make out sans color. There is a great richness in detail in this, and it really gives you an idea of how it was back then, and how people related to each other, including across the classes. This wasn't what I expected, and I watched this late, so I felt a tiredness set in, that I have yet to succumb to(as I type this, it's been two and a half hours since the end credits ran, and I haven't stopped thinking about it, or the issues it brings up). There is disturbing content and violence in this. I recommend it to anyone who finds what I describe to sound appealing. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Haneke's masterwork.,"Michael Haneke relishes in the ambiguous and the uncomfortable yet the conflict is always clear, it's just the intention that is up for interpretation. In The White Ribbon, it's almost as if the film is self-aware of the impact of its drama. It's a vast ensemble which leads to many scenes feeling like vignettes featuring inciting incidents to spark further interesting stories. They're heartbreaking yet subtle and utterly human and often end, in true Haneke fashion, in brutal violence. In each story, there's a common theme of overreaction to change, insisting that ""the world won't collapse."" The smallest irregularity in a routine leads to an overcompensation of punishment or paranoia. The irony is that the effort to try and stop the change effects the routine severely. It's a town that is scared of death and how that impact ripples through society.It's revealed later in the film that the 'white ribbon' is a symbol of innocence, naivety and a protection from evil so the film is a study of the consequences of that protection. But it's all for nothing when by the end, the first spark of war has begun and everything changes. It's a film about the inevitability of change, despite the force of resistance. Its a fascinating place to study in the realm of storytelling and The White Ribbon is a truly exquisite piece. It's enhanced by theatrical and measured performances by the entire cast, especially the compelling actor playing the Doctor and particularly impressive performances from all the children. Haneke usually relishes in the grain and dirt of his photography but here it's slick and stark. It absolutely deserved its Oscar nomination for the terrific cinematography. The White Ribbon is easily Haneke finest work and immediately enters the canon of great films.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Black and White (Ribbon),"A couple of friends of mine play the Oscar game.

"A crude, puerile, anti-Christian attempt at explaining fascism","I will never understand why any movie buff would consider Haneke's movies anything more than self-righteous and arrogant trash. His latest film is just puerile and crude. Fascism was all due to authoritarian upbringing and Christian ethics? Are we to believe that anti-authoritarian ""anything goes"" and sexual promiscuity would have been the panacea against fascism? This obtuse logic is typical of any lefwing ideologue. Haneke is no exception. ""Funny Games"" was a priggish attempt at condemning movie violence but made use of violence itself. I guess only Haneke is allowed to employ violence in ""Funny Games"" and ""Die Klavierspielerin"" but anybody else who dares employ the same device is fair game for him. Everywhere you look, you can tell what havoc anti-authoritarian upbringing and sexual promiscuity have wrought: Crime, rebellion,STDs, illegitimate children, sexual perversions. Maybe Haneke should consider the consequences of his morals before he points with the finger at Christianity. In my church, you won't find a tyrannical priest. If we sin, we confess and our pastors forgive us, just like Jesus taught us. Forgiveness is one of the most important principles in Christian lives. Why does Haneke use a caricature of a priest to get his point across? Because that's the only way he can impugn Christianity. Because Jesus' and Paul's teaching all make sense, even if sometimes it's not that easy to stick to them. But what is the alternative? No morals atall? Of course Haneke's devoted minions look at all his trite output as ""masterpieces"" because they are blind to the depraved and anti-Christian moral values that hide behind Haneke's work. ""Das weisse Band"" is a telltale testament of a man who hates Christianity, who shows a distorted picture of Jesus and his teachings, and who opines that celibacy until marriage is the root of all evil. A true Christian knows that Jesus' teaching all make sense. That's why I abide by them, not because I have to. How about this, Mr Haneke? There are people actually who do not consider sexual ethics as an abomination or a hindrance to a happy life. It's very fitting to the Zeitgeist that a movie maker has to be Anti-Christian to get all the accolades of an atheistic world. Mr Haneke, your jig is up.",,Anonymous,History
Extremely Memorable,"Is this 2009 Palme d'Or winner worthy of the honor? What made it something uncommonly out of the loop in lieu of what has come before consists of Haneke's adept hand in capturing a period in time with detailed precision, the wonderful performances of the cast and an extremely memorable story. Every single consideration made in the direction of this unhurried thriller assured it will attain classic status, made to withstand the ages of film-making. Its script centers on a series of malicious, spiteful occurrences perpetuated by culprit(s) who hide in plain sight amongst a settlement of church-fearing Germans. Still waters don't necessarily mean that there are no gators though and the deceptively polite characters in the film hold some dark secrets of their own. We were doubtful whether it deserved its prize when we arrived at the end, but when our minds refused to be rid of Haneke's carefully realized images as if we suddenly had an epiphany, we accept the jury's choice.

"Bar none, THE most haunting film I've seen this year.","Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"" is a crude, dark film that haunts you endlessly- and I mean HAUNT in the highest sense of the word. I watched this film last night out of curiosity for the buzz it earned last year at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. As I was watching it I was both enthralled and appalled by how it vividly represented the darkest faults of human behavior, but I failed to consider it a masterpiece (like many other critics are doing). The film was over, I turned the DVD off and was soon asleep. I can't even come close to explaining how much the film haunted my dreams (and still does to this moment); I tossed and turned in my bed all night, my mind thrown into turmoil by the moral implications the film explores and the amount of difficult questions it forces you to face. It's a difficult film to swallow, but it's also a cinematic experience you'll think over for years to come.The film takes place in a small village in pre-WWI Germany. It is filmed in black and white, and the cinematography is perfect in giving it its aged, depressive feel. The story follows each (or most) of the villagers' lives throughout the year and a number of disturbingly mysterious crimes or 'accidents' that oppress the villagers' peace and in which many of the children seem to be involved. It would be utter madness to try and describe each of the characters, or each of the mysterious 'accidents' that unfold. Suffice it to say that Michael Haneke has managed to give us a thoroughly-nuanced story, and even though it deals with a great number of characters, they're all well-developed and of multi-layered depths; a heaven-gifted screenplay, if I ever saw one. I remember that I kept thinking ""This is what M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' would have looked like if it had been done flawlessly."" It's a suspenseful story because of the mystery behind the 'accidents', but it's actually more of a drama- a deeply-felt, crude but poignant exploration into the human soul and of the simplistic beauty in us all that rivals the beastly evil we all repress. It's about the loss of innocence to a world of war, greed, violence and envy; it's about love, and how such a pure feeling becomes adulterated with the hellish passion for sex; it's about the basest characteristics of humanity, and how they taint the existence of a few people living secluded in their village, quiet witnesses to the horrors around them but unable to act against them.It's not a simple film, no. And it's not a film to watch on a rainy Monday night, cozily snuggled under your covers. It's a film meant to be taken seriously, to be thoroughly analyzed, to have its every frame dissected and squeezed from its significance. I watched it for mere pleasure and discovered that I was almost bored to yawns: it's two hours long but feels like five, it's incredibly slow-paced, there is no raw emotion meant to be immediately understood (but everything must be interpreted from the characters' faces and tone of voice), every single scene has a definite, non-literal meaning...in short, it's NOT a movie you'll enjoy, but a film you're supposed to analyze and then to treasure for the amazing message it conveys. I went to sleep after watching the film pleased with it but unable to understand how such a... slow, emotionless thing had managed to capture critics' attention so. And then came the sleepless night, where I unconsciously ran over many scenes in my mind, analyzing their meaning and coming up with the horrid, deep and frightening conclusions the film gives us.Well, actually, it's not like the film itself gives us any conclusions, but it leads us to ask ourselves many questions concerning the abhorrent nature of humans and it points us to the turgid answers we'll be sure to get. It's a film that flawlessly presents beauty and horror as twin brothers who can't leave apart from each other. There's the mystery of the 'accidents' combined with the tragically dysfunctional lives of each villager, with the unfair treatment of the children, with the expressly marked roles of men and women, with the growing ambiance of war around them, with the loss of innocence in the town's children, with the inhibition of sexual discovery in each of them, with the refreshing love story between the narrator and a naïve teenagerwell, the movie imparts cold, direct facts of life, pieces of humanity in all their wonder or horror, and it's up to the audience to make any sense of it all and to come to one's terms with the implications of the film's message.I think of ""The White Ribbon"" and I see it being the topic of discussion in cine-circles around the globe and in film classes. It's destined to become a classic because of the sheer amount of things it deals with and the absolute power one manages to uncover while analyzing it. If I were to start analyzing now I'd be giving away spoilers by the second and ruining what will surely be one of the best foreign films you'd ever watch. I can't recommend it enough!

nope,"There are few filmmakers to whom I have as mixed feelings as I do towards Haneke. My favorite films of his- Amour, Code Unknown- I hold to be about as great as cinema gets. The Haneke films I hold in the least regard, such as the two Funny Games films and The Piano Teacher (the latter of which I know some people hold in very high regard), I think are ill conceived exercises in misanthropic sadism disguised, I think even to Haneke himself, as some kind of moralistic lesson to the audience. 
This film, one of his most celebrated, for me falls into neither extreme camp- I just found it tiresome. Indeed, this is an example of a film that is well made on just about every level, that still manages to be unsatisfying. The craftsmanship here is of a very high level- the cinematography is great, the art direction flawless, the acting top-notch. Even the narrative is passably entertaining in a prosaic who-done-it kind of way (although the ""surprise"" ending is anything but). And yet, I felt I'd wasted three house watching it. Perhaps this is because the film's message seems to be: 1. Early 20th century German culture was hella Protestant. 2. Puritanical protestant culture is hypocritical and oppressive. 3. Therefor, the generation of children who grew up in such a milieu grew up to be Nazis.

a significant work of art,"The extraordinary composition of frames serves to create a visual basis for a terse, complex narrative. The visual composition of each scene conveys what the verbal content alone would not. The acting ensemble was of the highest imaginable caliber. There emerges a third dimension in this art work which is seldom achieved in just 'motion picture'. Moralizing based on this work is really irrelevant. Expectations of linear, tidy narrative would not be met. The ambiguity which seems to pervade the core of the story is itself an aesthetic device necessary to the purposes of the maker of this work. Hanneke seems to have been developing and perfecting his skill in telling a story by thinking about his work as a painter of successive pictures connected by a common meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Those To Whom Evil Is Done,"Michael Haneke doesn't believe in solving mysteries for his audience. Apparently he does believe in the left wing Freudian analysis of Wilhelmine Germany. Between the wars, German thinkers like Reich, Marcuse, Bettelheim and Adorno all concluded that the culture of sexual repression and patriarchy had been the root cause of the First World War -- not simply the outbreak, but the dogged obedience and endurance the German people had displayed during four years of hardship, hunger and slaughter. A fortiori the same root causes applied to the German desire, epitomized by Nazism, to do the whole thing over and get it right this time. The Weimar fusion of Freudian psychiatry and Marxist politics is with us to this day. It was vulgarized during the 1960s to a slogan -- Make Love, Not War -- that assumed that fighting and sex were antitheses. It is still the conventional wisdom of middle class progressives about gender relations and child rearing.The conventional view of European life just before the catastrophe of the First World War is one of hazy nostalgia for a lost world of order and certainty. Haneke isn't having any. His little village of Eichwald, somewhere on the North German plain, is a pastoral hell of patriarchy, subordination, violent punishment, heartless religion and sexual repression, breeding envy, resentment, hatred, and self-loathing, where children's natural impulses are driven underground by force to emerge in violent cruelty towards the helpless. The social structure of Eichwald is dominated by the Baron, who owns most of the land and who most of the peasants depend on for wage labor on the estate. Representing order, learning and moral instruction are the Steward, who is a porcine and subservient brute, the Doctor, who is a self loathing sadist and pervert, and the Pastor, who coldly dispenses humiliating punishment in full ""this will hurt me more than it hurts you"" mode. At the bottom of the educated elite, just above those who work with their hands, is our narrator, the ineffectual Teacher, who doubles as parish clerk and organist, and who is paid too little to afford to marry. All of these men are addressed as Sir -- Herr Baron, Herr Verwalter, Herr Artzt, Herr Pastor, and (by the children only) Herr Lehrer. The children address their fathers not merely as Father -- no Daddy here -- but as Father, Sir -- Herr Vater. The younger children are sweet and open, but by the time they're 10 to 12 the kids are hard, tight and closed. And onward to 1933-45.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The White Ribbon,"Haneke returns to form after his very good, but unnecessary, remake of his own Funny Games. The White Ribbon focuses on a small village where mysterious things are happening. Not supernatural things, just weird and dangerous things. This is the kind of town where a ""tragedy"" is someone slicing up the Baron's cabbages. On many levels this is an exploration of inexplicable hate, the kind that often surfaces during childhood. There is no real reason for it, other than the child's view of injustice. A lot is left to the viewer, is this a single campaign of terror and hate? Or separate incidents aiding a myth? The perfect cinematography creates a peculiar, yet welcome, dream like fantasy world. It feels like a paranoid fairytale or Gothic fable, but always grounded in reality. It's a marvelous achievement and the perfect way to end 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The sins of the fathers are visited on the children... and vice versa?,"Not sure I buy Haneke's coy suggestion that the misdeeds of the spooky kid vigilantes that drive the plot of this film, set in a small North German village in 1914, might have had something to do ""certain events that later took place in our country."" Doesn't really matter... ""The White Ribbon,"" filmed in silvery black and white, plays like an adaptation of a classic novel-right up till the copout pomo ending-and I found the doings of the pompous gentry (the Baron, the Overseer, the Doctor, the Pastor...) and their vindictive offspring quite suspenseful and involving, even though I knew better than to expect a tidy solution from the likes of him.If I were pitching the script, I'd say something like ""Agatha Christie meets Thomas Hardy meets Edvard Munch""; there's an atmosphere of brooding Nordic fatalism hanging over this village of the verdammt, but no Miss Marple or council of the Fates to sort things out. If you know a little German, the formal, old-fashioned dialogue is pretty easy to follow, with the verbs thumping down at the end like so many shoes dropping. Reminded me of Fassbinder's ""Effi Briest,"" classic 19th-century-style German storytelling refracted through a whacked-out visual sensibility.

Compelling art,"Michael Haneke, one of perhaps the most gifted directors of our times, made a compelling piece of art. His movies are all but predictable and repetitive. ""The White Ribbon"" is a an incredible treatise on nature of evil and seductive power of violence. Small German village, year before bloody World War I, full of hard working and seemingly civilized people,turns into a dangerous place, where ugliness lurks at every corner. Amazing black and white cinematography gives powerful imagery. People with subdued emotions that eerily get expressed in a same black and white way.

Great imagination Hanecke,"So, starting my word with , I want to say that ''white ribbon'' is a movie about a small town of decade 1910 . Director wants to show how the relations of people formed by the happenings of strange facts. Michael Hanecke indicates who's responsible for them : the children of the town or the doctor with the midwife? I will explain to you why I believe that both are. The children live in a strict disciplined, religious, society . They seem to manage to get over with it but the conservatism of their parents sample their patience . So when they are starting to feel isolated they react with different ways. Clara cut the neck of the bird , they drop baron's son in the river and someone bites his hand. I must say that the kid's of poor locals farmers react to the rich and comfortable Sigi because they feel that they are inferior of him. The question which creating is can the children do things like these happened in the small village of our story? Hanecke shows the indignation of children but he indicates what children can do ( for example when Clara cut the neck of the bird). The other suspects are doctor and midwife. The school teacher who is the narrator of our story indicates that these two might have a connection with the death 's wife of doctor. Doctor has sexual behavior with her daughter . The teacher said that Clari's eyes have been wounded them by the doctor and the midwife. The question is who put the wire on the doctor's house and he fell from his horse? Was it midwife or the children? Generally this movie like Hanecke's movies doesn't give you free and easy answers but he wants to make you think, to make you imagine things just like the end which is an open end .Clearly answers are not given and I like these kind of movies because they make you search for the answers and think how your life would be in 1914 . Would you have been able to live in an environment like that ? For Baron's wife, I don't think so and I believe that Hanecke gave so much freedom of her . Don't be free thinker Hanecke ,women didn't act like that especially the wives of rich people. The shot in black and white is very good idea because Michael wants to transport you in a cruel society of 1914.Anyway very good movie",7.0,Anonymous,History
Going scourging,"I'm either too guilty or not guilty enough to accept this movie. At bottom it's just another of those suspense stories that amount to a half-hour TV episode--specifically, an episode of the old Alfred Hitchcock series--padded out to five times the length; but this one differs from the rest in its aesthetic and social pretensions. Quite evidently, the director set out to make an art film and a political parable, and prepared himself by watching a lot of early Bergman and late Carl Dreyer, and probably Bela Tarr, as well as art horror movies. And so the movie is shot in black and white, in formal, frozen compositions that last forever; it takes place in an isolated, almost medieval village, where everybody looks as if they were in mourning; and the whole story is narrated offscreen in a muted voice. All this seems like much ado about nothing, since the moral of the fable becomes obvious at once and that is the point of the exercise, as well as the sole source of dramatic interest. Having gotten the point already, and not feeling the need to undergo ritual purification, I found the movie a reverse luxury: something I could have afforded but didn't want.

A Frustratingly Great Film!,"The White Ribbon is one of the most frustrating and antagonizing movies I have ever seen. But on the other hand, the film consists of sheer beauty from the story within and from the amazing black and white cinematography which adds authenticity to the film. This film moves at a snail-pace and is consequently devoid of thrilling action, but the story is very captivating and the lesson is simple: negative, authoritarian leadership will lead to negative, possibly devastating consequences.Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke directs a film that takes place leading up the first World War. The location is a baron's land which consists of a doctor, schoolteacher, and so on. But one day, these mysterious events occur which results in injuries and even deaths of townsfolk. Now as they are trying to find answers, nothing can happen without drawing suspicion.The acting is very good. Christian Friedel does a great job as the young teacher who is witnessing these events and is trying to find answers which is proving tough as he is trying to marry his prospective fiancée. I also have to mention Burghart KlauBner as the preacher. He was very tough and is a man you can't look down upon.Overall, The White Ribbon is a serious look about the root of evil and it is known for depicting society and family life on the dark side. This film essentially shows the evils or we shall say the roots of Nazism and Fascism which would rise to power less than two decades after the events of this film. This film is the meaning of beauty, technically and story-wise, but is also a very frustrating film and it is very hard to watch due to the tepid place. But it is a case study on human society, so it's well worth watching. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Haneke's masterpiece,"Wow, that is a great film. It's only the second Haneke's I watched(got introduced by Amour) and now I faced a real masterpiece. The bleakness and the very dark humor, the incredibly deep depth the characters had, despite each one of them barely having much more than 15-20 minutes of screen time..the acting was great...the cinematography was excellent...all around great.I really loved the ending(I know it bothered some people), because if you really think about it, was the ideal ending. We saw lots of details, suggestions through the film, lots of details and things that weren't totally explained, so making a ""close- ending"" would actually kill all of the magic and the interesting parts about the film.

Disturbing journey to a very dark place,"Michael Haneke spent more than ten years on this production, which explains why every little detail about this movie is right. From the first frame on this movie grips you with its bare-bones style and unbearable silence. There's no music, long stretches without dialogue, most scenes only use natural lighting so the screen often goes black, but none of that is needed to generate an intensely powerful suspense. This is mostly due to the excellent child actors, who put in very effective performances. You feel sorry for them, but at the same time they're very ominous. Haneke's message seems to be that suppression only leads to more suppression, a scary basic idea that makes for a very frightening film. Rightful winner of the Palm d'Or, and I'm pretty sure it only got snubbed for the Best Foreign Film Oscar because several judges later admitted to never even having seen the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Haunting Film,"Haneke's haunting parable set in a small German village on the eve of WWI - told from the perspective of a local teacher (with a voice over looking back many years later) it tells of a series of events that took place - some mundane, others quite horrific that engulfed the village - no-one can be found to be blamed and this creates tensions that ratchet up the already tense relationship between the major characters. Its as much a mediation on the roots of evil and how in the years to come these roots will manifest themselves as history. Its engrossing throughout with long elegant takes and fantastic B&W photography - its quite slow and at 2h24m quite a long haul but won the Palme D'Or at Cannes that year - and it does reward the effort.....",8.0,Anonymous,History

Didn't love it as much as i should have,"Two years in a row films that win the Palme D'or have strong social and political messages. Both Haneke's ""White Ribbon"" and Cantet's ""The Class"" chose to deliver the message of how the society influences children and in turn it's future. It seems to me that the judges at Cannes are a bit inclined to give the award not to the better film but to a more important film. While Haneke's effort on ""The White Ribbon"" is evident: it's visually stunning, the structure of scenes are very much his signature objective style (that doesn't really stir me but i get what he is trying say). The children's performances are amazing, they truly steal the show. Now the problem for me with this film is that it's constantly trying to deliver the messages it's supposed to, it's overpowering and practically smothers every storyline in the film, the cinematic style stresses it again. It's an interesting study in Haneke's favorite subject the nature of violence. But to me it drags a bit more then it should i couldn't for some reason appreciate the slow burner pace, which I know many people loved. But for me it wasn't the best movie of the year, not even my favorite Haneke film. I'm not sure it will stand the test of time and become a classic that everybody predicts it will be.",7.0,Anonymous,History
No Simple Who-Dunnit,"Greetings again from the darkness. There have been many films with troubled communities: ""The Village"", ""Wicker Man"", ""Children of the Corn"", and ""Stepford Wives"" to name a few. None of these compare to the pre-World War I rural German village that director Michael Haneke plops us into.Haneke is the master of keeping the viewer guessing and never really allowing us a clean solution to the mysteries he presents. Did you figure out what motivated the cruelty from the boys in ""Funny Games""? Did you ever really figure out who or why the family was being videotaped in ""Cache""? The same holds true here.The story is told by the voice-over from the school teacher many years later. We only see the village and the residents as ""things"" happen - through the recollections of the teacher. Haneke presents many suspects, but no answers to all of the ""accidents"" and foul play that occurs. We witness only the aftermath and the distrust of the close community.The film is up for Best Foreign Film and the stark, bleak, black & white look will put you on edge and create a feeling of discomfort, even in the somewhat happiest moments of the film. No doubt it will frustrate those who need a clean wrap-up, but those who enjoy discussion and debate will need an extra cup of coffee afterward to go through all the what-ifs.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Wow! What a waste of time this was!,"Wow! I think the only time I've been more frustrated by a film is when trying to figure out a David Lynch film (or two). Except this was SLOWER.... much, much SLOWER! I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless he or she is the most ardent student of film who is interested in modern black and white cinematography. Please don't waste your time if your like a gripping screenplay or story.None of the questions raised in this film were answered. The viewer is left hanging at every turn. The crimes committed were brutal and the ONLY reason to stay with this film for the two plus hours (very long hours)is the hope of getting some answers, but to no avail. No answers whatsoever! Just questions.I'd say the only bright spot in this film was the romance between the upright, honorable school teacher and his shy fiancée. They were both charming and memorable.But the rest? Yikes! There were no characters developed that one could pull for. So many of the children and teens favored the others that it was difficult to figure out who was who for the longest time.... not just favored each other physically; but in manner and spirit as well. Everyone seemed the same. The children were all alike, the women were all alike, etc. Dull, dull, dull.And yes, there are some parallels between the villagers and the soon-to-come Hitler's Third Reich. But, come one... there were parallels between this film and The Village of the Damned, too. But that doesn't make this a good film. It's screenplay is terribly weak. There are many spots where it simply ceases to exist.

It took this viewer some time to recognize the subtle tensions as they exist behind the closed doors of the rooms and houses of this German village, partly because these tensions, anxieties, etc., are -until near the end of the film- almost oblivious to our good Samaritan narrator. In retrospect, when I say ""behind the closed doors"" I mean so almost literally as household, bedroom, barn and other doors, gates, fences, etc., (open, closed and/or in the act of opening or closing) appear so frequently in this film that I can't help but wonder if such were not intentional.

The eve of war,"The White Ribbon (Das Weisse Band) tells the story of a small German village and the strange occurrences that happened in the months leading up to World War I. The film begins with an accident involving the doctor. He falls off of his horse and is severely injured. This is the first of several strange and out of the ordinary incidents.There is tension building between the lower class and the upper class. The major conflict stemming from the death of a worker's wife. While the husband tries to look past it his son refuses. Other groups like the Baron's son and other children arise.The film is narrated by the school teacher, telling the story many years after the incidents occur. He lets us know that even he is not sure of what happened, and what he is telling us might not even be true, much like a story passed down should be set up. It's not a perfect retelling, but it is (hopefully) accurate. What a story it is.Each individual character has their own story. The school teacher, the Baron, his wife and son, the doctor,his daughter, the midwife, the preacher, his wife and children, the nanny, and the list goes on with several minor but important characters. Story lines intertwine and combine to construct a complicated web. It's very well written (Haneke penned the screenplay) and paced perfectly. There are several themes and conflicts that arise here. Marriage, faith, loss of innocence, death, abuse, just to name a few.Filmed in stark black and white by Christian Berger (who worked with Haneke on Cache and The Piano Teacher). This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful films I have seen in a long time. There are some hard issues and startling images, but the camera makes each shot look like a work of art. Choosing to film in black and white gives the film an older quality simply because black and white tends to be associated with older films. It also makes light and shadow vitally important in helping to tell the story. There are no colors to help determine emotions and feeling, just white, black, and in between grays. One mistake could render the image unusable. It's a pleasure to watch a film that pays such close attention to each shot.I was very pleased with the end. Throughout most of the film we are trying to figure why these horrible things are happening and in most cases who is doing them. Haneke keeps us guessing right through to the end. I'm not sure how others will fell but I felt very satisfied. I invested a lot of energy and emotion and continued feeling for the characters and thinking about the film long after it was over. That's my favorite part about great films. The ability to stay with you after the credits roll. Haneke succeeds.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Black & white is dead, long live black & white!","This is a movie that you need to let sink in for a while after you finish watching. At first the movie might feel like a bit of a redundant one, since it doesn't really tie things up by the end and it's a quite slow and long sit, though the movie in fact is just over 2 hours, end credits not included. However the more you start thinking about this movie afterward, the more you start to appreciate it and also start to see- and better understand the grand scheme of things.The movie can be seen as director and writer Michael Haneke's views on the origins or fascism, at the start of the 20th century, in Germany. Not saying that the small town depicted in this movie is supposed to be the source of all evil but what the movie does is slowly but above all things subtly showing how years of abuse and oppression can lead to dangerous thoughts and actions. I can't really say how realistic this all is, since honestly it seemed all a bit far fetched to me but then again, I'm not an expert of German history and was clearly also not around at the time. It's supposedly based on true events all, so there at least must be some truth behind it all.But if you believe there be some truth in the story or not doesn't matter that much, since while watching this movie you'll still remain fascinated by it all and get sucked in by the movie its slow story-telling. What I really like about the story but especially its storytelling was that it never really wrapped up things or clarified just everything. It's a movie that probably leaves more questions than answers, which forces you to think about things and fill in all of the blanks for yourself. It makes ""Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte"" a very thought provoking movie.It's not the sort of movie you see an awful lot of now days. It's the sort of movie that reminds you of Ingmar Bergman's work and neorealistic movies from Italy, from the '40's and '50's. Movies that are like a random slice of life, with featuring everyday persons in it, doing everyday things, facing everyday's struggles and problems in life. Those movies are also often set in small towns or communities, just like this movie. I'm glad there are still persons doing movies like this and it makes me even happier that they are being appreciated and successful as well. This movie even received an Oscar nomination for best foreign picture of the year, as well as one for its cinematography.And it's not hard to see really why Christian Berger's camera-work for this movie is so much praised. I have to say, I don't think I have ever seen a more beautiful shot modern black & white movie, at least not in recent years. Hard to say what it is but the black & white makes this movie so much more clear than color could had ever achieved. Besides it suits- and enhances the movie its overall atmosphere.Yet another real great and unique 21th century German movie achievement.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History

A Parable warning against moral absolutism ***Spoiler Alert***,"White Ribbon is an achingly beautiful parable that demonstrates how moral absolutism - expressed as strict, conservative religion and enforced with physical punishment, fear and shame - leads not to moral perfection but increasing violence, fear, chaos, and intolerance. Yes, obviously, at this specific time in Germany, Fascism and Nazism grew out of such an environment. White Ribbon's deep power is not only as a window to the past, but as a warning for today to any community. The religious-righteousness and fear-mongering, as well as threats of domestic terrorist violence, in the US in 2010 suffer from a similar desire for a kind of order that cannot bring the order and perfection envisioned, only a form of control that eventually strangles humanity.SPOILER ALERT: To comment on an earlier thread, people in White Ribbon disappeared sometimes because something bad happened to them, just like Nazi Germany, but sometimes they disappeared because they chose to get out before anything bad happened to them, and because only something bad would happen to them if they didn't disappear. Hopefully that's what happened to the woman on the bike, the Midwife - that she disappeared to save herself after her son had been murdered.",,Anonymous,History
Links to Powell and Pressburger,"Although there seems to be some question as to what this film is about, the director spells it out in an interview on the blu-ray version I watched. I did not put the same interpretation on the film that he suggests but I can see it makes sense. He is also at pains to say that this isn't just about German society and could have been about anywhere with analogous conditions.I always hesitate to use the ""M"" word but in this case I would call the film a masterpiece. I can also see that it isn't a film that everyone would like because it is a very still and calm film, despite the violent acts that take place. It also runs like a mystery but there are no easy answers given which might be unsatisfactory for some viewers. I generally like two sorts of film; either a straightforward good action or genre film or films that are highly metaphorical and mysterious. This is definitely in the latter category.The White Ribbon is such a beautiful visual experience that I feel it could be watched with sound and the subtitles turned off. There's so much to see in each frame and the black and white photography is better than anything I've ever seen in a film before. Oftentimes the effect is quite painterly especially when featuring the interiors of buildings. It also leaves the viewer to do a lot of the work – sometimes the characters leave the frame and shut doors behind them and the camera is static for several seconds before characters come back into frame. Could be deadly yet it's always done in a way that allows you to know what is happening behind the closed door or at least be intrigued by the possibilities. Even though the film moves at a slow pace I felt constantly on the edge of my seat.The only thing I can compare this to is Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale which had a similar set of disturbing events going on in a rural town. But the White Ribbon stands on its own as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Although I've nothing against a good bang, crash type of film as I've said, this is on an entirely different level. This is pure art and lots of people won't like it. It just so happens that I do.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Ignorance poses as Innocence: The White Ribbon,"In a small village in Northern Germany in 1916 a series of bizarre and horrid things happen. There is no explanation for these events, only mute rumors and musings in a town confined by strict Protestant rules of judgment and behavior. The town Doctor on horseback is tripped by a trap wire hidden on a path, is injured, and must leave town for a hospital treatment for a while: upon return we learn that the town doctor is anything but kind in his verbal and physical abuse of his office manager/mistress who may be the mother of 'his child' - a mentally challenged boy cared for the mother/mistress who also cares for his naive other children by his deceased wife. A young boy, the son of the town Baron, is found in the woods, bound and beaten, and the town fails to produce information as to the brutality. A woman falls through a dangerous flooring and dies, her husband commits suicide, the mentally challenged boy is severely tortured, the Baron's cabbage farm is destroyed, the children of the large family of the town pastor are punished for varying reasons (each offending child must wear a 'white ribbon of innocence' to remind themselves to sin no more - the young boy's sin is physical self satisfaction), a building on the Baron's estate is burned, etc. Oddly since there are no identified culprits, the town focuses on the children as the possible perpetrators of the violence - since they are ignorant until they receive Confirmation in the church - a ritual supposed to bring the enlightenment of adulthood to those confirmed!There are many stories in this magnificent film by the gifted Michael Haneke and none of them is fully resolved by the end of the film. It is the tenor of the city that seems to breed ill winds that in turn suggests that the town's inhabitants - curious and possibly dangerous children and adults with both overt and subliminal evil in their characters - are setting the scene for a country that could produce the evil demonstrated by the events of July 1917 which opened World War II. Haneke captures all of this terror and submerged hate and fear and abuse and character dysfunction in startling black and white photography. The townspeople are all fairly similar in appearance, made more so by the black and white imagery, and the only person in the town that has some semblance of humanity is the young schoolteacher (even in his discovery of courtship) that seems to make the statement that it is only through education that change can occur. Haneke has the courage and sensitivity to leave the audience guessing about the etiologies of all the evils we have witnessed and simply ends his film in slow fadeout as WW I ensues. It is a heart-stopping film, brilliantly directed and acted and photographed and accompanied by a musical score that emphasizes choral hymns sung by children. This is magnificent film-making!

I struggled,"'The White Ribbon', or 'Das Weisse Band' for you Germanians, is the latest product from the mind of Michael Haneke; who is up to his eye balls with festival awards and academy nominations. For those uneducated, he's one of the most acclaimed non-English language filmmakers working today. He won the Palm D'or last year and was nominated for the Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Film in the Oscars.There is little argument to suggest 'The White Ribbon' didn't deserve the former of those nominations. Shot in stunning black and white for that pure cinematic look, it proves that you don't need colour to show off the great German countryside. If nothing else this is surely worth a rent just to look at. I don't necessarily have an issue with the latter nom (seeing as I haven't seen all of the films in that category) but I really can't recommend this for the average movie-goer, if there is such a thing.Set in the few months before the First World War, 'The White Ribbon' tells the story of the residents of a very small village coping with a number of ""accidents"": one injured doctor, one dead woman and one dead horse.There is the underlying mystery as to who perpetrates all of these shenanigans but what takes the main stage is the family drama in response. In the first 40 minutes there are a number of very sensitive and sometimes moving scenes, one of which has a young teen attempting to explain death to her younger brother. The raw style in which it is delivered makes it un-sentimental; it's just a shame that it in end it never amounts to much. I've always admired Haneke's 'epic theatre' style but this time, unlike the thriller 'Hidden', I don't believe the story was conclusive or emotionally satisfying.What mars the first part is that I really struggled keeping up with all of the characters and who's children were who's. It seems kind of like trying to remember the names of everybody in your class but in a significantly shorter time. Ironically, it's a good thing the film is so damn long, otherwise I think I would have had to watch it again to understand what was going on. But the plot never seems to get active enough to excuse that sort of running time. I was unsure of what the priority was, seeing as the accidents keep coming but never seeming to be the main centre of interest until the final act. I wasn't bored, but I imagine a lot of people not used to this sort of thing will be.I know some will instantly label this as pretentious. It's got all the hallmarks of pretentious film making, for example, with its attempted ""White/innoncence"" symbolism going on, I admit this much. But seeing as the acting, cinematography and editing are all so fine, I seriously think only slight tweaking with pacing and plot would make this film a great one.So should you see it? I'm sure Haneke fans have all seen it by now, so they're out. All I can possibly say is that I, a foreign film fan, was underwhelmed. Make of that what you will. For those interested, I suggest renting it first.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I don't honestly think it was about the roots of evil,"The evil was well established in the movie, from long time ago, from the glory of the Holly Roman Empire in Germany, from the height of the bourgeoisie in the Habsburg Empire.The core,the inner, enormous value of this piece is not about that. The movie is a fantastic inventory of objects and faces, an anthropological exposition of the German features, a live museum,a magnificent docudrama... The texture of the whole environment, the details of the set are altogether a masterpiece of film directing . Given this fantastic set we are set to immerse ourselves in every moral nuance of the story, of every common and flat sentence given by the voice over. I enjoyed every second, every frame of this gem, with a thirst hard to describe. When it was over I wanted to last three more hours. I had the (bad?)luck to watch(or try) the enormously overrated Romanian''Police,adj' after this and it didn't but make this one more majestic and strong.

Pure evil...,"""The White Ribbon"" - ""Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte"" is a Drama - Mystery movie in which we watch the people of a small village in the north part of Germany during World War I being surprised by the occurrence of some strange events. The church plays a major role in the punishments of children or people but they still cannot find who is responsible for these strange events.I had high expectations from this movie but I was a bit disappointed because it was too long and in some points it was a bit boring. Despite that I liked it and I enjoyed the interpretations of both Burghart Klaußner who played as The Pastor and Christian Friedel who played as The School Teacher. The direction which was made by Michael Haneke who is also the writer was very good and he presented very well and as truly as possible the stereotypes of that time in combination with the condition of the society and its rules.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Once upon a time in pre-Nazi Germany...,"The White Ribbon is an intriguingly strange piece of film: a deliberately elusive thriller, 150 minutes long, in black and white, set in Germany just before World War I. It's also the long awaited return to his mother tongue for Austrian provocateur Michael Haneke, after a decade filming in French and, in the case of his shot-for-shot remake of his own Funny Games, English. Additionally, and most importantly, it might be his most important film to date.The story takes place in an unnamed rural village, where a strong Lutheran mindset rules. Over a period of a year, strange events occur which cause harm to some of the more respected inhabitants, like the doctor, the priest and, in a potentially political act, the local nobility. But who is to blame? Somehow, the children seem to be playing a significant role in this, and the priest comes up with a severe punishment: his offspring will have to wear a white ribbon, symbolizing their lost innocence, until they are trustworthy again...Like all of Haneke's previous movies, The White Ribbon is, at first sight, a very frustrating picture: static shots, and overall ""coldness"" (despite a surprisingly spot-on comedic segment) and, most ""annoyingly"", a whodunit story with no solution. But that, of course, was to be expected: Haneke, an academic as well as a filmmaker, is not interested in easy answers, a fact that is most evident in his decision to deal with his trademark theme - the effects of violence on society - without depicting most of the acts on-screen (there are no sudden gushes of blood like in Funny Games or Hidden). Despite its straightforward storytelling, this Palme d'Or-winner could seem to be the director's most uncommercial feature, devoid as it is of a real ""solution"" and ""big"" names in the cast (although Haneke aficionados might recognize Susanne Lothar, the female star of the first Funny Games).And yet it is a masterwork, because in his apparent refusal to spoon-feed the audience Haneke still provides a riveting - and frightening - study of human behavior, specifically man's capacity for evil. Beneath the sublime use of black and white and the period reconstruction, which give the picture a neatly anonymous, timeless feel (despite a couple of time-specific remarks), lies a very precise point of view on a very definite moment in history: the narrator (who, in pure mystery tale tradition, isn't very reliable) says the bizarre events in the village might shed some light on subsequent happenings, and Haneke seems to suggest the punished children of 1913 will have a chance to retaliate against other ""wrongdoers"" some twenty years later. It's merely an implication, with no closing captions to openly state the director's point, but it remains very unsettling.Proving that you don't need blood and other gimmicks to make a statement about violence, The White Ribbon is a superb essay on the human condition: elusive, yet poignant and right on the mark. Extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The nemesis is someone you know.,"This reminds me of Jorge Luis Borges' ability to misdirect his audience with facts, histories, that simply aren't true. I've read an adequate sample of the reviews and I find that many if not all draw conclusions (call them ""suspicions"") about the film using the backdrop of real history - the audience is necessary to conclude this film.I don't think there is any lesson or allegory in this story whatsoever. The entire story and all that it insinuates about the future serves the art and philosophy of film, not history. The reason for my opinion is the Narrator. I don't want to pepper this review with spoilers, so I will just describe what the narrator is: an omniscient, omni-prescient that provides an early caveat that his memory is dim. The audience is NOT transported to some view outside of the narrator's own recollection or design. No scene plays out without breadcrumbs from the narrative. The ""evil"" in this story is the ambiguity of its source, the narrator. Worse, the narrator's ""dim"" memory may just be his way of NOT saying that he himself is the nemesis.I find it especially wry that one of the last scenes discusses how the towns-people, the rumor-mongers, fall into fevered conjecture about the events that transpired, not unlike the reviewers of this film. This gives the film a palpable sense of Borges and my conviction that we have all been duped by Haneke. Haneke's own words: ""Every argument is powerless against feelings. But every interpretation is also correct, because it occurs in the mind of the recipient -- in your mind, in this case. In that sense, you have contributed to the film -- hopefully."" Everyone seems to project history on this story. Keep in mind that this film is even more fictional than, say, ""The Titanic"". At least the The Titanic was based on a real event in history. The White Ribbon is based on a completely fictional village. Even so... we all knew what was going to happen to the ship, but we didn't know what was going to happen to the village - not to worry; there's an archetype, Nazism, to ride like a hobby horse.The Narrator is speaking to the audience. Whenever he fails in providing a fact it is not because he doesn't remember, but it doesn't suit the construction of the fable. The narrator is outside of the fable alongside each of us.Who committed all these acts? Who withholds the answers? Who is telling the story? The nemesis.Any allegory in the fable is complete misdirection; what matters is the psychology of projecting it on each viewer; every ambiguity, every unsolved (undisclosed) puzzle, propelling every individual to make sweeping statements, grasping. I know that I am correct... after all, Haneke says I am. Quotation taken from Der Spiegel interview.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Somber. Moody. Slow.,"It's not often that a film leaves me perplexed (""Inception"" notwithstanding), but I must admit that I had a very difficult time understanding what was going on in this film. The children in this movie play a key role in the growing sense of menace and fear that permeates the small German village where they live. Someone is terrorizing the village, committing brutal crimes, and no one seems to be able to figure out what's going on. The children seem to be implicated in much of the mischief, but it's nearly impossible to tell them apart—which child belongs to which family. Is this kid the steward's son? The pastor's daughter? The Baron's child? It all gets too confusing. Maybe it's too much to ask of a contemporary German film (yes, it's recent, despite the early 20th-century setting and the black-and-white), but I would appreciate a bit more clarity, at least when it comes to differentiating the characters. I know the ambiguity in the plot is intentional and the whole thing is supposed to be some sort of extended allegory for the domestic roots of German Fascism and the titular white ribbon symbolizes childhood innocence and so on—but please. Enough already with the heavy-handed artiste-ry.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A dark drama with a very unsatisfactory ending,"Lot of question marks at the end of this greatly directed, well scripted, well shot, well acted, best costumed, make-up, amazing talented young kid actors...this film is a great artistic achievement. The poverty, the rich and the poor, the extreme contrast and opposition, the boredom; no matter you were rich or poor. Rich people with less children, while the poor families got so many mouths to feed.....What a pathetic and suffocating story before the WWI in the northern part of Deutschland Germany. The poor villagers, the tyrant and cruel pastor, the disgusting doctor, those poor women and children at that time. The cruelty of the parenthood, the suppressed children by their horrible parents, especially the fathers. No wonder later when these kids grew up, they'd naturally become the cruel and heartless Nazis. It was the Baroness's words prescribed the unbearable and horrendous village lifestyle. Think about it: Even the rich people like her couldn't stand the suffocating life in a grand mansion with so many servants, how about the lives of the poor villagers? The unfairness between the rich and the poor when facing the boredom, there was rich boredom and the poor boredom. The only person that looked normal with decency was the lamer teacher, lending the bike then lost his hopeful marriage.Those murder cases, those malicious things, those injustices.... on and on, never were told or solved in the end, giving the viewers a very uncomfortable feeling and emptiness, that's the worst ever ending we've experienced in all the movies we've seen so far.

It's about people who have existed and start to exist inside you at the same time as you're part of the screen.The movie is not about the ""German experience"", not about the evil in us all, not about guilt. It's about a real life inferno and for the first time, Haneke manages to get us into it. This makes this his really first good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Nice acting and the dialogs, especially between the doctor and his wife. How can a person be so cruel and empty... If you liked ""Code unknown"" or ""Hidden"" by Haneke and are not necessarily a fan of ""Funny games"" than this title is for you.

"Not for the mass market, but thought provoking.","It's in German, and it's black-and-white. So we're not off to a good start in terms of mass popular appeal. At least it's not about The War. Or is it? War never seems to be very far away in German films, especially black-and-white ones. And this one doesn't disappoint.The White Ribbon is set in a small village in rural Germany before The War. Very specifically, in the year immediately preceding the start of the First World War. The story is narrated through the eyes of an elderly School Teacher, told as the events of his youth. The 31 year-old version of himself lives in the up-til-now, sleepy village where life is dominated by the harvest, and three men - the Baron, the Pastor, and the village Doctor.The story opens when the Doctor, returning home, suffers a riding accident. But this is no ordinary riding accident. His horse trips over a wire deliberately strung between two trees. This incident marks the beginning of a year in which the village sees many more such mysterious and disturbing events. People and property are attacked, a man dies and before long, we have not one whodunit, but a whole collection. So who did do it? Was it the Baron's wife who suffers at the hands of her authoritarian and unsympathetic husband? Perhaps it was the Pastor's wife, who has to watch her husband beat and humiliate their children? Maybe it was the Midwife, the 40 year old neighbour, secretary, nanny and spurned lover to the Doctor? It could have been the children, fighting a war of attrition against their puritanical and domineering fathers. Or any one of a number of other villagers who have reason to carry a grudge. Who knows? That is one of the elements that make this film fascinating.Director and writer Michael Haneke ('Funny Games', 'Caché') builds a world where on the surface, everyone has reason to be a happy camper. The harvest is good, there is food for everyone. However, behind closed doors, characters are slowly revealed who we have plenty of reason to hate. The Baron, the Pastor and the Doctor rule their wives, their children and the village with an iron hand. Each in his own way is supremely selfish, controlling and brutal. The women have little opportunity to protect themselves or their children, and the children, brutalised by their fathers, have to find their own way to thrive.As a simple vengeance tale the film is excellent, but The White Ribbon also works on a whole other level. The film ends with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand (for younger readers, the event that precipitated the beginning of the First World War). This, together with the fact that while the children are named, all of the adult characters are only identified by their roles (Chaucer-style) creates a powerful metaphor. The implication is clear. People like these, in a place like this, were amongst those that fought the war and created the history of Germany. Despotic authoritarianism on the village scale was recreated on the world scale by history.Performances are excellent. In a cast made up largely of children, there aren't too many familiar faces. The only one I recognised is Pastor Burghart Klaussner as the Judge from 'The Reader'. The sixteen year old Maria-Victoria Dragus excels as the Pastor's eldest child and ringleader.Despite being in German, in black-and-white, long, somewhat slow and a bit about The War, I recommend it. Although I kept stopping to do other things, I made sure I didn't miss a word. It will never appeal to the mass market, but to those who do watch it, it offers a lot of food for thought. It's also worth watching just for the amazing line the Pastor throws his soon-to-be-ex lover as he dumps her - ""My God, why don't you just die?"". Wow! That's definitely up there with ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"".The White Ribbon was one of five contenders for the 2010 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Just to remind you, the other contenders were Ajami, A Prophet, The Secret of Their Eyes and The Milk of Sorrow. If you can only watch one, make it 'A Prophet', then this one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Marvellous,"I had heard many good critics about this movie and Haneke's works in general, so I expected a great masterpiece. Well, the truth is it was one...First of all, the cinematography and the narration put you in the cold climate of the film from the very first moment. Haneke's slow-paced direction was outstanding, while the whole cast (especially the kids and Burghart Klaußner) must be applauded.However, there is just one thing preventing me from adding this film in My Top 50 Films. And this is the lack of catharsis, or at least of the disclosure; Haneke should reveal who did all those crimes, even if he decided not to ""punish"" the culprits.Without a doubt, 'The White Ribbon' is a must-see film.

The root of evil,"The White Ribbon had been on my wish list for a long time, since it won the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. I had thought Haneke's films were mostly intense and violent, not at all a mainstream. But winning the Golden Globe Award gave me a feeling that this film should not be too difficult to watch. And it is really so, though the film is still intense and somewhat violent anyway.The White Ribbon depicts society in a German village before the outbreak of World War I, where a series of mysterious violent events happened. The village was still under feudal system and religion had strong influence. The higher class used their authority over the lower, not just in the society but also in their families. The lower had no right to argue. Could the mysterious violence be a result of the pressure on them?The White Ribbon is not as sadistic as Haneke's latter film 'Amour', and thus easier to watch. Perhaps also because it doesn't use lot of long still shots like Amour, and it's in a narrative story-telling style, so the audience do not feel so involved and so tortured. Both films are great, but in my taste I prefer Amour a bit more.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Haneke's greatest vision to date,"excerpt, full review at my location.Michael Haneke is a master of suspense - a director whose focus has lay solely on his power over his character and his audience. His past successes, of which there are many, have all probed a little deeper than the horror at their surface, and his name has been made not just by his signature direction but by his ambition also. The award-winning, Oscar- nominated White Ribbon showcases another string to his bow.Eichwald is one of cinema's most haunting locales, and the events there carried out between July 1913 and August 1914 (in Haneke's world at least) are some of the most thought provoking and chilling cinematics of the director's illustrious career. The talent on display from both cast and crew make this film not just a must see but Haneke's greatest vision to date.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Seeds of War,"While this isn't Haneke's best film (his 'glaciation trilogy' and ""Code Unknown"" are better cinematically, and are better examples of his personal directorial style), it is perhaps his most mature/restrained, since he doesn't resort to what, in his other work, may be seen by some as 'shock tactics' to get his point across. The use of a mystery plot as a way of exploring the characters' psyches and capacities for wrong-doing and self-denial is similar to what he did in ""Cache"", though the cinematography (which is outstanding in its starkness and formal composition), pacing and acting are more reminiscent of Bergman than any previous Haneke effort.",,Anonymous,History
puritanism,"It is likely that men who beat woman or children often end up with their children being bullies at school and beyond. The small protestant village can bring us puritanism and that beating as well and sometimes like, tough love, and there is little kindness. Although this is rather long it doesn't seem so because there is a mystery and it is beautifully shot especially outside in the snow and the children make it interesting. There is little mention of the war although at the beginning but we know that it is on the eve of World War 1 and towards the end we know what is coming. Michael Haneke doesn't have many light moments and even though we are thinking about the children we are also wondering about people and power and also about dictatorships.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Who did it? Who cares?,"Movie directors are no different to any other kind of artist. They have a view and they use film to show it. Great directors are usually thought of as being great because their view is broad and sheds a lot of light into the areas of human contact that are often hidden. The stories they tell emerge from the feelings of characters. There is no story in Waiting For Godot. It is about nothing other than what happens when the characters interact. The White Ribbon has no story apart from a peep behind the doors of people living in a small German village in 1914. One has sex with his daughter. Another hangs himself. Another sticks a pair of scissors into her father's pet canary. A woman dies in a work accident. A boy is beaten until he is blind. Another boy has his hands tied to the side of his bed when he sleeps to prevent a defiling of the flesh. And on. And on. And on. And all of it, in case you miss something, underscored with a narrator, who was himself a teacher in the village all those years ago. I read that the Austrian director of this movie makes a lot of these sorts of films and as a result, he wins loads of prizes in art house festivals. Art house being another term for small audience.

A masterpiece,"Director Michael Haneke's film 'The White Ribbon' is a brilliantly paced slow burn into the secrets of a small town somewhere in north Germany. Haneke also wrote the screenplay setting it just before 1914 and the run up to WWI. He shot his masterpiece in magnificent black and white, which places your imagination as close to this period of time as most would imagine. True to many of Haneke's recent films, we see the worst of human nature. Yet his ability to bring you so close to each character secures you to your seat motivating your internal desire to see how it all plays out.Strange things are set in motion inside this tight community when someone plants a trap causing the town's doctor to take a fall from his horse causing him serious injuries. His two kids lost their mother in a mysterious death 5 years earlier, which resulted in the town's midwife looking after the children as the doctor spends months in recovery in an out-of- town hospital.The spiritual leader of the community, a Protestant pastor is a strict, guilt-slinging father of 5 kids for which he provides severe punishment so they become 'pure' adults. You have the Baron and wife who are disliked by most as they employ about half the town. They too have dirty secrets. The Barons steward and his wife and kids struggle as he tries to keep his family in line.Adults start dying, children are tortured, yet no one can find the culprits. The story is narrated by the schoolteacher, a new town resident, who recalls the story years after the war to the best of his recollection.'The White Ribbon' won the Palm d'Or, the highest prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

Nothing is white around here...,"This movie achieved something where many other similar works exploring on the darkest sides of humanity failed to accomplish - choosing the right medium, mood and a right balance to demonstrate so powerfully the sick, unfathomable downfall of human nature.Shot in black-and-white, the medium was a perfect way of revealing features that helped focus the attention of the viewer to guess what truly was the beginning of all that is evil. But by spending too much time thinking about it, anyone will miss out the bigger picture, that is probably a small flaw in my opinion in that it leads the audience astray from the bigger truth.The movie knows not to reveal too much, for evil is not something that can be explained by any root or cause...it is manifested by all the repercussions and external influences making waves within the surrounding environment and to future generations.Even more so in a society where people are trapped within the limited knowledge of what they can immediately see and feel, under the absence of TV and internet to escape from the collective mental cage, and in a small village where even the darkest secrets are in no way easy to be hidden to everyones else including the children, this psychological collateral damage is amplified",9.0,Anonymous,History

Horrifying in its possibility,"Very lyrical use of black and white film, beautifully framed shots, and a stillness that first strikes the viewer as the peacefulness of a village, before gradually transforming into an unspoken dread of things that cannot be acknowledged or escaped. Like another film I reviewed, ""The White Ribbon"" investigates the negative repercussions in authority figures demanding nothing less than perfection and harmony from isolated individuals in an isolated community. In this film, however, the theme was more fully fleshed out, and shown from various character angles.

Haneke at his best,"Michael Haneke said in an interview for Le Monde that he intended to make a movie about the roots of evil. He said that he believed that the environment of extreme, punitive and sexually repressive Protestantism in Germany has laid the groundwork for Fascism and Nazism. He also said that he saw the same patterns developing in fundamentalist Muslim societies today, and that it is those societies that today were spawning terrorists and suicide bombers. He said he wanted ""The White Ribbon"" to be a movie against ALL extremisms.This is absolutely Haneke at his best. Stunning black and white film, with a real mystery that he leaves the audience to figure out for themselves. Throughout the film there is a sense of brooding and malevolence, personified in the children of the village (spookily played by one and all) who seem to be forces of evil. The events that take place in the village are never really explained, but that is the Hanneke experience, and serves to make the movie all the more thought-provoking.A fascinating movie on several levels, which will leave you wondering long after the final credits.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it is so difficult to bear""","Das weiße Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte - ""The White Ribbon, a German Children's Story"" – CATCH IT (A+)Das weiße Band is a German movie about almost 50 years old former teacher (presumably on verge of World War II), who is thinking about the strange events, happened in his village of Eichwald north of Germany just before World War I. To his believe the children in the village are the generation of Germans who became Nazis. The movie runs in flashback where former teacher tells about different series of incidents take place in the village of Eichwald. These incidents starts with A horse trips on a wire and throws the rider; a woman falls to her death through rotted planks; the local baron's son is beaten and hung upside down in a mill; parents slap and bully their children; a man is cruel to his long-suffering lover and sexually abuses his daughter. People disappear. The teacher, who courts a nanny in the baron's household, narrates the story and tries to investigate the connections among these accidents and crimes. What is foreshadowed? Are the children holy innocents? God may be in His heaven, but all is not right with the world; the center cannot hold. (IMDB) It won't be wrong to say that The White Ribbons is one of the creepiest movies of all times. This Black&White venture didn't rely on screams, graphics, blood or torture to create creepiest. The creepiest relies in the people and children living in the village. They are obscure and living duel lives in front of public and behind doors. There are many moments in the movie which will literally put audience in shock and disbelieve. Some of the most bizarre scenes have to confrontation about masturbation between Pastor and his young boy who is entering into adolescence. Later for vindictive divinity, every night as punishment he ties his eldest son's hands to prevent even the possibility of nocturnal masturbation. Then there is a widowed doctor who engages in unthinkable practices with his 14-year-old daughter. Besides that the beating the Baron's young kid and torture upon midwife's special child makes you squirm. Michael Haneke has directed a beautiful movie about complex subject matter. As one critic rightly said ""Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it is so difficult to bear"". All the children are truly the star of the movie. I have to mention these names who were absolutely incredible Christian Friedel as the school teacher , Leonie Benesch as Eva, nanny to the baron and baroness's twin babies , Ulrich Tukur as the baron, Ursina Lardi as the baroness, Marie-Louise Fion Mutert as Sigmund, their oldest son , Burghart Klaußner as the pastor, Steffi Kühnert as Anna, the pastor's wife, Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara, their oldest daughter, Leonard Proxauf as Martin, their oldest son, Roxane Duran as Anna, the doctor's daughter , Susanne Lothar as the midwife . The ending of the movie is ambiguous as the teacher himself doesn't know what happened to some of the people or who is behind the torturous events. But if you read between the lines and watch carefully you'll understand who can actually do that and Why? An Absolute Remarkable piece of Art, movies like A Separation and The White Ribbon makes me love foreign cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent!,"It's quite different from what is usually seen on screens. It's one of the films unique, original in everything. From the point of view of the subject, it's almost hermetically - everyone will understand as much as you can; the aesthetic, the film enchants you with poetic black and white, photography; directing: a masterpiece. And there's also the possible meanings that even if you can not catch on entirely, all you felt you mustiind in this film worthy of the Palme d'Or and learned that last year (2009) . The key to the logic of this film seems to be the film Das Weisse Band that also a parable be taken to refer to dark period of German history the two world wars. Ethics fanatical, extreme guilt and masochistic degeneration odious faces appear in this film. There are scenes of horrific abuse and outrageous verbal and physical cruelty here: but that without proper insist on showing their actual ... bloody images: everything is settled and finesse but also strongly represented in these respects intellectual . White Ribbon movie title, had to gauger children's innocence Germany. But it appears innocence lost and lead to atrocities and disasters of historic proportions. By demonetizing children and young people, due to slippages fatal mentality and morality of parents, this movie is in lineage ideation and Demons famous novel, Dostoevsky's. Michael Haneke maybe wanted to capture in this film as a parable, hideous psychology of fascism, or fanaticism in general, then the decay of a culture reached a point of self-sufficiency and superficiality seriously dehumanizing. Very interesting is the anthropological vision of the film, with rural customs and mentality specific prewar Germany.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Oh, yes...It's like that","Michael Haneke is still asking the same questions. The context, the people involved in the stories he tells, they don't matter; or at least not as much as what lies behind them. We can easily discover this if we try to read the script of ""The White Ribbon"", an original story by Haneke that is told, from the beginning, by the voice in off of a teacher. Eventually we learn that this teacher is a part of the story, but he doesn't even remember it well. We could imagine any other details if the images and the settings weren't the ones we see on screen and we were left only with the narrated dialogue.There's a small village, apparently normal and functional, when suddenly strange accidents begin to happen. That's all we need to know about the plot of Haneke's latest adventure: an adventure for him, to shoot, an adventure for the viewer to experience; a very particular adventure that doesn't have any element we might identify with the word 'adventure' in cinema. But it's always nice to remember that cinema itself is an adventure; and that comes before any genre definitions.With absolutely no music and with a beautiful, classic black and white cinematography (thank you Christian Berger, for providing a work that we don't need to detail in words because it's right there), Haneke deploys his cinematographic strategy. The strategy has to do, naturally, with the questions he's going to ask. What's important is that it is cinematographic. Viewers, critics, people in general have always been discussing the same thing: how filmmakers leave the viewer wondering, without being able to understand some things when a film is over. Why did this character do that? Why did that character say that? Why did the other one left that thing in that place?There are directors who have always offered more questions than answers, providing a way of filming and a depiction of characters that justify not knowing. I think the Richard Kelly of ""Donnie Darko"", or most of David Lynch. These authors not only talk about many things; they also try to distort life, the nature of things as we know them. I mean, they are the guys we shouldn't ask ""why did you put the red rose in that drawer?"" or those types of questions that they probably can't answer. The eternal discussion mentioned above also has to do with the fact that we can't pretend a director to control every decision and visual aspect of a film.However, and although this may not be true, Haneke always seems in control. This is related to the fact that the world he depicts can never make the viewer doubt what we call verisimilitude. The village in ""The White Ribbon"" is a possible place because its basic way of functioning and the people who make it function are the things that make any small village function, with a system that prevails in many places of the world today, whatever the technical development. There's a Baron (a landlord) and his wife, there's a Pastor and his wife, there's a Doctor and his family, there's a Farmer, there's a school and there's a Teacher. Yes, as I said and as it occurs with every story, things happen. But I leave the development for the viewer's enjoyment.Let me just say I admire ""The White Ribbon"" for several reasons, all which have to do with the same thing. If we think for a minute, Haneke is talking to us about the most basic things and feelings in life, those that come from the core of human relationships and kids can understand and explain in an early stage of their lives (it's not casual that many of the characters –some very important- in the film are little kids). But he does this with such rigor and command of the cinematographic language that everything acquires a new dimension.One can never question that ""The White Ribbon"" belongs to a high level of movies we tend to relate with art, or whatever...It's designed that way. And within that design, among the mysteries floating in every perfectly composed shot, we understand. The ending arrives and comprehension arrives with it in a magnified form; magnified by the experience of the (a) movie. Michael Haneke (whom I consider, as you may perceive, a very generous filmmaker) is still asking the same questions, never offering answers about a (our) world that sometimes finds its most complex representations entangled with what's most simple and pure.The questions this time around sound a bit more like assertions. Not definite statements but warnings. And I believe (or I would be contradicting myself and this review) that these warnings are also in the level of the basic things, and they are only a few, maybe one. Yes, of course we had our suspicions, but learning about it like this makes it resonant, powerful...Utterly unbearable.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Gran obra que refleja la realidad natural del hombre.,"O brilhante diretor (ainda mais bressoniano do que antes!) não tem pena do espectador, que é mergulhado numa aura de sadismo infantil crescente, numa atmosfera de crueldade metonimizada na fotografia em preto-e-branco com nuances graves e na completa ausência de música climática. Por mais que haja uma narração semi-condutiva, o roteiro plana pela austeridade punitiva de vários personagens. Ave, Haneke! (WPC>)",8.0,Anonymous,History
A very matured take on lessons of life.,"The time period of our lives when we are the most susceptible and the most vulnerable to lessons of morality, differences between good and evil, death and life is childhood. But, the society norms say that childhood should be protected from all these thoughts. The White Ribbon challenges these norms and says the right time to discuss these things openly is from a very tender age. Hence we see a detailed discussion about death between a 13 year old girl and a 6 year old boy, where the girl says 'I am going to die, even you are going to die someday'. The level of maturity shown is very commendable.The movie basically is about a pre-world war small town in Germany governed by a baron, pastor and a doctor who are powerful people holding moral and religious high grounds in the village. Some oddly weird things start happening which change the dynamics of the village and are felt mostly through the eyes of the village children. Narrated by the village school-teacher, the movie encompasses the life of several village families and more importantly the family children.The director has used black and white as a medium to tell the story and it is extremely effective. Another unique quality of the director is his non-dwelling in scenes. He doesn't want the audience to linger in a particular scene for too long. Thus, sequences happen thick and fast and sometimes, you may loose track of what was happening (Thank god for the rewind button). Nevertheless the movie rakes the issue of violence and it's effect on children and the issues of morality and how they should be handled pretty effectively.Rating : 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Another perfectly imperfect Haneke film,"10/10. ""Come and witness the violence inherent in the system!"" -- Monty Python.It took me a while to REALLY come around to Haneke's methods, and his complicated and unresolved endings, but for a while at least, more traditional movie endings might seem unsatisfying and contrived.Things that happen to me in life that I consider interesting are rarely, if ever, totally clear. They are interesting because I have to think about them, consider the outcomes of various possible actions, and weigh the costs and benefits. The usual outcome of this exercise is me shaking my head and wondering one of two things. 1) ""What just happened?"" Or, 2) ""This can only be the best possible solution because we are mercilessly punished for literally everything enjoyable in life."" This is how I feel at the end of Haneke movies.The ending of Burn After Reading, the excellent Cohen Brothers movie is also like this and portrays J. K. Simmons trying to make sense of the film's incomprehensible nonsense. I'll also give the Coen Brothers credit for pulling one of these non-endings off in No Country For Old Men, which was my favorite movie for a long, long time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Close to perfection,"The story of The White Ribbon is narrated by The School Teacher (Ernst Jacobi) of the village many years after the events took place. He states in the opening moments of the film, that much of the story is based on hearsay and speculation. He even concludes; ""a lot of it remains obscure to me even today."" Set in a small Protestant village to the north of Germany, in the year building up to the First World War, a series of mysterious events, accidents, and seeming torture, occur that begin with the local doctor (Rainer Bock) being throw off the back of a horse in suspicious circumstances. The occurrences escalate through the village, bringing with it accusations, and divide, in an already hierarchically structured ""society"".The tension builds throughout this masterfully structured narrative, with confidence of pace, and some beautifully composed black and white cinematography, by long time Haneke collaborator, Christian Berger. Haneke is a film maker at the top of his game. The intricate relationships throughout the village, the power struggles, and authoritarian menace, is perfectly acted by a strong cast.It's no crime to reveal that nothing is resolved in the film. But, like in life, other more terrible events happen outside of the surroundings you dwell in, beyond your usual environment (the people for example), that evaporate the issue from memory. And, like history, we can read this as a fable about authoritarianism, and it's effects on the people around it. As allegory of war, it shows the utter contempt for humanity is lost in those who have been victim to this dictatorial rein of fear. In this village, we are only exposed to the corporal punishment that is dealt on a daily basis, to the children of the village.

"Difficult to watch, but totally rewarding","This is not an easy film to watch, and not only because some of its themes and ideas get so far under one's skin that it becomes quite an uncomfortable viewing. It's a long, dreary, slow-paced film that places almost no emphasis on plot and instead focuses almost exclusively on characters and how they go about their lives and react to certain events that unfold over a relatively extended period of time, for a film at least. It is also in a foreign language that, no matter what, does tend to create even the slightest bit of alienation from non-native-speaking audiences. What I think is interesting is how Haneke exploits this alienation from the audience and takes it a step forward in order to further emphasize his point. The film is shot in stark black-and-white, which automatically alienates the audience because it makes us aware that we are watching a film – after all, the real world we live in is in color. In addition, Haneke has the film accompanied by a dreary, deadpan voice-over narration that, although spoken by a character in the film that experienced them firsthand, is alarmingly detached from the events depicted in the film. All of these elements serve to create an alienated and sterile environment, which serves as the launching point for Haneke's deeper themes.There have been numerous films made about the dark underbelly of a seemingly perfect and pastoral American life: films like Blue Velvet, The Ice Storm and American Beauty portray settings that seem to embody the perfect example of the American Dream and the pursuit of happiness, but these settings are revealed to have dark secrets and nothing is as pure and wonderful as it seems. Similarly, Haneke sets his film in a seemingly perfect environment: a picturesque small village in rural Germany, in which all the townsfolk are good Christians who do their jobs, go to Church and whom all know one another. And yet, as the film progresses, this village is struck by a series of tragedies, events that expose the darkness within all the town's characters. The good doctor who had an unfortunate accident with his horse turns out to not be a very good doctor at all – he verbally abuses his mistress and sexually molests his teenage daughter. The baron is a victim of numerous crimes, against his crops, his barn and eventually his son – but could he have deserved it? He seems to rule the entire town – everyone works for him and he controls everyone's fates with a wave of the hand, and if that's not the perfect embodiment of daunting totalitarianism, than what is? Even the good priest is seen to go to alarmingly extreme measures to educate and discipline his children. What is most notable about the film is that, unlike the film's American counterparts, Haneke's The White Ribbon is completely uninterested in plot. By the end of it, we never know for sure who committed the crimes that the townspeople find themselves subjected to. We hear multiple theories, but none of them are ever verified. Haneke places far more emphasis and importance on the characters and how they face these troubles; the fact that someone committed them is not as important as the fact that they transpired in the first place.Although it is a heavily allegorical and character-driven piece, another very important element that must be mentioned when discussing this film is a technical one: the cinematography. Some people were surprised this little-seen foreign film managed to nab a much-coveted Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography – but it whole-heartedly deserves it. The cinematography is nothing short of divine. Every frame is fastidiously staged, down to a T: the lighting, camera movement, composition and dynamics are pitch-perfect, and if there is one thing that must be said about the film is that it is absolutely stunningly beautiful to look at. The stark black-and-white photography lends it an air of otherworldliness; the lighting and delicate camera moves become almost ghost-like. It is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking films of 2009.As I mentioned earlier, it is not easy getting through this film. It progresses at a snail's pace, takes its time with every scene, is intentionally emotionally distant and requires a substantial intellectual investment from the viewer; but it also a tremendously rewarding film for those who do choose to make that investment. Haneke paints a harrowing portrait of a small and simple village that loses its innocence, so to speak, in the face of a rapidly changing Europe in the early 20th century. Secrets are revealed, dark secrets, and moral values are shaken to their foundations never to be the same again. But the worst part is that we witness the decline of the young generation, who represent the future – and it's not accidental that the film ends on the devastating news of the outbreak of World War I.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Back (once again) In The ""Bad Old Days"" (homage a'  R.W. Fassbinder)","Back in the 1970's,German film maker,Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed a film adaptation of the novel,'Effi Briest' that was in every way a 19th century costume drama that some found a meditation into the human condition,and others found a crashing bore (the film clocks in at nearly two and a half hours,is in German with English subtitles,and is very slowly paced). Flash forward thirty plus years later (2009),and Austrian film maker,Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher,Hidden)has gone and directed an absolutely glowing film dealing with events leading up to World War 1 (which,like Fassbinder's film,is nearly two & a half hours,mostly in German,and moves at a snails pace,which does not ruin the film one bit). That film is 'The White Ribbon' (known in Europe as 'Das Weisse Band-Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte'). The film takes place in an un-named village in north Germany in 1913. When the local doctor is injured in an accident that seems to be deliberately planned,it leads to a series of one unfortunate event after another. The events are narrated from the perspective of a newly arrived school teacher (played by Christian Friedel,with a voice over by an obviously aged teacher,in later years by Ernst Jacobi). The teacher (as his name is never mentioned)takes a fancy to a local young lass,Eva (played by Leonie Benesch),but knows her father will never consent to his proposal of marriage,due to the fact that Eva is much younger than he. Other events unfold in this beautifully photographed drama (by cinematographer Christian Berger) that proposes that certain events & attitudes were responsible for the onset of World War I,and the rise of Nationalism,which would eventually lead to the formation of the Fascist party in the early days just after World War I,throughout Europe (acts of sadistic violence toward ethnic groups & the handicapped were not out of the question). Michael Haneke writes & directs this quiet,but powerful drama that (potentially)points accusing fingers at those who were responsible for darker times that were to come (religion is cited as a major catalyst for the troubles---as embodied by Burghant Klaussner's brilliant portrayal of The Pastor,a cold hearted,loveless father of a cadre of children who channeled a ""Village Of The Damned"" vibe---truly creepy). Other figures weave in and out of this well played out drama,for thinking persons who crave more than Hollywood eye candy (and get it). Spoken in German,Polish,Italian & Latin with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some rather disturbing violence,muted sexual content & other adult content. Probably not a good choice for the little ones.",10.0,Anonymous,History

But yes, the Cinematography was good, its just the whole squinting factor when your trying to read the subtitles against snow, or fields of grain, is highly painful; so indeed, this is a hard film to watch.The characters literally are avoiding conflict!

This movie doesn't have a single second of entertainment.Then there are few characters. A pastor who is supposed to be emotionless person and he keeps on punishing his children for very silly reasons. And those punishments are not cruel but full of extreme foolishness.

The Origin Of Cruelty In Every Society.,"Carefully digging into the origin of what generally lets violence & cruelty seep into our society, The White Ribbon (also known as Das weiße Band) is an elegantly crafted, meticulously shot & patiently narrated drama from writer-director Michael Haneke that's thought-provoking, disturbing & riveting at the same time, and is presented in a manner that's destined to polarise its audience.Set in a fictional village of Germany, taking place just before the onset of First World War & narrated by the schoolteacher who once used to live there, the story of The White Ribbon concerns the suppressed children of the villagers who seem to be at the heart of a series of bizarre incidents, having the characteristics of a punishment ritual, occurring in their village.Written & directed by Michael Haneke, the film has an eerie, mysterious vibe to it from the very beginning and is sufficiently aided by its crisp, dark & greyscale photography. Performances are no doubt terrific but what's definitely going to test its viewers & is sure to leave them either absolutely fascinated or utterly frustrated is its painfully slow pace, uncertain conclusion & moral ambiguity.On an overall scale, The White Ribbon is a masterly controlled, skilfully directed & exquisitely performed art-house feature that captures the root of everything evil in a brutally honest manner & shows that people aren't born as sadists or monsters but are turned into one by the very individuals they put their faith in, and that the seeds of an inhuman society are planted a long time before it begins sprouting on the surface.",,Anonymous,History
"The White Ribbon (2009, R)","""The White Ribbon"" begins with a series of mysterious happenings in a small northern German village before World War I to provide insight on the broader history of Germany and the rise of fascism. The director (Michael Haneke) holds back just enough information to prevent viewers from jumping to conclusions, feeling resolved about the story, and moving on to something else. If you want answers, you have to connect the dots and read the signs. It isn't difficult, just look for the gang of little angelic-demonic faces marching around like the cast of ""Village of the Damned"". But the controversial part is trying to explain how they become how they are.The actors were chosen for their likeness to historical black and white photographs, and the film is presented in black and white (originally shot in color and then intentionally drained of color and modern elements later). The influence is a mixture of Ingmar Bergman black and white films and the mood of classic horror films. The camera slowly lingers on scenes. Most noticeably it pauses twice to merely let you listen to violent action that occurs off screen.The story is told by the town school teacher (Christian Friedel) as an older narrator reflecting on the strange events (narration by Ernst Jacobi). Although the events occur in temporal order, the movie cuts sharply between events. A series of tragic events occur and receive no outward resolution: a doctor on his horse trips over a line intentionally tied around two trees, a woman falls through a rotten floor after being assigned to lighter work, a baby becomes sick after a window is left open, and two young kids are taken and found ritualistically beaten. Along with these is a young proletariat man who feels the bubbling of dissent and rebellion. He blames the Baron (who employs half the town) for his poverty and strikes back on a cabbage garden. These are only the mysterious public happenings. More happens in private.The movie mixes benign acts of goodness and normalcy between the acts of horror, which all occur off camera as if the film itself adheres to secrecy like the culture it's observing. We know something is mysterious about the children. They start to act like a little collective, which amounts to every school age kid in the village, roaming around town together and appearing outside windows always with the excuse of being there to ""help"". The pastor's oldest daughter, Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus), seems to be the leader of the kids. It's best to begin with the assumption that the children are a parable for something like a nascent Hitler's Youth and future Nazism. Then try to figure out why they act the way they do. What would cause people to become susceptible to such a deadly ideological movement? This is where the film becomes most mysterious, and where answers vary the most. The kids have troubled family issues for one. The town doctor (Rainer Bock) molests his daughter and humiliates the midwife, who serves as his assistant and long time lover. The town pastor is an authoritarian purist. After his kids are late to diner, he makes them go to bed hungry and sentences them to 10 strikes each with a cane in front of their siblings. He forces his oldest kids to wear white ribbons around their arms to remind them of the value of innocence and purity (or, that is, publicly humiliate them in front of the rest of the town). He also makes his oldest son, Martin (Leonard Proxauf), bind his hands at night to prevent him from destroying his nerves (from masturbating, that is).Martin's reactions to his inquisitorial father are particularly compelling. The performances by the children are collectively subtle, patient, and psychologically convincing. Martin's face is pure anguish. We see him dangerously walk on the ledge of a bridge as a God-test. His test: if he doesn't lose his balance and avoids falling, then he knows God doesn't disapprove of his actions. Is he blaming himself for his father's extreme discipline? Is he a central perpetrator in the acts of violence?Another important theme is the public intrusion on private life. Doors are rarely locked and windows rarely closed. Such inappropriate behavior would instantly raise suspicions, and then you would have a gang of blond headed angels staring at you outside your window as if they wondered off the set of ""Village of the Damned"". They act like good neighbors to each other, but they also lurk around corners spying on each other (as Nietzsche liked to phrase it).The parents, especially the pastor, protect their honor and dignity by ignoring the truth of their children, and the children mimic this behavior. Just try to get the truth out of anyone in such an environment. Most of the mysterious acts of violence go unreported, except for the ramblings of a girl about her dreams. The only way to hint at the truth is to dream of it and pass along your dreams to a rare truth seeker, the local teacher, since only fraudulence is allowed in the public domain.If the narrative has any historical plausibility, then it must implicate our dark side as humans or as a society. Otherwise it would be impossible to generalize from the events that take place in a mere single rural town to a whole nation. Something about our typical responses to mordant themes in the movie – humiliation, intolerance, abuse, collectivization, invasion of privacy, and public fraudulence – cause the local children to become susceptible to violence for whatever purpose they might secretly have. Most of these causes always exist to some extent. The best thing about the movie is that we can ask the same questions about any culture, and we can wonder whether these causes are becoming prevalent enough around us to nurture terrorism or worse.",,Anonymous,History
Dark and Haunting,"A cold German drama set in 1913, The White Ribbon, directed by Michael Haneke, known for Funny Games, a sadistic thriller/black comedy, is a distinct change in course for the filmmaker. A man works as a school teacher and is engaged to be married to Eva, a nanny to twins whose father is a local baron.A strict Protestant minister runs the school with an iron hand. He holds confirmation classes and his children must wear white ribbons as a sign of purity and innocence. When his son admits to touching himself, he ties his hands to the bed posts.The widowed doctor is nice to the children, but treats his housekeeper badly and sleeps with his teen daughter at night; lots of drama at this strange village. Payback occurs when doc is riding his horse and it trips over a wire strung between two trees. More bad things happen. The farmer's wife falls through a rotted floor and her husband hangs himself as a result. A barn burns down. The Baron's wife tells her husband that she is in love with another man. The troubles continue until the end, with the start of World War I.The White Ribbon is shot in black and white, adding to the ominous tone, and at almost two and a half hours of nothing good happening to anyone; it is a marathon of agony. Haneke must have serious issues to produce something so dark. Be warned; do not watch this if you are having a bad day.",,Anonymous,History
Bergmanesque,"Many stimulating comments about the content and meaning of this film have already been made, so I will just note the homage that Haneke pays to Bergman with this film. The cinematography is exactly like Bergman's earlier work, with the harsh north European landscape (who knew the sun shone so much up there?) and the repressed emotions. Even the sound, where every footstep on a wooden floor, every door closing seems amplified, is like Bergman.The German is not as sing-song as the Swedish of Bergman's films but the characters are just as curt. The pastor is a clone of the dismal pastor in Winter Light (himself based on Bergman's father).Many commenters see the repression of these children as paving the way for Nazism and perhaps that is what Haneke intended. But German children were raised in similarly repressed fashion before and after this particular generation, so I'm not sure this is the full explanation.",,Anonymous,History
An engaging and meaningful film,"On my first viewing of The White Ribbon I appreciated the film very much, but it did not always connect with me or engage me. However, like I predicted, this is one of those films that demands a rewatch and if you know what sort of film it is, you will not be disappointed. This was a problem I had the first time I was watching it, I expected a more physically thrilling film I guess, and since it is a very slow film, I did not like it as much as I thought I would. But this is a film that demands your full attention throughout, and this time I certainly was engaged throughout with no dull moments.I have to start off by saying that the writing and directing by Haneke is certainly amazing. He is certainly a director of patience when he thinks his film needs it. What I think is most interesting of his film is the fact that there is so many characters (which I thought was the problem the first viewing but have come to realize that it's it's strongest aspect) and he gives so many of them importance that this is probably one of the best examples of an ensemble piece. Haneke is showing us the way the people in this village live and how their flawed actions are the cause of so much brutality and cruelty. Honestly, I am not comfortable saying that that is what Haneke is trying to show us. Most already know that Haneke intends to show how these type of children in this village are examples of their future Nazi roles, so say in a simpler way, but I feel that the film does not actually need to be explained in any way, which I think is why I love the ending so much- it gives no closure. We are always as clueless as the townspeople and we are never given any further insight as to who is committing the cruel acts. We are forced to experience what all of these villagers are experiencing, yet without any leads on anything. We see how the Pastor has a powerful sway over his children's' acts and what makes up their morality according to his own flawed beliefs, holding them up to higher standards only because they are his children. We glare at the way the Doctor so ruthlessly commits perverse sins, and how the Baron is dominated by anger and selfishness.Technically, the film is outstanding. The cinematography is brilliant and is the main factor that gives Haneke's film it's engaging but subtle atmosphere. The lack of music just creates more dread in ever scene and forces you not to look away. The acting is brilliant. The children's' performances are all great and are probably some of the finest child actors I have seen in any film. Ultimately, this film demands a 2nd viewing, and just like Antichrist and A Serious Man from 2009 as well, does improve significantly just because you dwelve into it's brilliant film-making more than you ever did in first viewing.",,Anonymous,History
