Still my favorite Batman movie but wait... let me tell you why!,"I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!'The original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince.Nowadays, many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.My opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.I just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Dark, funny and original. Not as good as the first film, but well worth watching.","There were a lot of things that were excellent about this movie, like the cinematography and the performances, though it isn't as good as the first film. Michael Keaten is suitably brooding as the Dark Knight, better than George Clooney in Batman and Robin (considered as the worst out the franchise)though he is overshadowed by the villains, namely Danny DeVito as the Penguin, who looked as though he was having a ball, and brought a sense of sadness and grotesquesness to the role. Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
darkest chapter,"Batmust returns is the darkest batman movie to date. With a scary villain, and sneaky hero/villain and the dark knight himself. The penguin brings a dark look to the character. Tim Burton success from the 1st batman brings the success of batman returns, a very good storyline with good actors bringing the characters to life. Burton dark and Gothic scenes gives Gotham the reign of terror look, makes you believe that batman is needed in Gotham. A film that was ahead of it time. The audience of 1992 wasn't ready for this, but as time as gone on the film has become more liked, maybe the downfall of batman forever and batman and robin, everyone seemed to realise then that this film was very good and should of kept Tim Burton as the director. Never the less a brilliant film and 100% must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"The best film in the Bat-franchise, by far...","As a life-long mega Bat-fan, I thought that Batman Returns did the best job (of all four films) of portraying the Dark Knight. Sure, the 1989's Batman was great, but it was lopsided; it might as well have been called ""Joker"" considering the focus of the film. Batman Returns allowed us a better look at Batman/Bruce Wayne himself, who was little more than an imposing supporting cast member in the first film; I loved Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance, but THIS fanboy wanted more of the Caped Crusader in the film. Batman Returns gave us that and more...we got Batman/Bruce character development, the AWESOME give-and-take between Batman and Catwoman (one of the strangest courtships in comics), and Burton even tossed us a little bit of fun, dark humor with Shreck and the Penguin. Everyone's performances maintained consistent characterizations that came across beautifully as both mad and tragic; Keaton was subtly psychotic, Pfeiffer was fatally seductive, Walken was deliciously megalomaniacal, and DeVito was unwaveringly grotesque. Everyone pulled off their characters with gusto and memorable appeal. Though not as dark and gritty as the first film, ""Returns"" captured the subtle madness that permeates Gotham City. When you compare ""Returns"" to the other Batman films, it is easy to see that it gives Batman's world the touch of underlying insanity (as only Burton can capture) that the first film lacked (where was the Joker's twisted sense of humor?) and the last two increasingly turned into the Three Stooges (""Chicks dig the car""!?!). Batman Returns excelled in that it was a dark, disturbingly insane portrait of Batman and Gotham City; a film that carefully balances on the fine line where and darkness and madness meet. For those movie lovers brave enough to try walking that line, I recommend this film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Gothic lunacy,"Bizarre second outing for the Dark Knight that goes overboard on the darkness, but remains highly entertaining. DeVito has way too much fun, and Pfeiffer's Catwoman remains the benchmark. This film forced the overcorrection of Batman Forever and disastrous Batman and Robin. Can't help but wonder what would have happened if Burton and Keaton continued the series. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A grandiose sequel with three splendid roles: the Bat, the Cat and the Penguin","A nice follow-up to blockbuster fantasy epic that renewed Hollywood's faith in media blitzing. Batman returns contains a lot of noisy action ,thrills, chills and dazzling production design. The caped crusader is back in Gotham City, where even the criminals are afraid to walk the streets alone. There's a new breed of criminals in Gotham City led the the sinister the Penguin. While Batman (Michael Keaton) deals with a deformed man calling himself the Penguin (Danny DeVito) wreaking havoc across Gotham with the help of a cruel businessman (Christopher Walken), a female employee (Michelle Pfeiffer) of the latter becomes the Catwoman with her own revenge. From the Sewers of Gotham, and New Villain Emerges. From the Rooftops of Gotham, the Purrrfect Enemy Comes to Life. And the Only One Who Can Save this City, is a Creature of the Night. While She Craves a Romance She can Sink Her Claws Into, He Plots a Fowl Reign of Destruction, Above Gotham, Looms Its Greatest Hero.This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie. Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming fights and traditional FX along with brief computer generator special effects. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film Batman (1989). The picture relies on terrific flying sequences, impressive struggles, black humor and breathtaking pursuits. More of the same from director Tim Burton with Batman more of a supporting role overshadowed by provocative villains. With Danny DeVito cruely misshapen Penguin who seeks to role over Gotham City. Michelle Pfeiffer is the dangerous and exotic Catwoman who has more than a passing personal interest in Batman and Christopher Walken in the maniacal tycoon Max Shreck. Keaton is surprisingly good as the dual personality hero though Pfeiffer steals the show, she fares best in her wickedly sexy character and second-skin costume completed with bullwhip.The motion picture was well directed by Tim Burton.

Good Batman Film Without Question,"Batman Returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films. Its predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre. For one to say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of Danny Devito as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The tale of Batman is suppose to be dark and Tim Burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Dark Christmas Knight,"Batman Returns is a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is wonderful. It's weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.What's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class couple throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary has a mental breakdown and dresses up in leather as a feline, and said grown-up mutant baby freak runs for political office while being backed by a Trump-like business tycoon hungry for more power. Not to mention the S&M subtext that Tim Burton somehow managed to get away with. His eccentric visual style fits this film best, and is the height of his career, IMO. This is Tim Burton at his Tim Burtoniest.This is a true live-action incarnation of the comic-book character and Burton really should have stayed with the series to keep it on the correct course before it crashed and burned. Batman Returns is not as grown-up and straight-faced as the Dark Knight, but it's more atmospheric, and I just prefer the oddball character development here and Nolan's movies took themselves very, VERY seriously, almost to a fault. They are often depressing to watch while Burton's approach, and the animated series that it inspired, continues to resonate and find new fans.Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is amazing as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realistically' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than the embarrassment of Anne Hathaway, who was simply appalling. Danny DeVito is so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes become a little disturbing to watch. Special mention must be made of Christopher Walken, who is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck if you think you recognize his Chip Shrek it's none other than Butterfinger from Hudson Hawk (fitting, as co-writer Daniel Waters is the man responsible for turning that movie from an adventure heist into an absurdist comedy).Sam Hamm returns to pen the screenplay, this time without being restricted (and sabotaged) by writers strike deadlines and it's a stronger film with a better assortment of characters, chemistry, and dialogue. He even manages to get in a subtle dig at the shortcomings of the rewritten 1989 screenplay by criticising Alfred for letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave - something Alfred would never do but was necessary for fixing structure problems.Danny Elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes define the Batman universe better than any other composer. No offense to Hans Zimmer, who made some wonderful stuff for Nolan's movies, but Elfman gave Batman a sonic aura that became world renowned and it will always be THE defining Batman sound. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Stick to the animated series and forget the following sequels. Christopher Nolan brought integrity back to the series, but before Schumacher destroyed it, Burton gave the original series integrity too and I miss this twisted fairy tale incarnation of the character.An essential Christmas film, and my favorite Batman adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Tim Burton's busy follow-up to Batman is ambitious and memorable, but is suffocated by Burton's unrestrained excess","33 years after being thrown in a sewer by his high society parents, Oswald Cobblepot aka The Penguin (Danny DeVito) has been raised by sewer penguins and now runs a gang of former circus performers called the Red Triangle Gang. Unscrupulous business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is pushing Gotham City to build a power plant which in actuality is a capacitor that will syphon off energy from Gotham. When Schreck's put-upon secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) discovers Schreck's plan, Schreck throws her off a building, but she survives and suffering a psychotic break takes on the alias of Catwoman intent on taking revenge on Schreck. The Penguin having amassed a collection of blackmail materials regarding Schreck orchestrates a plan to attain power and prestiege in Gotham with Schreck's help, and while most of Gotham is sold on the image of Penguin Schreck has helped sell, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is not and believes Penguin is connected to the Red Triangle Gang terrorizing Gotham. As Bruce investigates as Batman he crosses paths with Catwoman who unbeknownst to him is his love interest Selina Kyle.Following the smash success of 1989's Batman, Warner Bros. Was eager to get a sequel from the same creative team. Burton filmed the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Edward Scissorhands and was hesitant on doing a sequel to Batman, but Warner Bros. Enticed Burton back with more creative control than the first film. While original Batman screenwriter Sam Hamm had written an early draft involving The Penguin and Catwoman searching Gotham for hidden treasure, Burton hired Heathers screenwriter Daniel Waters having been impressed by his work. The movie was critically successful as well as commercially so but the box office was a significant sum less than the previous film making $150 million less. Audiences were also not as receptive to the film with a massive parental backlash against the violence and sexualization of Catwoman that resulted in McDonalds ending its Happy Meal promotional tie-in with the film. To this day Batman Returns is a divisive entry in the movie with some appreciating it's bold, dark and bitterly ironic leanings while others call it a shapeless mess of a movie with lack of focus or direction. For me Batman Returns is a mess, but it's an ambitious mess.Regardless of what your feelings are on the movie as a whole, Batman Returns isn't a rehash sequel. From it's Christmas setting to its freakshow antagonists seldom a moment goes by in Batman Returns without some kind of visually magnetic oddity or ""wait a minute, what!?"" moment that it's pretty much guaranteed you'll stay engaged in the film. The production design has some unique elements such as The Penguins abandoned Zoo hideout but Gotham feels a lot smaller and emptier this time around with most of the action set around Gotham Square where the city's Christmas tree is situated and the surrounding streets when we do see them are strangely empty. Despite the first film having half the budget of Returns, Gotham felt like a living breathing metropolis with lots of bustling activity and there's not all that much of that here. With that said, despite clearly being a set it's a very well dressed set and they get some solid if goofy usage from it.The story of Batman Returns is both weirdly engaging and pretty boring. Max Schreck is arguably the primary antagonist in this film and despite being played by Christopher Walken his plan of building a capacitor disguised as a power plant to syphon Gotham's power grid doesn't make much sense and it's pretty underwhelming. Danny DeVito is well cast as the Penguin and despite being under several layers of make-up and prosthetics DeVito is giving his all to the performance. Batman Returns is largely responsible for the impression of Penguin as a gross rotund freak in comparison to his original intention being a gangster who was a send-up of high society ""gentlemen"". There's very little of The Penguin's ""high society"" attitude on display with a minor subplot of Penguin running for mayor probably about as close as we get to it while the rest of the time Penguin runs around in a filth and sweat stained onesy snarling through black teeth like a mixture of a overgrown baby and a rabid beast. The Penguin is odd in this movie, the movie plays his story of abandonment for tragedy and pathos, and yet he's also a sneering perverted, sadist who we're supposed to root against leaving the character in this weird limbo where he's too pathetic to hate but he's also too hateful to be sympathetic. Selina Kyle/Catwoman is no longer a thief and is instead the mousey, overburdened secretary whose character type will serve as trope in several Superhero movies after this one. According to Daniel Waters ""Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary""...certainly big words for a guy whose script plays up the sexuality of Catwoman with emphasized Dominatrix BDSM overtones. If you're going to make a statement like that maybe don't do so while also approaching the character in a way that's only slightly less sexualized than when Frank Miller turned her into a literal prostitute in Batman: Year One.You've probably noticed I haven't spoken much about Batman in this review of Batman Returns. Well that's because Batman is pretty much a secondary character. In terms of importance placed on characters it probably goes The Penguin, Catwoman, Schreck, and then Bruce Wayne/Batman. Since Batman avenged his parents murder by killing Joker in the last movie, Burton clearly has no idea what to do with him so Batman just goes around doing what he does because it's what he's supposed to do. Most of the initial focus of the movie is on the freakshow antagonists (and Max Schreck) with Batman really only making borderline cameo appearances in the first hour. Eventually the movie does incorporate him some more with Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle starting a relationship with neither knowing the other is Batman or Catwoman respectively and it's a solid set-up for a conflict that the movie drags its heels in getting to. Batman Returns is a Batman movie made by someone who considers Batman the least interesting character in the film. Yes an action movie is only as good as it's villains, but that doesn't mean you scale back the hero to the barest possible minimum.Batman Returns has moments of brilliance in it and as a viewing experience with its twisted take on Christmas and macabre depressing imagery it's guaranteed you'll remember it. The movie's main antagonist of Max Schreck isn't interesting and the lack of Batman in place of focus on the villains is frusturating. But the performances by DeVito, Pfeiffer, and even Keaton despite reduced presence are still strong enough to make an engaging product. I can't say I liked it, but I will remember it and didn't hate it so do with that what you will.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Dark Knight Returns,"Out of all the Bat-films, Batman Returns is my favorite.  This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of Tim Burton's best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane envisioned many years ago.  Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman.  With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City.  Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve.  But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies.  It's got everything.  It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels.  If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today.  Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Good,"I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Dark -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin's story. They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The best of all the Batmans,"This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.I do not hesitate to say that ""Batman Returns"" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film.If nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A sequel,"The 1989 Batman film was seen as a gothic art-deco nightmare of a superhero movie. The sequel, released in 1992, is the picture that we believed we were seeing in 1989. The film was sold mostly on the strength of its scene-stealing villains and Michael Keaton's performance as Batman. The picture has been dubbed an atrocity by critics, who believe it threw Batman on film into an eight-year sleep. It was regarded as a gothic nightmare of a superhero film at the time of its debut.Bruce Wayne is caught up in a crazy jumble of egos in Batman Returns. Selina recognizes the pure cruel id that comes with enormous power but no true accountability. Bruce sees the horrific aspect of being abandoned and choosing an unrighteous path in the Penguin. Selina, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, is a one-of-a-kind interpretation of the character. Batman, as played by Michael Keaton, is essentially a reacting figure to the events of each scene. To the tune of a wonderful, undervalued, and dramatically relevant track, the film's conclusion comes to a head.Batman Returns is an odd, ambitious character study encased in the flimsy framework of a Tim Burton superhero film. It's difficult not to draw parallels between how Batman Returns and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice fared with the general public. The hero of Batman Returns is just as flawed, but he's permitted to acknowledge and be shocked by his own peculiarity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Awful,"One of the most anticipated movies in my life, and by far the biggest disappointment. It is hard to believe that Tim Burton directed both this and the original Batman. I went to see it with my brother on something like the second day it was released. The theater was jam packed, and there was a lot of chatting. When the advertisement stopped, and the movie started many people cheered. When they showed Michael Keaton for the first time, many more people cheered, it was pretty nuts. The excitement from the audience very slowly died down and at the end of the movie no-one clapped, no-one cheered, we just all cleared the full theater, most of us with dull looks on our faces.I think the worst part of the movie was the animal element. There were a bunch of bats, a bunch of cats, and a bunch of penguins. The character to take the animal mania the furthest was Catwoman. She licked herself clean, she purred, she crawled like a cat, and oh yeah, she had nine lives. Did we need any of this? Penguin in the comic books wasn't a penguin, he was a fat guy in a tuxedo. Catwoman wasn't a cat, and Batman wasn't a bat.Why must all good comic book movies have sequels that are so silly? We need more people who understand the comic books, and less people who have no problem with making them look real stupid. I'm glad that Burton stopped making Batman movies, but I'm afraid his successor did the same thing with HIS second Batman movie..",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A childhood favorite, and a misunderstood classic","Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video.here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with.penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole ""9 lives"" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and ""normal guy"" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world.I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of ""comic book"" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Much better than Batman (1989),"While Burton's first Batman film was unwatchable, boring, and just badly done, this one is much more entertaining and with better acting. There are of course ridiculous scenes you can laugh at, such as Selina (Pfeiffer) licking herself in a cat-like fashion.

"The makings, if not quite the results, of a campy classic","Batman Returns (1992)I've seen this version of Batman a few times now, over the years, and in many ways it's the best of them all, along with the companion 1989 ""Batman."" And in some key ways, both of these fall just short of quite gelling into classics.Here's why, both ways.First, remembering Batman as a comic book hero, Tim Burton's version of that world is wonderfully exaggerated and fanciful and actually comic. This is the biggest difference (in my humble view) with the Nolan films of the last decade. Where Burton sees a chance to be inventive and playful, Nolan sees a chance to make the unbelievable real.It's a relief that there is no reality to Burton's world. Sometimes you can tell the movie was shot on a set—and the same set, rather a lot—but that's again part of the ""world"" we are drawn into.Characters for Burton are about excess just beyond camp. The Penguin is pretty amazing—Danny DeVito pulls it off like no one else could, an equal to Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's earlier Batman flick. And Catwoman as played by Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Batman himself might be a matter of taste—many people prefer Michael Keaton but I find him dull. And in this movie, he mostly stands around as Bruce Wayne and drives around as Batman. Not much physicality here.Christopher Walken? He starts off being weird and wonderful and then kind of keeps that steady state attitude throughout (even as his world is in constant tumult). It works, but it's not perfect. In fact that's what happens a lot of the time. Some of the ""action"" sequences aren't as elegantly edited (or shot) as other similar films (especially Nolan's) and so there is energy but not necessarily a visceral involvement. (You have to be thinking about this while watching it, I suppose.)But it's Burton's idea of Gotham, and his development of characters, that makes the movie really special. Whatever its limitations, it has so much that goes beyond expectations—and beyond the somber grandiosity of the Nolan versions—you really need to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A decent follow-up but no match for the first movie,"""Batman Returns"" brought Tim Burton back to the Batman franchise after 1989's incredibly successful first outing. The movie proved to be a financial success but opinion is divided on whether or not the movie lived up to its now iconic predecessor.This time around, Batman (Michael Keaton) faces off against a pair of his longtime nemeses - the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Plot-wise, the Penguin teams up with a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) in order to essentially take control of Gotham City. Catwoman, meanwhile, has her own reasons for getting in on the action.I find that ""Batman Returns"" has a more pronounced Tim Burton feel than ""Batman"", which isn't surprising considering that he was given more creative control. Whether that's a good or a bad thing for the movie is subject to debate. Personally, I find that this is where the franchise started gravitating towards the cartoonish aspects of the character's universe, which would only get worse with the poorly regarded third & fourth films.The cast is pretty decent but it's tough to fill the hole left by Jack Nicholson. Nevertheless, Danny DeVito is effective as the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is alluring as the leather-clad Catwoman. Christoper Walken, meanwhile, supplies a typically Christopher Walken-esque performance as only he can. Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks of introducing all of these characters is that Batman himself is noticeably absent for most of the beginning of the movie.Burton's direction is solid as always but the visuals just seem to lack something in comparison to the first film. Perhaps it's the Christmas setting or maybe it's just that the production design in general isn't as ominous. At least they were able to get Danny Elfman back to handle the music again.Ultimately, I think that ""Batman Returns"" is a decent follow-up but no match for the first movie. Saying that it's better than ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"" doesn't count for much but I would say that it's a reasonably entertaining superhero movie, all things considered. It's just that, with the glut of superhero movies in recent years, it's no longer particularly remarkable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A sequel worthy of an excellent movie!,"Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying!Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?You'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin ""Meow"" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You'll have a blast! Trust me!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Not quite a classic, but undeniably good","The main reason that Batman Returns ranks below its famous predecessor is that it fails to stand on its own. Consider The Dark Knight compared to Batman Begins. The Dark Knight stands on its own. Tim Burton's Batman Returns is definitely a very good movie, but it fails to stand on its own, expand the Batman mythos, or develop the characters.There's still a lot to like in this movie. The three Batman villains have very magnetic performances: Christopher Walken as Shreck, Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. All of them really steal their scenes. Tim Burton's inspiration in the set and costume design is always superb, and he brings his quirky charm to this dark yet campy Batman universe. It's the right blend of fun and tension.The pacing of the movie is a little off, some dialogue corny, some of the innuendos a little uncomfortable, but this film rises above all that with great performances, great action, a fantastic score, memorable characters, and a great Batman movie. If you like Batman (1989), this is a good follow-up that doesn't quite match the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman.","One of the darker films ever made. It is one of my personal favorite Batman movies. Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman. Danny DeVito gave a brilliant performance as The Penguin. The only two good things in this movie are return of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Danny DeVito as The Penguin. I thought classic original Batman (1989) was way better film than this. Batman Returns is my second favorite Batman film in the franchise. The film has a many problems in here I didn't like and it annoys me, but there are other things I did like and love in the second installment.Things I don't like in this film: Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman she was extremely violent woman. I still couldn't believe how could an grown aged woman act like a child, trying to be an animal and than she just rip off a harmless pet rubber animals stuff them in a sinker , destroying a doll house, spraying a t-shirt and than acting that she is the queen in this movie? She wasn't written and portrayed by the comic books like was Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. Selina Kyle was never a secretary like she was in Shreck Company, she wasn't a vigilante, violent or angry woman. She was a cat burglar and a thief. She didn't went around cutting people like she did in this film, she only did what was necessary to do for survival. That is the main problem in this film. I still prefer and think Kim Basinger is much better better actress than Michelle Pfeifer is and I still love Vicky Vale much better than Selina Kyle. Sorry Bat fans. I wish there wouldn't be Max Shreck in this film because he look's like a selfish lunatic person. Those are the main problems I don't like in this film, that is why this movie is not better than his superior predecessor.Things I do like in this film:The Action sequences are outstanding and awesome and Fight sequences are fantastic. The first fight between Batman and Catwoman is awesome. The film is very dark which I love that in the film. Michael Keaton reprise his role back as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It is my childhood film and I will always watch it. It was a big hit in 1992 when the film come out, there were different times then, than they are today. The story centers around Christmas Eve. The Penguin, releases several bats that fly frantically around the girl's (Ice Princess) head, causing her to lose her balance and fall, but giving the impression that Batman, visible to the crowd below, had pushed her. She lands on the tree switch, lighting it up and unleashing a flurry of bats that the Penguin had hidden within the branches. Batman attempts to flee. I love that Batman flees in this film around Bats flying the crowd. It shows his symbol stands for Bat which he is a Batman. He also try to save that girl when she was kidnapped but couldn't. The Penquin and Catwoman becomes alley and they set up Batman to be a criminal. I love how The Penguin had placed a control device under the car that let he himself steer it from an arcade-style car hidden in a trailer. Batman, helpless, is trapped behind the wheel of the Batmobile as it veers through the streets, knocking over city property and frightening citizens. Batman manages to remove the control device before anyone is killed, and returns home. That is the best awesome scene I have seen. Batskiboat using in this film that batman drives on the sewer was FANTASTIC! Beside Batmobil there was other vehicle used in this film. Batman saving all the children from Penquin was also awesome. Batman was a real hero in this film. There was no Robin in here. Which I am happy about it. Batman does not need any sidekick to help him out. I hate Robin, don't get me wrong I don't like that character and I never did.Michael Keaton Is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman his acting performance to me in both Burton films is better than Christian Bale is. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne was a clearly uncomfortable man, a mumbling solitary eccentric, ill at ease in his own skin and with other people. In the Batsuit, though, he becomes the beast he really is, an imposing personification of vengeance and fear, despite his slighter frame. There's something far more sympathetic about Keaton's Bruce Wayne. Maybe it's because he was never recorded throwing a wobbler on set. Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing the second Batman film. I love the costume designer by Bo Welch for Catwoman, Batman and Penquin. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design. I think those three actors Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeifer did a great character chemistry and good acting performance. CGI was also not bad for the bats I real love it. I love this film not as much as I love The Dark Knight and Batman but I still love it.The rating I give to this film is 10/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"We're the same.-Split, right down the centre. Don't you see? We're the same.","Many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. That is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. It was winter, here in Australia 1992 when I had seen Batman Returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. Both ""me's"". I was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first film maker to say its OK for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. Comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? You snap. Somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. The only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. He is their Saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains ""the only lonely man beast in town"". Bruce Wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile Max Shreck. The Penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.This movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot.The film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle , Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. That is until we finally snap. Only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman rise towards the night sky. But come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. As for me , I cant say that I will reach a point where I will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. But thats OK. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of the Batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A film mostly about Tim Burton and Danny Elfman,"Batman Returns came at a time when Tim Burton and Danny Elfman had become a superstar team and forgot what landed them there. Whereas films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice had lots of over-the-top set pieces, surreal themes and bounding music, they also had a lot of good heart, charm, fresh ideas and fun storylines.Batman Returns is pure style over substance, and the style isn't even pleasant to look at or listen to. It's dirty, gritty and alienating. None of Batman's gadgets or action scenes feel exciting, inventive or original, and yet they're presented as if they were. You often feel like you're missing something, but no, there just isn't much there once you strip away the surrealist style and bombastic sounds.In contrast to Nicholsan's Joker, there's zero charisma in DeVito's Penguin nor Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman. And in the latter's case, her looks, which are covered up most of the time, can't save her.Speaking of sound, Danny Elfman shows zero restraint and just can't help but cram his bombastic soundtrack into your ears even when nothing on the screen warrants it. It quickly wears you out and you occasionally feel the need to cover your ears just to get a break from it. The opening score is suitably epic and memorable, and that's not the problem. It's in the music score throughout the rest. Every single little thing elicits these overly loud baritone romps that stop being a soundtrack and instead become rather obvious attempts to make the audience pay attention to the soundtrack more than the film itself. At least in the first Batman, Elfman's score gets a break during Prince's music tracks. Not so, here. It's non-stop and over-saturated, and your ears will beg for it to stop.While Burton and Elfman are trying to one-up each other - Burton with visual style and Elfman with music - Burton forgot he was actually supposed to tell a story and have compelling characters. His self-indulgence tanks the entire film. It doesn't work as an action film and it doesn't work as a stylistic film. It just sucks. And because it's so loud, you can't just close your eyes and tune it out to feel like you got your money's worth. It won't let you.I worked at a movie theater when Batman Returns was in theaters, and the very best part of it is the song Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees which plays during the closing credits. It's the only time in the whole experience of this movie you don't feel like it's trying to blast you out of the theater with its visuals and obnoxious soundtrack. I remember people exiting the theater looking tired and disoriented, feeling like they were supposed to like what they just watched, but confused about why they didn't.Batman Returns was a box office success, but critical viewers knew it was not a great film and you can only make so many of those before the audience will turn on you. I don't think Burton made another film that truly follows up his earlier work until Big Fish in 2003. Burton and Elfman are the classic example of great talents that need a steady and restraining hand for them to perform at their best.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A thrill ride from start to finish,"Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. BATMAN RETURNS however, does so with gusto. The sequel to 1989's BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS neither milks the success of the first movie nor totally disregards it; it's a wonderful sequel and a spectacular movie in its own right. There's something for everyone in this movie - humor, high drama, plenty of action, and lots of cool things to look at. Of course, viewers have to get around Tim Burton's morbid and sometimes offensive sense of humor, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem in this era of SOUTH PARK and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. While the movie has many great moments, it also has its flaws. The plot seems rushed, stitched together. Danny DeVito tries his best as the Penguin but doesn't quite pull it off. Christopher Walken appears as a secondary bad guy, but his performance is lackluster compared to the others. And many of the action sequences, though breathtaking, seemed forced and are occasionally absurd. All that aside, there's all kinds of surprises in this movie - smart humor and dialogue, characters you can't help but love, lots of satire (Homer's Iliad, CITIZEN KANE, and the American political scene are all lampooned), and many memorable scenes that only serve as a testament to Burton's colorful imagination. I hope to get this movie on DVD, where I can enjoy it on my big screen TV in all its glory. Not exactly the best Batman film ever, but still a fascinating movie to watch over and over again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Entertaining,"Batman Returns is much more in line with Burton's trademark style than the original Batman was, and perhaps that's because the studio may have lightened up a bit on him after the massive success of the first one. I may never know the reason, but this one is different than the predecessor.Of course, the work the cast puts in determines the overall tone of the film, and this one has a few new characters - most notably Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito - who added something a little different that wasn't there before. DeVito plays The Penguin/creepy sexual predator, and Christoper Walken plays the holier-than-thou philanthropist who convinces an entire town of his kind actions while blinding them to the nasty realities. Those two characters bring about a much darker film, but it also gives characters that have even more depth than Nicholson's Joker.The big question that is relevant to the film, however is: Is it good? The answer is yes, but it's not as good as the original Batman. DeVito really does a terrific job as The Penguin, and he sells his character pretty well. Of course, even under all the makeup, it's impossible to see him as anyone but Danny DeVito, but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone else as devoted to that role as he was. And he clearly enjoyed doing it a lot. The Penguin character, according to Burton, was the major issue the studio had with the film. The darkness, coupled with the effects of the character toward the end of the film, made it difficult to market him in a McDonalds Happy Meal, so Tim had to deal with a lot of back and forth to get this movie made.Once again, we have the brilliant Danny Elfman doing the score, taking the work he did on the original and expanding upon it, doing a fantastic job as always. The film benefitted greatly from his work.Batman Returns doesn't equal the quality and entertainment value of the original, but it does offer a fun and entertaining experience that's well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Still a Great Film,"When a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) and the grotesque Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take control of Gotham City, only Batman (Michael Keaton) can stop them, while the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) has her own agenda.First of all, this cast is amazing. Setting aside the supporting actors (including the great Paul Reubens), the four key roles make this an instant classic for any movie fan, regardless of their love of Batman.But also, I think Tim Burton ""got"" Batman in a way no other director has. Christopher Nolan's films may be the best from a critical standpoint, but Burton's are best at visually blending the comics and reality. His world is dark, but still fun. Nolan's Gotham is a hopeless land.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Dark and Misunderstood Masterpiece,"Who in Hollywood is more misunderstood than Tim Burton? Well, no one. The Batman films over the years have been plagued by one and only one thing...no, not Joel Schumacher...they are called Studio Heads. But enough of that. The fact is, this movie was not advertised, nor made to be a fan friendly or even kid friendly movie. After the success of ""Batman"", a sequel was inevitable. In order to lure Burton back into directing, the ""Powers that Be"" told Burton that it could be an ""all Burton film"". This is very rare for a director to get in these money grabbing days. With all the politics and misunderstandings of the finished product aside, the film ""Batman Returns"" provides a dark, intense, and very exciting interpretation of ""Batman"" on screen. ""Returns"" shows us three characters, which all have dual identities. One is a creature of the night, stopping ruthless and petty criminals in every alley way and rooftop, and is also a tortured billionaire industrialist with the guilt of is parents death haunting him. There is also a purrr-fect enemy, draped in skin tight vinyl and carries a whip, with vengeance on the mind, and was once a push over secretary who was obviously pushed over one too many times. Finally there is the Penguin, a freakish and vile figure who was abandoned by his parents and now wishes for the respect that has avoided him all his life, and as Oswald Cobblepot, he gains the respect of the city in order to become its mayor. With these three characters, all you can get is an epic Tim Burton masterpiece, and that is what it became.After discovering their first born as a freakishly deformed monster, the Cobblepots decide to rid themselves of this black sheep. Almost thirty years later, the lost Cobblepot son has become the Penguin man in the sewer, who has become just as much a myth in Gotham City as the legend of Big Foot. After the Tree lighting ceremony in Gotham only weeks before Christmas, all hell breaks loose. Within one night, the evil industrialist Max Schrek (Christopher Walken) is kidnapped by the Penguin (Danny DeVito), and blackmailed into helping him re-emerge into Gotham society to finally earn the respect that he so thirsts after. Following this, Shreck drops his nobody assistant, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), out of his department store window after she discovers his Power Plant operation is just a scheme to suck what's left of power out of the city. Little does Shreck know, this nobody assistant survived, and is going to turn the tables on him ten fold as Catwoman, donning the skin tight vinyl black outfit and cracking a dangerously long whip. As Shreck helps the Penguin become Gotham's new golden boy, Oswald Cobblepot, he also uses Oswald to challenge the Mayor (Michael Murphy) into a recall election. If this happens, Shrek's Power Plant is secured. Now it is up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop these three super-villains from carrying out there plans. It is just a question now to whether Bruce will be able to balance his love for Selina and his duty as Batman to bring her, Oswald, and Shreck to justice.The movie's performances, special effects, costumes, amazing sets, and of course make-up design make this movie great. Michael Keaton returns (Forgive the pun) as the dark knight. Keaton gave us a dark complexity to the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne in Batman 1, and he carries that into this film, but in a much different way. His complexity in this film has more to do with his lack of a real life. In the first time we see him in the movie, he is sitting down in his study, doing absolutely nothing, until the Bat signal shines through his home, in which he then, through his eyes and body movement, comes to life. Through his attraction to Selina, he is naturally hoping for he and his equal to possibly have more of a ""happy ending"" to their story. Michelle Pfeiffer is actually, in my opinion, more unrecognizable than Danny DeVito. I say this only because in the beginning, we are introduced to this bumbling and oblivious secretary, and then she becomes a determined, sexy, and very aggressive creature of the night. Pfeiffer's brilliance in her dual roles, her body language, her change in voice, and overall sex appeal make this Catwoman probably the best ever seen projected from the comic book legend. The scene where Bruce and Selina are the only ones not wearing costumes at the costume ball, with the haunting song ""Face to Face"" echoing in the background, is truly brilliant. Now for Danny DeVito. This is probably my absolute favorite Danny DeVito performance. While his make-up says enough, its DeVito chewing through the make-up, the scenery, and most of the other actors to get his portrayal of the tortured, deformed, vile, and ingenious villain that is the Penguin, off. In many ways, he can make you feel sorry for him, and in other ways, he can make you loathe and detest his very existence. A true comic-book/movie villain through and through. Finally for the great Christopher Walken. Walken was cast as a character that does not appear in the Batman comic-book universe. He is described as a rich, handsome, but diabolical businessman, who will suck the life out of anything he touches (much like a vampire, in which the actor Max Schreck in real life portrayed the vampire in the famous film ""Nosferatu""). Shreck in many ways is the personification of Gotham City, as he says ""I' am the light of this city. And I' am its mean, twisted soul."" Walken, in a sense, is more horrific than the Penguin. Shreck on the outside is a wealthy and respectable man, while on the inside, is more a horrific beast than the Penguin could ever be. An amazing and operatic Tim Burton masterpiece all the way though.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A Bit Too Dark, Gloomy and Bizarre","Born so deformed that even his parents don't want him, a young baby is hurled into the sewers of Gotham City in the hope that he will die. But, incredibly enough, he is taken in by some penguins who live right there in the sewers and grows up into a repulsive creature known as ""the Penguin"" (Danny DeVito). And his first action is to kidnap the wealthiest man in Gotham City by the name of ""Max Shreck"" (Christopher Walken) and blackmail him into helping him rediscover his roots--or at least that's what he wants people to believe. But Max isn't the type who is easily controlled and instead attempts to manipulate him for his own evil schemes instead. At the same time Max Shreck's secretary ""Selena Kyle"" (Michelle Pfeiffer) happens to stumble upon a secret file that Max has which details an illegal scheme he is planning and she ends up being thrown out of a skyscraper to her apparent death. But she is somehow revived by some stray cats and having now gone totally insane decides to take her revenge upon Max as a costumed villainess called ""the Catwoman"". Needless to say, Gotham City isn't big enough for 3 such villains and it's up to ""Batman"" (Michael Keaton) to somehow save Gotham City from all of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that a dark and gloomy atmosphere is almost a prerequisite for a ""Batman movie"". However, this film probably went a bit too far in that department-and it got even more dark and gloomy the further on it went. Additionally, I didn't especially care for the rather bizarre ending either. Those issues aside, I thought all of the actors just mentioned performed credibly enough with Danny DeVito probably standing out the most in my opinion. Likewise, although I still believe Julie Newmar was the best actress to ever be cast as ""Catwoman"", I must admit that Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't too bad. But that's just my opinion. In any case, given all of the previously mentioned good and bad points I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Has bettered with Time,"Having watched Batman Begins for a second time two nights ago and coming to the conclusion that I'd overrated it, I thought I'd bring out Tim Burton's much debated Batman Returns. Although Batman 89 remains my favourite over the entire franchise (old and new) I'd never really appreciated just how facile the second instalment was.I'd always liked Returns as a child simply because it was a Batman film. I'd never understood or appreciated the intelligence and artistic style of how it was put together. The entire film is resembles a sad poem. The characters always craved something more than they had but were always cursed never to find retribution.Tim Burton has received plenty of criticism via the use of hindsight for never having explored the true character of Bruce Wayne. I think, perhaps, that is something that works in his favour. Burton's Wayne is an enigma, someone we just can't understand and at all and Michael Keaton pulls this off splendidly. We can see in Keaton's face that there is always a deep rooted pain in every menial action he makes. It is an absolute pity that Burton wasn't allowed to do a 3rd Batman film because that could have made something really special. I'd hazard a guess and say that it would have been a film primarily about Batman, and his battle with his inner demons and origin, thus making the perfect trilogy. Needless to say Warner Brothers felt the need to mess with something that was working.The Catwoman is a divine character. It is typical Tim Burton in the scene where she is pushed from the window and her origin is put into place. Unlike Selina Kyle, Catwoman is sexually heightened, confident and mysterious. She is everything Selina wants to be. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is wonderful. It is no wonder that we believe Batman to have fallen for her, she almost mirrors him as a character and he says so at the final confrontation ""We're the same. Split, right down the centre."" Danny DeVito also pulls of an Oscar winning performance as the disgusting and rejected Penguin. Underneath his ambitious self, he is merely a horny teenager wanting to experience a little bit of human life. That is why his story is so compelling and we are almost moved to see him die. If you compare this with Schumacher's Two Face then it makes for a much more interesting villain. Max Shreck was perhaps the face of true evil in this film and he eventually gets his comeuppance. I do enjoy the fact that Batman sees right through Shreck but does nothing. Had any other director had this film then I am sure they would have opted for a confrontation once Bruce had discovered the truth.The movie, altogether I think, is an intelligent dark comedy. As someone has previously mentioned in these reviews it really isn't what you would expect of a Batman film. If you want a version that stays faithful the original idea and is so suave then Begins is the answer. If you are after something a little discrepant then look no further than Tim Burton's versions. For the love of God stay away from the last two catastrophe's. Me, well I appreciate both Begins and Burton's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Everyone knows the story: the Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) battles the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), while Christopher Walken plays the corrupt Max Schreck.Maybe this movie has no real artistic value, but it's still pretty good.

A Tragically Underrated Gem,"Though it may be to weird and dark for some peoples taste Batman Returns holds up remarkably in an era were superhero movies continue to push boundaries, the more comicbooky and fantastical elements wouldn't be touch in todays era which adds to this films uniqueness and helps it stand out, the atmosphere more gothic and cinematic than the first and though this film has more villains it manages to focus more on Michael Keaton's batman giving him an emotional arc in the form of his relationship with Catwoman played phenomenally by Michelle Pfeiffer in one of the greatest batman villain portals of all time (topped only by Heath Ledgers Joker in The Dark Knight) who manages to be extremely captivating whether extremely unsettling or tragically sympathetic, there relationship is the heart of the film and is by far the strongest batman movie relationship (not that there's much competition) as they try to balance there human desires with there darker personas, rounding out the core trio of this film is Danny DeVito's Penguin who is generally terrifying and though comicbook purists make scoff at this very literal portrayal it is unquestionably a great performance and fits the tone and atmosphere of the film quite well even if not all aspects of it hold up.Bring together this film is Tim Burton's superb direction which brings a unique gothic flair truly making Gotham a world of it's own with every shot oozing with style, the Christmas setting also helps as the snow provides a different look for a batman movie and gives it a special feel to it similar to what you get with a special episode of a TV show, as well as Danny Elfman's score which some how manages to top his score for Batman 89 and which elevates each scenes impact tenfold. I could talk about this movie forever but somehow I don't think you'll want that so I'll just say this if you haven't watched Batman Returns because you didn't like Batman 89 or you think it looks to silly or you watched it back when it came out and you weren't a fan I would strongly encourage you to watch it, as someone who's 17 and wasn't even born when this film came out I can tell you, it holds up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Like Batman, I'm dichotimatically torn...","...by Batman Returns.  On the one hand, there's a good story here (Bruce Wayne sympthasizing with both the Penguin and Catwoman, and even Schreck's concern for his son gives him a sympathetic moment or two), an interesting Biblical motif, some good fight sequences which help to maintain the image of Michael Keaton as the Batman, and some generally interesting elements throughout.On the other hand, Keaton seems to think he's in a comedy movie, playing almost all of his Wayne sequences for laughs.  He was blown off the screen by Nicholson's performance in the first movie:  this time around he's blown off the screen by three less-powerful actors/actresses overacting in concert.And _oh_ do they overact.  When Christopher Walken is the most subdued bad guy in any movie, you know you're in trouble.  The Penguin isn't so much Dickensian as disgusting as he eats raw fish, bleeds black, and bites off noses.  Pfeiffer goes too overly humorous as Kyle, too overly aggressive as Catwoman.  These are the comic book characters reinterpreted and stripped down to their _very_ basic elements.  I don't mind that they're different from their comic book counterparts, but they're (ironically) much more two-dimensional than their four-color equivalents.Meanwhile, with Keaton struggling against his overacting villainous counterparts, everyone else gets short shrift.  Michael Gough is the only other character to remain at all noticeable.  Gordon and Chip Schreck are mildly memorable, but can you really picture anyone else in this movie a day after you've watched it (except for SNL actress Jan Hooks, and maybe the memorably icy Poodle Lady)?  There's really just too much going on here, ending with a big penguin missle-launching blowout.The second in the franchise, BR remains somewhat entertaining.  But it's big, flashy throw-everything-we've-got-and-hope-it- sticks approach is a predecessor to the Schumacher ""epics"" that are to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Definite Improvement Over Its Predecessor,"A definite improvement over its predecessor, Tim Burton's Batman Returns offers welcome upgrades in several aspects to deliver a darker, stronger & better sequel that digs into its characters' emotional trauma in truly fascinating ways, and is all the more uplifted by its operatic set pieces, smart camerawork, chilling ambience & haunting score.The film this time pits Batman against Penguin & Catwoman but the tragic angle the story takes to progress their arcs is what makes the trio and their interactions so compelling. Its over-the-top action hasn't aged well but the drama still retains its freshness & gripping quality. While it still feels like a product of its time it is at least more entertaining.Although the refined set pieces, sharp imagery, eerie tone & splendid score uplift the look n feel of the whole picture, performances are this time its strongest suit. Michael Keaton is more comfortable as Bruce Wayne, Danny DeVito is fantastic as Penguin but it's Michelle Pfeiffer who steals the show with her sultry rendition of Catwoman. It's a deftly layered act from all three.Overall, Batman Returns is better than Batman in more ways than one and it also appears less dated, thanks to the toned down goofiness. When it comes to action, it is as uninteresting as it was in the previous entry. However, its dramatic depth & emotional beats resonate more strongly this time around, thus making it a worthy successor to the original. If not for anything, watch it for Pfeiffer.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"""Dear Penguin. The children regret they are unable to attend - Batman.""","Having seen off the evil Joker, the Caped Crusader now has to deal with with two other deadly foes to keep Gotham City safe. The crazy mutant like Penguin and the power crazy megalomaniac in waiting Max Shreck. But wait, just who is this women dressed up like a cat? Friend or Foe? Seems the Dark Knight has a lot on his hands this Christmas.In 1989 director Tim Burton rekindled the super hero genre for Warner Brothers with his take on Batman. Made for $35 million, recouping over that in its opening weekend, the film went on to make a Worldwide profit of over $375 million. The sequel of course was inevitable, as was the return of Burton, even if he dallied around trying to bluff that he would only return if a script was fresh and exciting. Sure enough, and with Burton getting the script he wanted from Daniel Waters, Batman Returns turned over a profit of over $185 million. Thus ensuring that further franchise instalments were to follow, even if, as it turned out, Burton didn't.Batman Returns is more breezy than its predecessor, not in humour terms, but in action. In fact for a genre so steeped in sense of humour, Returns is surprisingly devoid of comedy. A charge of both Burton & Waters taking things a little too seriously is hard to argue against. But that's not to decry the good things that run abound in the film. Burton's trademark Gothics exist all told, and it has its darkness, both in themes and in actual visuals. All of course accompanied by a whirling Danny Elfman score. But what of the story itself? Well this perhaps would have been better served as being titled something along the lines of ""The Penguin Cometh,"" for make no fish bones about it, this is the Penguin movie. Batman and Catwoman are in essence just playing henchman and henchwoman, with Max Shrek serving only as plot device that's saying the real villains of our world don't wear masks or costumes. A bold move by Burton to have the Penguin as the lead protagonist, one that financially paid off. But one that ultimately turned many away from revisits for its perceived un- family friendly being. Guilty as charged said Burton, it's his vision and he stands by it. Thus Batman Returns stands up as the most adult of the four Batman movies made in the modern wave from 1989 to 1997. Quite a feat when you consider the film is set during the bastion of all family holidays! Sadly what was to follow would be kiddie friendly fodder served up by Joel Schumacher-reaching a crushing and chronic nadir with Batman & Robin.The cast are mostly excellent, Keaton does what he can in what is ultimately now a cog in a big wheel role. While Max Shreck gets to play Christopher Walken with relish and oratory menace (yes I did it on purpose). However, it's with Michell Pfeiffer's Catwoman & Danny Devito's Penguin that the film reaches its acting heights. Pfeiffer plays it mousey for Selina Kyle and then leaps at the chance to vamp it up as the delicious Catwoman. With a sultry miaow here and a tippy tappy skip there, this Cat is all in one sexy and very dangerous, something poor Bats is going to have to contend with. But it's DeVito's show all the way. Charged with having to follow Jack Nicholson's film stealing turn from the first film, DeVito immerses himself in the role of the pathetic, deformed, yet dangerously criminal Penguin. It's a monstrous creation fit to grace any modern day horror movie, with DeVito's physicality proving a necessity for the mutant flippered one who was raised in the sewers. If only Danny had been given more opportunities like this to show his talent.There's many missteps in here too, though. Burton is no master of directing action, and some of the one liners shoe-horned in are poor and pointless. While the whole birth of Catwoman story arc just isn't explained in any way. In fact it's all a bit lazy in truth. Burton though, remains a film maker with his own visual flair, his layering of atmosphere as Gotham is on the brink of collapse is expertly crafted. He has stuff to say and he's going to have fun saying said stuff. Often frustrating he can be for sure, but always he carries a uniqueness into many of his films. Batman Returns is no different in that respect. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A Bat, a Cat and a Penguin walk into a bar.","Batman Returns, sequel of the '89 Batman film, starring Michael Keaton as Batman for the second, and probably last, time, and with Tim Burton directing as well. It was a watchable movie, although inferior to the original one. Keaton's Batman doesn't convince and he doesn't have the spotlight, Danny DeVito's Penguim and Pfeiffer's Catwoman are the best things here, mostly for the acting, both characters are just too 'stylized', for the lack of a better term, and honestly, silly as well, they both scream 'TIM BURTON!!!!!!' in absolutely everything.The rest of the characters are just too boring. Alfred just appears for 5 minutes, and that's okay for the most part, Shreck is the generic 'capitalist pig', evil industrialist, that love his son. It's basically that, and the Selina Kyle vs Shreck whole thing was meh, and nothing more. There's a few other secondary characters that doesn't add practically nothing for the plot. Both Vicky Vale and Harvey Dent are not in the movie, but as a sequel, they should play a major role here. Vicky Vale romance with Bruce was okay in the last movie, I can't say the same for Selina/Catwoman and Bruce/Batman, it seems so forced, and how everything ends is just so disappoiting. No character development for Bruce AND Batman, he's the protagonist and that's it. But the technical part of the film is still good, keeping track with the last one. Elfman soundtrack, Burton's Gotha, all the costumes and the crazyness, penguins in the sewer, a giant duck, the whole aesthetics, it's a Tim Burton film after all.Batman Returns unfortunely is a flawed sequel, after a really good film that sinceraly didn't needed one, but they made it and could be so much better than it was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Saturday Morning Cartoon Come to Life,"The Good: Batman Returns has long been a childhood favourite of mine and for most of my life, I far preferred it to the 1989 Batman. In hindsight, I can definitely see why people take issue with it, but I can also now appreciate why I loved it: it's basically a Saturday Morning cartoon come to life.Think about it. We have a retconned and vaguely supernatural story for the Penguin (who commands an army of circus weirdos and literal penguins) and Catwoman (who literally have 9 lives), involving a Big Business conspiracy. We have cheesy one liners out the wazoo, we have logical inconsistencies all over the place, and outrageous technology. Whereas the original felt like the 1950s Batman come to life, this one feels much more like an attempt to bring animated Batman to life.Not to mention, Tim Burton's style is ALL OVER this thing. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but this might be the stylish and visually striking Batman film (disclaimer, I have not seen the 2022 Batman yet). The twisted, gothic architecture, low rolling fog, incredible sets and costumes all work to transport you into a very different and exciting world. I'm not sure if it was Burton's idea, but setting this movie during CHRISTMAS time was a stroke of genius. It gives the film such a warm and cozy feel, despite the persistent darkness.I also have to credit this film for what I consider (not the disclaimer) to be the best Catwoman put on the silver screen. Pfeiffer is electric in this movie and gives easily the best performance in Batman Returns; without her, this movie lacks so much of the fun and kinetic energy I've appreciate about it. As well as some of the best fight scenes and most iconic lines and moments (the freak out scene, ""give me a kiss Santy Claus"", the ball at the end).DeVito is...decidedly less beloved for his depiction of The Penguin. I get it, a lot of people disliked the transformation of a cold, calculating crime boss into a mutated, violent pervert. But for what he was given to do, DeVito did a tremendous job and absorbs himself into the character.Finally, Elfman's score is honestly my favourite of Batman's entire filmography. THIS is the sound of Batman, to my ears at least. The score - with a considerable touch of Burton whimsy - is absolutely iconic and superior to the original, in my opinion.The Bad: Batman Returns suffers from a lot of problems that - having grown up - I've noticed on this rewatch. Keaton is pretty good, but he feels underused. I get that there are three villains in this movie but Batman feels like a side character in his own movie. Bruce Wayne doesn't really grow or change and there are long stretches of the film where he's just not there.Perhaps the biggest problem people have with this movie is how weird it is. Catwoman licks herself clean at one point. The Penguin bites a man's nose off ( I love this scene btw). Catwoman puts a live bird in her mouth.I don't take issue with the weirdness, per se. What I do take issue with is how excessively long the movie is and how many of stupid, unnecessary scenes contribute to its length.Finally, this movie suffers from Saturday morning cartoon logic, where Batman can somehow get a recording on a CD of the Penguin in his private home *somehow* and Penguin's goons can take over the Batmobile *somehow* and Catwoman seems to have superpowers *somehow.* It's not a big issue and looking for logical consistency in a super hero film does not make one fun at parties, but it seems like some of these threads could've been expanded on. And we could've had less of Danny DeVito being a perv. Maybe.The Ugly: I love this movie and it'll always have a soft spot in my heart; for me, THIS was my cinematic Batman. And I think there's more good than bad, and I'm so happy Burton got to make the Batman film he wanted.If I could sum it up, I'd say this is a movie with some GREAT moments that rank amongst the best in Batman film history, but a lot of mundane and outright bad moments too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"An extremely ambitious, greatly directed superhero movie","Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to Batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.*First review written by me at 16. Re-written at 21*Tim Burton has an interesting history in film, between the surreal Pee Wee's Big Adventure and mis-interpreted Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's career has gone from an artistic darkly comic director, to unimaginative copy-cat of his own work. I still stand by my original review in that this film is very cleverly directed, beautifully shot, with stunning towering set pieces, but a script that goes from cheesy melodrama, to cheap and nasty humour.Though with some terribly written scenes there are some, incredible ones. Mainly those concerning antagonists Catwoman and Penguin. One scene in particular concerning the two concocting a frivolous ploy to destroy batman is one that springs to mind. The acting is first class, Danny DeVito is deliciously theatrical and sinister, Michelle Pfeiffer relentlessly sexy and smooth.Since my original review Dark Knight was released. Unfortunately for Burton I retract my youthful statement of his originality over Nolan. Dark Knight surpasses Batman Returns and almost eclipses its existence, but this instalment still has great merit and will stand out as one of the greatest superhero films, not to mention cementing Batman as the greatest superhero franchise ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Inferior follow-up ""Batman"" movie.","I remember when ""Batman Returns"" was released in the summer of 1992. The notices weren't overly positive. After seeing the film at the cinema, it isn't difficult to understand why. ""Batman Returns"" was issued straight onto video after the box office takings were disappointing. I was glad to see Michael Keaton, Michael Gough and Pat Hingle again and Danny DeVito was a reasonably effective Penguin villain. The film's drawbacks, are that the script is pretty moronic and the film sets are too restricted in that they are all within the confines of soundstages instead of being on location. The whole film looks artificial. Tim Burton's direction is good but it's hampered by the production values. Michael Keaton is less business-like this time as the Caped Crusader and that annoyed me. Michelle Pfeiffer is irritating more than alluring as Catwoman. She can't hold a candle to Julie Newmar's unique portrayal. Christopher Walken is over the top as business tycoon Max Schreck. There are some good action scenes which go some way toward redeeming ""Batman Returns"" but the negatives outweigh the positives for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show,"I always loved this version of Batman, only because of his counterpart, Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show with her stunning and sexy portrayal of the femme fatale, Catwoman. She is the best thing, after the amazing performance of the creepy and slimy Penguin, about this movie, and I don't think any other Catwoman can do her any justice.I first saw this movie when I was very young - perhaps 4 or 5 years old? I remember at the time all the visuals and special effects looked stunning. Now, granted, this movie is from 1992 so obviously, the visuals of more recent Batman movies shouldn't be compared. However, watching this in 2015, with some hindsight and seeing the Dark Knight trilogy and the more recent angsty/deep portrayals of Batman's character, this movie lost its magic for me.It's beautiful if you look at it in terms of classic Tim Burton, but in terms of an action film, it isn't quite up to par with more recent interpretations. Michael Keaton's Batman simply doesn't cut it anymore.But Penguin and Catwoman hands down are the signature performances of this movie and I challenge Hollywood to one-up either Michelle Pfeiffer or Danny de Vito in their portrayals here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Campy and weird, just like Schumacher","I should probably preface this and any other Batman review I make by saying the blasphemous truth, I think Batman is the most overrated superhero in existence. He's like Hawkeye with a utility belt instead of a bow and arrow, but he's praised as being better than Superman by most of the free world. So I'm not exactly starting at a place of adoration whenever I approach a Batman movie. However, that should be OK with Batman Returns since the Caped Crusader isn't in massive chunks of this movie. He pops in on occasion to foil the villains' plans, but otherwise isn't really the star of this film despite the fact that his name is in the title. This is the Catwoman and Penguin movie, but that probably wouldn't have put as many butts in the seats as ""Batman.""For those who like this kind of over-the-top campy comic book movie, I can see how Batman Returns would work. The dialogue is cheesy and full of puns, the performances are goofy, and the storyline is ridiculous. What I can't understand is the fact that people will praise this movie while criticizing the films that Joel Schumacher made to follow it up. This feels almost identical to those movies in tone and characterization. OK, I'll grant that Batman & Robin probably went a bit too far into the nonsensical stuff, but certainly Batman Forever is on par with Batman Returns in every way. This movie is goofy and weird, and doesn't really fit all that well with the original Batman movie which actually felt like it was taking things seriously from time to time.What I find most unpleasant in Batman Returns is the Penguin of it all. The Penguin in general is a disgusting character in this film, and they push it way too far in the gross-out direction. This is also the first time I can remember Tim Burton allowing the deformed, abused, and mistreated character to be the villain. Catwoman is a silly character, but she works fine for this movie. Her origin story is ridiculous, and her literal nine lives seems a bit crazy, but within the context of this film it isn't all that off-putting. I didn't take any issues with her, other than the fact that I couldn't really figure out why she was fighting against Batman. In general, this movie seemed to be created from a messy script. People's motivations are muddy and confused, and Penguin's plans seem to be ever changing. From start to finish, all I can see in Batman Returns are flaws, and that left me annoyed and completely underwhelmed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but far too much focus on spectacle over content","Evil land developer Max Shreck teams up with sewer dweller The Penguin to plan to take over large areas of real estate.  When Shreck's employee Selina Kyle discovers his plans he kills her, only for her to survive and develop Catwoman as an alter-ego.  Gotham City's regular defender Batman, steps up to battle the villains while, as Bruce Wayne, he begins a romance with the sexually charged Kyle.The second of the Batman series had the possibility to go one of two ways. 1 - it could go darker and look at the character of Batman in more detail and bring out the ambiguous nature of him more.  Or 2 - it could take the blockbuster elements of the first and up the ante.  With Burton on board it was always possible that it would go darker and complex than the first, however instead it panders to the mass audience.  In fairness the studios had a lot of money to make from the films and merchandising so couldn't risk the sequel turning people off.  So here we have a plot that doesn't really matter.  At times it's not really clear why any of the villains are doing what they're doing, the thinnest of reasons suffice - the Penguin simply wants revenge for being dumped in the sewers at birth.With the plot noted on a matchbox, Burton seems happy to concentrate on the set pieces.  With the characters set up in the first film, he now can just jump in at the deep end.  The end result is a endless run of explosions, gadgets and fights.  Keaton is not so effective as he was in the first - mainly because his character isn't developed because we concentrate on the baddies instead.  De Vito is a good Penguin and he doesn't ham as much as Nicholson did.  Pfeiffer is definitely a better female role than Basinger was, but she isn't fully explored.  Walken is always watchable as a bad guy, but here he can't rise above the material.Overall this film bottled the opportunity to build on the dark original. Going for the `bang, bang, boom' audience it throws all it's energy into action and fights.  Overall it's an uncoordinated mess - the name Batman deserved better.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Just one villain next time, please","If people are scratching their heads trying to figure out what exactly went wrong with this franchise, the answer is right here. It is a mistake to cram more than one villain into a movie. The Penguin has always been a fine villain for Batman, but in this movie next to the dangerously sexy Catwoman, he comes off as simply boring. Catwoman should have been the only villain in Batman returns, just like the Joker was the only villain in the first movie. It wasn't bad enough that a great villain like Two Face ended up getting the short end of the stick to the Riddler in Batman Forever, but we had to fit in another hero in Robin. By the time we upped the ante to three villains and three heros in idiotically titled Batman and Robin, it had simply gotten ridiculous.So, if anybody out there reading this is even thinking about making a superhero movie, remember this.

It was okay.,"Tim Burton's Batman Returns had the potential to be an excellent Batman film, but unfortunately, it missed the mark. Although Burton had full artistic control, he didn't seem to care much for the source material. The script lacked a clear lead character and didn't fully flesh out the character arcs of the main protagonists. Despite Selina Kyle's/Catwoman's interesting character development, the movie failed to focus on her story adequately. The plot was chaotic and didn't allow the audience to invest in any of the subplots. Although the performances were decent, the dialogue was occasionally subpar. Additionally, there were unexplained plot points. While the movie boasted excellent art direction and cinematography, it ultimately fell short.

But changed his mind when he was given full control of Returns, and just made his own thing from some wierd dream he had or something. I don't know. It's also weirdly perverted at times, like it's written by a teenager with sexuel frustration.

The best Batman movie of the series,"In my mind this movie is the best in the series. The sets are awesome, the tone is just right and Keaton is at his best as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He is backed up by two great villians Penguin and Catwoman, played respectively by Danny Devito and Michelle Pfieffer. In this sequel to the 1989 box office smash, Batman finds himself battling the Penguin, a man deformed from birth, who like Batman, never knew his parents and Max shreck, the devious businessman who plans to help the Penguin become the mayor of Gotham City and at the same time fulfil his own questionable plans. Adding to this is Catwoman, who finds herself battling Batman and battling the mutual attraction between them. This movie is a rollercoaster ride of action, crazy characters and powerful emotion and is great successor to the original film. The thing I find most intriguing about this film is the character of the Penguin. In my mind this character is not inherently ""evil"", just tragic. It's the tragedy throughout his life that has made him ""evil"" and forces him to do what he has to do in the end. His similarity to batman/Bruce wayne is somewhat noticeable. At the beginning of the film , when the Penguin first appears on tv and Bruce wayne sees it, we can see in his eyes that Bruce Wayne seems to know what Penguin is going through, because he too lost his parents to tragedy and is struggling to find out who he is. It it this level of characterisation that makes this movie so good. Add to that some pretty good action sequences and you've yourself a winner.

While visually stunning and filled with memorable performances, the film's eccentricity can sometimes overshadow its narrative focus.Michael Keaton returns as Batman, delivering a solid performance as the stoic hero, though he often feels sidelined by the film's colorful villains. Danny DeVito's grotesque and tragic Penguin is a standout, offering a chilling yet sympathetic portrayal of a man consumed by vengeance and despair. Equally captivating is Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, who brings a perfect blend of seduction, vulnerability, and menace to the screen, making her one of the most iconic characters in the Batman franchise.The film's production design is spectacular, turning Gotham into a nightmarish winter wonderland that perfectly complements its darker themes. Danny Elfman's haunting score elevates the mood, creating an atmosphere that is both enchanting and unsettling.However, the story feels uneven. The film juggles multiple subplots and characters, which sometimes results in a lack of cohesion. The Penguin's over-the-top schemes and some campy moments detract from the emotional depth the film occasionally achieves. Additionally, Batman himself often feels like a secondary character in his own movie, as the villains dominate much of the screen time.Batman Returns is a daring, visually striking film that embraces its weirdness with unapologetic flair. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessor, it's a memorable and unique entry in the Batman saga that deserves appreciation for its ambition and creativity.A dark Christmas tale like no other, Batman Returns earns a solid 7/10 for its visual brilliance and unforgettable characters, even if its story stumbles along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Sheer force of style largely transcends the flaws,"I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I'm also starting to become concerned about whether I'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great film, especially if you're a Burton fan, as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film's ""evil capitalist"", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman.While all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.Before re-watching Burton's Batman films this time, I didn't remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. Batman doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching The Penguin.Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can't say that I do, even if I'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an ""origin story"" for two major Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.For that matter, he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. That's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.As for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more ""poetic"" film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well.""Dark"" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that ""Max Schreck"" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin's final scene.In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general ""feel"" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Tim Burton's Batman Worth Continuing,"This is the last movie of this kind of Batman franchise that is directed by Tim Burton, but I can call it the only good sequel in here. Batman Returns is the only sequel in this franchise that does follow up right. It may have a bit of a downgrade due to a dull plot element with Catwoman, but it still has the charm from the first movie with an engaging story that gives the Penguin's development seem intense, nice special effects, very solid characters, and great performances especially coming from Danny DeVito as the Penguin. If you enjoyed the first film, you will most likely have a good time with this one too. This sequel ain't The Dark Knight, but it is the only one at least in this franchise worth continuing.

Overly Burtonesque,"Something happened to the Tim Burton BATMAN films after the ultra-serious Christopher Nolan vehicles made many long for superhero simplicity, while the Joel Schumaker trainwrecks gave an impression that something good was turned extremely bad...And yet, BATMAN RETURNS is a tiresome, eclectic mess, not quite certain who and what to center on since there are way too many cooks, all going drastically overboard...Especially the director himself, who uses so many of his stylized Gothic popup-book visuals that the Jack Nicholson BATMAN seemed tame by comparison... which was more of a BATMAN movie directed by Burton while RETURNS is a Burton movie that happens to involve BATMAN...And not very much, which is why Michael Keaton, with too much screen-time centering on the villains, winded up quitting the role, yet it's difficult to tell who the real antagonists are since Penguin... played by an overacting, bad monologue-spouting Danny DeVito... is so pathetic with a genuinely tragic backstory that he's never quite as evil (or dangerous) as he should be; and Christopher Walken's corporate tycoon makes DeVito's creature as benign as Keaton felt in the titular role...Meanwhile, Michelle Pheiffer's CAT WOMAN seems like her own solo movie's being invaded by characters who should be more important here... but eventually, too much happens in BATMAN RETURNS for anything to really stick, or wind up mattering beyond the overdose of Burton's self-inflicted style over substance.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great entertainment!,"""Batman Returns"" is very entertaining as a movie and is professionally made with some big talents both in front and behind the cameras. Still the movie goes a bit too far at times and becomes utterly ridicules, even for Tim Burton standards.I'm a big fan of Tim Burton's style so this movie certainly is not a disappointment to me. The movie has this typical and unique crazy look that distinct Tim Burton movies from others. There also are some typical, crazy like Tim Burton characters in this movie, such as the main villains (Penguin, Max Shreck) and especially the bizarre red triangle circus gang. The end result of all those odd and unique things combined, works surprising well and entertaining as a movie, that is watchable for all, so you don't really have to be a Tim Burton fan to fully enjoy this movie.The story is very simple and because of that it also gets quite ridicules at times, especially toward the ending with the Penguin when the movie loses most of its credibility. The whole duality between the Bruce Wayne and Batman character is highly underdeveloped in this movie and the character of Bruce Wayne is totally uninteresting in this movie, as is Alfred, who both had some good scene's together in ""Batman"".The new characters in this movie are a welcome addition to the Batman movie franchise. Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito are both wonderful as the new 'villains', whose characters are really deepened out good enough and are quite humane. But there, also at the same time, lies another small problem I had with this movie. The villains weren't stereotypical villainous enough. Christopher Walken just plays a 'normal' businessman and Penguin is more tragic than he is villainous. Oh, well guess I was just expecting another villainous Joker like character(s) in this movie. Also a welcome addition is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is surprising good and believable in her role and she plays a memorable impressive character and not just only memorable because of the way she looks.The action is good and there are some good fight sequences. There also are some good new cool Batmobile tricks in this movie. I really want a Batmobile for Christmas now!The musical score from Danny Elfman is wonderfully present again in this movie which certainly adds to the mood and atmosphere of the movie in a positive way. The good action-editing is from specialist Chris Lebenzon.All to together its a wonderful and good looking action movie, that is very entertaining to watch, time after time without ever loosing any of its power or entertainment value.

"Holy Bloody Nose, Batman","Batman: Returns is a sequel based on the first movie Batman '89 and once again Tim Burton sits in the director's chair. The new villain of the movie is The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito) who's fooling the people to vote for him as Mayor of Gotham, along with Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken) who's helping him and Selina Kyle (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) who's the Catwoman and her goal is to seek her revenge on the man who did her wrong.While the set design look good, Danny Elfman once again does a great job in composing the songs, and everyone is well-acted. The film still carries its flaws, that of course being the Penguin; watching his character you can clearly tell he's a monster, but the direction wants us to feel some sympathy for him, I'm not judging DeVito about it and he can clearly preform a good job at it, but it's like taking a disgusting villain like Freddy Kruger and we're supposed to feel sympathy like Joaquin Phoenix Jokers. If you ask me I think it would have been better if the film started with him just wanting to belong to society and then the corruption of society doomed him to go bad.Overall: If you can look pass that the film is another blank check that's giving to Tim Burton to do whatever he wants, it still has its joyful moments, if your into seeing a twisted Christmas film weather your a Batman fan or not, then this film is my personal request in seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Where is Batman?,"Not that different from the first one. Yes, more Burton on this one. More goofy sometimes. More camp. More spectacular. But...with the exact same issues as the first film.I roll my eyes every time someone says Keaton was a good Bruce Wayne/Batman (or even better than Bale 🤣)...damn, he was NOT. These two films are much more about anyone else than the Batman. It could have need Poirot, it would be exactly the same thing. The guy is there just to make his money and move on.Most of the good things of the first are here. Joker is very well replaced by The Penguin and I think Catwoman works much better than the romantic interest on Batman. The score is great, Gotham City beautiful. But boy, some of this dialogue lines are awful and terribly cheesy. They wouldn't pass on the modern days scrutiny but somehow they have a free pass because they are part of our youth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Bat the Cat and the Penguin in a good show,"the second in the Batman series finds Tim Burton in the directors chair again and while the second isnt as dark as the first, it ain't no walk in the springtime either..

Pfeiffer plays her role as the love interest who takes more than a little interest in Bruce Wayne.

"seen years later, a rare sequel that's better as an adult then as a kid","I'm not gonna lie, for a while I was a bit down on Tim Burton's own sequel of his 1989 classic post-modern adaptation of the the dark knight. It was mostly in due to feeling that the script was weak, with dialog WAY over the top, and an overall appeal that just at times seemed either too serious for its own good or too hokey (I mean, penguins doing what they do in their final moments in the film, who'd of thunk). But seeing the film years later, as Batman Begins now has its mark in the comic-book world, I've found a greater appreciation for it and Burton's vision. It's actually one of the best of the franchise, a given to be better than the Schumacher films, but with an added appeal after seeing countless other films since taking this is as a kid.Even as it isn't necessarily great, it has brilliant things about it, from its lavish and spooky production design (hell of a way to make that Penguin lair), fantastic make-up, and twists that have a perverse fascination here and there as a blockbuster entertainment. I'm also very fond of the performances I see again. Keaton still has that deadpan style as Batman that works (even if he's lesser as Bruce Wayne); Pfieffer is the best that could be done with Catwoman; De Vito stand out and occasionally steals scenes as Oswald Cobblepot (his plight is almost the most poetically tragic of the series, however if not the best as a villain); Christopher Walken is, well Christopher Walken in one of the lesser of the over-the-top roles he's done.But maybe most of all that has me gravitating more to Batman Returns as one of the better sequels of the 90's is how much of Burton's vision makes it to the screen, and how his control over the material is present throughout very strongly, as the sense of humor is either very dark or just very silly (in a good way, ""My Babies!"" Penguin cries out looking on at his confused penguins). And Danny Elfman's music is one of his best, at being at times eerily somber but with that Gothic edge the material needs. Plus, Burton understands a slight 'camp' element to what the Batman world might have, but doesn't overplay it like Schumacher did. In short, it's really just good entertainment that is maybe even more appealing after seeing all of Burton's films and, in general, just seeing more movies and understanding sloppy vs. successful in these hugely produced franchise pieces.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Too Dark,"Now the parts I enjoyed with the original Batman, are not in this one. This movie is just too dark. It's no longer a Batman film, it has become a boring crime film with another ""hero"". Micheal Keaton wasn't ever a good Batman and showed it being number 2 to the Joker. Now he's number 3 to Penguin and Catwoman. I do like Catwoman in this movie but I don't understand the Penguin. He's nothing like the comic book Penguin that was clever and suave. Danny Devito shows a just disgusting excuse for a villain. The only thing in this entire movie I like was the Bruce Wayne, Serlina romance. I liked how they were attracted not only as Batman, but as Catwoman as well.

Batman Returns - It Could Have Been Better,"'Batman Returns', the sequel to 'Batman' (1989), was interesting to watch but a lot of negative points come to mind after you see the movie. There were some creative ideas and dialogue in the movie, but the scriptwriters or directors didn't take the initiative to expand on those ideas before going onto something else less interesting. Though Danny DeVito might have done a good job for the 'person' he was supposed to portray, the actual character is hideously uninteresting in this picture and makes you want to turn off the television in a couple of parts. Also, his sidekicks are little more than completely unentertaining as well, which does not help make the villainous plot of the film any more exciting. That being said, Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific as Catwoman, the seductive assistant of Max Shrek (Christopher Walken, with a less than okay performance) who lures in Bruce Wayne with her unique charm. Ironically, there were few too appearances by its star (Michael Keaton, as the unbeatable Batman), and the film comes across as a possibly rushed production sequel and is too mean-spirited for its own good.

Not as good as you remember...,"Re watching Batman Returns, I realized just how weird this film is and how mixed my feelings are towards it. We all said at the time this was the dark one, the one that made them turn a corner and change things to be more 'kid friendly' in the following films. And we all know how well THAT turned out, don't we?I remember loving it as a kid (Why did my parents allow me to watch this film filled with sexual innuendos and violent death scenes?) But now, well, it's not a bad film, I refuse to dismiss something that so many people put a lot of effort into, and there are things I love about it. I have always said, and I still maintain that Michael Keaton is the best cinematic Bruce Wayne, but it's a shame that he's barely in the film, just like Burton's first Batman film, the villains are given far more screen time. The plan of the villain, sorry, the back-up plan of the villain is ridiculous. Penguins in the sewers? Really? Michelle Pfeiffer is the highlight of the film, without her I wouldn't like anything really. Danny DeVito gives a great performance, but if they were trying to make his character sympathetic, they failed miserably. He just comes across as a grotesque, one-note monster.

An Enjoyable Sequel,"This is a lot darker than the original, but it does kind of work in my opinion. None of the villains are as good as Joker in the first film, but they're still fun. Danny DeVito is delightfully over the top, but it's Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman who is the best villain. She has a legitimately strong motivation as well as being really entertaining to watch. I didn't mention the score in the last review, but it's really good across both of these films. Burton's direction is still good, and the story is actually better than the first film, with way less of Batman shooting people (although he does kill a couple people so it doesn't even really fix that problem). My big issue with the film is that I really didn't like the ending. It felt quite rushed given how it was built up, and the action doesn't really do the rest of the film justice. It also recycles the Bruce-Vicky relationship from the original, just replacing Vicky with Selina Kyle.

"None of it makes any sense, and Burton doesn't really mind","As a big Batman fan who liked 1989 Batman and was fresh off watching the wonderful campy show Gotham, Batman Returns seemed like a great watch, with a famous take on Penguin and a dark villain-oriented story. The parts fit together on paper, but on the screen it was nonsensical, with no coherent or interesting characters, a nonexistent plot, and one of the most laughable scripts I've ever seen - for all the wrong reasons.This movie starts and ends with the characters, so let's dig into them. Penguin is the biggest character in this movie I'd say, and early on I thought he had legitimate potential. While it doesn't make any sense, his backstory is interesting - he was abandoned by his parents, and drifted to the (abandoned?) zoo and grew up in the sewers with penguins. How he got food to survive for 33 years, why he looks 70 years old as a 33 year old, how he acquired things like the rubber ducky or his many umbrellas, why he never went aboveground, or how he survived and learned about the world if he never went aboveground: none of that matters. What matters is that he wanted to learn who his parents were and make Gotham stop taking everything for granted. He makes a decent play in blackmailing Shreck to gain power, and then Shreck gives him the platform to become mayor. This is where it becomes clear that Burton is not interested in logic. Penguin, the grotesque and uncharismatic sewer creature, is somehow beloved by everyone, even after biting a dude's nose off and making two gross sexual comments to women. There's no reason for him to be mayor - he's never really given the chance to be a creative, manipulative planner and is just thrust into the role through citywide pity. Even though he has no coherent plan throughout the movie, I perked up when I heard his scheme at the end to kidnap kids to show Gotham all they took for granted. The plan was literally stealing them and putting them in jail cells on a train riding around town, which was quickly and anticlimactically thwarted by Batman. To his credit, he seems unsurprised his half-baked idea didn't work and says it's time for plan B: blow up the city by attaching rocket launchers to hundreds of penguins and mind-controlling them. Of course! Batman sees this on his special penguin radar and, in one of countless instances of boringly lazy writing, Alfred jams the signal so the penguins return to the zoo. That's the climax? Then Penguin has to come out to the streets in his rubber ducky to really show Gotham who's boss (don't worry about what he was gonna do in the rubber ducky), and Batman drives right into him thanks to the handy penguin radar that also tracks big rubber duckies, sending Penguin into the water below. Aside from being half the age he looked, I liked the way Penguin's look was designed, but his dialogue is poor, he has no real ambition throughout the movie, and his one plan that could've been coherent was comically stupid.I'll spend less time on Catwoman, since she doesn't even have the promising aspects that Penguin does. She is presented as a nervous and incompetent secretary, but after being shoved out a window goes insane and becomes the Catwoman. No, there's no reason why her near-death made her want to be whatever she became, but don't worry, she actually never has any plans or goals. She'd be happy to kill Shreck, but isn't focused on this during the movie, and gets mad at Batman and Penguin when they fight her, but there isn't a single time when she dresses as Catwoman with any goal or plan of what she wants to do. She simply goes and sees if anyone looks ripe to... intimidate, I guess? I'm really not sure. She also gets shot four times and tases a dude while grabbing an electrical wire until he's fried to a crisp, but of course she doesn't die because she has 9 lives. Her sudden transition from being extremely clumsy and awkward to super athletic and aggressive is not at all believable, and even aside from that is a boring character with literally no ambition or ideas.Batman is given relatively little screen time, and Keaton is still fine as Batman, but completely lifeless. Gone are any moral dilemmas of taking the law into his own hands or even just creative ways to stop the villains. His penguin/rubber ducky radar, frequency jammer, and being a sick DJ on the Penguin tracks are all he needs.The things wrong with these three characters embody the many problems the film faces as a whole. There's no thematic material or ideas, none of the characters have real ambition or plans, and the set pieces that are supposed to feel exciting are either rote or laughably unrealistic. For every uninspired Batman punching people scene, we have Penguin being lured into a bizarre underground office for his mayoral campaign by a raw fish, Catwoman eating one of Penguin's birds to show she means business (I guess???), and the hundreds of penguins tossing those goggles on to get ready for the rockets. I'll give the movie credit in the few places it's due: the score was quite good, and the visuals of Gotham were pretty solid, as long as you ignore that they walk on the same street literally the entire movie. People generally seem to regard Batman Returns with respect, and I can't see what element of the movie isn't abysmal - the characters, script, and plot are all bottom notch. That also makes me scared for Batman Forever and Batman and Robin - can they really be worse than this mess? None of the events in Batman Returns make any sense at all, and the only pleasant parts are when you realize how ridiculous the movie has gotten and laugh at the game of one-upsmanship Burton plays with himself in regard to nonsensical plot points. If you want a campy, fun villain-based vision of Gotham, watch the show Gotham. If you want a dark Batman, watch the Nolan trilogy. If you want a well-done Michael Keaton Batman, watch the 1989 Batman. Only turn to Batman Returns if you're truly hankering for a movie with ambitionless and uncreative characters and a plot that has no interest in making sense.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great Performances but No Story,"Batman Returns (1992)** (out of 4)Tim Burton's sequel finds Michael Keaton back as Bruce Wayne and his crime fighting alter ego Batman. This time out he must protect Gotham City from The Penguin (Danny DeVito) who is trying to fool people into electing him Mayor with the help of a crooked business man (Christopher Walken). Also, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) plans to seek her revenge against the men who have done her wrong. BATMAN RETURNS, much like the previous film, is pretty to look at and it features some terrific supporting performances but like many Burton films I think it suffers from too much style and not nearly enough substance. For the life of me I can't understand why this story would get the green light and especially when you sit back, look at it and see how silly it is. The entire premise seemed to come from an ugly, deformed child being born and then its parents throwing it in the sewer. The second ""story"" comes from Pfeiffer's character being abused. I personally found both of these characters to be rather sad so it was hard to really root against them no matter what they were actually doing. Another problem is that both of them, along with the Walken character, are much more interesting than our hero. This was true in the first film and it happened again. It's so clear that Burton was in love with the villains that I think he pretty much forgot who the star of the picture was. The film is still worth viewing for the costume design, terrific sets and some pretty amazing cinematography.

No. If you take a minute to recall the dark mind of Sweeney Todd or the musical mischief of Jack Skellington then you know just how dark the director's mind can be and with this picture you would expect to see more dark imagery and imagination, especially considering the amount in the first Batman and in the comic books. And such is the beautiful darkness that the opening scenes bring back memories of his other flicks, particularly Edward Scissorhands. As powerful and creative as Burton is once again (will the man ever let us down?) he is unable to do anything about a poorly scripted plot.The bizarre opening looks as though it will be Burton magic again with Elfman's music juxtaposed with a floating basket in a dark river but what follows is a strange string of events involving a man's quest to find out who his parents were, a man hating cat loving woman and a ridiculous lack of superhero usage.The Penguin, though visually brilliant, is an awkward segment of this narrative. This child in a man's body feels very misplaced in the political side of the world. Running for mayor, finding parents and blackmail is all too much and though De Vito was excellent in many turns, there is simply too much for the character at once to be considered remotely believable.Catwoman on the other hand makes things interesting. Not only does Pfeiffer look the part she embodies the slowly suffocating soul of the protagonist. The strong opinionated woman is a fine addition to the film and is the highlight. Male viewers in particular will love her domineering actions and sequences.The political ideologies are too risky and take the attention of the characters. Perhaps the film is trying to preach but with an unbalanced script with action and talking mismatched its hard to tell whether the film has a message or is there for entertainment.This political edge takes the shine of the engaging action sequences and almost overshadows the action. Batman is even left out for the first half an hour because of the political debates which frankly, ruins it all together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
My second favorite Tim Burton Batflick.,"When Batman first came out nearly 30 years ago, it overcame bad pre marketing buzz and became a must see event film that broke the record set by Superman nearly 11 years before and became the biggest movie of that year in North America (Last Crusade was even bigger overseas) and spawned hot merchandise, including a killer soundtrack by Prince as well as the classic score by Danny Elfman, not to mention a VHS which my dad rented from a local Washington, DC video store where my cousins still live and which was the first pg-13 movie i saw in any format. It was quite dark. Then came Batman Returns, which was even darker than the last one. During this movie's theatrical run, McDonald's sold toys from the movie, although the film was marketed towards the teenage set. It was quite controversial at the time, which is why Batman Returns failed to outgross Batman yet broke the opening weekend record set by its predecessor, a record which would be broken by Jurassic Park as well as Batman Forever, with many other movies soon to follow, the last being Infinity War this year. As for the movie, it's a great movie to watch during the Christmas holidays, as it's set during christmas in Gotham City, where the Penguin and Catwoman team up to try to defeat Batman from saving the day!!! Here's a fun fact...this was the first film to get a wide release in Dolby Digital 5.1, but not the first mixed in it...that honor goes to Star Trek VI, which was given a test run during pre screenings (a 70mm 5.1 mix was used instead for select markets and was used for the dvd release). This is also the last good batman movie, as Forever and Batman and Robin are more kiddie like.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman Gets the Bird,"This is really quite good with more exposition and character development. We are introduced to two more staples of the Batman stable, the Penguin and Cat Woman. The Penguin's origins are brought forth in this episode as are Cat Woman's. The Penguin is set on taking over the city. There are evil politicians and crooked workers that Bruce Wayne must deal with. The Penguin looks like a lightweight, but he is, indeed a formidable enemy. Batman is immediately struck by the beauty of Cat Woman (played by the stunning Michelle Pfeiffer). The efforts to quell the situation set up by the Penguin and do it quickly, is the problem Batman must face. With Michael Keaton at the helm, Batman is a bit more cynical and harsh. Batman continues to be a force in the film industry to this day. One of the better episodes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Much Darker but Sadly not as Fun as its Predecessor,","Batman Returns is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's still enjoyable, but it certainly lacks the same level of fun and action that we saw in the first Batman. Tim Burton is certainly a dark and unique director, but he toned down his weird style for Batman, this time around, however, he dosen't and it's much darker and creepier than you would want a Batman movie to be, for example, a scene of a woman being pushed out a window falling to her near fatal death and the Penguin biting someone's nose off. He clearly had more power with how the movie was made this time around, but he simply went too far with conveying his own style which dosen't really suit the Batman universe. The highlight of the movie is certainly Michelle Pfeiffer, she is a fabulous actress and performs brilliantly as Catwoman, her scenes are the most memorable as well, particularly her dialogue with Batman. My biggest problem with this movie is the same one I had with the first Batman, but it's more extreme this time around, Batman dosen't have enough screen time and is underdeveloped, the villain has much more dialogue, which wasn't a huge issue the first time around as Jack Nicholson was terrific as the Joker, but I really wasn't fond of Danny DeVito as the Penguin. Villiains normally have a lot of reasons to be likable, but the Penguin was simply creepy and every time he was on screen I was uncomfortable, it was clear that Burton found this character fascinating, but giving him, as well as Catwoman, more dialogue and screen time than the title character is simply odd. It certainly has its flaws and fans of the Batman franchise will probably be disappointed, but Batman Returns is still a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it as a good action if you ever see it on television.Batman (Michael Keaton) must put a stop to a corrupt mayor and a psychopathic man who calls himself the Penguin, from taking complete control of Gotham.Best Performance: Michelle Pfeiffer Worst Performance: Danny DeVito",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Darker and better,"What a film. Blows 'Batman' out of the water. 'Batman Returns' is up there with the greatest movies of all time. I couldn't care what anyone says about 'The Godfather' or 'Titanic'. No doubt they are great films but everyone should have a favorite movie (Personal choice, whatever is your ideal movie) and what you think is the best movie (The Shawshank Redemption,The Godfather etc). Stand By Me or something like that would be my favorite movie but Batman Returns is up there. Penguin was a really good character and so was Catwoman. All in all this movie is dark,thrilling and suspenseful. Some American thrillers I can really taste the cheese off of. (V For Vendetta for example)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Visually impressive...but that's it,"The Pengiun (Danny DeVito) and evil millionaire Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) team up to rule Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to stop them. He also has to deal with Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has ideas of her own.Dark and pretty sick sequel to the 1989 ""Batman"". For starters the villains are pretty silly. DeVito is in an obvious fat suit as the Penguin and his character is needlessly grotesque. Walken sleep walks through his role (as always). Pfeiffer REALLY tries (and looks great in that costume) but her character goes all over the place and acts real strange (even for a Tim Burton film). Keaton is miscast--but he IS good. The movie is filled with stupid one liners which come out of nowhere and seem totally out of place in this context. The tone of the movie keeps switching gears--from comedy, to action, to horror, to romance--erratically. Also Batman kills two people (!!!), little babies are kidnapped and/or put in danger, the sexual aggressiveness of Catwoman is REALLY strong (for a PG-13 movie), the Penguin bites somebody on the nose and people are casually killed left and right. The story also ceases to make sense at certain points and goes barreling out of control by the end. I mean--penguins with BOMBS on their backs invading Gotham City? Come on! Director Tim Burton seems only concerned about production design and special effects. They are impressive (especially Wayne Manor) but swallow the story and the actors. Also the constant dark tone and cruelness really wears one down after a while. I kept watching but the darkness of this one was really too strong--this deserved an R rating.This was a big hit but parents who saw it with their children were (understandably) outraged and bombarded Warner Bros. with letters and calls. Because of that Burton had no hand in ""Batman Forever"" (the next movie). I do think Batman movies should be dark but not at the expense of characters and plot lines. And did Burton really think it was wise to have so much violence in a film children were going to see? And Batman should not kill. I give this a 6 for production design alone. Don't let little kids see this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Burton's dark vision of Batman's Gotham City is impressive...,"Tim Burton creates a dark vision of Gotham City and its inhabitants with BATMAN RETURNS, which begins with a stunning opening sequence with a freakish infant being disposed of by cruel parents, all to the pulsating and powerful score by Danny Elfman that sets the mood for the rest of the film.MICHAEL KEATON returns for his second turn in the Batman role, convincing whether he's playing Bruce Wayne or the masked crusader; MICHELLE PFEIFFER has a grand time in her dual role as Selena, the mousy secretary afraid to express an opinion or the aggressive, sensuous and sinewy Catwoman who finds a willing opponent and lover in Batman, a love/hate relationship that builds to a frantic finale. The wonderful MICHAEL GOUGH is Alfred, Batman's faithful, wise and all knowing manservant. And, of course, DANNY deVITO gets a huge share of the spotlight as the villainous Penguin, conspiring with power hungry Max Schreck (CHRISTOPHER WALKEN) to get rid of their opponent, Batman.While all the performances are right on target, it's the special effects and sets that dominate the story with its mean and twisted nature sharply accented by the dark foreboding appearance of Gotham City, its Herald Square resembling a bleak counterpoint to New York City's Rockefeller Center. MICHAEL MURPHY and PAT HINGLE are present in minor roles but the film is carried by Keaton, Pfeiffer and DeVito.The screenplay is about as dark and mean spirited as you can get with comic book material, but it's the dazzling production design that gets the attention all the way through, usually on the sinister and somber side. There's a nightmarish quality to some of the action scenes and Burton, of course, is a master at this sort of thing.All told, a very enjoyable take on the Batman legend, dark to be sure but never dull with lots of juicy dialog for clever exchanges between Batman and Catwoman in their game of oneupmanship. MICHELLE PFEIFFER is especially good at capturing the dual nature of her role--and makes a stunning Catwoman with a whip. MICHAEL KEATON is not an actor I personally would immediately think of casting as Batman, but he does extremely well in the role.Summing up: Dazzling sets, good script and Danny Elfman's mesmerizing score are a solid combination to make this Batman a worthwhile viewing experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Well done... but undone by too many villains...,"""Batman Returns"" is by no means a bad movie. In terms of action, set-design, scoring and acting, there's nothing to envy from its predecessor of1989. Yet something was lacking, definitely. Whatever it was, I was so turned off that I'd rather explain why the original was so good instead.""Batman"" had that Gothic atmosphere that fitted the tormented mind of Bruce Wayne, billionaire, vigilante and misfit, and the noir tone of the film fitted a city where organized crime reigned supreme; but had it been just an exercise in style and design, ""Batman"" would've been poisoned by its own depressing mold, the film worked because it had an antidote, a grinning psychopath played by Jack Nicholson, a Joker who, as far as characterization went, was no joke.I said in the review of the first film that Nicholson's Joker scared me because of the way he enjoyed killing and made every homicide, an art, something fun actually. What it reveals about the performance doesn't need to be over-analyzed, you could tell Nicholson had fun playing the Joker, and that fun was communicative without making his actions any less impacting. The Joker, played by a deliberately over-the-top Nicholson was a histrionic bastard intoxicated by his own flamboyance and yet making the whole film a real macabre dance between organized crime and the Dark Knight.Keaton wasn't too present in the picture but his investigation on the Joker's action and the interludes with Kim Basinger were actually the moments we could catch our breath between two Joker's scenes. Now, to put it simply, Keaton isn't any more present in ""Batman Returns"", which makes the title a bit misleading, he's even a rather tertiary character, but the villains in the film could have made his absence unnoticeable except that they were as much in need of a psychotherapy as Bruce Wayne himself. The film got too psychological and dark for its own good.There is basically one villain too many, and I guess that is Max Shreck, Christopher Walken as the evil businessman who wants to control Gotham City through electric power. He doesn't have many shining moments, except for throwing his secretary Serena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) out of the window once she unmasked her evil project, he does look good in an odd sexy way, but he's never as impacting a presence as Danny De Vito playing the Penguin or Pfeiffer as Catwoman, which is the height of irony since he's the actor most used to play creepy guys. You would think De Vito and Pfeiffer would spice up the film a little and ""have fun"" like good old Jack, but they're actually victim of the plot's intricacy.Indeed, ""Batman Returns"" feels more like an assemblage of many subplots that were certainly mouth-watering on the paper: Schrek's s plans, the penguin's quest to find his parents echoing Wayne's own trauma (he was abandoned an orphan child and was raised by penguins, living in the sewers for three decades), Serena Kyle seeking revenge against Shreck and criminals of male persuasion. There's also something interesting in the ambiguity governing the so-called villains, the Penguin wants to be loved by Gotham City community, Catwoman is a vigilante but her actions are often antagonistic to Batman, not to mention the romance growing in subtext.To make things even more complicated, you have Christmas in the backdrop, the City undergoes many assaults from the Red Circus Triangle, and many love or hate triangles from one character to another make the plot quickly derail. The original ""Batman"" had one villain, not the subtlest plot but that was enough, by trying to make many antagonists and make them as three-dimensional as possible, the film went in too many directions, creating a Rubik-cube of a plot, without the colors to make the final result look good.Indeed, each of these stories, was depressing as hell, there was something fun in Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman but like the Penguin, like Bruce Wayne, they were characters turned to the past, to the initial struggles of their human counterpart while the Joker was from any trauma. The only villain with a focus on the future was Schreck but he could only be underused, and so was Batman.In the end, you have a Christmas movie whose action sequence provided nothing new once you enjoyed the original but whose tone is so dark and depressing you might enjoy the film for the actors, the atmosphere, but you wouldn't think of watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A fave,"First let me start off by saying that without a doubt anyone who does not like this movie must be a. a ten year old,b. a comic book geek, or c. a person of a similar mindset. Sorry kids, this movie is not 100% silly cornball, comic book hokum, the heroes are all too recognizably human ( as opposed to bland specimens of almost God-like perfection that will fill your head with warm memories of the crudely drawn crap you used to watch  a billion saturday mornings ago ), and so are the villains. As much as I enjoyed Spiderman ( I'm a big fan of the comics), I have no problems admitting it was typical, by the numbers Hollywood product that while extremely enjoyable on a puerile level,it doesn't engage on any other(beer guzzling, lets shoot the sh*t over pool fellas just outta college who-you know- just EAT up this crap will inevitably ask ""Well, f**k, what else do you want from a movie?"" Such people truly are holdovers from the Ice Age, and merit no attention). This movie's strength lies in its sharply drawn characters as opposed to its special effects which is why it will outlive such inoffensive, whiz bang offerings. Take the Supermans: by now, they are quite dated, as is the first Batman movie, and as Spiderman will unquestionably be in a few years, but this movie is as fresh now as it was in '92. Unfortunately, Batman Returns was a happy accident that will never occur again in the history of Superhero films. Warner's ( inadvertently of course) made a smart decision in handing over total creative control to established money maker Burton(a genuine artist with a definite vision; notice the refreshing lack of blatant product placement, or say, stupid flavor of the month pop soundtrack tie ins calculated to make teenyboppers go gaga in perfect, herd-like unison as we all know they do).  The result is a wonderful family film that contains S and M images, coarse sexual innuedo, and sizable dollops of bloody onscreen violence that will no doubt  scar younger viewers. It's an over the top subversion of the genre, that knows its taking a dump on the notion of Superhero films as school field trip fodder. and is completely unrepentant. Which why its so f******g great. None of it would work of course, if the acting was on the same low level as other comic book films, but thankfully the cast-much to the chagrin of the unwashed masses- chooses infuse their roles with depth.  Michelle Phieffer in particular is a stand out as the tormented Selina, and her sexilicious alter ego the Catwoman. Keaton as Bruce Wayne is a revelation. Their scene together at Shrecks party is by far, the best scene in any superhero movie.  A 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A little dark in a few areas, but really great to see","BATMAN RETURNS is really amazing.The tone is really dark and intense and this had a very parental backlash from critics because the violence was so dark, but now in the superhero film genre, they still do light hearted films, but keep the dark and gritty tone in films.The acting and action scenes are really cool and I really love both of those. Michael Keaton returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne for his second and last time and I could not have think of anyone else. The rest of the actors are really cool and the film is just amazingly well done.The visuals, music, editing, story and pacing are very good in this film and I am very pleased with the final results, but it was not that dark and violent.Overall, BATMAN RETURNS gets an 8 out of 10, while there are some flaws, I still love this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

I voted a ten for this movie based on childhood memories,"SILLY ME.Baaadd sequel. It leaves you feeling cold, and unsatisfied. This is a comic book movie-shouldn't we come off feeling like Batman indeed saved the day, and all might be well? That's the feeling we got at the end of the original Batman, and one that is badly missed here. The only thing we feel by the time the movie has reached it's pathetic (anti)climax, is that perhaps Batman SHOULD join Mr.Freeze, Riddler, Posion Ivy, and all the others in Arkham Asylum.Michelle Phiefer is the only point of interest in this dreary mess, and she is given FAR too little screen time. Catwoman deserves her own movie (although not the one Daniel Waters scripted, which was pure 1960's era Bat-campiness), and indeed one is in the works. Too bad the lesser Ashley Judd will play her, according to the latest news. With a better, more fleshed out Catwoman to play Michelle could really SHINE in a role she made, and has yet to top.Danny Devito is awful. Every second he has onscreen is a waste of celluloid.

Batman Returns,"I've decided to give you mine opinion on all the old Batman movies. Starting with Batman and ending with Batman & Robin.This movie, Batman Returns, is the second Batman film made by Burton and, this is sad, the last of the old movie to be worth the money. After this there were no good Batman films until Nolan and Goyer decided to make their version of The Dark Knight.With the Joker gone, this film starts to focus on the character it should focus on: Batman. That said, it still gives all the characters a moment to shine. Batman faces two of his deadliest foes: Catwoman and the Penguin, along with the corrupt businessman Max Shreck (named after the guy who played Nosferatu). The cast is great. DeVito was born to play Penguin, Walkens character is the real villain and Michelle Pfeiffer is hot and purrfect as Catwoman (pardon the pun).Once again Burton got the setting right. Gotham during Christmas is a wonderful background to have during this story, that in fact is better then the 89 version. In many things, this is the better Burton film.Then again, on the more important parts, this is the not so good version. Once again Burton got the characters all wrong. Catwoman is, if not true to the original, still good though. She turns into a thief/vigilante after, like the Joker would put it, she had a really bad day. She still is the grey part in Batmans black and white world and she actually makes him love her. So she works and therefor she's okay. The Penguinis was changed radically. He has become a freak who lives in the sewers and is the leader of an ex-circus crew. But, after all, Penguin never was a good villain to begin with. The worst thing is that they took one of the plots, there's more than one, from the old Batman series with Adam West. The Penguin runs for mayor?! WTF is going on? The Penguins other plot is way better but spoiled because of lack of time. That is sad.Still, the ending is great and it is still an enjoyable movie. I'll have it in my collection along with Batman and the new Batman films by Nolan. But Schumachers movies is better of forgotten. ""Merry Christmas, Alfred. Good will towards men... and women.""

So Bad It's Almost Good,"Batman Returns isn't Burton's best film, yet it isn't his worst either.Although there are some dangling plot threads and not much narrative sense, Danny Devito really does make The Penguin come to life.

A Comparison of those who played Batman in movies.,"Four Actors: Bale, Kilmer, Keaton, ClooneyBALE: He's leaps and bounds ahead and best among them all. No need for comparison. No need to explain.KILMER VS. KEATON: The real Issue. Kilmer had everything correct about him except one: he was in a Bad Movie. One simply canNOT refer to Bad scenes in a Badly scripted Bad Movie by a Bad Director to explain why the actor was not good to play his character. I understand, Kilmer could have never replaced Bale, but he would have easily replaced Keaton (who even though was a good Batman, WAS a wimp Wayne). Even if we forget that Keaton was the least good looking and had the least physicality required for an ideal Wayne/Batman respectively, we still cannot forget that he never had the ideal Wayne magnetic personality to attract females. He was a plain idiotic wimp as Wayne. Whereas while Kilmer was definitely muscular/handsome of the two, his was unfortunately limited by the Bad Movie itself that he worked in, that did no justice to the character of any roles in it, least of all Batman. Also, we can't forget that Kilmer did play a very good playboy-Wayne of whatever the script allowed him to. That is what is important (where Keaton failed). Because once you're inside the caped costume, it does not matter who is inside it, because nobody's going to recognise you anyway. So the character that must be given more priority is of 'Wayne' where one cannot hide behind a costume.Remember, Kilmer was a good Wayne/UNDERUSED Batman in a bad movie by a bad director. Keaton was a good Batman/wimp Wayne even in an overall OK movie by a very good director. Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director.MY POINT: If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton.CLOONEY: As for 'Batman & Robin', every thing was wrong about it and so was Clooney who only played 'himself' both as Batman/ Wayne. And he will always be remembered for that. Anyway, except when the movies are called 'Syriana', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Clooney is all 'himself' everywhere. No Surprises here. I seriously hope they destroy all records/sources of that B&R-crap.My Ranking: 1. Bale 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton.Clooney? Who Clooney?AS for this movie, I don't understand why people call this movie 'Dark'. This movie is Bad because it is TOO dark. Totally unwatchable / unenjoyable for children. On the contrary, the Penguin here, would give the innocent children, traumas for life. Don't ever show this movie to your children. Penguin is a seriously (pun intended) a horror crap here. Too Hideous, No Fun. And what's the use of the movie being Dark when you have No Character Development here. Penguin is a ridiculous villain and they have not shown even a single glimpse of his childhood, that is how the Penguins nurture him which is utterly impossible even in comics/fantasy, especially if they portray the movie and the Penguin as 'serious' and 'dark'. But yes, De Vito has been a good obedient actor here and did what he was told to do efficiently.(P.S.: As for the Comparison between those 'Batmen': Believe me, as the tag-line of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' goes - 'It's Nothing Personal.' None of these four actors is my personal favourite. I love Denzel Washington.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

The movie is also more action packed and fun than the first one. The cast also does a really great job in their roles and are arguably the best thing about the movie. Michael Keaton plays a great mysterious Batman, Michelle Peiffer plays a great sexy Catwoman, and Danny Devito was a perfect casting choice for the Penguin. Both Catwoman and The Penguin are great scary and tragic villains with personality and Batman is badass in this movie.

Worthy sequel,"Batman returns is the second Batman film from Tim Burton of 1992. I've heard that this film is one of the darkest Batman films and that it has a somewhat gloom and depressing tone which like one person said that it was from Tim Burton's too much control, but I almost felt it like a darker film. Even with some comic relief things, doesn't mean that is light in tone.Michelle Pfeiffer did an excellent job as the catwoman, she's probably best character of the film. Danny Devito did a very solid job a the Penguin. Michael Keaton as Batman is great despite not being too much in screen time like he was in the first Batman film. Let's hope that in The Flash dceu movie, Michelle Pfeiffer will return as the same catwoman.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Misguided, decent sequel to Batman","I can somewhat understand why this film is cherished so much. This film is the darkest installment of the Burton/Schumacher franchise. The movie has a star cast and Michelle Pfeiffer gives a memorable performance as exotic, seductive, but vile Catwoman. The great Danny Elfman music is all still there. Danny Devito and Christopher Walken bring decent comic relief in their roles as villains.The movie suffers from a silly plot devices and rhetoric , which is ironic considering this is supposedly the ""darkest, most serious"" film in the franchise. Yes, its dark, but in a very superficial, stylish way. The film never aroused in emotion of despair or sympathy for any of the characters because it was filled with ridiculous premises. There is more violence in this film, unnecessary death, even some minor blood, but especially near the end, the violent conflicts never seemed to have a point.The big problem with this movie is that its apparent Tim Burton wasn't sure where to take the character of Batman after the first film. Burton essentially focused on making fantastic Burtonized Gotham City and Burtonized villains. Whereas the first movie was somewhat realistic, gritty and a decent Batman film, this movie makes Gotham City more surreal and goth fairy-tail. Burton changes the origins and motivations of the two major villains (The Penguin and Catwoman) DRASTICALLY from their comic counterparts. The Penguin is changed from a deformed, calculating, crime boss into a genetically altered, naive, and angry mutant who lives in the sewers and never knew his parents (who are human). Catwoman's transformation and origin is almost as absurd. Their motivations are so dimensional, Catwoman is reduced to a simplistic poster boy for feminism.The first half of the movie has a decent plot, but after a semi-climax, the movie spins out of control wrecklessly and nothing makes much sense. For all the flack Batman & Robin got for being campy, this movie has the Penguin......talking to and commanding an army of penguins with rockets on their back. I couldn't believe I was seeing this in a what some considers ""the Best Batman movie of all time"". There are too many convenient plot devices and inconsistencies throughout the ending. The other minor characters from the first film are gone or do little to almost nothing in this film.Keaton's Batman is still good and convincing. What's bad though is that the film is even less about Batman waging a war on crime than the previous film, and more about angry, unloved, or ugly people (the hero and the villains) never finding happiness or love that they deserve. Burton definitely imprinted his artistic, fantastic, Gothic but dreary style throughout this film, for better or worse. Thus, this isn't really a superhero film, but a typical Gothic ""nobody loves me, so I have to wreck havoc"" film. Batman's dedication to fighting crime is ambiguous in this movie and I don't feel he becomes a stronger or a resolute character in the end.The movie is decent, there are some good action scenes, and as said before Pfieffer is awesome and attractive in this film. Christopher Walken is sometimes funny and Danny Devito has some good scenes. I think the dark nature of the movie has successfully hid the fact that this movie is just as campy and silly as the next two sequels. In some aspects, Batman Forever is even better at somethings, such as characterizing Bruce Wayne. This film has little to no direction, point, and is more stylized art over substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The main characters shine with their personalities,"The best part about this movie with no doubt, are the characters and the actors portraying them.

"A Tim Burton film, more than a Batman film - which isn't necessarily a bad thing","Re-watching the two Burton ""Batman""s I was shocked to find I liked ""Batman Returns"" more than the 1st.

And Christopher Walken is a blast comparatively underplaying evil capitalist billionaire Max Schrek.The film looks gorgeous, arguably better than the first. And if the production design can't match the grandeur of Anton Furst's sets for ""Batman"". these have a lot more Tim Burton surrealist fun-house/nightmare aesthetic.What's missing is much of a clear plot, story elements coming and going a bit randomly.

Catwoman. Meow.,"I give this film a 10 rating if only for Michelle Pfeiffer's wondrous portrayal of catwoman. As a child growing up, catwoman was an icon for me and Pfeiffer's portrayal was remarkable. Even now, as i am older, the performance still holds up as one of my favorite performances of all time. She didn't just portray one character to perfection but played three. It's remarkable that she can meld all three sides of Selina Kyle together so perfectly. That being said, I enjoyed the film thoroughly. It was much more Gothic and surreal than any other Batman film. I think some scenes may be a little ""frightening"" for younger kids though, such as the scene where Penguin bites the reporter's nose or when catwoman falls into the greenhouse and starts to scream. I thought Danny Devito did a good job, and Keaton did what the role called for. I especially enjoyed Christopher Walken's Max Shreck. Well I love anything that man does, he's just a howling good time. But back to catwoman. She was just gorgeous, crazed, sexy and stunning. Her whip-cracking, her black eye shadow and pale skin, and her vinyl suit are a perfect combo. Her lunacy makes her all the more sexy. Too bad Halle Berry completely ruined catwoman in the self-titled flop. We'll all remember Michelle as the goddess in the black suit. Meow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Average Batman sequel to the original 89th classic. Dark, violent fantasy that is set on Christmas Eve but still not better than it's predecessor.","Average Tim Burton's Batman sequel to the original 89th classic hit. It is not better than the original 89th Batman but a Hughe step down. I like this film I don't love it like I love the original. Batman Returns is a violent, comic book, dark fantasy set on a Christmas Eve. This movie get's a lot of hate but dosen't deserve it. Because it is diferent people doesn't like it? They bash this film and they don't appreciate it. I prefer 89 Batman, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and Batman Forever over this film, but that is just me.Michael Keaton, Michael Gough and Pat Hingle all reprise their roles from the first film. Danny Elfman still returned with his music score. The movie has action, fantasy and dark Gotham City world. Characters are kinda out of place. The Penguin and Catwoman are still portrayed by the comic books just Tim Burton made a twist in those 2 villians and he changed the facts.Big + are for the positives: Batman is still in action, he fights off Catwoman which is good choreographed. But the stunts for Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer but Kathy Long a kick-box champion did the stunts for the actress. Batman still fights off Penguin's henchmans. I like when Penquin kidnaps Ice Princess (Cristi Conaway) and he throws her off the roof with umbrella of bats those stunts and that sequence were excellent. The movie has good effects, good puppetry. Batmobil is still good designed and excellent. The make up for the Penquin took almost 2 hrs on Danny DeVito. I read he wasn't allowed for 4 hrs to go out of his trailer anywhere and talk to people. Good custums deigned for Catwoman. Good custum for Batman like in the first one this one was great custum designed.Michael Keaton is still fabulous as Bruce Wayne / Batman his performance is charming and excellent. Love Keaton's performence. Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle / Catwoman: Is still good. Selena Kyle is portrayed by comic books. Watch Gotham I loved the first four seasons and Selena was portrayed by the actress Camren Bicondova and she portrayed Selena Kyle believable. Selena was really pushed out of window and cats really awekend her and she went on a revenge spree and she made a catwoman's custom her self. In Ghotham Selena was pushed by Bruce's clone and cats aweken her. In this movie she was pushed by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Selena was shot in end of Season 4 Gotham and in Season 5 she was looking for revenge like she was in this movie. Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito) really was mayor in Gotham city, he was mayor in Gotham and he was mayor in this movie. Catwoman and Penguin were portrayed by comic books in my opinion. Batman was still a cape crusader.Negatives - for this movie are: Selina Kyle was not a secretary or assistent in comics she was in actually a wise kid grown up on a streets and turned out to be a thief. In this movie she was a normal working girl. Catwoman engaged in sexually suggestive activities. That was the problem she wasn't romantic involved with Bruce in this movie enough. I still can't believe a grown woman goes and destroys her own pets at home acts like a child.. Demolish her home was Selina a psychopath in this movie to do that? I really don't like this. It is not entertaning. Penguin was nothing but a fat guy and ugly, he was terrible villian in this movie. He eat raw fish and he bite some guy's nose. Batman is barely in the picture. The fight scenes for Batman are not that great choreographed they could have been better. The music songs are not from Prince in this movie. I don't like Batman demolishes his beloved Batmobil. Max Shreck was not based on a comic book, he is a fictional character. Those points I don't like in this movie these mistakes hurt the film.I like the soundtrack Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees when Selina and Bruce are dancing. My favorite scene in this movie is when Batman comes to save Ice Princess but Catwoman attacks him and Batman knocks her down and says ""Eat the floor."" that was the best scene and Batman flys to his Batmobile and sees all those bats. Michael Gough was excellent as Alfred who supports Bruce in his hard times. In my opinion Michael Gough was much better and more likeable Alfred as Michael Cain in my opinion. I like the explosion sequence in the zoo practical effect.Beside those problems I have it is a good movie I am still going to watch it. Come out the same year as Basic Instinct with Sharon Stone. I would say back in the 90's Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer were the most top sexy woman by actresses ever. I like this sequel, but 89 Batman, Batman Begins , Batman Forever The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are better movies in my opinion. P",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Its.....OK,"Batman Returns is pretty good but not great. I thought Catwoman was great but didn't care much for the Penquin, he was just too.....weird. Michelle Pfeiffer is fab as Catwoman and really seems to be getting her claws into the role. I think I prefer Batman films to have one villain, two seems a bit too much as Batman seems to fade into the background as so much time is given to the villains. I preferred Burgess Meridith as the Penquin in the 60's TV show anyway. Batman Returns must be the weirdest summer blockbuster ever released, still its miles better than any of the Batman films that followed. Michael Keaton is good when he's on screen as Batman which doesn't seem that much, he's the best Batman so far thats for sure. Christopher Walken is always good and he's no different here his character reminded me a little of when he played Max Zorin in the Bond movie ""A View to a Kill"". All in all not bad, but I don't think I'd bother watching it again. ***6/10***",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Good job Tim Burton!,"I must congratulate Tim Burton for managing a truly high level sequel. After the success of: Batman (1989), it was not easy to propose a film that could stand comparison with such an important predecessor, but Tim Burton succeeded, bringing to the screen a much more serious Batman, with even darker tones , intriguing and engaging. The style of Burton, as for the first film, adapts perfectly to the character of the dark knight.

What makes a sequel? More stuff.,"Growing up, Batman Returns was one of my favorite movies as a child. It pains me slightly to watch it today, for what I thought then was flawless, is now rather over-the-top and melodramatic. But the production is beautiful and I will never forget Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. At the time, I thought she was God's greatest, sexiest gift to mankind.Batman's back and instead of one headache, he now has three: the Penguin, Catwoman and Max Schreck.Everything about Batman Returns is about more. More explosions, bad guys, gadgets, decoration. It's all on a grand scale. Unfortunately the script is not up to snuff, but the makeup of the Penguin is excellent, and the costumes are excellent, especially the Catwoman's! I couldn't figure out if Christopher Walken even tried in his character or if he was truly necessary. Thankfully, the Gotham scenery and the other actors' efforts catapult it above ground.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Would you like a rocket-firing penguin for Christmas?,"In my continuing review of the Batman films, I recently saw Batman Returns again. I believe that it is one of the better comic-book films I have seen, but it is really bogged down by some issues that cause the film to drag.Basically, the film is about the emergence of two new villains, The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito), a vengeful sewer dweller who wants to kill the children of Gotham in revenge for what his parents did to him as a child, and Catwoman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), a former secretary who inexplicably turns to a life of crime when she is thrown out of a window by her boss, Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). And Batman? Christ, who cares. He barely has a purpose in the film anyway, other than to stop the two of them and have a date with Selina Kyle.I said it before in my review of the first film, and I'll say it again here. The film focuses more on the villains than the actual title character, and that is not a good thing by any means. If the characters had any sort of interesting back-story, it might be better, but the way these two come to be villains is just ridiculous. Selina Kyle gets pushed out of a window by her boss, falls many stories, then gets ""licked"" back to life by cats (no, I'm not kidding), and THEN she proceeds to tear up her apartment, make a ridiculous-looking suit made up of spare leather, and suddenly she knows how to do back-flips and fighting maneuvers? A little explanation would have been nice.The way the Penguin is characterized in the comic books is interesting, because he is a crime boss, and poses a continuing threat to the safety of Gotham. Here, we find out that he was born a freak, his parents threw him into a sewer, and then he was raised by penguins, who supposedly taught him how to read, write and commit acts of crime? And what was his plan? To become the mayor of Gotham? Did he even have any political skills of any kind? The fact that he has become a literal penguin only serves to provide fodder for bad jokes that appear throughout the film (notably, the incidents with fish being offered to him, so he can make a complete buffoon of himself).It seems that the plans these two villains come up with are incredibly stupid and ill-prepared. First, the penguin attacks a Christmas-tree lighting ceremony, apparently to kidnap Max Shreck, and then use him to help him become the Mayor Of Gotham. In addition, he kidnaps the Ice Princess and has Catwoman hold her for ransom, then he frames Batman for her murder (even though Batman can't even be caught by the cops anyway since he sticks mostly to rooftops). THEN, when his mayoral plan doesn't work out, he gets a guy to kidnap a bunch of kids and ride through town on a slow-moving vehicle, perfect for a counter-attack. Finally, he gets a number of penguins to walk into the middle of Gotham City (which is strangely deserted), and fire off a bunch of rockets, which, in the end, we came to find out don't really do all that much damage anyway. And what did Selina Kyle do? She blows up a department store, stalks Batman around and gets shot numerous times before electrocuting her boss. Really smart planning there.Michael Keaton gives a better performance in this film than the previous one, if only because he has shed the geeky, shy demeanor and become more forceful and assertive in his role as a protector. Likewise, the rest of the cast gives good performances as well.I realize that in a comic book film, events may be exaggerated, but the physics at work in this film are unbelievable. First we are asked to believe that a woman who's been pushed out of a window can survive a thirty-story fall, when a woman pushed in a similar situation gets killed instantly. Then, we are asked to believe that Batman carries magical metal wings that all of a sudden take shape from his cloth cape whenever he desires it. Finally, we are asked to think that a woman who gets shot several times, then gets partially electrocuted, can survive just because she's dressed in a catsuit. It's these sorts of situations that serve to stretch the limits of the film.In addition, the whole film seems to take place withing a time-span of three or four days, which in that time, sees Batman getting discredited by a guy who has just come from nowhere looking like a penguin, a woman making up a catsuit, blowing up a department store and following her crush around, The Penguin running for the mayor position and failing, and having the time to ""take in the sights of Gotham"", plan all his operations and execute them, AND crash a dinner party. Now that's what I call time management!Bottom Line: In the end, though, the movie is enjoyable for what it is, if you overlook the ridiculous villains, threadbare plot and the lack of Batman himself. I give this film a 6 out of 10, and while it is one of the better films, you're probably better off watching the ever more dependable Batman Begins, if you want to see some more credible villains in action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

A unique Christmas movie.,"I guess this is a Christmas movie. It's probably the weirdest and strangest Christmas movie in the genre. Problem is I wish it had more to do with Christmas than what I witnessed. Now I'm not criticizing this and saying it's horrible because it's not, but it is really gothic and unique for Batman and Tim Burton too. When Tim Burton directed the first Batman yes it was goth but it wasn't too goth like this one is. This one he went full Tim Burton from the cinematography, costumes, props, you name it. There are some shots that are done really well, and there are times where it goes a little too far. Besides Michael Keaton, one of the highlights is Christopher Walken and Michelle Pfiffer. Danny Devito as Penguin is a unique take, where he gives a good performance one scene and another scene where he needs to chill. So overall, it's not a terrible Batman movie like some others but it does have its moments. And I don't think this counts as a Christmas movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Overstuffed sequel, barely any Batman","After re-watching the original 1989 Batman I came away lukewarm about it. It's a classic, but not one that has aged well.Watching Returns right after the 1989 movie...I now appreciated the 1989 movie much more as Returns is a tough watch.For a movie called Batman Returns, the titular character is nowhere to be seen for 80% of the movie. The plot focuses way too much on Penguin and Catwoman. Our caped crusader has essentially no focus at all. A majority of his time is the romance with Selina/Catwoman and even those moments aren't building up to any kind of meaningful depth.The visuals are as stellar than ever and the practical effects aren't too shabby. Keaton still has a bit of the neck issues with the suit, but overall the effects are really good.As with the first, the script here is just the main issue here. The rest of the parts of the movie are already great, it's just the script that really puts all of the rest of the production to waste. Though the lack of sets kind of cheapens the feel. It felt like there were only 3 different locations in the whole movie. It makes the scope of the movie seem way too small.There's never really much going on and when there is, it's not very well established or crafted. Scenes just kind of happen without warrant and rarely add anything to the plot.There's also way too many plot holes or too unbelievable moments. I mean how the hell do Penguin's goons get the schematics for the Batmobile? Why are there NO cops anywhere to stop the Penguin's circus train from driving in the night? Why does Batman have his logo all over everything? Just things there and there that just make zero sense thematically.The performances are solid. DeVito is good, but the script makes him a little too horny and creepy. I don't know how they allowed any of the innuendos in it. They were super obvious and not smartly hidden and even as adult they were just gross and creepy. He was already creepy enough on his own without him joking about humping Catwoman.It's just a movie that is all over the place. It's got a poor script and some really questionable moments. It just falls flat overall. It's probably for the best that Burton didn't do anymore, but then again we got the so bad they're funny Schumacher movies.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

The best Batman.,"*** out of ****By the time I'm writing this review, I haven't seen Batman Begins (2005) yet, but I can tell that this is the best (or least worse) Batman movie so far. When I watched it yesterday, I kinda of thought it was cool, but it is too absurd at times! Sure this is not only a super-hero movie, but it's also a Tim Burton one. And as far as I'm concerned, Burton sometimes likes to be absurd at his movies. But don't get me wrong! I liked this movie! First of all, the best of it is the Gotham City itself. It's dark and sinister and it fits perfectly with Danny Elfman's score. Actually Elfman's score is another great point! I guess that the best part of the score is when Selina is tearing up her apartment and becomes the Catwoman herself. The score for Batman is great also, but it's more like a heroic score, while the Catwoman's score is more dark, which sure was something I loved! For Pinguin and his clowns, the score becomes a little more silly and childish perhaps, but it's still a great score.For this movie, the story focus now on the Pinyin. There are also other characters like Christopher Walken's one and his son. I loved Christopher Walken, he's as sinister as hell in this one. And Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman! She is truly great, deadly and hot! This is the true Catwoman, not this stupid clown that Halle Berry played recently! I hate that woman with all my guts!There is not much to be said about this movie, unless you spoil some plot twists. All I can say is that Danny Elfman's score is great, the performances are great, the Gotham City great also, and Michael Keaton is sure the best Batman that we ever had. The only problem of this movie is that sometimes it becomes a little silly and too absurd. I don't know how the Pinguin got to live in a sewers that is so beautiful (if you know how to decorate itself, of course), but that's OK anyway. I would make that water, my own private pool instead of the one I, myself, have. But since this is a super-hero movie, we may even tolerate some things. But Spider-Man is sure much more realistic! Well, a taste is a taste....The only one thing I didn't really get is why the Catwoman wants to beat Batman. Maybe I'll post this on the IMDb forum.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Batman Returns 1992 Review,"From the cinematography, the visuals, the score, it all scream Tim Burton. By all means this feels more like a Tim Burton film with Batman in it more than an actual Batman movie. That's not a bad thing though, because Batman Returns really brings a lot.
Batman Returns feels like it was ripped straight off the comic book panels and brings a new light to overlooked Batman villains.
This film brings in both The Penguin and Catwoman. Both being played by, what I would say, perfect casting with Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer respectively. Good god I was impressed and loved both of their performances.

A close second-best,"This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing.True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
superb Second Movie,"I was glad to see that Tim Burton again captured the essence of the comic books.This time Batman (still Keaton i'm glad to say) has two bad guys to contend with, the penguin (DeVito) played to perfection and of course the stunning Michelle Pffiefer as catwoman.

Ehhh it was OK,"I find it hilarious that some people call this (and I'm not joking here) ""a 10"" and ""the best movie ever made"". Please. Now while that may not be the majority of people, it still seems pretty silly to me how one could think that. I guess if you really like Tim Burton you might say something like that, but he has made better movies. Anyway I digress.I saw this on TV today for the first time in about 10 years and remembered how disappointed I was when it came out. I'll grant Burton an eye for the visuals, and would agree that his Batman movies have the best looking Gotham City and have the best Batman (Keaton). However, in this second installment things went a downhill for me. First of all Batman himself is given a back seat and instead we are forced to deal with Devito's Penguin. Once again the most gullible citizens ever are lead to believe that this clearly insane or at least odd and disturbing character would make a good mayor, kind of like they were tricked into believe The Joker was an ""okay guy"" in the first one. Also the needlessly dark touchs like the Penguins plan to kill all the first born sons of Gotham don't work for me. Also some of the stuff comes off as just tacky like the little penguins with rockets attached to their backs or the henchmen dressed up as clowns (didn't we already have a clown in the first one?). The ending is pretty anti-climactic as well and overall it isn't all that entertaining. I think that I actually got more enjoyment out of Batman Forever then I did out of this one (though I think this movie is technically better made).In conclusion this movie isn't the worst movie ever, and has some good moments and an excellent visual style that really resonates the world of Batman. However, some stupid plot points and needlessly dark/bizarre elements keep me from really liking it. If you are a fan of Tim Burton's work you will probably find something you like here. Even a Batman fan can find some good stuff as well. But just because there were worse Batman (and comic book movies in general) made after this doesn't necessarily make this a good let alone great movie. If you really like Batman read the comics books.Zoopansick",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

the hero's return,"With ""Batman Returns"", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year, ""Batman"" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, ""Batman Returns"" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the apparition of Catwoman...Tim Burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the movie of 1989, Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. The director attempted to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man.""Batman Returns"" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Michèle Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. Besides, at the time when I'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), it is sure that her performer Halle Berry must pale into insignificance beside Pfeiffer.Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also still find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. Concerning Batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman and Robin"" (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting the beginning of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The best of the 5 movies!,"I make my comment when i just have seen all the Batman movies including the awful as overrated ""Batman Begins"",in this sequel Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton,a good performer but a bad Batman)falls in love with a crazed and fired employed called Selina Kyle(a good Michelle Pfeiffer)but after she lost her job, turned in the ""Catwoman""(sand for the kitties saved her life when her former boss threw her trough a window),meanwhile a fatso freaky living in the cloaks of Gotham self-called Pinguin(Danny De Vito)challenges the caped one invading the city with his feathered ""friends"",in the final struggles Batman defeats Pinguin but his relation with Catwoman is pending between love and hate,the eternal trouble present in the comics of this character, Burton developed it in an efficient way.The performers were good though to see Pfeiffer as villain made me hesitate,she did it so good,yet rather i preferred Sharon Stone(she didn't accept because ""Basic Instincts"" was made almost in a same moment)but Michelle is a superior actress and did her best as the tiny DeVito,two scenes were superb:when the Ice Princess is tied up and Catwoman fights Batman amidst of the roof,and when Batman unmasks himself in the end,Keaton doesn't look at all to the comic character, but this moment showed his value,regrettably his look is not to be Batman,nevertheless this flick never bored like the first one did make it for many viewers in spite his fans,Burton got better this time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Top Tier Sequel,"It's Christmas time in Gotham City, and Batman (Michael Keaton) has his hands full. Business mogul Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is trying to expand his business deals when ditzy assistant Selina (Michelle Pfeiffer) realizes she knows to many secrets. As Shreck attempts to silence Selina, rumblings from the sewer begin to have a larger impact on the city. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) emerges from a lifetime of hiding to become the lost son of Gotham. Now, Batman must clear his name by getting to the bottom of Shreck's plan, discovering the Penguins' sinister plan, and combating a new foe named Catwoman.Director Tim Burton returns to the Batman franchise with the follow-up to the hit 1989 film which also brings Michael Keaton back to reprise his role as Bruce Wayne. While this film is a sequel, you can watch it without any knowledge of the previous film. This is an excellent decision by the production team as this film attempts to reach a wider audience. This film is larger than life and brings the audience right into Gotham City.The production design of this film is reminiscent of past Burton outings. A dark and gloomy aesthetic is the perfect counterbalance to the bright and cheery Christmas theme. The makeup and prop production for this film stand out in a very technical film, and the design of Penguin is iconic. The costume design, specifically Catwoman's costume, ties the film together. And what would a Tim Burton film be without a Danny Elfman score?Michael Keaton delivered once again as the caped crusader and cemented his legacy with this performance. The casting of Danny DeVito as Penguin will go down as one of the greatest casting decisions of all time. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman is also a great casting choice, and she plays the role with an elegant, yet intimidating presence.The major problems with the film can be narrowed down to the script. The overall plot of the film is solid and hits all of the beats you want to hit. It also has a third act that sees many different storylines come to fruition in poetic fashion. The script issues are the dialogue throughout. The addition of Max Shreck as an original villain plays well, but at times just muddies the water in a crammed storyline.Batman Returns will go down as one of the best sequels in film history. Iconic characters and design have helped keep this film alive. Setting this film during Christmas, with holiday undertones, makes this a film to revisit every year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

This wasn't as good as the first Batman movie but is still very entertaining,"Batman Returns (1992) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture displays a man working hard to have a new power plant built in Gotham and will stop at nothing to get his ambitions delivered. In the process he kills his assistant who returns as Cat Woman. He also encounters an underground gangster out to find his parents and reclaim his place among high society, the Penguin. The Penguin and the man trying to build the power plant look to take over Gotham and the Batman quickly determines he needs to stop them; meanwhile, Cat Woman finds herself caught in the middle.This movie is directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice) and stars Michael Keaton (Birdman), Danny DeVito (Throw Mama from the Train), Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Vincent Schiavelli (Ghost) and Pat Hingle (Hang 'Em High).The settings and backdrops in this once again are very well established, dark and well created. The soundtrack in this is also impressive, not as good as the first Batman film, but very good. Walken, Pfeiffer and DeVito were all outstanding in this film and great selections for these characters. They deliver truly unique and entertaining performances. The Batman toys and weapons are always good and the Penguins ending was great.Overall this wasn't as good as the first Batman movie but still very entertaining. I would score this a 8/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman Returns A Decent Sequel But With Flaws,"Batman Returns is a decent sequel but with some of the same flaws that were in the first one by Tim Burton. I re-watched the original and this one after seeing writer/director Christopher Nolan's take on the popular comic book character with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight which are so much better than Burton's no offense. Director Tim Burton does an okay job making this sequel but some problems weigh it down which I'll get into later. Michael Keaton reprises the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman whose decent as the character but he isn't as good as Christian Bale in my opinion. He wasn't able to bring the presence Bale brought to the character. Keaton however does what he can with what very little he was given. Danny Devito had a little more to work with as The Penguin and he's okay despite shouting a lot of his lines. DeVito is a good actor but this isn't his best performance. It maybe because I just don't find the Penguin that interesting of a villain but DeVito still turns in a solid performance none the less as the short grotesque and deformed enemy of the Dark Knight. Michelle Pffiefer fared much better as Selina Kyle/Catwoman turning in a solid performance as the dangerous femme fatale. Burton probably should have chosen just one of them to be the villain for this film because their story arcs felt rushed at times because Pfieffer does an impressive job with her role. Well done. Christopher Walken does his best as Max Shreck a psychotic businessman who helps The Penguin run for mayor. Walken sort disappears for much of the second half only to reappear for the third act but he's okay in the role. The rest of the cast are so-so but none of them are memorable. Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon have what amounts to a few extended appearances which is disappointing because their characters could've been handled much better. They both do what their roles require I guess though. The action sequences are well executed but none of them are exciting or intense as the ones in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. The dialog was once again cheesy at times and many characters like Harvey Dent for one aren't even in it or mentioned making their appearances in the first one seem totally pointless. Like Burton's first Batman one of the biggest problems is that this sequel seemed to focus mainly on the Penguin and Catwoman instead of the title character himself especially in the first hour. Keaton doesn't even show up until over 12 minutes into the film. He makes a brief extended appearance with very little dialog for an action sequence and then his character disappears until almost 40 minutes into the movie since most of the beginning centers on The Penguin and Selina Kyle's Catwoman. For a while it seemed Keaton has a cameo in his own movie which didn't help in the long run. After that initial first 40 minutes luckily he's in it more but Keaton seemed to get cheated out of some more much needed development and screen time again. I didn't realize just how little these films actually focused on the Dark Knight until I decided to recently re-watch them. It's always not a good idea to focus more on the villains than the main character because he's the one the audience is going to care about. I thought this problem was solved with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight because at least those films focused much more on Bruce Wayne/Batman especially Begins. The Dark Knight felt like an ensemble piece and by the end I think Bale got just as much screen time as the late Heath Ledger, Aaron Echkhart, and Gary Oldman. That film focused on the four of them evenly giving all four actors plenty of moments to develop their characters and shine. Overall Batman Returns isn't that bad of a sequel it just could have been better. I recommend Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to any fan of the comic book character because both films are entertaining fast paced action crime dramas and worth the time to watch. Batman Returns had potential to be a good sequel only it ended up being somewhat of a letdown compared to Nolan's two superior films on the Cape Crusader. Yeah it has some cool action, a little dark humor, and solid performances by the cast (Keaton, Devito, and especially Pfeiffer) but I just wish the film itself was a lot better than it turned out to be. I'd chose Nolan's two Batman movies any day over this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"so near, and such a mess","Not so much a movie, more a series of photo opportunities.  But what photos! This is a beautifully designed film, with some pretty decent performances, and a script that needed ditching and starting over; it has at once far too much and far too little plot, and Burton isn't the director to get over that.  As a noirish Christmas movie (which was a good idea visually: it enables Gotham City to have a bit of white in it, while still retaining the requisite bleakness) it bears comparison with Burton's more personal ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", and there are points of contact with ""Edward Scissorhands"" too.Rather than learn from this film's mistakes, the further sequels decided to make them again, only bigger (while introducing lots of really stupid ones of their own), by following ""Returns""'s terrible miscalculation of having two virtually independent villains who have less and less to do with one another as the dénouement approaches.  The film could have worked if only the last reel had drawn the plot strands together; instead, de Vito's (adequate) Penguin is resurrected simply for the sake of him falling over again for no good reason - this is dramatically unforgivable, and dissipates all the energies that have been generated by Keaton and Pfeiffer, who do some excellent work with pretty poor dialogue.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"""An embarrassing lack of juice""","There is a tendency for directors with a unique look began to dominate cinema more than ever in the 90s. Directors like Tim Burton have a kind of mainstream popularity and creative control only really enjoyed by Cecil B. DeMille and Alfred Hitchcock in the classic era. This meant that, after a certain point, whatever project Tim Burton took on, it looked like a Tim Burton movie. When he filmed Batman in 1989, it was very much a Batman flick, but when he returned for the sequel, armed with the commercial bankability and industry respect that the first picture had earned him, was far more able to twist the production to his own vision.Burton was never outstanding at basic film-craft (otherwise he could be making dramas), but his substantial genius lies in his visual arts. Somewhat atypically for a director, he would have his production design team base everything on his own sketches. His instantly recognisable forms – a mix of Gothic nightmare and twee Americana – dominate Batman Returns. It's almost so much here that the sheer weirdness of it all overshadows the comic-book antics. There's also a lot of ""clever business"" too such as the point-of-view shot of the young Penguin looking out through the bars of his crib being mirrored by a point-of-view shot of his older self looking through the sewer grate. It is very Burton-esque to show things from the perspective of the villainous freak – and certainly very unusual for the mainstream.As can be expected, the cast members are a suitably over-the-top bunch. Danny de Vito hams it up gloriously with humour and just a little pathos. Michelle Pfeiffer milks those terribly corny lines for all they are worth. Add Christopher Walken into the mix and it seems the writers were spread-betting when it came to throwing in traditional Batman villains. As a result poor old Michael Keaton in the title role is a bit lost, which is a pity because he was excellent in the 1989 predecessor. The most honourable mention goes to Michael Gough, reprising his role as Albert the butler. You have to admire his dryness when he Pfeiffer recommends he pen a dirty limerick for the occasion, and he informs her one has just sprung to mind.Batman Returns is several notches below the earlier movie. It is simply too much of a collision between Burton's world and Batman's world, but there are a few things to be salvaged from the wreckage. For all its basic incoherence, the picture is filled with a wonderful dark humour and numerous silly ideas. Far from a classic, it is at least a good bit of fun, and of course it looks pretty good too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman is back!,"Batman Returns quite surprised me actually. I haven't always heard glowing reviews of the film, but I found myself really rather enjoying this.From a plot perspective, I think it works very well even though some elements are really rather ridiculous. The pacing is solid and there's a decent spread of action.I was a little concerned knowing that two huge characters in the Batman world had to be introduced and set up in this film, as this could have made the film a bit crammed and slow to get going. However Burton welcomes both Penguin and Catwoman into the fray effortlessly.I do think the introduction of both does leave Batman sidelined a little in his own film. I'd be interested to see how much screentime he actually has as he felt remarkably absent for large parts of it. Some more Batman focused action and development would have been nice.However, when DeVito and Pfeiffer are putting in such stellar and captivating performances it's hard to argue against giving them the spotlight.Some Bat fans may take umbrage with the artistic direction taken on Penguin and Catwoman, but I loved it. DeVito knocks it out of the park as this twisted deformed version of Penguin, and Pfeiffer brings a great energy to Catwoman.Burton's gothic vision of Gotham is brilliant, particularly with it all dressed up for Christmas. The set design and costumes are all top notch.My main issue with the film is that the tone is all over the place. Sometimes it's incredibly dark and full of raunchy humour and grotesque costumes / makeup. Other times it's very tongue in cheek, juvenile and whimsical. I do wish they had picked a lane and stuck to it, as the lighter moments undercut the darker moments too often.I do also think the action could have been a bit better. Fight scenes with Batman himself felt a little lame at times.There are plenty of different ways to approach Batman, Gotham, Catwoman, Penguin etc, and Burton certainly makes some bold choices. They may not work for some but on balance I think this film just works.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Keaton continues to impress as Batman, a real presence, with a definite hint of humour, he's just so cool.The tone is spot on, it's a festive, real life action adventure, with not just one classic villain, but two.

He is short, stocky and looks like a kid trying on his dad's clothes when he puts on the suit. Combine that with his rigid movement and pathetic attempt at fighting and he can only succeed at making the criminals laugh.Add to that the pathetic villains -we have the penguin and catwoman, neither of who seem very menacing at all and really pose little threat to Batman. Also, WTH is with the thousands of little penguins with rocketpacks?? I might like this movie if I was a pothead but otherwise the march of the penguins is just too cute for such a dark movie.Burton's trademark dark visuals are really the only good thing about the movie.

good villains,"If De Vito and/or Pfeiffer were in every scene in this movie I probably would tack on at least one additional star. Their characters, Penguin and Catwoman, are developed so well they elevate the film from the rather dubious crop of comic book that have been made. Burton's direction and visual flare, and Elfman's genius score are a perfect pair yet again. It's a huge improvement over the first ""Batman,"" which was low on story and high on Jack Nicholson's scene-chewing. It's a hell of a lot spookier and darker than its predecessor, making it more faithful to its comic book source. If the movie were just overall better, De Vito's Penguin would go down as movie history's wickedest villains (he's like a Charles Manson with lame wings), and Pfeiffer's Catwoman would be among the silver screen's greatest female roles. The uneven script stifles the flow of the movie, and I'm sure the studio tinkered with Burton's singular vision with its need for blockbuster box office and perpetual tie-in merchandising.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Unlike other follow-ups of the saga this one is artistically and atmospherically superb,"What I extremely like about ""Batman"" (1989) bounces back again in ""Batman Returns"": schizophrenic characters (in ""Batman"" there were at least two super-schizophrenics - I shouldn't name them, should I? - but here there are distinctive three of them), enchanting atmosphere (the sets are beautiful, ""gothically"" menacing, and simply outstanding), cool acting (when I say ""cool acting"" I mean my absolute inability to poke finger at the characters with disrespect and contempt; quite the other way round: I do respect all the characters here, while they are never goofy, stupid, or over-sentimental), great action scenes (fighting against the hordes of clowns, great acrobatic stunts - I am especially happy with that scene where clowns are jumping onto the Xmas tree and bring havoc to the streets of Gotham, effective explosions, insane killing sprees, etc.), sharp black humour which reminds me of ""Hamlet"" (remember the trio wild chemistry?), fine music (it is far from being some monotonous junk or over-imposed opera pieces) and tons of other minor ""Easter eggs"".By the way, I had a chance to watch ""Batman Begins"" one day - is it supposed to be good? No way, it is clumsy. They ruined the whole concept one more time. Why do people go for those ""zero copies""? Wasn't ""Batman and Robin"" enough? I respect Mr Tim Burton for quitting the ""Batman"" project after this film. He's done more than enough for making the figure of on-screen Batman legendary.

"""Returns"" is why Burton wasn't welcome back for the third installment.","The first, but not best, follow up to the successful ""Batman"" includes two villains: Catwoman (Pfeiffer) and an unnecessary hideous rendition of The Penguin (DeVito). Keaton puts the cape on a second time for a wonderfully meek Batman/Bruce Wayne. Director Tim Burton, however, appears to be more interested in doing things the way he wants, instead of even attempting to continue a good story. The first was a darker and realistic take on a superhero that most be associated Adam West with — but the darkness and reality of the 1989 film worked well. Here, however, Burton tries to make ""Returns"" darker, uglier and less realistic. Instead of The Penguin being a beak-nosed mobster who wears a tuxedo, he's a mutated human living in the sewer. Instead of Catwoman being everybody's favorite anti-hero, she's wicked enough to be the main villain. Instead of Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Harvey Dent, he's replaced with Christopher Walken as the evil Max Shreck — a new character who looks more like a mad scientist than a corrupt businessman. Even the art design of Gotham City is significantly different and less believable than the first. Burton completely ruined the wonderful world he made in the previous film. Danny Elfman's score is the only thing this and the first film are equal at; everything else is significantly inferior. A huge disappointment.** (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
That PVC catsuit !,"I'm not a fan of Tim Burton at all . He's the kind of director who attempts to make movies for adults ( not those kind!) but they just turn out to look like they are made for big kids .
I quite enjoyed his first Batman film and I have to see this was fun in parts but at no stage was I drawn into that Batman world and that's what I wanted .Megalomaniac businessman Max Shreck sets a plot against Gotham City in motion. He is joined by Penguin, a deformed and rather deranged man abandoned at birth by respectable parents. Penguin, backed by hoodlums and real penguins, runs for mayor. The plot is further complicated by Selena, a wronged secretary who transforms into Catwoman, a villain with mixed motives.Firstly the good things .

It's also great to se Christopher Walken playing ...Christopher Walken !Now to the bad points . The whole movie has the look and feel of being filmed in a studio . The set feels restricted which makes the film feel a bit insular.
Secondly , Danny Di Vito has so much make up on he's unrecognisable and that very disappointing.
Finally the plot is paper thin. I'm not expecting Citizen Kane but at least make it have some jeopardy or excitement.It's not a terrible film , it's just a Tim Burton film and he'll always be one of the most overrated directors in my eyes .",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A timeless Classic and Christmas movie,"Just watched this movies again with a friends and our four 5-8 years olds. Loved and enjoyed unanimously. Great performances, if not the best From all involved. Was criticized at the the time for been too gothic, apparently, but I think it holds up better that the first, and I LOVE the first one.

"Of bats, men and sequels....","I can see what Tim Burton was trying to do with ""Batman Returns"".In the original, there was darkness enough but also a bit too much of the flip attitude of the TV series for his taste.  After all, we're talking about artistic integrity here.  Once and for all, he wanted to make his OWN interpretation of the ""Batman"" mystique, which he did here.Point of order - this movie is indeed successful in showing how good a craftsman Burton is for dark, gloomy images of despair, misgivings and doom. But, is that the right attitude for a movie about a super hero to strike?In a gloomy, seemingly refrigerated Gotham City, Batman must battle the evil of not only The Penguin (DeVito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) but also of businessman Max Schreck (Walken) who plans to drain all of Gotham's energy for his own power plant, along with a few other twisted deeds he has hidden up his tailor-made sleeves.BUT, and this is the important part, the first movie had a successful villain in Nicholson's Joker (as if there were any doubt).  Here, the villains are seen more as objects of pity (the deformed, pathetic Penguin; the put-upon, mentally abused Catwoman; the power-hungry, grasping and son (Bryniarski)-obsessed Schreck) than of anything inherently evil.And then there's Batman - as portrayed by Keaton, he feels more like a cypher - an empty suit, if you will - than he was in the first film.  He doesn't even give a flicker of the torment he felt in the original.  Here, he just broods.As before, the scenery is beautiful, if more dark.  Burton is, first and foremost, an artist and shows his talents in composition and design.  But even though the first ""Batman"" was far more successful, it had less to do with Burton and more to do with the calibre of other talent involved (Nicholson, Basinger, Wuhl).Devito plays a one-note villain without any nuance or subtlety; Pfeiffer makes a suitably flaky Catwoman and, even though she tries, her character is far too pitiable to be threatening' Walken basically plays his umpteenth baddie but still pales in comparison to similar parts he's played in ""True Romance"",   and ""A View to a Kill"" (sure, it wasn't very good, but it was still better than THIS!).This series would have to wait to improve (""Batman Forever""), but as far as sequels go, it at least kept with Burton's vision, even if it didn't keep with the entertainment value.Three stars for ""Batman Returns"".TIDBIT - Reubens and Salinger, who played the parents to DeVito's character, were featured in an earlier Burton effort - ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"".  Talk about a token gesture....",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Bat. The Cat. The Penguin. The Best.,"'Batman Returns' is my favorite Batman film out of the series, and, one of my favorite movies of all time! And, as far as sequels go (and poor Michelle had to survive the flop 'Grease 2'), this is as good as it gets - and this is why. 'Batman Returns', managed to do something that the original 1989 'Batman' film couldn't. Hold my attention to watch the whole of it (until about 10 years after I'd seen it)I much prefer this story, in which Batman is introduced to 2 new villians - Oswald Cobblepot, aka The Penguin (played by Twins star Danny Devito) and Selina Kyle, a slightly out-of-it secretary, who is pushed through a window of a building, to her death, only to be reincarnated, by cats, as the awesome Catwoman (played brilliantly by Dangerous Minds' Michelle Pfieffer).Again, Bruce Wayne/Batman is played by Michael Keaton, and is teamed up with the original director, Tim Burton (responsible for 'Beetlejuice'). Rounding out the core cast, we have Christopher Walken (Max Shreck), in his typical scary role, he's famous for.I always thought that this Bat film was the best because of Catwoman. Michelle portrays her feline character purrrfectly as she back-flips her way through an hour-and-a-half rollercoaster ride of thrills.In conclusion, I think everyone should rent out/own this Batman film (if not, all of them) - it's fast and funky, but with elements of weepy-drama mixed in. Near perfect! 8/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Maybe more Burton than Batman, but an exciting visual feast from start to finish","What got Tim Burton to come back to the Batman franchise as a director was, at least in part, being offered doing a ""Burton"" film. His kind of film. The comic book roots are still visible, but the touch of the man definitely shines through. The Gothic visuals are a definite plus, and really work well with the characters(whom Burton treats with the right amount of screen-time each... it's note-worthy that the first character seen who links this to the first film *isn't* the title character). The grotesque villains and imagery works as well as it did in the first film, although it may at times become silly. The development is quite good, and this manages to provide motivation for several main characters. It also keeps to a quite high pace, without being overwhelming or hurried. The acting is great. For almost all of the film, I wasn't thinking that I was watching Danny DeVito portray The Penguin... I was watching The Penguin. He disappeared into that role. Michelle Pfeiffer does marvelous as both Kyle and Catwoman(and this one actually uses a *real* whip), and also shines in all her scenes(and her on-screen growth and transformation is an accomplishment). Keaton brings the Bat alive again, and does well as Bruce Wayne, too. Walken is creepy as usual, and he really adds to the film. The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered, throughout. The humor is just about perfect, it never goes too far, and never tries too hard, but the film definitely delivers some (intentional) laughs. The plot, while it does perhaps suffer from what appears to be interference by the studio to keep the character of Harvey Dent out of the film, is magnificent. It all comes together and works. The production design is excellent. The sets, the costumes, props, everything. The film is dark, the tone and feel, throughout. It is most definitely *not* for children. The sexuality and violence alone should tell anyone that. The special effects are expertly done throughout. The direction, cinematography and editing are excellent. This may not be quite as much of an achievement as the first, and have fewer iconic shots and details, but it is definitely a worthy sequel. You may also want to give the commentary track, by Burton, a listen. I recommend this to any fan of the first, the characters, and the people involved in putting this on the big screen. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A very special Christmas episode...,"Batman at X-Mas......OK, I'm interested.Originally to cast Annette Benning, the CatWoman role seemed to be in safe hands with Ms. Michelle. And Danny DeVito being allowed his freedom of range in playing the Penguin was a great touch. Add some Walken, and we have a film.Not as big a blockbuster as the original, it still carried well. Unfolding a bit slowly and seemingly a bit mixed, it didn't quite follow the comic lore, but, neither did any of the other films in the original quadrilogy.Keaton played his role a bit better this time around, but was also given more script and screen in and out of the mask. He also had the advantage of being the original.Plan on the popcorn, but no breaks allowed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Fantastic, best in the franchise after Dark Knight","Tim Burton's Batman Returns is my second favourite Batman movie thus far. It's pretty underrated, stylishly cheeky and full of ornate, wonderfully oppressive, melancholic set design and drips with a Gothic sensability that only Burton included in his versions, and seems to be missing from the franchise these days. It's dark, comical and just a little bit campy, always a winning combination. Michael Keaton steps back into the batsuit for a second time, and he's even more somber and downbeat than in Burton's original 1989 film. Keaton is so talented, and one only needs to look at his zany work in Beetlejuice and compare it to the heft and restraint he shows as the caped crusader to see this. Here he's faced with a snowy, blackened and endlessly corrupt Gotham City, this time under siege from three wildly different villains. Danny Devito plays Oswald Cobblepot, a.k.a. The Penguin, in what is probably the most outlandish character in the otherwise grim film. He's a bad tempered, knobbly little gremlin, encased in sallow makeup and sporting disgusting, pasty little flippers. It's hard to tell it's even Devito at all until that little smart ass mouth opens up to hurl calculated obscenities at anyone and everyone. He aims to be mayor, and only in freaky deaky Gotham would a plan like that ever be taken seriously, from a sewer dwelling, animalistic mobster with an army of clowns following him. Christopher Walken plays evil, ghoulish Max Schreck, an amoral monster of a businessman with nefarious plans of his own, and a haircut that would make Andy Warhol run for cover. Last and most memorable is Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle, Schreck's awkward, meek secretary who eventually becomes Catwoman. And what a Catwoman she is. Forget Anne Hathaway, Julie Newmar take a number, and we won't even mention Halle Berry. No one played the pussy quite like Pfeiffer. She's got a shiny, skin tight outfit with the body to match, a sassy, sexy attitude, a whip smart mouth on her and just a hint of psychosis, making her my favourite film incarnation of the character. ""Meow"" she purrs sensually as an incendiary bomb detonates behind her. Damn. They all get wrapped up in various schemes and scams. Penguin wants ultimate power, which apparently involves kidnapping a bunch of infants. Schreck wants ruthless progress to tear Old Gotham up in worship of the almighty dollar, and Catwoman is content to slash and burn everyone's plans, until she gets a bit of a smolder in her eye for Batman, providing some electric sexual tension between the two of them that's a highlight of the film. Neither of them are sure whether they want to kiss or kill, fight or fcvck the other, and it's devilishly entertaining watching them hash out their hormones in naughty little action sequences and slow, slinky intimate scenes, involving both Bruce and Selina as well as their feral alter egos. Their chemistry revolves at the center of the piece, with all manner of circus sideshow madness happening around them. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough diligently put in work as Commissioner Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth, with Doug Jones, Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryarniarski and Paul Reubens rounding out the roster. Burton outdid himself with style on this one, his trademark eye for loving detail laboriously employed here to the point where it surpasses the artistry of a comic book and starts to look like some mad dream of Vincent Price. He dipped his toe in the water of the Batman universe with his first outing. Here he plunges headlong into it and fully commits to a style and tone that's distilled to a satisfactory point that he wasn't quite at with Batman 1989. A treasure in the franchise, and a wicked fun film at that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Bat-tastic,"This has the classic Burton touches of the prequel, as a dark and intimidating Gotham is menaced by killer clowns, fire eaters and a lady with a poodle(!) The imagination this chap displays is so off the chart, he was only ever going to be a brilliant director, or a permanent asylum patient. Fortunately, it hasn't just got one mildly compelling character in The Joker like numero uno, but three riveting ones in The Penguin, Catwoman and even Max Shreck, played by the ever-reliable Christopher Walken. Batman still feels like a bit-part player in his own movie, but with so much going on, who cares? Every minute something wild and wacky happens, but if you think the film lacks heart... Wait until you see the ending. The fates of two of the cast are movingly poignant, but lay to rest the argument that Burton is just a visual director. Then again, if you'd seen Edward Scissorhands, you'd know that already...",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
It's better than the first in many ways. A visual masterpiece.,"My Take: Definitely the best of the original BATMAN movies.The first BATMAN, although not entirely a perfect film, manages to capture the real atmosphere and dark-comic tradition, much missed in the campy 1960's TV series with Adam West. BATMAN RETURNS continues that tradition, being even more darker than the first. The film was heavily criticized for this, but I hardly see the reason why. It comes to show how creative this film is. It's better than the first film in many ways. A visual masterpiece, no doubt about it, and one of the better comic-book adaptations out there, perhaps since SUPERMAN in 1978.Director Tim Burton, who also directed the first film, gives twice as much creativity to this sequel. Coping, as well, to a more bizarre and oftentimes deeper plot. The film opens with a mean-spirited one, showing a wealthy couple throwing their deformed child to the sewer on a Christmas night, while we follow the cradle floating down the deep sewer and found by a group of penguins who take refuge there. This scene will definitely scare the kids a bit. More will they get scared when they actually meet The Penguin (Danny DeVito). The terrific (or is that terrifying) make-up by Stan Winston is sure to give nightmares.Besides The Penguin, we also have Catwoman (played voluptuously by Michelle Pfieffer), whose origin is yet another scene I wouldn't recommend you let the kids too see. Pfieffer, indeed, is a terrific femme fatale. Christopher Walken provides a convincing, yet not much used, villain as Max Schrek, Gotham's biggest tycoon who plans to create a power plant, which has a drawback that would drain the city's power.The film, while the first had writers Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, has a new writer, Daniel Waters. Waters gives the film a more deeper story, which highlights, this time, more on the villains. Whereas the first film focused on Bruce Wayne's reflection on the death of his parents, this time, it focused on The Penguin, yearning to find his parents, and find out why they hated him badly. Rarely has there been a film that, as well, focuses on the back story of the bad guys. Even more less on superhero movies, but BATMAN RETURNS gives us that unique quality.But the great story isn't the only great thing about the film, we also get Burton's great direction. He gives the film both it's deep, dark tradition, as well as his dose of the bizarre and the weird. Danny Elfman's music is terrific, a cross between a superhero film and a dark gloomy film. Stefan Szapsky's photography works as well. It gives the film the film noir-ish atmosphere.At the ending of the first BATMAN, I had a good time, but got the feeling that I could have gotten more. But as the credits rolled in BATMAN RETURNS, it had me gutless and panting, because I got more than I expected, for a sequel.In the end, BATMAN RETURNS does its job, and does it well. It's not a film that I would recommend young kids too see, even if it's a film that usually appeals to them. But anyone above the age of any kid will enjoy this dark and impressive comic book movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A dark and brooding vision!,"We're in the year 1992. Its been 3 years since the release of the critically acclaimed Batman (1989) and the fans are standing in line eagerly awaiting the follow-up. There premiere arrives and the fans are... divided. Batman Returns has a stellar cast who provided excellent performances and the film was even darker than it predecessor and it featured even more action so why was the film not as successful as the original. I am a great fan of Burton and I love his work but I have to blame him for not making as good a film as the first. ""Why?"" You ask. Burton had complete creative control with this one and therefore it is a much more personal film but he did turn Batman into a side-kick in his own movie (he did in the first film as well but in this one we barely get to see him). Without any reins Burton went completely overboard in darkness and brooding. He also turned a sophisticated villain from the comics into a bloody animal. That being said this is far from a bad movie it simply falls into the category; not as good as the original.The performances from the cast are good, no exceptions. Michael Keaton returns with his wonderfully manic interpretation of the character that is Bruce Wayne/Batman and I for one believes that he deserves the cult following he has as the character because he is excellent. Luckily Batman's love interest was replaced with an actress with talent this time around. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman and arguably gives the best performance in the entire film. Her transition from boring office secretary to irresistible temptress is excellent and more importantly believable. Danny DeVito does a great job in spite of a character that just doesn't cut it. I love DeVito but I just can't take the character seriously and he never becomes a true menace to Batman the way the Joker did. Christopher Walken is great as well. His portrayal of the power-frenzied maniac is pure joy to watch. He is a true scene stealer and a much more credible villain than the Penguin in this movie.The score is pretty flawless but that is what one has come to expect out of Danny Elfman who is one of the most talented composers in the industry. His score elevates every scene, be it a quiet scene in front of a fireplace or a fight scene on a rooftop. In short he is brilliant. Two thumbs way up. In fact the soundtrack is one of the only things that are superior to the original which was marred by Prince's very 80's sound.The film certainly has merits and quite a few but in spite of these merits the film is simply too Burtonesque and too many liberties is taken with the source material and therefore Batman Returns stands as a good albeit flawed addition to the Batman franchise. However, this was the last good Batman film in 13 years. Burton made the Batman franchise only for Joel Schumacher to kill it. In the end though Batman Returns is an entertaining film with a few problems.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Tim Burton's Best Work Ever!,"""Batman Returns"" was my favorite film in high school as no matter what grade level I was in, it kept getting weirder. The more I thought about this film, it looked like a three way circus dealing with a hero torn apart, a freak show who wanted the majority popularity and a Cinderella story where the woman wanted a better life for herself. To most fans, ""Batman Returns"" was a better adaptation of the comic book than the original, and you know what, they were right.The film's prologue takes place in 1962 of Gotham City where the Cobblepots couldn't be happier with the birth of their first child; yet to know that there son looked hideous like a burned kid going to school, the parents decide to get rid of their son by dumping him in the lake where it takes him to the sewers of Gotham City where thirty years later, the hideous son would grow up to be the mysterious Penguin.Gotham City is pretty quiet on Christmas Eve where no mouse would be stirring, and the deal on making a power plant in Gotham City from Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is no laughing matter. What the mayor and everybody else don't know is that Max wants to take all of the surplus energy from the sources in Gotham City in order to keep the plant alive. During a speech in Gotham City's fairground, a group of clowns called The Red Triangle Circus Gang attack the citizens of Gotham as it is up to Batman and not the cops to handle it.After battling it out with The Joker and losing Vicky Vale, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) returns as the dark knight and dukes it out with the gang members as he saves Schreck's mousy secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Phiffer) from getting killed. After the incident, Schreck gets kidnapped by some sewer thugs and take him to see the local crime boss The Penguin (Danny DeVito) as he tells Schreck that he wants to be a citizen of Gotham without anybody getting wise and to be loved as he bribes Schreck by showing him all the crap that he once destroyed. So the deal is made and Schreck needs to come up with a plan.Selina Kyle's life is never easy as her comes home from Schreck's Enterprise where from phone call after another, its another story. Until she gives herself a message that she has to file some paperwork for the Bruce Wayne meeting for Schreck's appointment. She discovers what Max is trying to do with the new plans for the power plant and is killed from Schreck as he throws her out the window. Street cats resurrect her as she wakes up dazed and fed up of the life she once lead and starts a new life, calling herself Catwoman.The Penguin's popularity in Gotham City is more than a jock or a hustler would have, as Batman wants to find out what angle the Penguin is getting at. Now with Schreck on the wing of a dragon, he gets The Penguin involved in politics where if the original mayor can't take his job anymore, then The Penguin would win leaving him and his gang of clowns to wreck havoc on Gotham City.During the film, Batman encounters The Penguin as he finds out the schemes he's trying to pull, not to mention the new female vigilante that has been all over Gotham newspapers. During a fight scene with the caped crusader, Catwoman has a thing for the man in black where like Spider-Man and the Black Cat, the new vixen wants to be in the bat's world. Sooner or later the two lovers find out each other's identity in a famous dance sequence where The Penguin crashes the party.I know there are some people out there that might not like ""Batman Returns"" but you know what, that's okay. The film is much better in set designs, original score, even more erotic than the first film. Just like my days in high school, Batman Returns is a fun house with surprises coming from left and right and there's no stopping the madness.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Batman, and Catwoman Are Up To Par, but the Pitiful Penguin Ruins The Sequel","Batman Returns is the 1992 sequel to the original 1989 Batman movie. Most of the original cast returns, and Batman faces two new- but familiar foes. The Penguin played by Danny DeVito, and the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeiffer emerge to wreck havoc upon Gotham City and cause Batman even more problems.The movie is not the blockbuster that the first film was, and is too grotesque and gloomy to be appreciated by young children. This is a cold, dark film, filled with pity and shame.The movie opens with the wealthy parents of a deformed baby, putting him into a baby carriage, and dropping him into the Gotham River on a cold winter evening. They don't care if their baby lives or dies or gets devoured by wild animals. The baby floats downstream into the city's sewers, where he is rescued and raised by penguins. Thirty-three years late,r the baby emerges out of the sewers fully grown, with an arched back, a deformed nose, and claws. Going by the name Oswald Cobblepot, the pitiful creature has only one goal in life, to discover who his parents were, and find out why they dumped him like garbage.Cobblepot, later in the movie, becomes vengeful at the citizens of Gotham City for living the fulfilled lives that he had been cheated out of. As Cobblepot emerges from the sewers, newspaper stories circulate about the mysterious penguin-man threatening Gotham City. Oswald is outraged at the fear and scorn he receives, and refuses to allow anyone to call him Penguin. But later, feelings of hate, greed, and vengeance overcome him, and Penguin is the only name he wants to be known by. The Penguin unlike the Joker in the original Batman movie is a pitiful, depressing creature. I felt so sorry for him I was ready to cry. How could his birth parents be so cruel to him? This kind of dark story may have worked for ""The Elephant Man"", or maybe even ""The Sixth Sense"", but not for ""Batman"". ""Batman"" is supposed to be based on a comic book character, played out for action, adventure, and even laughs. This is not supposed to be a serious dramatic tragedy, like Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"", or even ""Great Expectations."" Like in the original ""Batman"" film, Batman is portrayed as a loner, an oddball who happens to be on the right side of the law. Even though he is summoned by Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) via the Batsignal to handle a recent crime wave, he is still feared by many people in Gotham City because of his scientific genius and mystique. Keaton is not as wooden and comical as Adam West (the original Batman) was, but is completely overshadowed by the pitiful Penguin, and the fetishistic Catwoman.Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Max Shreck's (Christopher Walken) secretary curiously stumbles upon her bosses scheme to control Gotham City. She then is thrown to her death by the evil tycoon, so that there won't be any witnesses to his illegal activity. Pfeiffer however, is licked back to life by alley cats, and later becomes Catwoman. Catwoman sews up her own fetish costume and mask, and vows vengeance on Shreck and the rest of Gotham City ESPECIALLY THE MEN.Catwoman being a ""cat"" has nine lives, one of which she loses courtesy of Shreck, one courtesy of Batman, and one courtesy of Penguin after she tells him that he is too ugly to deserve her affections. The Penguin attached her to his flying umbrella, and she flies off to her third death, in a scene of outstanding special effects and creativity by director Tim Burton. Now this is one fantasy sequence that is classic comic book Batman. Later in the movie, in the Penguin's hideout, she loses her fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lives when Shreck pulls his gun on her and also Batman. Will she also lose her eighth and ninth? I enjoyed Tim Burton's special effects, his dark, brooding Gotham City set and skyline. There were some good acting performances especially by Michelle Pfeiffer, but ""Batman Returns"" spends too much time dwelling on the shame and hurt of Oswald being dumped and abandoned by his birth parents. This type of screenplay is certainly not meant for the young audience that superhero films are supposed to appeal to appeal to. Maybe if ""Batman Returns"" had some comic relief, and comical characters to deliver it, it would have been better. But the character who we empathize with most with is the Penguin who is not sinister or goofy but pitiful. This is not what comic book Batman is supposed to be about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"""I was their number one son and they treated me like number two.""","My brother and I walked out of the theater in 1992 feeling like our souls had just been crushed. We had both loved Batman so we eagerly anticipated its sequel and we came away disappointed by what seemed like a bloated mess of a sequel with too many villains, too much humor, and no clear focus. We also both hated the Max Shreck character played by Christopher Walken and felt he was just in the way of things. Time has altered my opinions on this film a great deal but I include my initial teenage reaction for comparison. I still feel it's a flawed movie and one that often feels more like a director's cut than your average edited-down theatrical release. As a whole, I'm not sure the narrative of the movie is at all times clear and a lot of that does have to do with juggling several plot lines and main characters. I'm still not entirely convinced Christopher Walken is necessary to the movie at all, though like most people I do enjoy his performance. Which is kind of my opinion on Batman Returns in a nutshell: there's a lot to enjoy but on the whole it's a movie that could stand a good trimming.Michael Keaton is a very good Batman. Perhaps the best ever. But once again, the focus is on the villains. Danny DeVito's Penguin is gruesome and miles apart from his comic book counterpart. I never really had a problem with this as I always thought the Penguin was a lame villain anyway. At least DeVito's is scary. There's also a good deal of dark humor to be had with him and some camp value, such as his assault on Gotham with penguins mounted with missiles. That part's admittedly more adorable than exciting, though. Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy Catwoman has become an iconic movie character in her own right; the standard by which all other Catwomen are judged. So far they've come up short. She has many of the movie's best lines. Christopher Walken is amusing in that Walken way as an original character for the film, Max Shreck.Even more so than the first film, Tim Burton creates a film full of amazing visuals and eye-popping special effects. At times decidedly campy, it never crosses the line that Joel Schumacher's repulsively gaudy films did. The only real problem with the movie, like I said before, is that it feels overstuffed with ideas and characters. While I believe Max Shreck could have been eliminated and the movie would not have been hurt at all, I think you could have kept him and still helped the movie out by editing some scenes down and quickening the pace a bit. Still, it's a fantastic sequel with great style and atmosphere. Memorable character and set designs, special effects, and good performances all around. It's too flawed to be considered Burton's masterpiece (at least in my opinion) but it's also too impressive to be ignored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Best of the series--Way better than the 1989 film.,"Why is it better?  Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one.  The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward ""romance.""  Here, instead of one villain, there are three.  No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face.  In fact, Pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film.  Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil.  She becomes truly fearsome.  The costumes and makeup are excellent.  Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut.  His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck).  Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman.  Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song (""Face to Face"") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack.  The least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

The true Dark Knight returns,"Batman Returns is more Gothic and somber than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. Also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented Danny Elfman.However, I didn't like the idea to make the Penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. But still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.Michael Keaton made a ""tour de force"" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he's called Batman in public sometimes...Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat.

Good,"Batman Returns was well-received in its American premiere. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. One knows from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. The film is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. It is difficult to imagine that such a dark film will attain much cinematic success. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. With this culture of ignorance in the Information Age persisting, fed by the corporate media, Michael Keaton has appeared in one of his best films yet, and in one that brings humanity down to its root nature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Good & Bad Of 'Batman Returns',"For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman films. It had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale.THE GOOD - Nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day Batman films. The stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. Violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other Batman stories but one is never bored watching this. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a fine job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne.THE BAD - For a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, I still think these first two Batman movies, both done by Burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the Lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. That would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. Danny DeVito's ""Penguin"" is downright gross in spots. ""Grotesque"" I can handle, but who wants ""gross."" Few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.OVERALL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the Batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. Sorry, but I prefer a kinder-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

The First is a Masterpiece and this second not,"The first Batman Movie was so great (a Masterpiece!), and this second was a bad Movie!

Bad Bat Flick.,"Batman is, let's face it, a weak comic book movie series. So Far the X-Men and Spider-Man have better movies than any of the Batman movies. While Superman 3 was mediocre and 4 was awful; the first two Superman movies are the kings of Comic Book movies that Batman, X-Men and Spider-Man has yet to reach. But this one is probably one of the worst Comic book movies ever. Only Batman and Robin and Superman 4 are worse than this movie.Basically we have this short fat thing with flippers who has a hard time walking and he's a big threat to Batman? Huh? Anakin Skywalker from Episode I could beat up this stupid character. Unlike the Joker, I didn't think for a second that this guy is a serious threat to Batman. Then there was the Cat chick, who was rather pointless too. It looks like they made this film so they can have some hottie walk around in skin tight leather.Overall a rather poor effort. Good thing Batman Forever came along or else the first Batman would be the only one worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A decent sequel, but the flaws anchor it down from being better.","Tim Burton goes full Burton in this much darker sequel. While Keaton and Pfeiffer give great performances with nuance and realism, Walken and Devito are so over the top you'd think Tim Burton couldn't decide on whether he was making a dark comedy or a borderline B horror film. The plot is bland, but the action pieces are good, at the end it is the chemistry between Keaton Pfeiffer that keep us glued.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Suffers from messy storytelling, but the good performances do enough to make it worth seeing","Wealthy businessman Max Schreck wants to build a new power plant, but the current mayor objects deeming it to be unnecessary. Max forms an alliance with a reclusive sewer-dweller known as 'The Penguin' and uses the Penguin as a pawn for his scheme (putting him forward for the role of mayor). When the 2 begin framing Batman for a series of crimes in Gotham City, Batman finds himself fighting to clear his name. Along for the ride is Catwoman who has an agenda of her own...The original Batman film was a bit weak when it came to its storytelling, but in its defence its narrative was focused, linear and straight-forward.The problem with Returns is that once it gets going it goes off in all directions resulting in its narrative being messy and unfocused. Many story strands feel half-baked and either start and don't end or come to an abrupt halt. One such example was Cobblepot's desire to find his parents - did that really add anything to the story?The inclusion of more characters in Returns gives the film a more upscale feel to it than the original film. Of course sometimes the problem with having more characters in the film is that they can sometimes get in the way of one another and harm the flow of the story and that's exactly what happens here. Returns feels too busy and never really seems to tell any one character's particular story (everything seems to be done in a half-hearted manner). Even the main focus of 'The Penguin' becoming mayor never seems to quite reach its potential.The upside of upscaling the film with a bigger cast is that, when you have the right talents on-board, the film will invariably be very entertaining. Burton and co got that aspect right and the likes of Danny DeVito and Pfeiffer in particular are superb. The former in particular is excellent and is the real star of the show here (like Nicholson was in the original only DeVito has the edge for me as he wasn't as hammy as Nicholson).If you enjoyed the first film then chances are that you will like this film as it is just as entertaining in my book. It's a pity that the story was a bit all over the place as it did slightly harm what was otherwise an enjoyable film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
An equally great sequel!,"I came across this movie with its predecessor at the store and i just had to buy them, i watched them both being left unable to pick a favorite batman movie, Michael Keaton returns just as good as he was in the first one, Danny Devito sets the bar high for Batman villains by playing such a disgustingly hilareous character, Michelle Pfeiffer was awesome as the catwoman, with Christopher Walken playing her nemesis powerfully, and don't forget Michael Gough as the memorable Alfred, really the only thing i wasn't impressed with was all the weird innuendos, it got a bit awkward.

A worthy sequel,"Tim Burton delivered once again with this second great installment in his Batman film series, that would unfortunately be ruined by Joel Schumacher when he took over for the next two installments. But let's forget about that and let's focus on Batman Returns.Everything that was good about the first movie remains here. Michael Keaton delivers an even better performance as Batman than he did in the first film, and it helps that this time he gets more screen time and we delve deeper into his psychosis once his complicated lover/enemy relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman comes into play. Michael Gough also remains perfectly cast as Alfred and Gotham City still oozes atmosphere.As for the new additions, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect as Catwoman, perfectly capturing her seductive, brutal and (for this movies purpose) slightly psychotic personality. Christopher Walken is also a worthy addition as ruthless tycoon Max Shreck, making what could have been a campy character into a cool, sinister and collective one.Danny DeVito as the Penguin is the one aspect of this film I'm torn on. While DeVito gives a memorably fantastic performance, and this version of the Penguin makes for a great character in any other film, he isn't really the Penguin from the comics, and this as usual reeks of Tim Burton's habit of changing source material to suit his own themes (see also, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Despite all of this, Devito does shine throughout and his sympathetic, vile character does enough to make you forget the differences from the source material.Another problem is that the script does feel a bit overcrowded at points and it does feel like the script could possibly do without the addition of Shreck.Nevertheless, this a sequel that isn't quite as good as the first installment, but still great nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Weirder and better sequel,"Batman Returns allows returning director Tim Burton to truly let loose and is all the better for it. A sequel that's superior to the original in its style, plotting, villains and pacing. It's also one of the best looking and wittiest comic book films of all time that's only slightly held back a noticeable lack of Batman in its early moments.Michael Keaton continues to shine as Batman/ Bruce Wayne, maintaining the awkwardness of Bruce and the confidence of Batman that works even better when Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is doing the exact same thing in equally terrific fashion, resulting in some genuine chemistry between them.Danny DeVito is incredible as The Penguin, he really leans into his animalistic nature but there's also a real sense of tragedy here as well. Christopher Walken is a lot of fun too, taking what could've been a very one note character and turning him into a ruthless villain with next to no morals.Tim Burton's direction is excellent, he really gets to lean into his German expressionist influences even more than before and the action is general benefits from an added bit of mobility. The music by Danny Elfman is perfect yet again, other than the central theme everything is so new and distinct with a beautiful sadness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
the body-snatcher of batman returns (screen) (cinematheque),"It has the same director, the same actor, same batmobile, same butler, albeit the flavor is totally different. I can't name another sequel being so different of the original. But if you read the comics, the batman of 1939 isn't the same than the one of 1989 or more accurately, frank miller's ""DK"" is far away from his ""DK2"".Maybe the choice for Xmas period isn't very adapted to superheroes because here, the feel is a bit cold and doesn't help a rather boring script:Batman is again sidelined and a bit stiff glued in action. funnily, the two movies taken together, Bruce appears a bit like a pervert and not because he dresses like a bat at night. In fact, each time, all he is doing is seduce a woman, get her in his bed and feel compelled to reveal his secret identity.The villains gets an inflation (three instead of one) but Schreck and Penguin are irritating. That's left Catwoman who is truly the best thing here. Pfeiffer did an amazing job, getting totally in that crazy part. She reveals a wonderful ethic for her craft and a very sexy side of her personality.The sets and visual are beautiful and Danny's score matches and maybe is better than his previous one.Finally, my feelings is a bit mixed but this Catwoman and her haunting presence wins me over.

This Film Suffers With it's Plot,"Although this film is very stylish (and it's able to maintain it that way throughout the movie), it can't make up for a broken up plot that consist of things that are left with out explanation, points in the story that aren't followed through, and points in the plot that feel like they were tagged on like for example, the climax which involves a plot that lacks in build up (it feels like it just came out of no where).  The film also in a way falls flat in the action department as the script occasionally resorts to inane dialog and graphic violence that's somewhat uneasy to watch.  Plot aside, one underlying problem in this movie is that the title character doesn't really play a central part here (it's really instead centered around Catwoman and Penguin).",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"P, P, P, Pick Up A Penguin!","Batman Returns (1992)-I really like Danny DeVito as The Penguin and I think that they should have called this film 'Penguin: A Batman Story!', as it was far more about Mr Cobblepot than it was about the Bat. It seems a shame that Michael, in the lead role, didn't get much screen time, so overshadowed by Danny, Christopher Walken and Michelle Pfeifer as he was.Michelle actually did a great job in my opinion. She was certainly far better than the easily forgettable Kim Basinger in the first film. Even before her ""Change"", her character was far more interesting, but surely she could have been easily distracted if Batman had just said ""PssPssPssPssPss""? Or tickled that bit right above her bum?I would have liked more clarity on her new abilities though. Were they transferred to her via DNA in the same way as Spider-Man? There was no training montage to show her learning martial arts and climbing, so it is the only explanation. Despite liking men myself, I actually found her quite sexy, which was good, as someone needed to add some va-va-voom to the film.Honestly though, I liked it mostly. It's certainly better than the first and for me it has a much better balance of the comic book and the real world. It's still heavily comic in its style and almost quite comedic too, but the other main characters seem to fit without being too over the top. It didn't seem to be trying to be current either, instead it appeared to focus on just being a better film and chose a more traditional soundtrack.Mr Walken and Mr Gough both do their jobs well too, but some of the supporting actors are still a bit far fetched.I personally would love to see Danny come back as The Penguin in the new films. A blend of this film with the Chris Nolan trilogy could really hit the right notes. I'm dreading Robert Pattinson and I just really want them to do the brand and the icon justice. Batman and his fans deserve it.641.09/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Hello ThereThis is Tim Burton and Troupe,"Director Tim Burton's Grotesque, Gothic, Gruesome Sequel to the Overwhelmingly Successful Batman (1989) is a Movie that is Darkly Colorful and Sublimely Sardonic. It can, at times, be Captivating as well as Cringe-Inducing.If Burton Dialed the Penguin just a Notch above 10, and He did, it is the Film's Only Detraction from this Bizarre Bat-Fest. Everyone in the Movie is a Side-Show Attraction (except Alfred). The Penguin says to Batman...""You're just jealous because I'm a real Freak and You have to wear a mask"".In Fact this Movie was so Disturbing that McDonald's Dropped the Happy Meal Toy Tie-In after Complaints from Outraged ""Goody-Goodies"". The Distributors of Mystery Meat and Fake Food had a lot of Nerve but the Studio seemed to Capitulate as can be Witnessed by the Next Two Batman Movies that were more Friendly to the Franchise of Fast Food.This is a Witty Movie with a Very Sexy Kitty, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, who Steals the Show from Batman, still with some Wonderful Toys, and The Penguin, although Danny Devito is Unforgettable and Delivers such a Disgusting, Demented, Character that He too is Memorable.Overall, the Movie may be a Bit Better than Batman, as this Followup is Richer, Funnier, and Crackles with a Bombardment of Bold, Burlesque, and Bawdy Behaviour.

In this  2nd installment of the batman films Batman vs. Penguin and Cat woman to save Gothem city.,Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor.All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

However, once again, director Tim Burton's overzealousness for sets and villains dooms the Batman franchise.

"Less of a Batman movie, more of a Tim Burton movie","It's been interesting to see the reception of Batman Returns shift in recent years. When this film came out originally, it wasn't particularly liked by fans or critics. In fact, Batman Returns would end up being the lowest-grossing film of the entire franchise. After just watching the film again and going back to read some of those original reviews, I gotta say, a lot of the criticism towards this film was pretty valid.Batman Returns contains a rather unfocused story that is devoid of any logic, Batman himself has been reduced to a side character while the Penguin and Catwoman take over as the leads, and the plot doesn't contain any real stakes. Batman Returns is less of a Batman movie and more of a Tim Burton movie with Batman characters in it.Now I, like a lot of people, enjoy this movie more for its visual aesthetic, dark gothic atmosphere, and sheer creativity. As much as I love Michael Keaton as Batman and enjoy Danny DeVito's wild and gross take on the Penguin, for my money, Michele Pfeiffer as Catwoman is the real star of Batman Returns. Her performance is still the best on-screen performance of Catwoman. Her unhinged charisma and highly sensual nature is so much fun to watch. She just steals every scene she's in.Even though Michael Keaton does take more of a back seat as Batman in this film than he does in the original, this sequel still contains some of my all-time favorite Batman moments. I love all of the new gadgets that Batman showcases here like the remote control Batarang, the gilder cape, and that badass hover boat/ bat wing vehicle we see in the last act. It's all still very awesome.As much as I do enjoy Batman Returns, I do think some fans go a little overboard with their praise of this film, especially the fans that say that this movie is the best Batman movie. It's fine if Batman Returns is your favorite of the series, but saying or even suggesting that this film is definitively the best Batman movie is objectively wrong.Outside of its more obvious flaws, if were critiquing this movie in terms of accuracy and authentic representation of the Batman characters and universe, then Batman Returns is a terrible Batman movie. The Penguin has never been a half-man half-penguin creature who lived in the sewer of Gotham with a literal army of penguins. And Catwoman has never been a lowly assistant who was pushed out of a window only to magically wake up with superhuman cat-like agility after having her fingers chewed on by stray cats.This movie strictly works as a fun Tim Burton movie in which he's exploring dark and disturbed outsider characters who just happen to be in the world of Batman. It's also a great movie to watch during the holidays if you're like me and hate most traditional Christmas movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A coldly intimate film.,"Tim Burton followed up 1989's 'Batman' with Edward Scissorhands (1990) and elements of the latter film are evident in 'Batman Returns', namely the wintery feel and characters unusually formed since birth (Edward and The Penguin respectively- by comparison the first Batman film shows that The Joker and Batman were created in adulthood). Even the pastel pink houses of Edward Scissorhands seem mirrored in the pink interior of Selina Kyle's (Michelle Pfeiffer's) apartment but with a difference-this is the suburbanite bubblegum pink of the mid 1980s, when Madonna was actually a 'True Blue' conservative (a Thatcherite 'Material Girl'. What first attracted her to the millionaire Bruce Wayne? Well, Catwoman doesn't actually know that Bruce is a millionaire. It's never hinted at but perhaps it's actually sweet Selina (so interested in company records) who has more money-minded intentions. As Catwoman, she has now moved on to Madonna's 'Erotica' phase of the early 90s.The Gotham City of Batman Returns feels, possibly unintentionally, like a small to medium sized city, as opposed to the towering skyscrapers and cathedral of the first film. The architecture of Batman Returns is reminiscent of modernist architecture from the 1930s and the austere lettering of the 'Shreck' building is like the graphic design from that time.Whereas the first film had the engaging Knox and various other side characters, Batman Returns is very much concentrated on the 3 villains. Commissioner Gordon and butler Alfred have just brief appearances. The assortment of circus-like goons (who are Batman's only real foes) give a carnival-like look to some of the film, slightly alike to Tim Burton's next film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. The best of Danny Elfman's score is re-used from the first film and the other songs do not form the centrepiece to scenes, unlike the way that Prince's did in the first film.Despite Jack Nicholson being widely though to have stolen all the scenes in the first Batman film (he should do if he was paid 50 million dollars), the warm, dry wit of Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne shone through and memorably stood up to the Joker in the scene in Vicky Vale's apartment where he demands of The Joker: 'Do you want to get nuts? Come on- let's get nuts!' In Batman Returns, so little time is given to the Bruce Wayne character that the Wayne/Kyle romance appears to be little more than a speed date. Even Batman doesn't have many memorable encounters with any of the villains. I can't remember him laying a hand on The Penguin or Max Shreck, instead opting to flirtatiously fight with Catwoman. (After Selina Kyle is found looking through company records and admits to Shreck that she knows of his plans to drain away rather, than provide power to, Gotham City pushes her through a window, causing her to hit her head and be bitten by various cats, after which she feels compelled to rebel against her mousy image and dress up in tight fitting black leather). However, no good reason is hinted at why Catwoman has taken a dislike to Batman other than perhaps envy.There are fewer memorable set pieces than the first film, where The Joker used a hand buzzer to kill a gang member, sunk a quill in to another's neck and gassed an entire art gallery (and later attempted to do the same to the main street in the city). Instead, The Penguin's tricks all come from his umbrella, apart from when he injures somebody by biting their nose. The giant rubber duck on wheels climbing steps in Ice World, before later crashing, was a surreal high-point though, almost a nod towards the supposedly camp 1960s series that was actually sometimes quite scarily surreal with its tilted camera angles.In the tradition of Frankenstein (and Edward Scissorhands), it seems that Burton wanted to give each of his 'monsters' a positive side. Shreck is shown as willing to sacrifice himself to save his beloved son Chip (a chip off the old block) and vice versa. The Penguin was brought up in a sewer and, therefore, we feel sorry for him for that. Arguably one of the most moving scenes out of either Batman film is when he is laid to rest by the penguins he lived with.Batman Returns can't top the set pieces, the witticisms or the scale of the first film (I'm sure it wasn't meant to) but anybody primarily looking for a quirky, coldly intimate film with great costumes and striking design will give this film the even higher score of 8 or even 9 out of 10 that it arguably deserves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Good sequel. The cast makes this one despite a change in style and some silliness.,"Perfectly good sequel. Feels more Tim Burton-y and a lot of the dark noir feel is gone this time replaced with a more mystic snowy fantasy type feel. In all aspects that should mean I'd not like this, but Keaton's Batman/Bruce Wayne is still great, and the supporting cast of Pfeiffer, Walken, and DeVito are so much fun to watch, especially the latter putting in a wonderfully great performance as Penguin.It's a bit too silly at times, and I'll still take the '89 movie over this one, but this is still a fun watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Superior comic book masterpiece,"There has been a rush of comic book films lately that have garnered high praise, but what everyone seems to be forgetting is that, over a decade ago, Tim Burton made a film that is easily on par with the best comic book adaptations being made today; maybe even better. The film is, of course, Batman Returns; which can only be described as an all out comic book masterpiece. Quite frankly, everything that could be good about this film; is great. Tim Burton has succeeded on a number of levels to bring us the ultimate comic book movie - the characters, the plot, the atmosphere - everything in this film is right on cue. What really annoyed me about the first Batman film was that Burton didn't seem to know where he wanted the focus. It seemed as if he wanted it to be more on The Joker, but then he threw in some character building for Batman; and the final result was very messy. This has been sorted out for this film, and although it has once again left Batman in the shadows; Burton has given us two great villains to have fun with, and the fact that the focus is more on them only makes the film better.The plot mainly follows a young child that was dumped into the sewers at birth. This child would grow up to become 'The Penguin', and he chooses to rise from the sewers at around the same time that businessman Max Schrek has decided to throw his secretary, Selina Kyle out of the window; who then becomes her alter ego, Catwoman. The Penguin and Max Schrek then team up so that the former can get his revenge on Gotham City, and, of course, the caped crusader is on hand to dispatch the baddies. The plot isn't all that deep or intelligent, but it serves it's purpose and allows Tim Burton to do what he really wanted to do with the movie; create a very dark Gothic look for Gotham City! Batman's home town looks absolutely fabulous throughout this film, and the winter setting blends magnificently with Burton's Gothic architecture to create a world that excellently compliment's it's hero's dark personality, while creating a great aesthetic playground for Burton to weave his tale within.It's not just the atmosphere that makes this film what it is - a plethora of great performances have been added into the mix, with each performer giving great energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Michael Keaton returns to his role as the caped crusader, and pretty much does what he did in the last film. He's never really given a chance to impress, as his three villainous counterparts constantly upstage him. Danny DeVito is supremely grotesque in his role as The Penguin, and makes sure that he holds the focus in every scene he's in. This sort of role suits an actor like DeVito excellently, and this is the best I've ever seen him. On the flip side to The Penguin, we have Catwoman; who is played by the very sexy Michele Pfifer. She looks great in her black leather suit, and her demented portrayal as the tortured villain works brilliantly. Rounding off the cast is the magnificent Christopher Walken. Walken has an uncanny ability of making a huge impression in everything he's in, and his dark and downbeat portrayal as a shrewd businessman is just great.On the whole, I highly recommend this film to everyone. While the substance isn't always there, Burton has given this sequel enough style and enough entertainment value to more than adequately mask that fact and if you're a fan of cinema; I see no reason to dislike this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Equally good and almost superior to Burton's 1989 original. And it's also dark and gloomy in it's own way.,"1992's ""Batman Returns"" was Tim Burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. Gotham City again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck(Christopher Walken)and the plan to make the ""Penguin""(Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham! Anyway Keaton again returns as ""Batman""/Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous ""Catwoman""(Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. Really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played ""The Catwoman"" any better and Devito was perfect as the ""Penguin"" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. ""Batman Returns"" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

So much better than the first Burton Batman outing,"Three years after Batman Tim Burton was back with the caped crusader and what a difference a holiday makes. Batman Returns is very different from the first outing. Firstly it oozes Burton, the musical score that plays from the very outset is very reminiscent of other Burton films, it has that element of fantasy and whimsy to it.The style of the film is different. Gotham City is no longer dark and ominous, but more lighter, there's more colour and the sets and back drops seem to work better and look more realistic. That adds a much more enjoyable element to the film and makes it more watchable. But there is more to like in this film. The villains are fantastic in this. Danny DeVito is brilliant as the creepy deformed Penguin, his performance is so good, combining a dark character with hints of DeVito's comic side. Michael Keaton returns in this sequel and he's good, but again he has little to do really. Christopher Walken also does a good job, but he is less Walken in this and that seems a shame. However the stand out here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Playing the hard working secretary who is reborn as Catwoman, she is brilliant. The contrast between the Selina and Catwoman is perfect, with her Catwoman being sexy, sly and full of wonderful lines; the scene where she says 'Meow' before the building blows up, may be the best delivered singular word line in movie history! There are wonderful fight scenes between her and Batman that touch on the campness that can be found in the TV series and Batman gets to play with some more toys and vehicles. The Penguin's mob and the theme of Freaks and circus's also work well and also show the Burton mind at work.It's amazing how different the two films are and how much better and more enjoyable this one is despite the same director and movie studio being involved. The next two Batman films in this outing had different directors and actors playing Batman and were very much disliked. It would have been interesting to see what had happened had Burton stayed, of course he didn't, but at least we still can enjoy this.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Quite a good sequel...,"The 1992 movie ""Batman Returns"" from director Tim Burton certainly is a good follow-up to the 1989 movie ""Batman"", also from Tim Burton. And if you enjoyed the first movie, then you most definitely will also enjoy ""Batman Returns"", because it is in the very same spirit and has that archetypical Tim Burton look to it.The storyline in ""Batman Returns"", as written by Daniel Waters and Sam Hamm, is quite good and enjoyable. And whereas you had the Joker in the previous movie, you get both the Penguin and Catwoman in this 1992 sequel.Sure, there were so many things that made little sense if you stop to ponder upon it throughout the course of the 126 minutes that the movie runs for, but it makes for good entertainment nonetheless. And after all, it is a live action movie based on a comic book, so realism isn't really what we're gunning for here.The acting performances in ""Batman Returns"" are good. Personally, I found Michael Keaton to be my preferred actor for playing Batman, and he does it marvelously again here in this 1992 sequel. Michelle Pfeiffer was nicely cast for Selina Kyle/Catwoman, as was Danny DeVito for Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin. And Michael Gough, as Alfred, just always is a well-added spice to the movie. As much as I like Christopher Walken as an actor, then he was just wrongly cast for this movie.Visually then ""Batman Returns"" is good, especially if you enjoy that archetypical Tim Burton look of things. Lots of nice special effects and good costumes throughout the movie. However, I don't really like the costume that Michelle Pfeiffer was donning as Catwoman, but hey, that is of course a matter of personal preference.There is a good amount of action to compliment the storyline throughout the course of the movie, which made it all the more of an enjoyable movie to spend 126 minutes on watching.My rating of ""Batman Returns"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"It was made too much like ""Edward Scissorhands""","I think this movie is the reason why Tim Burton was chosen not to direct the other two Batman sequels. Burton was making another ""Edward Scissorhands"" while directing this. He made Penguin too tragic, and made you feel too sorry for him, just like Edward Scissorhands, despite his horrific schemes like ruining a tree-lighting celebration in Gotham City. Batman movies are NOT SUPPOSED to make you feel sorry at all for the bad guy, when this one actually does. This definitely is not Batman at all, not what he really is.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Less realistic than its prequel, but still fun to watch","A lot less realistic than the 1989 Batman but this still isn't a problem as Burton is unrivalled at creating fantastical worlds that you become absorbed into. The stories of The Penguin and Catwoman for example are less believable than The Joker's but DeVito's performance is almost as good as that of Nicholson's. The Catwoman story though seems a bit unnecessary and almost like it would be better if it were left out and more time were spent on making The Penguin's story more interesting. It gets a bit silly towards the end and you begin to see the start of the fall for the Batman franchise as the films never picked up until Nolan's Batman Begins. Having said that this film is not as bad as Schumacher's Batman Forever and no where near as terrible as the 1999 film Batman and Robin. Worth it just for DeVito and Walken's superb performances as the villains, though Pfeiffer is a bit weird in contrast.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Good but not better than the first. Missing The Joker.,"I saw this film when I was still very young. I have no idea who Tim Burton was then. I was quite surprised to finally know he actually managed to direct films with no Johnny Depp in it.This is a good film with introduction to new villain like the Penguin (brillantly acted by Danny DeVito as he really irks and makes me just want to bash his head with his pointy umbrella), Batman's love interest- The Catwoman, who was also a villain at first but turns out to be good in the end.Somehow, no other Batman villain seems to match the evil genius and a sort of magnetic presence like The Joker, who can make any actor who plays him famous (Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger). Mention Batman and I immediately think of The Joker, with his famed purple suit and wild fuzzy green hair and that crazed smile. I actually love him more than the Batman. He is such a colorful and unpredictable character, the No.1 match to Batman's troubled and dark one.This film is good, but without the Joker the film seems incomplete and hollow. Something just makes me uncomfortable watching the film. The ending is not explosive and very stale. Everyone knows Batman always wins.I hate the Penguin, wish more can be said about the love between Batman and Catwoman. The film is only okay, mostly uninteresting, a bit below my expectation from a Tim Burton film. It is good enough for me with only one viewing. I like the first one more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"The best Batman movie ever, without a doubt.","This movie from Tim Burton is a masterpiece like ive rarely see. Every scenes give you this dark atmosphere, this dark and menacing feeling about Gotham city. A feeling the recent movie fail to deliver ( the Batman 2022 was a Come back to the Darkness)
This movie from 92' , is the very best interpretation of what Batman and gotham city could be.Way better than the 89 movie and even better than the dark knight ( second best ever )
The scenes with the penguin are so spooky, same for all catwoman scene...

Enjoyable...,"""Batman Returns"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch Batman facing another villain calling himself the Penguin while he has to deal with the Catwoman and a ruthless businessman of Gotham City who has his own plans.Since I had already watched the first Batman movie I had some expectations for its sequel and I was not disappointed by it at all. The direction which was made for one more time by Tim Burton was as good as in the first movie and he followed mostly the same pattern, with darkness and plenty of action, something that was an excellent choice. In addition to this and for one more time, the interpretation of Michael Keaton who played as Batman was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michelle Pfeiffer's who played as Catwoman, Danny DeVito's who played as Penguin, Christopher Walken's who played as Max Shreck and Cristi Conaway's who played as Ice Princess. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Batman Returns"" is a nice action movie and I am sure that if you have already watched and enjoyed the first Batman movie then you will enjoy this one as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
I just Love this movie,"Batman - is my favorite superhero.

"Weaker Than the Original, But Still Not Bad","Roundly considered a disappointing follow up to Tim Burton's original ""Batman,"" ""Batman Returns"" still has much to recommend it. Burton takes even more of a morbid funhouse approach to this film than he did the first one, and it's extremely dark in a way that I like.The biggest problem is that neither the Penguin nor Catwoman is as compelling a villain as the Joker, and the two of them combined can't muster up the same level of energy and menace that Jack Nicholson's Joker created singlehandedly. Plus, I always thought Michelle Pfeiffer was miscast as Catwoman, though I liked the origin story they give her here.Still, the film looks fantastic, as all Tim Buron movies do.

Better than even odds within that hardware store movie bin is a copy of Batman Returns. That means whatever you think it should, it's a freebie.

A little boring but not a bad movie.,This is my least favorite Batman movie. It's not that bad though. It's just a little slow and too dark for the kids to enjoy. It has good f/x and great make-up but the plot is a little dumb. The villains are not that great and that's what the Batman movies are about. The plot has Bruce still fighting the scum of Gotham but now he has two baddies to take care of. The  Penguin and Catwoman. Both trying to destroy Bruce and each other. Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as Catwoman and Danny DeVito was also good but the characters were a little dumb. Like Christopher Walken's character. It's not as good as Batman or Batman Forever but it really beats Batman and Robin. Check it out if you like any of the actors or if you just like Batman.

A Rare Sequel that is Better than the First Film,"Batman is brilliant, Batman Returns is somehow even better, my only major gripe with the first film is that it only has the one villain in it, Joker. I wanted to see more of the characters in this world. Batman Returns brings us Penguin as well as Catwoman, each portrayed excellently by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer respectively. A lot of new characters are introduced here and I like them all, especially Christopher Walken, but they seem to push out all the characters from the first film. Billy Dee Williams, Robert Wuhl and Kim Bassinger, apart from a couple mentions, all disappear which is a shame. Still I prefer the cast of this film so it's not a huge issue. An issue I do have is the set design, I thought the first film excelled in this aspect and while this film had some good ones I felt they weren't quite on the same level. Props and vehicle design are still superb. I loved the film, it was great from start to end and I think it's all because of Tim Burton's direction. It's a shame that he finished here as the next few films definitely show a decrease in quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
An amazing creepy sequel,"If you thought there should have been more Tim Burton style in the first Batman, this has a ton of it. With an all star cast of Michel Keaton portraying batman again perfectly, Michelle Pfiffer as a superb cat woman (much better than the mediocer Halle Berry character), a great creepy performance by Danny Devito, and the great Christooher Walken playing the evil Max Shreck. The story is about two villains. One a seductive secretary dressed up as a cat, and a ghoulish mutant penguin who lives in the sewers of Gotham City. The penguins plan is to become the mayor of Gotham and start some evil plans. The citizens of Gotham feel sorry for the penguin and ignore that he could be dangerous, except for Batman. Catwoman is a weird villain. In fact you don't know if she is a hero or a villain. She blows up a mall but saves a woman from getting mugged. When cat woman and the penguin team up there plan is to frame batman and take over the city. As much as the first Batman is great, I think that this one is a bit better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Dark-Knight life,"I have never seen a Tim Burton movie before until Batman. Yes I know. It's insanity, but the good thing is I saw both Batman movies he directed and fell in love. The aesthetic, dreary tone and all the black you could get. The way he blends bright colors with dark broody colors is just genius. For a movie directed in late 80 and early nighties this movie is a masterpiece. Each frame is gorgeous. I loved this movie. Plot wise it was thin but the characters make up for it. I have never seen a Batman movie where Batman isn't in the movie for a lot of scenes considering the name of the movie is after him. The plot is minimal and loses its way mid way through the movie but some aspects of it makes sense in a day and age where power is everything and people are dumb to get manipulated into doing things that they shouldn't. Hats off to an amazing Batman. Micheal Keaton is brilliant as Bruce Wayne and Batman. He's a reclusive billionaire as his comic counterpart and plays it to the T. He is great as Batman as well. Stand out performance in this movie was Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Which is nothing but a testament to Michelle Pffeifer. She is great in every scene she's in and steals the show. You can't not keep your eyes off her even for a second. I loved the transformation she has when she becomes Catwoman, her apartment transformation was brilliant. You just feel bad for Selina as she doesn't deserve what she is going through. When she laughs you do, when she cries you cry with her. The scene where Bruce and Selina dance and Bruce asks her who does she think she is was marvelous. She changes her demeanor in every turn in that dance. I fell in love with her acting. Safe to say she is the definitive Catwoman and much better than Anne Hathaway for sure. Though Bruce and Selina don't end up together in a weird twisted way they are perfect for each other. Shout out to Danny Devito as Penguin. You can't even tell it's him he's that good and plays really well to his emotions and strengths. This movie is a dark and twisted movie which kind of soothed my inner soul.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Who is this movie about?,"I went to this movie to see BATMAN.  I also enjoyed seeing Catwoman.  The only characters I really didn't like the Penguin and Shreck.  Well, in terms of time spent on screen, this movie was about the Penguin and Shreck.  The far more interesting Catwoman storyline only received about twenty minutes of time, and Batman himself was seen for maybe ten, fifteen minutes.  A Batman-Catwoman movie would have been great, but the addition of the other two villains was just too much.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman part 2 beats Batman part 1,"Batman (1989, directed by Tim Burton) was certainly not a bad movie, especially because Jack Nicholson played his Joker-role with 110% enthusiasm, but Batman Returns (1992, also directed by Tim Burton) is even better. Bad guy Danny De Vito (playing The Penguin) plays great and bad girl Michelle Pfeiffer (as The Catwoman) is the best and most sensual Catwoman ever! Pfeiffer in her Catwomansuit is simply delicious to watch!! She also acts out the cat-habits like licking herself very good. And then there is Micheal Keaton as Batman. He was good in the first film and there didn't change anything, he's still a great Bruce Wayne/ Batman.Another improvement to the first Batman film is the story. In the first movie the main woman (played by Kim Basinger) is in the film, but what she's doing there? I don't know. In Batman Returns The Catwoman has a very important role which pushes the story along.The conclusion is that Batman 2 is better than Batman 1 and that there is nothing bad to say about the film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Tim Burton Returns to Gotham,"Tim Burton's second adventure in Gotham City is another impressive film, but it doesn't seem to carry the same weight as the original. I loved that he brought back Michael Keaton and Michael Gough, and the casting for the film's new villains were well-thought, but the film had a couple flaws that weakened the overall experience in my opinion. In the second adventure, it's Christmas-time in Gotham and the city has been plagued with sightings of a mysterious Pengiun-man from the sewers. The Penguin soon reveals himself to the citizens and, with support from local corrupt businessman Max Shreck, begins a bid for mayor of the city. Meanwhile, Shreck's meek secretary Selina Kyle adopts the persona of Catwoman when a near-death experience spurs her into action to change her life and bring down those who've made her miserable.Just as in the first film, the casting and production design are the greatest parts of the movie. Michael Keaton continues to prove he was a great choice for Bruce Wayne/Batman, though it seems we don't get nearly as much of him in the film this time around. With two villains to explore (three, if you include Shreck), Bruce loses a good deal of screen time to developing the new characters. This is my primary complaint with all comic-based films that attempt to include multiple villains: you spend so much time building up and introducing these new characters that it bogs down the story and it feels uneven. The primary focus of the film is the Penguin and his plot to become mayor (and an additional evil plan involving Gotham's children that he prepares for throughout the movie and watches it fall apart in less than a minute of screen time). Danny DeVito was absolutely perfect as the Penguin and he is what really makes this film enjoyable for me. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a hot Catwoman, but she ends up playing second fiddle to Penguin; still, she's given enough development in her scenes to make a tragic character who's torn between her two lifestyles. Corrupt CEO Max Shreck is played by Christopher Walken, and we all know that man can do no wrong.The film's weaknesses come in the form of the the execution of the story. While BATMAN managed to avoid it for the most part, BATMAN RETURNS jumps right in with a bit of camp I'd hoped we'd left in the past: themed henchmen. Right from the start, we're exposed to Penguin's thugs...the Red Triangle Circus gang. So, to match Penguin's circus sideshow vibe, we have henchmen ranging from the organ grinder with the monkey to the ringmaster. It reeked of the corniness of the 1960's series and put a damper on the noir feeling evoked by the first film. There are also plot holes that I can't help but nitpick each time I watch the movie, such as how Penguin and his crew got ahold of such detailed plans for the Batmobile for their plan to blackmail the hero. And, since I'm on the topic of camp, I found it hard to suspend my belief for the Penguin's final plan (his ""army""). Seriously...did the franchise need to resort to something so corny so soon?Despite it's descent into the camp of the 60s that paved the way for the Schumacher sequels to take it too far, I don't hate this film. I love the characters enough to forgive some plot issues and, while it isn't as strong as the first, it's still a great Batman film. I would've been interested to see where Burton would've wanted to take the series from here but I'm glad he got out before the series too a turn for the worse (BATMAN AND ROBIN, anyone?).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Opinion of The Movie Changed Over the Years,"When I first Saw this film, I wasn't as big on it as I was on the first one. This feeling went on for many years and it is reflected in an earlier review I wrote on the film back in 2002. Now, after having seen Batman Returns within the last 4 to 6 years, I have had a changed of mind on this film and consider it my favorite of the four Batman films made from 89-97. It has a feel that I connected with more recently than I did during my earlier viewings. The villains walk a blurred line between evil and pathetic and sometimes this line blurs where they are interchangeable. Sure the film has its flaws, but still I think it is well made and a little underrated. That is a sadness that hovers over the characters like a overseeing shadow. I wish they had bought back Michelle Pfeiffer's Cat Woman for another film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
What is it about this film,"I can't figure out why I like this film so much. The acting was kinda poor, with exception of Pfeiffer's role, which I thought she did a great job with.

Yet I am drawn to watch this movie again and still enjoy it.Michelle Pfeiffer's role was not just a sexy catwoman, but a twisted dual personality of a sweet nerdish 'old maid' and the aggressive 'cat' dominatrix that she becomes. She draws the viewer in to sympathize with Selina and despite the fact she wants to do harm to the lead hero, we still root for through out. Maybe thats why I like this film so much.two thumbs up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good Batman movie","Obviously, the tone of the movie makes it one that is good (albeit a bit dark) to watch around the holidays. This is the time of year for the second Batman film, although I don't think the holiday cheer is spread around to all. However, I felt cheerful, even though it is July, because this movie was just as good as the first one.Michael Keaton is back as Batman and although at first I wasn't sure what I felt about the guy. But honestly, he is quite charming, quite attractive and quite likable as Batman. He can woo on a dime, his subtle humour can be found with many funny lines, and his Batman is a quiet, not-talkative, brooding type of Batman. He does it really well.Also, no matter who plays Batman, he will always remain the hottest superhero to grace the screen.The other memorable roles include Michelle Pfeiffer, who played Catwoman as such a vixen, and although she was on the wrong side, you couldn't help but like not only her but her relationship with Bruce/Batman (and/or Keaton). Their chemistry was undeniable. It's unfortunate we don't see it play out (Since Catwoman is not in the next one). Danny Devito played an awesome although largely grotesque (did you see his outfit? yarg) Penguin, and the makeup used to turn him unrecognizable was very well done (seeing as there was no reliance on special effects and whatnot). Finally, Christopher Walken also played his role well seeing as it varied incredibly from his usual nutty roles in other films.

But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say?

Batman Returns,"Where the first Batman film was divisive in my opinion, I found this film a better vision than the first. Director Tim Burton demonstrates his amazing eye for the camera, crafting a gothic tragedy as well as a creative deviation from the comics. Despite the characters being obvious departures from their comic origins, the creative and artistic angle that is brought to them is impressive. This is only accompanied by iconic performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer, bringing flair and a sense of tragedy to their roles. Although this film is brighter than the first, the film continues the lack of definition from its title character. Through lacking a clear reason as to why he fights crime and the lack of what defines him as a hero, Batman's greatest aspects of being a hero are lost in translation. This film does improve upon the first with its artistic liberties and brilliant performances, but lacks in the most important aspects of its main character which makes the viewing experience at times feel empty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Batman did return, but after this film Burton didn't.","This Batman film at the time of its release was thought of as a bit of a disappointment. Sure it did quite well at the box office, but really did not compare to the first one. The reviews were lukewarm at best, quite incendiary at their worst. I believe it had multiple razzie nominations and I do believe Danny DeVito actually won for worst performance. However, over the years for reasons unknown to me it has gained a following, now it is often said to be the best of the original four films. At one point it had a 6.2 score on IMDb, but now sports a 7.0. What changed? I have no clue as to me it is not the disappointment it was then, but I still thought the first film was better. Burton went darker with this one, at the same time in areas he went lighter. This one is a sequel, yet other than a throw away line about Viki Vale and a few of the same actors this film almost feels like a totally different film in some regards. Still, it is my second favorite film of the original four films, though it is a set of sequels that change up the formula so often that you hardly can tell they are connected when you compare Batman and Robin to the first film.The story has a strange circus gang on the attack, things get a bit out of hand and Commissioner Gordon calls on Batman. Did not take him all that long to become over reliant on the Bat now did it? Well during the chaos a strange person dubbed the Penguin makes his way out of sewer, part of his plan that is not really a Penguin plan of the comics. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is having boss troubles to the point of being pushed out of windows and resurrected as Catwoman! The boss, Max Shreck, decides to use the Penguin for his own needs and makes a bold push to make this strange man into the mayor. Catwoman and the Penguin soon team up as the Bat keeps interfering with each and plan a caper to frame the Dark Knight.There is a lot going on in this film, and that is a bit of a problem. Penguin's and Catwoman's team up seems rushed, there are parts of the film that seem important that are never discussed again and the best villain is not even one of the two super villains, but rather Christopher Walken's Max Schreck character. Still, Burton has a way of making the very bulky bat suit not look like something that is going to restrict someone's movement to the point it is nonfunctional. The next two films it looks like the heroes can barely move! The suit on display in this film is also the best looking one of the original four ditching the molded muscles of the previous film and the strange tail on the bat insignia. The bat mobile still looks awesome, it doesn't for the next two movies and Catwoman's costume is hot...though I prefer the Lee Merriweather look in the 60's version as Michelle is too pale for my tastes.As for the villains, neither is really a lot like their comic book counterpart. However, Burton should not be restricted by a comic book nor any other director. Seriously, do people really want every comic book movie to start at issue 1? Granted, both get a very strange treatment as Catwoman gains her power from random cats, I would prefer she be just a cat burglar and Penguin's origin shown at the beginning would be great, if the villain was Killer Croc. He is also a bit to disgusting looking. I just do not see people rallying behind him as people are shallow and while they may not burn him at the stake, they are not going to fall in love with him as they do in this film. Michael Keaton is still good as Batman, I prefer Bale a bit over Keaton, but Keaton is miles ahead of the other two guys. I just think Bale did Bruce better while Keaton was actually better as Batman. With them it is close, not so much for Kilmer and Clooney.So I still do not see why people act as if this film is the best in the series including the Nolan films, however, I respect their opinion. One even gave me a list and while I did not agree it allowed me to understand a bit why they felt it was superior. To me, it was an okay film and a disappointing sequel. I just thought areas of it were to strange, some too lighthearted and it just did not continue the first film well enough (Billy Dee Williams...where are you?). It still had a lot of fun moments and it had a lot more Batman in it than the first film and probably the next two. Add a awesome action scene to the end and I would give it an 8, but the anticlimactic ending we got is one of the main reasons I did not like this film as much as the first and only give it a score of six. I still remember the disappointment I felt as a kid as the ending played out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The best Batman ever.,"The first Batman introduced us to the main character, Bruce Wayne by day and Batman by night. In both films he is played marvelously by Michael Keaton. Another excellent trait from the first is the flamboyant and extremely enjoyable performance by Jack Nicholson. Now comes the second film which is better than the first by far. The story is more intriguing and the characters provide brilliant background to an awesome story. I love this movie on the basis of its special effects, make-up, and the performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito. I couldn't have found a more perfect actor to play the Penguin than the incomparable Danny DeVito. He has the movie's funniest lines and creates a character very unique and memorable. The story is too complex to say here since it has many subplots but believe me, it's worth your time and money.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman Returns - 6.9/10,"1. Overall Plot - 5/10
The plot is a bit all over the place. I like having Penguin as the villain, because he is a very unique character. But the Penguin just kind of comes out of no where, and is just a bit forced. Catwoman is a good character for Batman, but it feels very out of place. Almost a bit random.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 7/10
The movie itself is kind of boring, and not the most entertaining. But being a fan of Batman, and loving his classic characters like Penguin, and Catwoman, help a lot. I barely remember this movie from the first time I watched it, so it was pretty entertaining to watch it again.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 4/10
Not too much emotion to care about. The characters themselves have lots of emotion to them, but it's nothing that gets you invested in the emotional side of the story.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 7/10
Duality is a big theme in this. With Batman and Bruce Wayne. Catwoman and Selina Kyle. And Penguin and Oswald Cobblepot. Each character goes through having to deal with both sides of their split lives.That being said, I don't think this movie is super deep. Everything happens so rapidly that it doesn't have enough time to sink deep. Bruce Wayne's split life with Batman is pretty deep still, and there's a few quotes that I like that show this. Like ""Genius costume. Let me guess, trust fun goodie goodie."" Because Bruce Wayne is the real mask.5. Characters - 5/10
I really like the characters of Penguin and Catwoman. But they aren't portrayed the best in this. Penguin is pretty good, but he is kind of dumb. I like when Penguin is smarter and an actual crime boss. Catwoman is super weird in this. Her whole story of becoming Catwoman feels very forced and doesn't really make any sense. She feels to crazy crazy, instead of a super smart thief. She also isn't even really a thief at all in this.Max Shreck is also just not someone to care about at all. And he is honestly pretty cheesy.6. Acting / Writing - 6/10
Micheal Keaton as Batman is great. Danny DeVito is great as Penguin. He really shows the penguin side of him.Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman is pretty bad. She just doesn't fit the character, and feels way to crazy.The writing is pretty decent. I love how a lot of the dialog eludes to the duality of Bruce Wane and Batman.7. Cinematography - 5/10
Nothing special or bad. Just a dark movie. But that isn't too terrible because it is a Batman movie after all.8. Score - 8/10
Still has great music. Not as good as the first one though because they don't use the great main theme as much. The music just feels a bit more bland.9. Editing / Pace - 4/10
This movie has poor pacing. It does too much with Penguin just being crazy. And too much Max Shreck, because he's just a dumb character. The Catwoman scenes are also way too long and boring.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
The effects in this are super good. Other than it being an older movie. Nothing at all looked bad or cheesy.Average Score:
6.1/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
6.9/10
I really like Penguin as the villain. Especially because this is the only film where he is the main villain. Danny DeVito is a great amd iconic Penguin. I like the idea of Catwoman, but I don't think she was executed well in this. She just seems too crazy instead of a smart thief.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"It's vichyssoise sir, it's supposed to be cold","Batman Returns the follow up to the 89 film by Tim Burton, takes us back to Gotham during the Christmas Season. A Carnival gang terrorizes the city led by the mysterious penguin(Danny Devito) a deformed underground Hermit who seeks revenge on the people of Gotham. While at the same time a corrupt business tycoon named Maximilian Shreck(Christopher Walken) gets roped in. As well as his secretary Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) murdered by Shreck and resurrects as the feline burglar Catwoman now out for revenge. The only one who stands in the way of them all is the caped crusader himself(Michel Keaton). Batman returns has always been one of those comic books movie, That's always had a particularly style to it. Comic book films have a variety from light hearted to mid-level camp. Batman returns was kind of the first to actually take itself more seriously than most probably expected it to be. This movie was pretty dark,not very surprising for Batman. Although still the themes in its atmosphere has always given it a uniqueness that few other films of this genre probably rivals it such as the crow or Sin City. It was because of it's tone that parents Complaining caused McDonalds happy meal deals dropped, and we were giving two more child friendly films by Joel Schumacher in it's place. Although the movie takes place during Christmas it uses that setting to contradict it's theme. While everything supposed to be more festive on the surface. This movie just filled with Tim Burton visual showcase and tragic characters. Michael Keaton does great as batman just as much as he did in the first film. However here it doesn't feel as balance between his life as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Pretty much everything with Batman is good, but Bruce's parts don't really hold up in the first half of the movie. The interesting parts more in the second half when he begins to get closer to Selina and pursues Penguin. You get much of the playful banter between Batman and catwoman, but also between Bruce and Selina. You feel generally hoping for them to fix things and when they find out who each other are they don't really know how to react to it it's handled perfectly. Michelle Pfeiffer is my catwoman she embodies this performance. Catwoman's always been one of those few characters that multiple depictions manage to get right for the most part. Whether it's the 90s animated series, the Arkham games, or not The dark Knight rises. She always carries those attributes. She's flirtatious,she's agile,she deadly, she Sexy. Michelle Pfeiffer's version comes off as different from the rest. This movie she more of a tragedy she's damage. She's not really a thief in this just simply out for revenge, and you understand why. When she changes it's almost meant to be otherworldly as cats around her are biting her eyes twitching. Almost like she's reborn she free act more cat like, and losing herself in away. I love the way she acts, the ways moves The scene where put bird in her mouth, that wasn't fake. How her personality changes over the film. You don't really see this character emotionally vulnerable like this really often. Danny Devito in one of his most iconic roles here as the penguin. A villain that's usually treated more of a joke, but at the same time a more sophisticated gentleman. Burton add his style here instead more refined old money he's Heinous not just inside but outside with the uses of amazing make up. This is the most Disgusting penguin ever depicted he's vile and vulgar. Everything that comes out of his mouth is just disgusting from his dialogue to all his Groans & Moans as he moves. It really adds the symbolism to him as a monster more. A lot of complaints came from Penguin. Where he bites the one guy's nose comes out of nowhere. With not as many depictions as Catwoman. Danny really made this whole performance memorable. With Robert Patterson The Batman film coming up, how's Colin Farrell's gonna hold up in comparison. Let's be fair that it's still penguin so he has some weird and silly moments. This movie's actually is weird when you think about it goes for a even more dark and serious tone. At the same time it just has a strange sense of humor. While it's not out of character for penguin, there's penguins with rockets on their backs, the whole speech sabotage with the record scratch. Christopher Walken's character as a whole does serve a purpose, but you're still question how Burton came to that decision. Shreck could have been played by anybody and still would've served his purpose. However without a doubt this character wouldn't have stood out as much if it wasn't Walken. Overall it's greats I love it and I don't regret want burton did with this movie. Shame he never got another changes this and Schumacher took the Wheel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Great movie,"I love this movie, it's definately my favourite of the 4 live-action Batman movies. However, be advised that, like the other three, it's not really that true in spirit to the comic. For that you have to see the brilliant animated series and movies. But Returns is a lot of fun as a stand-alone movie; like the first it features a career-defining performance from one of the villains (Michelle Pfeiffer, amazingly intense as Catwoman) and a lot of gothic eye candy. This time, though, the dialogue is snappier, the humour is more sophisticated, and the characters (while cartoonish) are more interesting. The Penguin, here a grotesque monster who bears little resemblance to his comic book counterpart, is a bit of an acquired taste; I found him hilarious. There's a third villain, Max Shreck (which also happens to be the name of the actor who played Nosferatu--there's a hint for you), an evil industrialist played by Christopher Walken in one of my favourite performances from him. Some feel that 3 villains was too many, but I found them each very interesting. Oh yeah, and then there's Batman, Michael Keaton again. He plays second fiddle to the villains this time out (though he gets a few nice scenes with Pfeiffer). But personally I didn't mind. You'll notice Batman does a lot more fighting and stuntwork this time, that's because the batsuit was actually light enough not to hamper movement in this one. Finally, I'll mention Michael Gough, who plays Alfred--he's consistantly great in each of the movies, and this is his best, with lots of dry one-liners. As for the movie as a whole, it reminds me of one of those screwball farces from the 30s, like His Girl Friday (or, more recently, The Hudsucker Proxy) only conceived as a dark Burton fantasy and with action scenes. THere's LOTS of detail and throwaway lines in this, it rewards repeat viewings. Lots of fun for those of you with a somewhat off-kilter taste in movies, and requires you to lay aside expectations, but well worth it! 8.5/10 stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
As dark as the orginal Batman !!!,"This sequel is as dark as the original Batman movie (also directed by Tim Burton). But this time Bruce Wayne/Batman must face two villians at once!!The first is the Catman(Michelle Pfeiffer) and the Penguin(Danny DeVito), they are great in their roles for this movie!!The movie also throws in a third villian to power play the Penguin, he is played by a very over the top Christopher Walken!!The main plot is that the penguin wants to take over Gotham City and the Catwomen aids in his quest for power.

Best superhero movie ever made!  It's like a PG-13 horror movie!,"Batman is definitely the best superhero movie ever made.  Michael Keaton beats Adam West, George Clooney and Val Kilmer by a mile as the Dark Knight. His performance isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but it was still good.The best performances are obviously given by the three villains though. Danny DeVito plays the Penguin with a sadness but still as evil as every other comic book villain.  Christopher Walken's Max Schreck is calmly cool and sinister, but the one who steals the show is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  You really feel sorry for her, and I may sound crazy, but she deserved an Oscar Nomination for it.The action is great and tense, and the fight scenes are well-done (considering the heavy 'batsuit' Keaton had to wear).  And, of course, Tim Burton's directoral touch makes this movie like his usual stuff: comedic horror.Great movie, 8.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Style Over Substance,"The first Tim Burton Batman (1989) movie was VERY good. I enjoyed that film. This movie is VERY fun and VERY enjoyable. With a stellar cast that includes Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pffiefer, Christopher Walken and many others, one would expect the brilliance and excitement of the first film doubled. However, that just doesn't happen in this sequel. There are some great performances in the movie, but basically there are just too many villains intertwined with each other's movements. It gets tiring to watch with too many great actors getting their faces plastered all over the screen all at once. It feels almost like a competition at times. The scenery is fantastic and there are some amazing special effects but the storyline is watery and tiresome. It is simply not original enough to be an exceptionally good film. Batman has some great new gadgets which will entertain and thrill younger movie-goers and the characters are extremely savouring to watch but I couldn't help thinking that Tim Burton knew this was going to be his last Batman movie for warner Bros and therefore decided to jam all his ideas into a Gothic and somewhat suffocating two hours. This should have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A huge step up,"Much like the film that preceded it, Batman Returns is obviously built from several different scripts smooshed together. The difference is that it feels like either Daniel Waters, the final screenwriter, did his best to integrate the scripts into something surprisingly cohesive, or he got really lucky. I lean towards the former. The three main characters are all dealing with issues of duality, and that can't be by accident.Much like Burton's first outing, Batman Returns nails the aesthetics once again. From beginning to end, Batman Returns looks fantastic, and I love the addition of the Yuletide setting. The snow, the cold, and the Christmas ornaments give the film a distinctive look that when added on top of the noir underpinnings provide a wonderful canvas to paint the movie on. Burton's strong eye also returns, providing strong visual compositions that allow characters to exist in the large, ornate, and incredibly detailed sets created for the film instead of just being a series of closeups occasionally cut with some establishing shots.The story does take some time to get going, though, and I don't really have a problem with it. The first hour or so of the film is really setup for our two new characters, Danny DeVito's The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman/Selena Kyle. The film opens with a pre-title sequence of The Penguin's parents casting him into a river to be taken away into the sewers, and it's gothic and tragic in all the right measures. He would grow up to take a rabble of circus performers and make them into a violent street gang based in the sewers where he hides in the shadows. Selena Kyle is a mousy secretary to Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), a flamboyant industrialist with plans for building a power plant that will work as a capacitor rather than a generator (this plotline ends up going nowhere, showing that Waters' work couldn't make up for everything). Kyle lives alone with her cat, gets dumped by her boyfriend over the phone, and has to deal with her mother calling all the time as well as voicemails from herself reminding her to return to the office and finish up work she knew she would forget. A quick push out of a high rise window, broken by a series of canopies, drops Kyle to the ground where she has some kind of break and becomes Catwoman.Batman and Bruce Wayne is largely out of the film for the first half. He appears at an attack of the circus gang early, fighting them off, and he has some brief interactions with Selena establishing an attraction between the two alongside a small scene with Shreck where Wayne promises to fight Shreck's power plant (again, it goes nowhere). He's mostly sidelined to the point where we wonder if this is actually a Batman movie or not, until the lengthy introductions are done, that is. The actual plot of the film is Shreck fronting the Penguin as a mayoral candidate in an effort to unseat the sitting mayor through a recall. The Penguin, left in the sewers his whole life and treated like an animal, is brought to the surface and feted as the savior of Gotham City, creating a sort of mask hiding who he really is. Alternatively, both Batman and Catwoman operate under masks when they go out into the world and show what could be their true selves.There's a key scene where Bruce invites Selena over for dinner at the house, and Bruce has to explain why Vicky Vale isn't in this movie. For explanations that try to paper over these kinds of behind the scenes contract issues, this is a good one because it gives us a look into the life of the character himself. He has two truths, he explained both to Vicky, and she couldn't reconcile the two truths, leaving him alone. He's explaining this unknowingly to someone going through the exact same thing, and they end up perfect for each other. This is really strongly compelling stuff. It just takes a little while to get to it, but when we're there, as well as a later scene where the two mutually discover each other's secret identities at a costumed ball (where they are the only two without masks), it's shockingly precise. This is the sort of stuff that both makes this film so compelling beyond the visual and is what the first one was completely missing. There was nothing under the pretty surface of the first one. There is actual examination of the characters in the second, and it's quality stuff.And yet, the movie didn't really know what kind of evil plot should materialize. Reading (very briefly) about the scriptwriting process, this seems to have been a sticking point late in the game. What we end up with is twofold. The first plan is The Penguin deciding to take out his anger on his parents on the rich of Gotham by stealing their first-born children in the middle of the night and killing them (grim stuff). When Batman very quickly ends this peril, The Penguin then...er...he sends an army of penguins with missiles strapped to their back to the center of the city to kill 100,000 people. This stuff missile stuff comes out of nowhere, probably put in to provide for a flashier kind of action ending rather than an ending that more naturally fit.The real standout of the ending is, of course, the stuff between Catwoman and Batman, Bruce Wayne having some level of acceptance of his two lives but Selena being unable to do the same with her own, eventually just falling to her own anger at Shreck.If these movies had had more time to figure things out at the script stages, a lot of my issues would have been addressed. As it is, the second of Burton's two Batman films had the better script and came out far better for it. Performances are generally strong, though DeVito can't quite pull off the tragic the role calls for. Pfeiffer is great, though.This is a combination of a smart script that understands its characters with some wrinkles left over combined with a director with a strong visual sensibility that meshes well with the material. The aesthetics are on point, the performances are good, and the script actually takes its characters seriously enough to examine them clearly. It's very good stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

THIS MOVIE IS MY CHILDHOOD!,"OMG THERE'S NOTHING BAD THAT I CAN SAY ABOUT IT'S SUCH A MASTERPIECE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.Tim burton batman movies are so revolutionary that itself reinvented batman ip and brought the character into prominence introducing the dark gritty serious gothic style that we haven't seen before and this was all during adam west era. This is such an influential film that it should be noted how impactful it is and should be always remembered.Yeah, there was short coming such as keaton's suit that became a meme from how he wasn't able to move his neck, there wasn't cgi in this time period so u was able to see the stunt double in some scenes but i didn't care about that when i was a kid when i saw these two films growing up Keaton is my batman and he introduced me to batman (the dark knight). No longer was batman that act all cartoony from west's cape crusader era he was finally taken seriously. The cast is amazing, Michelle Pfeiffer embodies catwoman in every way and the naive selina kyle before becoming catwoman, Danny DeVito is epic as penguin, he stole the spotlight in every scene that he was in, just everybody had their time to shine individually. This movie is so iconic. Keaton returning as batman had me returning to watch these two movies again and it's still as legendary as it was back then. We would never had batman mania if it wasn't for Tim burton & keaton's batman the animated series would never exist, if it wasn't for these movies.

"Batman Returns, but he probably shouldn't have bothered","Batman Returns (well sort of) in the sequel to the 1989 smash hit. This feels much more like a Tim Burton project and much less like an actual Batman film. Batman is here of course, but he has a much more subdued role to play in proceedings and Returns likes to concentrate on its villains a lot more than it does on the caped crusader. It became infamous at the time due to many complaining about its violence and grim tone. Yet that's not the issue, the first film had a dark tone, as the problems lie with the storyline and the ideas the film tries to bring to life.Story: The bizarre story features the Penguin, deformed and abandoned as a child, rise from the sewers and attempt to become mayor of Gotham with the help of shady businessman Max Shreck. Elsewhere, Catwoman is created after Shreck attempts to kill his secretary and she causes havoc around Gotham. It's up to Batman to find out their plans and stop them. The plot is all over the place and makes little sense. It doesn't make sense why the Penguin would want to be mayor and Catwoman has no motivation to do what see does. Batman just seems to be shoehorned into things as the villains are given no reason to be against him and he barely gets any screen time, again this is meant to be Batman 'Returns'.Batman: Keaton returns and he's given very little to do here. His Batman is still enjoyably mysterious and brooding, even if he is too cruel. His Bruce Wayne is pretty dull and doesn't act like Wayne should, he's too awkward and not the charismatic playboy we should expect. There's not enough separation with both roles either, when he's Bruce he just acts like Batman without the mask. He doesn't get enough screen time to make a big impression and has no arch which just makes him feel wasted.Villains: Danny DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin and he's nothing like the Penguin should be. It's just a bad character, he's just a freak and has none of the wit or charm needed for the role. We don't feel sorry for him and we don't care about his plight because the character is unsympathetic. DeVito gets into the role and looks ideal, but that's it. Michelle Pfeiffer is having fun as Catwoman and looks fantastic, but once again this isn't the true Catwoman. She isn't a thief and her interest in Batman seems like it was thrown in at the last minute. As said, her motivations make little sense and she just isn't that interesting to begin with. A disgruntled secretary who wants to try to get revenge on her boss, it's pretty weak for a Batman film.Support: Christopher Walken is wasted as Shreck. He's a wonderful actor and could have been superb in a creepy role, but Shreck has no substance. If you took the character out then it wouldn't make much of a difference. Michael Gough is great again and is given a little more to do here which is nice. Pat Hingle is given even less to do than before and his Gordon is useless, he has about 4 lines and his relationship with Batman is non-existent.Action: Burton isn't great at shooting action and it shows here. The opening fight scene is clumsy and just has Batman letting the Batmobile do all of the work. The little fights with Catwoman are pretty daft and the climax just has things exploding which gets dull. The issue is that Batman does a lot of un-Batman things here. He sets some guy on fire, plants a bomb on another and throws acid at Catwoman. It's very distracting and so out of place.Music: Danny Elfman's score is easily one of the highlights of the film. It is a lot more subdued, brooding and darker than before with some wonderfully haunting melodies as well as some suitably upbeat stuff when needed. It perfectly fits the wintery, Gothic look that the film possesses. I'd go as far as to say that this is Elfman's best score.Production: The best thing about the film is its look. The cinematography is truly spectacular. The sets look aptly gloomy and some of the building designs look great, especially Wayne Manor. The idea to set it at Christmas is also really clever as we get many beautifully atmospheric shots of snow falling and the wintery landscapes. The scene at the party with Bruce and Selina is done well too. Yet, similar to the following two films the writing gets silly. I don't want to hear Penguin spewing sexual puns like there's no tomorrow and Batman looks dumbfounded far too much (just look at his failure to save the Ice Princess). It too out of character and it's hard to know what the writers were thinking. There's no big set-pieces either here which harm the film. The opening with the Penguin as Moses is flat and nothing exciting happens in the climax.Conclusion: At the end of the day Batman Returns is a very flawed film. It has good elements as the look it goes for is wonderful and the score is brilliant, but it has so many daft parts. People point the finger at Schumacher but there's a lot of campy stuff here. A lot of people claim that the film is too dark, but I think that's it just too strange and daft for its own good. Most of the acting is iffy, the plot makes no sense, the action is uninspired and Batman is just a background player in his own film. At least Forever knew it was light and ran with the idea, if this is a serious Batman interpretation then something is very wrong.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Return to Batman Returns,"I always disliked this movie when I was younger. After watching it tonight, though, I learned to enjoy it again. I guess I just missed the comic relief of Nicholson's Joker - the obvious gags. So I was surprised to find myself laughing a lot during this sequel. Lots of bat, cat, and bird puns - real groaners, but hey, it's still funny. Another thing that bothered me was how quickly Selina Kyle was able to become Catwoman - a bad ass in skintight pleather who knows enough kung fu to challenge Batman in fisticuffs. Didn't bother me so much this time for some reason. And Batman was just letting her win The thing I realized was that it was written totally as a comic book. The first one, I feel, has its own sort of reality where people can still see their surroundings as ridiculous. It was a city of straight men surrounded by comic book clowns. In Batman Returns, everyone is in on the joke that is Gotham City. It feels less real, but more cohesive.In case you don't remember, this is the movie that made it hip to inject twice as many villains into an action sequel, allegedly to achieve twice the action. Both The Penguin and Catwoman are getting' up in Batman's grill this time around, and everyone's stories intertwine. What I still find unique about this movie is how much it feels like an episode in a series of stories. Basically no re-introduction is given to Batman - everyone watching this movie knows who he is and why, so the only reason we know Bruce Wayne is Batman is from a quick scene of him looking mopey in a dark room, getting interrupted by a giant Bat Signal - so the beginning of the picture is more about the origins of The Penguin and Catwoman. The Penguin is the son of a high society couple (first shot of the movie belongs to Paul Reubens as his dad!) who is born in a sort of egg shape with flippers instead of fingers. So his parents toss him into the frigid waters of an abandoned zoo. And Catwoman starts out as a shy secretary, is nearly killed by her boss (a great Chris Walken), then something snaps in her mind and she becomes the person she always wanted to be. Or maybe she's just a little nuts.Tim Burton directs with his usual (for the time) cartoony zeal, not hesitating to use special effects to paint his picture. Danny DeVito is very good as The Penguin and everyone else manages to not look like a jerk in a goofy costume, which is sometimes the highest possible praise for a movie like this. And Michael Keaton is always a pleasure to behold - one scene in a boardroom with Walken has him casually chuck some documents across the room for Walken's perusal. He does it totally off-the-cuff, proving that Bruce Wayne is not a typical stuck up ""rich guy."" Great moment, fleeting as it is. And in his corner, Walken catches those same documents perfectly, seemingly without blinking, proving he's totally capable of chewing up a guy like Bruce Wayne if he so desires. It's a good little scene. The whole movie was written with enough poppy dialogue and satire to transcend just a simple superhero action movie. There's all kinds of political and social overtones to the characters and situations. Under the huge Art Deco-Atlas-Shrugged-esquire statues throughout Gotham City, the flick plays like a morality tale of the common man vs. their corporate enslavers. Hell of a thing to do with the superhero genre. Good work, gang!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Tim Burton's follow-up to his tremendously successful Batman (1989) has the same look and feel but just doesn't achieve the same level of adventure and sheer quality.,"In comic book films like the Batman movies, the thing that has to be there, that is at least as important as having a title character that the audience will love to love, is to have a good bad guy, and that means someone that is wonderfully hate-able and has the power to make us fear him or her. The bad guy has to be intimidating, even for us as member's of the audience. Jack Nicholson was able to add his cynical charm to the Joker to make us like him, but just enough to allow us to hate him at the same time, maybe even as a result. His parade through the crowded streets of Gotham City where he gleefully gassed thousands and thousands of people was more than enough to illustrate the extent of his madness and his hatred for mankind in general, but Danny DeVito's Penguin is just not a scary character, no matter which way you look at him.The biggest problem here is that the Penguin teams up with a corrupt businessman (Max Shrek, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken), and even goes so far to run for Mayor of Gotham City. These are not the kinds of things that comic book villains do, and he came off as little more than a hideously ugly candidate for mayor with plans to make himself massively rich off the poor suckers of Gotham. DeVito is one of our few actors who is able to consistently play shady characters who are flawlessly convincing and yet strangely likable, and his talent is completely devoured here in the enormity of the prosthetics that he is forced to endure for this role, which does not do him justice as an actor in any way.Christopher Walken is also an actor who is almost incapable of filling a role without making it hugely entertaining, and he is completely wasted and misused here. Not only is his enormous charisma swallowed up by his goofy mad scientist wig the way DeVito's is by his repulsive costume, but he plays the role of a corrupt businessman that he just doesn't fit in. Like Denzel Washington in Training Day, Walken does not work well here because he is forced to play a character that he is simply too likable to pull off. He does as well as can be expected, and his screen presence was more than welcomed anytime he was onscreen, but the role just doesn't fit him.I love the role that Walken plays, by the way. I am not sure whether this is a throwback to the earlier actor (although it almost seems like it's just too much of a coincidence not to be), but of course you remember Max Shrek as the mysterious actor who played the vampire in the 1922 horror film, Nosferatu. I won't go into too much detail here, but this is one of the most fascinating mystery biographies in movie history, so much so that an entire film was made about this actor only a few years ago, The Shadow of the Vampire, which I highly recommend.Michael Keaton is back again, thankfully, to play the part of the caped crusader (unfortunately for the last time, since they HAD to keep making Batman sequels), filling the role with charm and personality, and Michael Gough is also back perfecting as Alfred and returning as one of the only actors to have been in all four (thus far) Batman films. Michael Keaton and Michael Gough work so well in their roles that it's amazing the series was even able to survive (although whether or not it survived or just became a dead horse will vary, depending on who you ask) when Michael Keaton stopped taking on the role of Batman.I remember when I was in high school I was amazed at how sexy Michelle Pfeiffer looks in that hot little latex Catwoman outfit, but watching now that I'm a senior in college, she just doesn't have the same effect. Instead of being captivated by her incredibly sexy body, the first thing I noticed was her slutty eye-shadow and glowingly bright red lipstick (which is so overpowering in an otherwise almost colorless movie that it almost seems to dance around the screen by itself like the grin of the Cheshire Cat), I was instead amazed at how obvious it is that the Catwoman is meant to have this loose sexual appeal, which I like to think fades drastically as maturity increases. Pfeiffer was able to fulfill this at the time, but I think that she as an actor has matured and taken on more respectable roles since, so that looking back it's almost like looking at some foolish thing you might have done in your own younger days.Batman Returns is entertaining in that it is such a visible spectacle and it is so interesting to watch the new characters, but overall it is a disappointment because it just doesn't have the same substance of the original. There are interesting new characters, but they are little more than strange creations than creatures in themselves, things to be looked at rather than entertained by, leaving this installment in the Batman series as a skeleton of what it could have and should have been. Fans of the old comics are sure to be put off by things like this, as are die-hard fans of the original films, but the kids, I'm sure, are going to love it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Good but still dark and violent,"I've watched this 1992 American superhero film about several times. It's a good film but it is not really suitable for children because it is way too dark, violent and frightening for them. The acting is good especially from Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer themselves.This film is set in Christmas time but its orignal US release date is 19th June 1992 and its UK and Irish release date is 10th July same year. That's far too early to release any Chrimbo-themed films at cinemas in the months of June and July. Who wants to watch any Christmas films during the summer? Anyway this film is definitely more than just a Christmas film.In 1992, many parents shouldn't have brought their children to see Batman Returns at cinemas especially in America because it was way too dark, violent and frightening for them. They might unsettle them. Warner Bros. Definitely should not let children to watch that 1992 film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"""i am the light of this city... and i am its twisted soul""","The second trip to Burton's Gothic Gotham maintains much of what I loved from the first. Burton's Gotham is again wonderfully realised in all its German Expressionist inspired glory. This time it's dusted in a Dickensian Yuletide snow. This is however a bleak midwinter.While the first Batman was full of comic book revelry; the second deals with far more complex themes, is much darker and feels a whole lot more Burtonesque. Dealing with hefty themes of childhood abandonment, psychological duality, corruption, greed and a whole lot of death.Danny Devito manages not to be irritating as the penguin; grotesquely deformed; abandoned as a baby by his rich parents at a young age. A deliberate mirroring of Keaton's Batman who also lost his parents at a young age. Keaton seems a lot more stoic in the sequel; a more traditional chisel jawed hero. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck (name pinched from German Expressionist classic Nosferatu) is well, Christopher Walken his usual mercurial self. The standout turn is definitely Michelle Pfieffer, nailing both Selina Kyle and Catwoman's dual natures with such a deft turn; elicits the biggest laughs, wrings the most emotion and is sexy as hell.Critically dismissed as far too dour in 1992 I wonder if the critics would have been so harsh if they'd had to sit through Snyder's study in Grey that is BvS first? Personally I think it's almost as good as the first Batman. Very different films, Returns feels far more personal to Burton and a more mature adult work. The first Batman though has Nicholson dancing to the music of Prince blasted from massive boomboxes. No contest really.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Batman returns, sort of.","This is the first sequel to ""Batman,"" and Michael Keaton's last outing as the Caped Crusader thus far. With this film, the mood is as eerie as the original film, this time starring Danny DeVito as the Penquin and Michelle Pfieffer as the Catwoman. Here, a corrupted businessman named Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) helps the Penquin to become the mayor of Gotham City; Max also wants to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity. In the mix is Selina Kyle, who ultimately turns into Catwoman. The results lead to a dramatic performance by the tragic, yet frightful Penquin, and the sexy and luring Catwoman. Michael Keaton returns as Batman, and delivered a somber, yet powerful performance, just as he did in the first film. Keaton is, I think, the best of the three actors to play Batman in the first 4 films.The story is great, with plenty of action and great on-screen comprehension between Batman and Catwoman. She is an anti-hero of some sort, crafty and cunning, yet confused and apologetic. Out of all Batman's villains, Catwoman remains my favorite. Also, I enjoyed the music score by Danny Elfman - catchy, eerie and haunting.Some downsides are that some of the actions are a little overkill, like the part where one of the Penquin's goons attack the plaza during the Christmas tree lighting ceremony-a little too intense for a holiday scene. And, I think the movie should have focused more on Batman, since he does have the title-role and it would have been great to have his origins and background elaborated more. Batman just appeared on cue and didn't have a really intriguing introduction. And, Penquin took too much screen time; too much emphasis were placed on him.But overall, a pretty good sequel. Plenty of action!Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
If A24 made a superhero film.,"I never grew on the burton batman films, my generation was the nolan movies. Also, I only saw the burton movies way after watching almost every superhero movie ever at the time, including Avengers Engame.Maybe thats why I enjoyed these films so much. It just felt...""Refreshing"".But something about Batman Returns is just the best.This is a movie about Catwoman & Penguin. These villains are way more developed than any other superhero movie villain in the last 10 years. I love them, its basically their movie. Batman/Bruce Wayne is only in it for a total of 30 minutes screentime (this is a 2 hour movie).Here, bruce starts the movie brooding, alone and misterious, and at the end hes brooding, alone and misterious. Bruce doesnt develop, he's damaged. And nothing changes.I really really like that. For some reason it feels right.Catwoman is the best.

My favorite of the franchise.,"This wasn't a great movie.  In general, Tim Burton's films are style over substance, but man what style!  The good about this movie is the Batman/Catwoman relationship.  It was far more interesting than the romantic dynamic of the previous film, although still not what I'd consider a classic love story.  Christopher Walken is fabulous, as always.  Danny DeVito does a good job playing the character of the Penguin as written, but I did not enjoy this story's version of that character.  The bad about this movie is that it spends more time focusing on the villains than on the title character.  This seems to imply that the producer's of the film don't believe that Batman can carry a movie on his own.  Nonsense!  After all, in my opinion Batman is one of the four greatest comic characters ever created (the others being Superman, Spider-Man, and Wolverine from X-Men).  This movie is also seriously too dark, violent, and sexual for kids.  It was rated ""PG-13"", but I'm sure was really close to an ""R"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

A Superb Sequel!!!,"""Batman Returns"" is an excellent sequel to an excellent film.  I cannot express enough how happy I am that Tim Burton returned as director and Michael Keaton returned to the title role.  Tim Burton is an excellent director!  He has the occasional eye-rolling moment, but overall, he is very good at what he does.  Michael Keaton is absolutely fantastic as Bruce Wayne/Batman!  The Batman suit looks excellent in this film, they really did a fantastic job with the outfit!The rest of the cast is very good as well.  Danny DeVito plays a very good Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect as Catwoman (and isn't that bad on the eyes either).  Christopher Walken does a very good job as Max Schreck as well.  Michael Gough, Michael Murphy, Pat Hingle, and Andrew Bryniarski were very good supporting cast members as well.I don't think I can say that this film was better than the original ""Batman"", but it was very good in it's own right.  The story was pretty good, but there are a few problems here and there that I had with it. Overall, I thought this was a good second installment to the Batman series, but could have been a little better.

"""I believe the word you're looking for is 'Aaahh'!""","Before ""The Dark Knight"" changed everyone's perception of what a Batman movie (or sequel, for that matter) should be, there was Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns,"" reaching sixteen years back to 1992. With perhaps the best cast of any of the original four Batman films (we're talking the Burton/Schumacher fare) and improved confidence by it's director, ""Returns"" is a rare occasion of a sequel one-upping it's predecessor. Sure, audiences failed to embrace it at the time in the way that they ate up 1989's ""Batman,"" but time has revealed this one to be the better film.As Burton states in the commentary track for the film, ""Batman Returns"" is less a sequel than it is another chapter in the Batman saga. And visually, the film reflects that. To match it's decidedly darker tone, Burton gives a much grimmer, much more realistic look for Gotham City than the comic-book look he gave the first. He immerses his characters in gritty darkness, whether it's The Penguin lurking in the murky sewers, or Bruce Wayne sitting alone in a darkened Wayne Manor waiting for the Bat-signal. Everything about the movie is much more adult, more mature and meaner than before, which played a big part of it's initial backlash. Afterall, it's hard to sell Happy Meals and action figures when a certain character in the film bites noses, feasts on raw fish and barfs black sludge. Therefore, it must be said that it takes a more adult audience to appreciate this film, and it's not something for children to be watching -- although I surely got my fill of this movie at the tender age of eight years old.The story, about about a deformed baby outcast from society by his own parents, who takes refuge in the sewers only to re-emerge as iconic villain/urban-legend, The Penguin is almost as depressing as the story of the meek bachelorette Selina Kyle who, after being pushed over-the-edge by her boss, is re-incarnated as the sexed-up, merciless Catwoman. Truth be told, ""Batman Returns"" feels more like a movie about the two villains than it does it's title character, as Batman (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) takes a back-seat role. Danny DeVito is natural as The Penguin, and not just in body-shape. This is a rare case of an actor disappearing into his role, and DeVito has hardly had a more interesting part since. Michelle Pfeiffer, on the other side of the coin, seems to be having fun with her character, and watching her in Catwoman makes one think that maybe she was more deserving of her own spin-off film, instead of the 2004 abomination that is ""Catwoman."" Christopher Walken has a role as b-villain Max Shreck, and really, what can be said about the guy? He's great in everything he does, and his portrayal of the heartless megalomaniac that drives the motivation of each respective villain is spot on.Overall, ""Batman Returns"" is a much more complicated film than the first. Those looking for a typical comic-book or superhero movie may find themselves disappointed in what they find here. However, like another, more popular Batman sequel in recent memory, it's a film that proves that Batman can be taken to extreme lengths and out of the context of his original format. It may feel more like a Tim Burton film than your average Batman flick, but it's also one of the best pieces of celluloid to feature the character. It's a movie that has gradually found it's audience over time, and surely, it's better than the two films that follow. This is, in my opinion, the only film prior to 2005 that gets the spirit of The Caped Crusader right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Less than the sum of its parts,"Watching this for the first time recently on Blu-ray, I was a little disappointed. The film has a lot going for it: a great music score; an impressive use of colour; vividly-drawn villains; nice sets; beautiful photography. The problems seem to be with the plot and the handling of the characters. A lot of the action seems arbitrary, with all of the characters lacking believable motivation. It's hard to care about any of them. Danny DeVito as the Penguin makes a better villain than Jack Nicholson's Joker (the previous film had toppled over into ""the Jack Nicholson show"") but the actor and the director fail to make the character even vaguely sympathetic. The Penguin wants to be liked, so what does he do to achieve this? He's a villain so, naturally, he cons everyone. Michael Keaton is competent as Batman but again, it's hard to warm to him. Even having seen the previous film, the viewer doesn't get much sense of what makes him do what he does. Michele Pfeiffer's Catwoman comes off best in this respect, mainly down to a good performance: again, the script doesn't make much sense any of her actions.The director's eccentricities are initially appealing, but the film just isn't enough *fun*. Maybe Tim Burton did treat the material with respect, but the overall effect is too po-faced. The essential ridiculousness of the characters isn't quite acknowledged – we don't laugh at these grotesque and dysfunctional people, but we can't believe in them either. Finally, the film is too long-winded. With tighter editing, ten or fifteen minutes could easily be taken off its running time, giving it a faster pace.I'll be branded as a heretic for saying so, but I think the third of the initial Batman quadrilogy (Batman Forever) is the best of the four films for bringing back the fun, just as Ed Wood is the best of Tim Burton's films by a long way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

This is it's only fault, however - Returns is an outrageous superhero adventure, with awesome make-up and costumes,  witty dialogue and stunning sets.Michael Keaton simply IS Batman, and it's a joy to see him take to the crime-infested Gotham streets again and kick ass. Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life as Catwoman, sexy, deadly and disturbed in equal measure.

Rounding off the cast is Christopher Walken as Max Schreck, not a character from the comics, but ironically the biggest villain of the three.With it's moody yet rousing score, intense action scenes and cool vehicles (including the water-based Batskiboat and a giant rubber duck), Batman Returns is a  treat for the eys and ears and even the brain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Another reason is that it didn't seem like it tried to be better then the original, which in my opinion is a comic book classic.  It needed a little more action and a better story.  The performances in the movie were superb no doubt.  Danny Devito was unbelieveable as the Penguin.  But the one character that I hated to see in every scene that he was in was Christopher Walken's character.  I don't think he needed to be in the plot because he seemed useless to me.  Tim Burton as usual did wonderful directing when it came to the acting and the action scenes but again it was little too dark for me for a Batman film.  It just seemed a gothic story written by Edgar Allen Poe or something. Not a comic book adaption.  But I did like it and I haven't hated a Burton film yet.

"""Don't Bother!""","Burton returns as well as Batman and in doing so abandons any pretence of real story telling in favour of a retro-expressionist exercise in psychological damaged character study. Even the production methodology replicates the old studio constructivism of pictures made in Germany's Weimar Republic and its clear that you're looking at a sound-stage the entire time which if anything just heightens the sense that you're occupying a complete fantasy world, superbly realised but lacking in the subtleties of plot that would have made it a more complete experience. As it is the visuals are stunning and its a more technically accomplished, more confidently directed picture than its predecessor but for all that it lacks the unpredictable edge of Jack Nicolson's Joker or the epic scope of Anton Furst's sets, here replaced by some accomplished design by Bo Welch. Its rare for a studio to give a director as much latitude as Burton got here but there's an argument to say that he ran too far with his own vision as the sacrifice of story and the creation of a film with such a dark and foreboding centre made him an easy scapegoat for the movie's apparent under-performance at the cash registers. Burton may have got his own way but his inability to properly balance the material and propensity to over-egg the pudding produced an ugly reaction in the studio, Joel Schumacher.

Batman Returns to the Wrong Comicbook,"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns series in the 1980's gave us a darker-than-usual world for Batman.  Tim Burton carried this over in his first Batman movie, but the story was clunky and too mean-spirited.  This movie is even darker and more mean-spirited than the first, and does not follow the comicbook history of the characters, mostly in the villains.The penguin in the series is *not* a deformed freak; he is an obnoxious thrillseeker, who was more of a pain in the butt to Batman than a deadly threat.  Likewise, Catwoman was a mysterious villain whose motives were never explained; the origins of both these villains have been re-written for this movie, which is fine, except that they are ludicrous and change the entire character of the villains to something one-dimensionally mean. Devito and Pfeiffer are perfectly cast as the Penguin and Catwoman, but they are never allowed to breathe as the characters.  If the film-makers had lightened up and gone for an intelligent script, Devito could have had a field-day as a dangerous but lovable munchkin, and Pfeiffer doing much more with her role as Catwoman.  Instead, both are lost in ten pounds of gloom, darkness, and leather.The story is ludicrous, but that's ok, it's a comicbook, so plot doesn't matter.  This is *not* the attitude that Frank Miller had when he wrote the successful series; readers didn't buy it because of the look, just as audience's don't buy this movie because of its look.  If Miller had sat down and wrote out a story in 15 minutes, it would have been much better than Batman Returns.  Would he have written a story about penguins with rockets attached to them attacking Gotham City, while the Penguin tries to escape on a giant motorized Rubber Duck?  I don't think so.This movie was a tremendous, painful waste, all the more so because of the actors involved and what they could have done with an intelligent script. (""An intelligent script?  What are you talking about?  It's only a comicbook!"")   Tim Burton is the wrong director for this series.  It needs someone with a handle on the story and characters foremost, not the scenery. Whenever a movie is based on a comicbook (except for the first two Superman movies), the producers only look at the art, not the story...because they don't understand the stories.  They only understand how to recreate the image.  And to assume that comics readers only look at the pictures.  That Tim Burton would make such a mistake is what depresses me.  I haven't been able to stomach seeing another Batman movie after this one.Three out of ten stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Batman Returns: My Good, Bad, and Ugly","The Good:
Much of what makes this film unique is wrapped up in Tim Burton's aesthetic that was still somewhat new upon release, and yet to be as defined as Burton's films have done in the decades since. But, as I address below, because this film is more a Burton film than a Batman film the stylistic choices detract from the film's tone and content rather than complement them. Danny DeVito's performance is the only real bright spot of this film. While critical reviews vary on his turn as The Penguin, it was even, committed, and criminally lecherous. DeVito really delivers on Burton's intent for the character even if Burton doesn't finish with his own delivery for the film as a whole.The Bad:
Burton's choice to replace Furst as Production Designer for this film, Bo Welch, continued with the established German Expressionism aesthetic of Batman (Tim Burton, 1989) in a much bigger way as might be expected of a sequel. The film goes as far as making literal nods to the film and art movement of the early 20th century in the character and costume design of the film's chief villain, Max Shreck. Visually, this film benefits in the same ways as its immediate predecessor, but fails in that it's more a Tim Burton film, as had been and would continue to be established, than it is a Batman film. And, the detachment is more than the film can sustain beyond its initial box office run.The Ugly:
The easy choice for a film that's done it better is The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008), and it's the easy choice for a reason. It did everything a sequel needed to do, and it did everything a Batman sequel needed to do. Christopher Nolan's trilogy grounded Batman in reality, which hadn't yet been done, and that added level of excitement to the narrative as it unfolded that the fantasy and stylized nature of previous films negated. With the right director finally at the helm of a Batman film the cast really shines, Heath Ledger in particular. The debate on the better Joker can rage for eternity, but there's no real comparison between Ledger and Nicholson. Ledger is the darker and more convincing psychopath that Batman's conflicted duality needs as its opposition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Very Good Sequel,"Though I still prefer the originial ""Batman"" I still think that ""Batman Returns"" is a very good sequel. It is darker and more violent than needs to be an that does hurt the film. What help the film is two supierior villans, ""The Penguin"" and ""Catwoman"". Michele Pfieffer who plays ""Catwoman"" is by far the sexiest villian ever!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A very dark sequel,"I saw this for the first time after seeing Batman Forever.  This one was still great.  The action at the beginning was very cool, and the plot was pretty good.  Michelle Pfeiffer, like all the Batman babes, was also hot. However, this one is a lot darker and more saddening.  Cat woman's insanity really makes me feel sorry for her.  Danny DeVito did good with his character as well.  I still think that the thing they had in common wasn't ""their contempt for Batman,"" as Michelle put it, but that they had a very disturbed psyche.  A good movie, but expect a little sorrowful feel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"The gothic adventure continues with a twisted, darker tone","Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS is by far one of the best sequels ever spawned. Burton chose not to follow the norm, making Batman Returns stand on its own. That is the best quality of this movie; you didn't have to see the first one to understand this film.  Michael Keaton does an excellent job of reprising the role of the Dark Knight.  In some ways I think he out-did his first performance in Batman.  (Ex. The scene where he sits in the dark, alone in his chambers and the bat-signal comes shinging through the window.) Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman had to be one of the best casting choices as well.  If this had been a terrible movie, the chemistry between Keaton & Pfeiffer would make it worth the watch.  Danny DeVito's dark & repulsive portrayal of the Penguin was also a masterpiece.  Critics raved that this film was ""too dark"", but in the true sense of Batman it was exactly as it should be.  Gets 4 outta 5 stars from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman gets the  Burton treatment.,"Batman Returns is the sequel to the original 1989 film and because the previous film made almost twelve times its budget ,making one of the highest grossing movie of 1989, Warner Brothers gave to Burton free range to make the movie as he liked to. And here is why the movie has issues for Burton is a really good director in creating strange characters out of some idea and give it a Gothic beautiful style. But in adapting a character of a already existing source isn't his strongest suit and Alice in Wonderland is proof to that! Despite that I will say that it is a fine movie.So to anyone who has see it that is the reason why the Gothic and funny elements of the first film were cracked to eleven in this one. Now to the story it follows the new criminal called Penguin ,played by Dany Devito, who using black mailing tactics and allying with a corrupt business man ,play by Christofer Walker(!) of all people device a plan in order to take over Gotham and Batman has to (of course )stop them. While this plot is happening we also take the origin story of one of the most well known and loved( By men mostly ;)) anti-heroines of all times and main love interest of the Dark Knight ,Catwoman. Now Michelle Pfeiffer did a really good job portraying the sexiness and wildness of the character ,but let's be real here guys, this Catwoman is less and interesting character and more an loose woman in a skin tide leather costume, no offense to Pfeiffer I believe that you are a great person.Now apart from the strange sex under tones one other thing that ,this flick had it was that it is much more darker than the original. In the 1989 movie, yes it had the maniac the Joker, killings and Gothic image, but it was more like a Nightmare Before Christmas and less a horror movie. I don't know why but Burton did the reverse making is more horror flick and difficult to kids to watch. For real when I was ten I though that this film was a horror movie and I was afraid of it. And the design for Penguin, the criminals under his command and the streets didn't help either. So many parents didn't let their kids to go and watch the movie and for ones I don't blame them for it is more for teenagers than for kids.That had as a results the movie though it had more than twice of the originals budget it grossed far less and despite making almost 267 million this massive decline of gain made the studio to rethink who to make a Batman movie less Gothic and murdering and more friendly to children. Just for the record the 1989 film made a bit more than 411 millions so personally no matter what is send for the producer, if you had that facts in your had ,would you have similar ideas? But we all know how that went.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Still my favourite Batman movie!,"One of my favourite films of all time partly for nostalgic reasons of watching it when I was a kid and being fascinated by its darkness but also that it is a perfect example of how to create a fully rounded villain as well as the hero. It's Christmas 1992; the rise of cooperate villain Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is upon Gotham, who proves himself to be an unorthodox stepping stone for The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman/Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Bruce Wayne as well as his crime-fighting alter ego Batman must overcome great obstacles to protect Gotham. It's a darker and more emotional beast than the first and I think to have this much focus on the villains was a fantastic move. Although fans at the time of release did argue it lost the focus on Wayne, I think it delves into its theme of duality really well because of this and therefore makes Wayne an even deeper character also with another well-nuanced performance from Keaton. Stan Winston and his team perfectly create The Penguin's look which I think is one of the most beautifully unique designs of any film character. DeVito is astounding in the role and is a real career-best; the perfect combination of grotesque and cruel yet understandable with his deeply scarring psychological need to be accepted. The pre-credits scene is heartbreaking and initiates Penguin's story so well. Pfeiffer is wonderful as Selina; another of her greatest performances, a really rebellious role where we root for her to get her own back in the coolest stitched leather suit we're likely to see in cinema. Danny Elfman's beautiful music score is just.... phenomenal. It's my favourite of his whole catalogue and it's truly melancholy, epic and breathtaking! Well done to all the cast and crew for creating an original take on the Batman mythology with great visual and narrative content while also having a good gag now and again.

It was still a good movie to watch, but everyone was going to compare this to the first one and no doubt, everyone wanted this to be better. Unfortunately not!This seemed out of sync from the first movie and nothing blended into the sequel. It's almost as if Tim Burton adjusted things in Returns to suit critics. In my opinion, he shouldn't really have listed as critics tend to have tunnel vision when it comes to certain movies.Danny DeVito is great as the Penguin and does a good job of making a great villain. Michael Keaton is great as the Batman again but has a more comical edge to it.Good movie but I'm glad Burton ended his contribution with this instead of it getting worse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"30 years of The Bat, The Cat, The Penguin fills the Void","2022 is the 30th Anniversary of this gorgeous piece of art and what a Piece it is.This was a re-watch after a good few years absence and my first view on Blu-ray which really made the visuals and sound pop. Batman Returns and The Dark Knight are the two standout Batman movies, stone classics.After the slight disappointment whenever I watch Batman 89 , a good movie with great acting by Keaton and Nicholson's Joker that is spoiled by the Vicki Vale character who seems to drop in from something else entirely. This time all tho notes are hit, Keaton, Walken and DeVito give magnificent performances....And then there is Michelle Pfeiffer, Catwomen, entirely gorgeous in both guises. Something that can never be topped. A great shame that she was never to return to the character. Burton also. Victims of yet another Warner Brothers course correction in their attempt to sell Happy Meals and Be-nippled Batsuits.This time I noticed that the whole opening scene and credits of the Penguin's journey to the sewers is a take on Superman's journey from Krypton to Earth. Really, it is.Great also to see the Penguin in the cemetery bump the headstone just like an Ed Wood Movie which happened to be Tim Burton's next movie.Praise must also go to Danny Elfman's greatest score and the production design which though 'stagy' is glorious and gives a claustrophobia to the cold Christmas setting.A great ,colorful delight, my favourite Batman.With a big yellow ducky...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The decline begins...,"In the original Batman, the villain, the Joker was a sufficient force to oppose Batman. In Batman Returns, apparently the producers didn't think that any of villains alone were of sufficient magnitude so they pitted three, the Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max Schreck, to face our hero. Although it should be noted that the Catwoman is not merely a villain but a love interest as well. Like in the case of the Joker, the Penguin's origin was modified from his origin in the comics. It is more grotesque and the character himself as portrayed by Devito is more grotesque and revenge minded than his comics' counterpart who is more concerned with material gain. The materialistic villain in Batman Returns is Max Schreck. Digressing slightly, I just want to say I am a huge fan of both Devito and Christopher Walken. Batman's role is actually slightly diminished since the villains, in addition to fighting him, predicatably turn on each other. Again like it's predecessor, the props, sets, and special effects were state of the art for their time. Thankfully Burton stuck around to helm this one as well. He would be conspicuous by his absence from the director's chair by the time the next installment was released. Solid entertainment, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Proves the sequel theory wrong.,"Having been born in 1983, I up thinking that every time a movie came out with a number in it, it wouldn't be good. Up until 1992, almost every sequel that was released wasn't very good, or up to the standards of the original. So when ""BATMAN RETURNS"" was released, I wasn't very enthusiastic (despite being a BIG fan of the first). This movie proved me wrong. If the one reason this sequel isn't as good as the original, it may be that it's better.This movie stuck me with me every second after I saw it. I watched the video of it so many times that it actually wore out and I had to buy a new one. See this movie before you find yourself attracted to some of the action-drama dreck that gets released today.***1/2",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Tim Burton's style really shines in this version of Batman,"This sequel is more dark gritty and has more character development than the first one. The last one had some Tim Burton style going for it but this time it's really really distinct. Danny Elfman did a fine job of composing the Batman theme song and can easily get stuck with that tune in the audiences head. So when I think of Batman this theme song comes to mind since it just stands out. The previous movie shows the villain's origin and this one is no exception, except there are two this time. And it shows how certain character got to where they are. This movie might not tie in with the comics but Tim Burton's vision isn't too bad for this movie. Style and vibe of it is similar to the first one but it has a bit of dark Gothic feel to it. However some areas are just not developed enough to the point it can get sort of difficult to just go with it sometimes. When it comes to the penguins goons and some other stuff, it just seems a bit too far-fetched even for a Batman movie. It might work if it's a cartoon or goes in a really silly direction like the live action TV show. But that just isn't the case here. Also the characters actions and reactions are just not all that believable. Selina Kyle might not seem like a sophisticated cat burglar in this. And her origin might sorta suck in this. But she gives off this crazy and yet tenacious vibe. Michelle Pfieffer was a good choice for Catwoman, she isn't sophisticated like I said but she fits the role of a cat burglar for the most part and her voice is cute but acts crazy and rebellious when it comes to her action. She plays the role of a attractive and yet dangerous Catwoman really well. Well after she turns into Catwoman that is. Now the acting in this flick isn't necessarily good but the villains in this really get into there roles. Especially when it comes to Danny DeVito who played the Penguin in this, he was almost perfect for this role. Well at least for a Tim Burton version, despite him looking like a giant egg man sometimes. He may not be as intimidating as the Joker but he can be more comedical, intentional or not. Kinda felt bad for his character, but only slightly. Both villains are suppose to be a bit more sophisticated but these versions are passable although a bit too insane. Sometimes it feels like too much time is on the villains though than Batman. Which is probably one of the reason this sequel didn't do as well at box office. Cause youngsters go to superhero movies to watch the superhero. Commissioner Gordon is yet again wasted in this. When he plays crucial roles a lot in the comics. Lastly Christopher Walkens is always good and he plays a very very corrupt businessman There is few moments that make this movie stand out though, like the part where the Penguin and Catwoman taunts each other. This isn't necessarily a good vs. evil movie like the first one but has other elements crafted in, which might not be entirely a good thing but it works. This flick has it's flaws and not good as the first one although this has more character development. But it's still worth a watch, especially if you like Batman.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Strange things are afoot in the mind of Tim Burton,"Tim Burton probably should not have made this film the way it was. For the most part, it was rather decent in its implementation and design, but it was just far too dark and unusual, like the set designers were in the middle of some acid trip while creating the backdrops of this film. I felt this should have been the last in the series, simply because Tim Burton took this film to a level that was too out there for most regular film goers to conceive. A decent film, but just too much to handle in regards to eye candy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
An underrated holiday classic,"Batman Returns is an underrated classic. Yes, it has its problems but for the most part it's a very entertaining film and a great follow-up to Batman (1989). Michael Keaton is still great as Batman the best in my opinion. He's intimidating yet not overly trying to be intimidating like Christian Bale. He also has a very charismatic performance as Bruce Wayne. He's suave yet cold from his tragic past. Danny Devito is terrifying as the penguin. His performance is uneasy to watch but in a good way. The penguins back story is very tragic and heartbreaking which adds great layers to his character and makes the audience feel a lot of sympathy for him. Michelle Pfeiffer is great as Catwoman. She really goes all in on the performance as someone whose gone crazy and is looking for revenge against the world. Her performance is probably my favorite in the whole film. You feel her pain of being lonely her whole life and her nearly dying has awoken this new woman to take on the world. Christopher Walken is great playing the maniacal businessman Max Shrek. You can tell he is having fun with his over the top performance. My favorite thing about this movie is the production design. Bo Welch created a very gothic and elaborate setting for the film. Everything from the buildings to the just the way people dress is just gothic and very old detective comic like. The zoo is my favorite set. I just love the giant polar bear in artic world. There's a giant crab. There's a duck car ride that looks like a ski lift. It just looks cool and thematic. The costumes are all great. The Penguin looks terrifying and is just unsettling to look at in a good way. Catwoman's suit is very accurate to the comics and fits the tone of the film. Max Shrek's outfits are all over top business suits that really look silly but in a way that works for his character and the tone of the film. The film is very comic book like. The set are straight from comic book drawings. The plot is very over the top and unrealistic, but it works but it sets up the universe in a way that just allows those things. The film is unapologetically an over the top Tim Burton comic book movie and that's why I love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Batman, without the love","I don't mind superhero films moving away from the comics. So don't take my love of Batman Begins and my distaste for this movie as just the typical obnoxious fanboy ranting. The 1989 Batman was a magnificent film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton couldn't make lightning strike twice.I like movies that are Character driven. Unfortunately, this movie is not driven by characters, it is driven by character traits. Catwoman is sexy and Penguin is disgusting. Really nothing more to go on, other then more nifty ways to make toys.Just thinking out loud here, but, are we supposed to like Catwoman? I mean, she's obviously not a total villain, she fights for what she thinks is right. Okay. But she's still not the least bit likable. Hell, the penguin is more likable then her and were not supposed to be able to stand the site of him.A little quirkiness like Catwoman being flown around on a helicopter umbrella is definitely not 1. Funny 2. Suspenseful 3. Enjoyable 4. Quirky... Basically, what were we supposed to be thinking and feeling during this movie? SOme of these scenes only work to try to add a little weirdness to the film, but ultimately fail miserably. Because this movie is not driven by its story, action, or characters.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Better Than the First One,"I have always thought that ""Batman Returns"" was better than the first ""Batman"" movie. It may be because there are two villains this time, but I think that there's more to it than just that. They do still have Michael Keaton, who happens to be the best Batman compared to Val Kilmer and George Clooney. I thought that this was perfectly cast. Danny DeVito is great at portraying a dark side of the penguin character. The reason I love Tim Burton for directing these movies is he is showing a dark side of the Batman series, and of the villains. Michelle Pfeiffer is great at playing two roles as a stressed business woman and a feline-fanatic villain. The story of this movie was definitely well written. I almost forgot to mention Christopher Walken. Even though he isn't exactly considered to be a villain in this movie, he does a good job at acting as a somewhat psychotic businessman.Altogether, this has great actors, a great story, and Tim Burton tried something new for this movie, and made it great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

This one is the one to light the Bat Signal for!,"Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In the first Batman by Tim Burton we had only Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast Batman movie (yes even better then Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end. Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there's something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.Story wise I have to say that Batman Returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's over the top antics. You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman I feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns.So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the Batman to light the Bat signal for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Masking a good time.,"As a kid I grew up with the chintzy 60's TV series (and no I'm not that old POW!). However when director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, I simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'), which I don't really care for. Even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche further but in honesty I don't think there's all that much to tap in to. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what Burton brought across, and this is the reason why I can watch them over and over again.After wowing audiences with the 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gaudily Gothic art direction and Jack Nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well-done. In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is delightful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo appearance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Good acting, bad plot","Following the success of 1989's 'Batman', Tim Burton and Michael Keaton released a second movie in the franchise: Batman Returns. Gotham City retains the Gothic look of the first film, only this time the city is in the midst of an icy winter punctuated by the arrival of two new villains on the scene: Catwoman and the Penguin.As a kid I loved this movie and the original Tim Burton 'Batman' movie, however after re-watching it over a decade later it doesn't quite hold up as well as I wished it would have. Part of this reason is the fact that Batman seems almost external to this plot which revolves around Penguin (Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Gotham businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Batman (Michael Keaton) seems to only step in momentarily to throw a few punches before exiting back to Wayne Manor.All four lead actors, especially Danny DeVito, deliver great performances in this movie, but it is a real shame that the scriptwriters chose to not continue the analysis into the Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche. Instead, we are left with a fairly routine 'bad guy trying to overthrow the city' story; the Penguin character was well developed, but the action scenes in the movie are nothing memorable. Another complaint is the lack of resolution that is given to the Penguin's attempts to turn Gotham city against Batman. Surely the mislead public would be angry at Batman for the crimes that they believe him to have committed, however the Bat-signal at the end of the film gives the impression that this is not the case.On the positive side though, the movie has a great feel to it; from the visual appearance of the winter Gotham, through to Danny Elfman's musical score. You can't help but feel some of the special effects - computer and real-life - are a little outdated 13 years down the track though.Overall, this childhood favourite of mine is worth a look and a film that I will revisit in the future, but upon reflection should have been better. I'm glad that the newly released 'Batman Begins' dives head first into the exploration of the Bruce Wayne/Batman characters that this film avoids.2.5 stars / 5",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

20 years on and still the better Batman movie,"Yikes, cant believe this film has reached its 20th anniversary! I was only 5 when this hit theaters but I do remember watching this many times on videotape. Anyway, I'm here to give the new revised review of this amazing film. Looking back at the batman movies, this one comes off as rather unique. Its not your atypical comic book movie in that it doesn't just have loads of action with one fight scene after another. not that it doesn't have its fair share of exciting action scenes, but its more about the characters and how they relate to each other, almost like little character studies. there's a reason why the tagline for the movie is ""the bat, the cat, the penguin"". the movie is all about these 3 characters. One thing that strikes me is the emotional level this film achieves. Its quite amazing what Burton did with the characters, particularly the 2 villains. In the comic books, they are very 2-dimensional characters. Catwoman is just a hot chick who likes to steal things, and Penguin is just a little roly poly guy who wears a tux. If there were ever 2 characters that were in dire need of a face lift, its these 2. Tim Burton gives them both a rather incredible amount of depth and pathos. Penguin is a deformed guy who years after being dumped in the sewer, seeks revenge not only against Gotham city, but more specifically, its children. Talk about a disturbed individual. Catwoman on the other hand was a quiet put upon woman treated badly by her employer, who eventually tries to kill her. This makes her go into a fit of rage, a sequence in which Selina totally lets loose in her apartment, which is quite a powerful scene and which also shows why I love Michelle pfeiffer. Very, very talented actress. Its in this moment she becomes cat woman. Sure beats the hell out of the comics version. Then there is Batman, once again dark and brooding Michael Keaton, born to play this part, who has seemingly no life beyond waiting for that big bat in the sky to call him to duty. During the course of the movie, all these characters go in and out of each others lives, betray each other, love each other, fight each other. The 3 leads are superb together, and the casting for this movie is PERFECT. I mean cmon, who else could possibly play the Penguin? Seriously? But besides the action scenes and the amazing visuals that Burton does so well, there is something about this movie, a kind of sad feeling, especially during the climax. These aren't just your typical run of the mill comic book villains and heroes. These are deeply hurt, deeply scarred people who inhabit this dark wonderland of Gotham city. The penguin acts and behaves like your usual crazy super villain, but at the same time you realize, why is he targeting little kids as his aim of his revenge? Because he himself was thrown into the sewer as a small child and now wants to reenact this on the children of Gotham. Hes hurting. Catwoman and Batman are both messed up which makes them perfect for each other, but they can never truly be together because of the very things that draw them together. The ballroom scene between Selina and Bruce is one of the best scenes in the movie.What can I say, Tim Burton is a master of visuals, a true genius of dark filmmaking. Such is his talent of creating an amazing and creepy atmosphere. He is, as far as I'm concerned, the only guy fit to direct a batman movie. He just gets it. The nerds and basment dwellers who judge a movie simply on how accurate it is to the source material are just narrow minded haters, especially since its popular right now to hate on the older films in order to ""prop up"" the newer movies. the comics by the way, are not the Bible. characters and origins are constantly changing and being re-envisioned by different artists writers. one minute penguin is a tux wearing, snooty, intelligent human being, the next hes a monstrous, bulbous, disgusting slob with claws/""flippers"" and long greasy hair. nothing remains the same for too long in the comics, so when it comes to comic books, nothing in set in concrete. its more up to personal taste, and i believe that burton took the source material and simply added to its greatness. he took the characters and made them so much more compelling then they ever were in the comic books. isn't that what the films are supposed to do?Its really quite sad to see people and the weird crazy internet culture having this massive hard-on for Christopher Nolan's boring, bourgeois bland take on the character. heath ledger did not deserve the Oscar, and was the worst version of joker I've ever seen. Out of all 6 batman films made, none of them I believe have the same kind of raw emotion of this particular batman film.I also like the film also because it deals with outcasts, of which I feel very much an outcast in many ways so I can relate to it. Heck even here on IMDb I am an outcast, as I hate movies that most people seem to love and I love movies people seem to hate! I hate the new Batman's. I think they are dull lifeless garbage. Does that make me Mr. popular or what? But I stick to my thoughts and wont bend just to make some stupid shmoe happy. So there's always this tension with people because my tastes are different. Lets face facts here, most modern versions of thing's suck, and that includes the new batmans. the original 3 are the best, simple as that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Gets better with age!,"Many poor reviews simply do not appreciate what this movie is and as they say in the movies ""still, it could be worse, my nose could be gushing blood!

On par with Batman '89.,"Hot off the heels off his hugely successful predecessor, Tim Burton was quickly snapped up to harness the reigns to it's sequel. But only if he had total control. Which as this film shows, he most certainly got.
Visually different, (I miss Anton Furst's lavish sets, though the sets created here are still worthy of merit), the film doesn't really seem to be in the same universe as the first film, whereas the first one was a straight up good vs evil superhero crime flick, this one lingers more on fantasy and a freak show element that fully embodies Tim Burton's creative talent. I feel that if the viewer isn't a fan of Burton, or felt disappointed with Batman '89, probably won't appreciate 'Returns, although it's definitely worth a watch, the film seems to almost play out like an opera.
Keaton returns also as Batman, albeit I feel not quite giving such a strong performance as he did in the first one, despite getting more screen time. Although he doesn't give a bad performance by any means, he does seem to just simply breeze through the film. 
Danny DeVito is the next star to portray one of Batman's rogues, The Penguin. He couldn't be any more different from every incarnation of the character before it, instead adopting shades of Killer Croc's origin. He is grotesque, tragic, a freak with the worst case of sexual frustration arguably in existence, he is a Tim Burton creation with the Penguin moniker pinned to him. I like this incarnation however, it fits in perfectly with the themes Burton is trying to convey. Whether he comes across as a strong villain though is up for debate. There's potential, but the plot involving him running for Mayor I feel instead could've taken a different route, focusing more on his bitterness and hatred more directly, allowing us to see just how twisted his mind has become because of his very unfortunate circumstances, clearly painting the picture of the old school horror villains that Burton clearly has been inspired by. 
Which he references head on with the casting of Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, a corrupt businessman with plans to drain the city of power for his own benefit, using Penguin as means in the process. Although he is played well by the ever reliable Walken, he also doesn't really feel like a strong villain, although he is at least a ""real"" villain. You can see at certain points where this character was originally supposed to be a return for Harvey Dent, which had they kept could've been quite effective, showing how Dent is leaning towards villainy because of circumstance before he actually succumbs to his Two Face persona. Could've made the ending to the film pack more punch too, pernaps even bettering the third entry in this franchise...
Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is also vastly different to the source material, no longer an agile jewel thief, she is a supernatural, tragic character who befriends Bruce Wayne, while their alter egos clash. I like how their romance plays out in the film, it never feels forced, and the contrasts between themselves and their other halves proves to be quite effective. Some still insist she IS Catwoman, and sometimes it's hard to argue against it.
The film is greatly boosted by the return of Danny Elfman, who brings back his bombastic Batman theme, as well as creating beautiful themes and riffs for Penguin and Catwoman. Elfman's contributions lift this film far higher than it ever would be without him, giving the film a grandiose feel, and further reinforcing the ""opera"" feel the film has throughout. 
Despite having more flaws than its predecessor in my opinion, the good vastly outweighs the bad, making this film at least on par with Batman '89, but not better. Being a Tim Burton fan greatly helps the appreciation of this film, but I can see how even a fan could find difficultly enjoying this as a Batman film. I however find this incredibly easy. And will return to this film time and time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Burton Elevates It Over Its Flaws,"Director Tim Burton's wonderfully whimsical style helps elevate this memorable sequel over many of its flaws. Michael Keaton returns as the Caped Crusader, this time called upon to halt a criminal alliance between The Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). The former is a grotesquely deformed sewer inhabiter with newfound political swing; the latter a sexy woman in black leather out for vengeance and aimless destruction. As different as they are, they do have something in common: a desire to rid Gotham City of Batman once and for all.The biggest beef one might have with BATMAN RETURNS is its excessive darkness and grim feel. People who watched the original BATMAN expecting a lighthearted superhero crusade were doubly surprised this time around. There is also a notable lack of the title character, who seemingly makes too few appearances throughout the 126-minute running span. But this is all mostly forgivable. The action scenes are highly entertaining without being over-the-top (Burton really should do more action... he's so good at it). Our black-rubber-wrapped antagonist has much more of a presence than he did last time. The film is so well-scripted, with interesting subplots of the Penguin's political power and Batman being framed, that the hero's limited screen time doesn't diminish the film.There are other things to like. The Penguin's circus gang make for some interesting fodder (though his deadly penguins armed with rockets were a little much). As usual, Burton delivers a striking backdrop, as Gotham City, seen here around the snowy holiday season, is breathtaking. The performances are solid, with Keaton able to carry the movie in the absence of Jack Nicholson's Joker. DeVito proved a perfect choice for the diminutive Penguin as he creates a complete maniac who can still draw much of our sympathy. Not to be outdone is Pfeiffer, who is superb as the hapless Selina Kyle and her tempting yet diabolical alter ego. And the element of romance, known to drag down many good-vs.-evil adventures, is a complement here given who is involved (Bruce Wayne aka Batman and Kyle aka Catwoman, but you already knew that).It's not entirely fair to compare BATMAN RETURNS with its predecessor because they are in reality two very different films. This one wins out in many areas, yet comes up short of the original in others. No matter what you think of this sequel, you won't be bored.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Gotham's Phantoms,"""Batman Returns"" is a complete improvement upon Tim Burton's first ""Batman"" (1989). The production design is more vital and actually reflects the characters that inhabit it, and, in turn, their animalistic and dualistic natures seem to be determined by the spaces they occupy: Bruce Wayne of the mansion and Batman of the cave, Penguin in the sewer and mayoral candidate Oswald Cobblepot above the surface, Selina Kyle going from housecat to alley cat and from pussycat to one with claws based on her costume with its stitching aptly and prominently displayed--a more striking change than even that of Bruce and Bat. And to show this architecture off properly, there's some flowing camera movement this time and inspired framings beyond the occasional canted angle of the first film. Moreover, unlike the first film, the narrative here follows through on some of its allusions to other narratives, which underscore the above themes. Sure, some goofiness, as in the last one, is present, and Burton and company still seem to enjoy referencing other films merely for the sake of it (naming a character Max Schrek, after the actor from ""Nosferatu"" (1922), for instance), but for the most part, ""Batman Returns"" corrects every major problem I had with its predecessor.I'm a fan of the dark and perverse tone of it, too. There seems to be a tendency with blockbuster sequels, perhaps because studio executives become more invested, to soften the mood of the original, especially if it had any edge to it, for supposed mass, family-oriented appeal. It happened with ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" and it happened with ""Ghostbusters II"" (1989) (and even more so with the reboot), to name two that come readily to mind. Apparently, someone selling ""Batman Returns"" had that notion in mind, which is why it was such a landmark in movie marketing synergy--complete with Batman toys in McDonald's Happy Meals. Fortunately, however, the making of the film and the marketing of it seems to have been relatively separated this time, as Burton and company decisively eschew any family-friendly Christmassy fast-food mush.Instead, ""Batman Returns"" accentuates the dark architecture and lighting of the original. Danny DeVito offers one of the most grotesque characters ever put in mainstream fare--the stuff of nightmares, truly. And Michelle Pfeiffer parades around in a latex catsuit--exuding sex the entire time, if not directly declaiming sexual innuendo none too subtly. Even Bruce repurposes a torture device, an iron maiden, to access the Batcave. Added to this, the Penguin's journey is a depraved variation on the biblical Moses: he's orphaned by floating down a river, only to come back with a promise of a plague to kill the firstborns.In the first ""Batman,"" there was quite a bit of Michael Keaton posing like Bela Lugosi's Dracula, but little else was done with that cinematic referencing. This time, the allusions are more consistent to another monster that originated on screen in Universal's classic horror movies. Like the Phantom of the Opera, the Penguin emerges from his subterranean lair to wreak havoc on the world above. Unlike the Phantom, however, the Penguin wears no mask to hide his hideous appearance; rather, Bruce and Selina wear them--except, ironically, at the masquerade ball. (By the way, in the novel, the Bal Masqué scene is the only one where the Phantom reveals his true face, as well, although the 1925 film features Lon Chaney wearing the guise of Red Death, which is briefly and obscurely referenced in ""Batman Returns."") And, if the Penguin most resembles Erik from Gaston Leroux's novel, then Bruce must be the aristocratic Raoul, who like Batman, usually fights against the Phantom and on the side of law enforcement as the two men compete for the affections of Christine--or, in this case, Selina.Indeed, Catwoman has the most compelling arc here, as her duality splits her between good and evil (and Pfeiffer stands out among the cast; this is the best role of her career). Essentially, she's a femme fatale, which is entirely more welcome than the damsel-in-distress love interest of Batsy last outing, as well as its concurrent useless subplot involving newspaper investigative reporting. ""Batman Returns,"" by contrast, excises such unnecessary narrative padding in favor of getting on with the action and in developing its themes, all of which coalesces much more congruently this time around. It's just three loons with spirit animals for their split personalities as they battle their phantoms in the opera of Gotham.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Strong in Atmosphere, Poor in Story","Weirdly childish and needlessly outlandish in parts, 'Batman Returns' shows Tim Burton at his best and worst. The film tries to be adult in its initial acts, but dissolves into a contrived plot that doesn't come together despite interesting character moments.Michael Keaton is fantastic but seems largely confused by the whole affair surrounding how his character is supposed to care about saving Gotham. Danny DeVito is hilarious and is having a great time despite feeling like he is in the wrong movie. Christopher Walken feels miscast and is badly implemented in the script. The star of the show by far is Michelle Pfeiffer who is gorgeous, captivating and enticingly neutral.The landscapes of the city are attractive, and there is a tasty colour palette throughout that feels warming despite its cold wintery embrace.However its second half deteriorates into underdelivered and ill conceived action scenes and obnoxious animal nonsense that undermines the more intriguing Plot B that, in its own movie, would have been far more enticing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The best Catwoman ever,"Watching Gotham in Tim Burton's gothic visualisations is a treat in itself and when Danny Elfman's music is there to complement it, it's fantastic. The film is often over the top and the meta humour added is right in place. Walken is a charismatic villain and Devito gives life to the creepy and funny(darkly) Penguin. Even being so over the top the film was able to convey so many emotions of the characters, how three of them are abnormal people trying to cope, through different eccentricities(running around in costumes). The romantic track of Batman and Catwoman was also perfectly in sync with all of this. Above all that Michelle Pfieffer is the best Catwoman ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of the Anti-Villainess named Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Who is on the neutral alignment and She has a tragic backstory. Danny DeVito's portrayal of the main villain named Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin is very villainous, but He has a tragic backstory.

"not that great, but better than 3 and 4!","This movie doesn't absolutely stink.  It does have redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I think its image in evalated in light of ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin,"" both of which absolutely sucked.Good points:Michael Keaton returns as Batman.  He is the best to date.Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  She simply IS Catwoman.  I'd even go so far as to say her interpretation of the character was far more dead on than Nicholson's Joker in the first movie.  If those two had been paired together... the thought sends chills down my spine!Christopher Walken turns in another fine performance as a villanous businessman.The mood is still suitably dark.  Camp is low, and where it exists it is appropriate.Bad points:The interpretation of the Penguin.  This arch-villian was changed so much from the original character (a genius turned to crime) and not for the better (a deformed and ugly circus freak who is just flat-out gross in everything he does).  Danny DeVito is an excellent casting choice, but his character was unlikable without a single redeeming feature.The plot suffers from attempting to cram too many villians and plot lines into the allotted time.  Splitting the screen time between all three undercuts their stories such that a lot of what happens seems contrived and phony -- except for Catwoman.  Her's is the only villian role that seems to flow naturally, maybe because her goals don't involve grand-scale plans, just the thrill of making mayhem while trying to get the best of Batman. Admittedly, it would be a hard choice as to who to leave out as both villians are created or used by Christopher Walken's character.  My personal opinion is that a wholly different script should have been used, but perserving most of the Catwoman story line or expanding it because she's just so damn good.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Extroverted, eccentric but brilliant","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All CostsWelcome back to Gotham City, home of crime and home of the avenger of crime, the legendary Batman (Michael Keaton) a.k.a. millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. While most of the crime emanates from muggers and thieves lurking in backstreet alleys and other grimy places, it's higher up the chain as well. Enter corrupt corporate boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), casually putting on a smile for the good people of Gotham whilst secretly running his own dirty little schemes, who's about to make an unexpected new ally. Abandoned by his rich, snobby parents from birth, tossed into the sewer and left to form into a hideously deformed man, The Penguin (Danny DeVito) has grand plans to endear himself to the people of Gotham, run for mayor and secretly fulfill his own hidden agenda to avenge his lot in life on the innocent people. And finally, Selina Kyle (Michelle Phyiffer) a dowdy, nerdy secretary for Shreck who becomes Catwoman, feline avenger of the night and the Penguin's sidekick. It's time for Batman to work his magic and save the city once again...Following the ultra-successful first Batman movie three years prior, a sequel was as inevitable as night following day. And in 1992, it arrived with Batman Returns, and with the same director, Tim Burton and with the same guy behind the mask, Michael Keaton. Given how much I enjoyed the first one, all of this should spell success. And, unlike in later years, where sequels with the same directors and such would start to suck, this was an earlier one that actually fulfilled.If you think of it all in this sense, you could look on it as a re-run of the first in a lot of respects, certainly the same formula, the same dark presentation and even the same running time! But it is, of course, a movie on it's own, with it's own qualities and high-points. It's not one of those 'sequel that's nowhere near as good as the original' types.So, where do we begin? Well, from the beginning. Opening to the sweeping, stirring soundtrack with the same clever camera angles that stylized the original. This is looking raring and set to be another distinctly comic book movie all the way. And it certainly gets stirred up in the eccentricity of it all as events roll on. Secondly, the performances. De Vito works his own unique brand of magic in the role of The Penguin, but he is ultimately side-shadowed by Walken, who manages a quietly menacing, delightfully devilish turn as the evil Shreck. Alledgedly, a vast number of publicity posters were stolen from Warner Brothers marketing department featuring Phyiffer in her Catwoman suit but (call me weird!) I only found her slightly more appealing than Halle Berry in Catwoman at a push. And then finally, there's the script. A delightfully hammy concoction of all the wildest comic book style extroversion you can imagine, combined with Burton's own unique style.Who cares if a bit too much time is focused on the villains and not on the development of Batman himself? Who cares if some of the action does look a bit rubbery (or maybe things have just moved on a bit too much for me?) Who cares if the ending, with the penguins with rocket-packs on their backs is eccentrically extroverted and even laugh-inducingly ridiculous in one sense? This is the ultimate comic book movie, and the last final, fleeting glimpse of Batman in his true, dark sense before the series deteriorated into the vacuous, colourful, chav-vy gloop it did. So three cheers for this, my favourite Batman movie. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Tim Burton's disaster,"This film is a sequel to the movie ""Batman"" by Tim Burton. And as the first film, falls into the same sins: lack of realism (not even try it) and excessive attachment to the comic strip that gives rise to the central character. Blame it again Tim Burton, which shows little understanding of the comic-book universe and how capable he is of direct cinematic masterpieces or disasters. The film has the participation of Michael Keaton (as Batman), Danny DeVito (as Penguin) and Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman), and only DeVito could shine, incorporating a spiteful and callous Penguin, still unrivaled in cinema.Moreover, the notes I've made for the first film applies perfectly to this also: the cinematography is so black that looks like it's always night in Gotham City, a city that, thanks to the unrealistic scenario, seems a depressed and bloodthirsty version of Orwell's Metropolis. The costumes seem's Carnival masks: Batman exaggerate in plastic polymers and Catwoman would be absolutely perfect in a hardcore and decadent version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey""... Again, Burton lost an opportunity to understand that the film audience expects more realism concerning comic-book adaptations.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Best Batman - Best Burton,"This is probably my favorite Batman movie ever. I usually watch the 1989 first movie and this sequel back to back, and they feel like parts of the same entity. The first one is the basic movie that everybody should watch but ""Batman Returns"" is a more dividing cult thing that some dislike but some really love.Tim Burton had more control over this one, so he went wild with his dark gothic fantasy visions. In addition to this being my favorite Batman movie it's also my favorite Burton movie. It's a bit darker and more twisted than most of his child-friendly fairytale stuff, so that makes it even more fascinating. The visual scenery is amazing, and with Danny Elfman's music it really creates an otherworldly feel.The cast is excellent too. I guess this was my first ever seen film with Christopher Walken. I didn't like him at first - before I even remembered his name I always thought ""oh, this is again that weird actor from Batman Returns"" but maybe for the same reason he became one of my favorite (weird) actors!It's one of my all-time favorite movies.

Dark sequel,"When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito.Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman.Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken didn't disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and he was just as good here as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel he was really never in the spotlight.With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Too Much Undeserving Hate, It's Not That Bad","Batman Returns is directed by Tim Burton and stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire living in Gotham City that secretly spends his nights fighting crime as a vigilante called Batman. After the defeat of his greatest villain, the Joker (Jack Nicholson), Batman has done a relatively good job at keeping the streets clean. However, a new villain is on the rise, a deformed man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), that calls himself the Penguin. Batman must find a way to defeat the new evil, all while managing his very complicated relationship with the infamous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer).While a good amount of people dislike this movie, I actually really enjoy it. I think there are many good elements to Returns, and it may even be as good as the original Batman (1989). Although many criticize Tim Burton's takeover of this film, I don't mind it all that much. This film may not be perfect, but it definitely accomplishes at least one thing: it's fun.The best thing about this movie has got to be the acting. Michael Keaton's Batman, although not my favorite, is legendary. Keaton definitely does a great job as both Bruce Wayne and the caped crusader, and started an amazing legacy. Danny DeVito also plays a near perfect Penguin, and captures a great image of how disturbing and grotesque Oswald really is. Michelle Pfeiffer, although not my favorite Catwoman, does a great job as Selina Kyle, especially in the sequence in which she transitions from normal Selina into Catwoman. Another great casting choice that's overlooked a lot is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Walken plays this dirty business man amazingly, and really shows how cruel a person can be.The direction in Batman Returns, I feel, is really good as well. Many people say that Tim Burton went too much Tim Burton on this film, and made it less of a Batman movie, and more of a Burton movie, which I subtly agree with. Although I still think it has more of a Batman feel that a Burton feel, I do see where those accusations come in play. Certain factors of Returns overly captures the oddness of Burton, and, while that can be good, it goes a bit overboard.My complaints with this movie really lie with small things, and aren't anything big, for instance the sexual element of the film, mostly revolving around Catwoman. Catwoman is a sexy, sleek character in both the comics and films, and that's a good thing, because it adds to the complications between her and Bruce. However, she's just a complete slut in Batman Returns. Not only does she friggin' lick Keaton's face, she has some very sexual dialogue, specifically in ""the scene"" with the Penguin (you know the one). There are many infamous lines throughout the movie, and about 80% of them come from banter between Selina and Oswald. I'm not going to provide examples, because I don't know who's going to be reading this, but just go under the ""quotes"" section on IMDb: there's some weird lines in this movie.Another small complaint I found in the film is the vividness of Gotham. Although Tim Burton made his two Batman films dark, Gotham itself doesn't seem too depressing. This is mostly thanks the giant bronze statues positioned throughout the city, and the giant lit up Christmas tree. As far as the statues, they stuck around for Joel Schumacher's Batman films, and we all know how those ended up. Burton makes the city dark, yes, but there are certain parts of the film that just take away from the grittiness that the filmmakers tried to inspire.The last point I'll hit is another positive, and that's the costumes and makeup, specifically on Danny DeVito. The disgusting, round body piece that DeVito had to wear (watch the special features), and the amazing prosthetics on his face, mostly the crooked, pointy nose, are fantastic. The extremities that were involved in making the Penguin look just how disturbing he does is unfathomable to think about. Danny DeVito, who spent five hours in makeup each day, really dedicated himself to this role, and earned any money that Batman Returns provided him with.In conclusion, Batman Returns gets a lot of undeserving hate, and really is a good film, both in Batman terms and in just general terms. Anybody should see this movie, especially if you're a fan of either Batman or Tim Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Utter crap,"This movie is by far one of the worst super hero films ever, it's on par with Superman 4.

Christmas in Gotham!,"""Batman Returns"" feels a lot like its predecessor ""Batman(1989)"" before it, but everything turned up a notch. It's darker, even more atmospheric and more violent. It also started the trend of two villains per movie, and was one of the few to pull it off, at least back then! The Christmas setting is great and works like a charm with the already overly gothic tone and look. Action is great and stylish, Batman is cool and intimidating. There is a lot of new gadgets and the Batmobile has also new tricks up it's sleeve. Full of dark humor and a bit twisted moments. Both villains are memorable for different reasons. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect Catwoman and Danny DeVito is great as a disturbing and grotesque version of the Penguin character. To top that off Christopher Walken has also an awesome part!

It is way better than Batman and Batman Forever,"Many people say that batman forever is better but it isn't, not by a long-shot.Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer are excellent as the Penguin and Catwoman.The plot of the story is good:One baddie wants to be mayor, and one falls in love with Batman.Christopher Walken was good in the film as Max Shreck and did a believable performance.When Batman Forever and Batman & Robin came out Gotham was turned into a neon lighted skyscraper glow stick palooza.In the first two films Burton made a more realistic environment, with a more realistic group of good guys and bad guys.The only Batman movie better than this one is Batman Begins.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Holy Crap, Batman!!!","Other then the disastrous Batman And Robin, this movie takes the cake. Batman is yet again just a secondary character to the villains, getting as much time as The Scarecrow did in Batman Begins. In this movie, dumb-witted Tim Burton re-designed the Penguin. He portrayed him very simular to the villain Killer Croc. The Penguin, instead of being a Rich, snobby Nightclub and casino owner, who often supplies Batman with information was turned into a sewer mutant freak puking black and white mucus from his mouth, with feces on his pajamas. Raised and learned English grammar by a bunch of NAZI marching penguins with rocket launchers on their backs who tries running for mayor. While Selina Kyle is pushed out of a window, killed brought back to life by a bunch of cats trying to eat her and becomes Catwoman. But in the comics Catwoman is an ally. Just a sneeky thief. Burton portrayed her as a terrorist. Blowing up buildings and killing everyone in her path. There was no use for even Batman being in this film, he was portrayed as a psycho murderer, Killing petty thugs in his twenty minute cameo scenes. It had no plot at all and was just overly dumb.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Batman Returns - The definitive Psycho-Drama,"This is my review of Batman Returns that I recently posted on the board for the film: It's easily the best Batman movie and one of the best things Burton's made, as well as clearly being focused on Batman whether you like the way it does this or not. It has a very interesting structure, and I love the way the main theme of masks is cleverly woven from the first frame onward through the characters and all plot points (the public facade and the reality underneath). It's a very thematically padded and interesting film, as well as being a great modern era ode to German Expressionist film-making in its ability to communicate ideas visually.As far as saying it's Burton and not Batman, that's utter rubbish. It's Burton's take on Batman, and that's no more or less valid than anybody else's as there is no definitive version of the character but only personal interpretation. If this was not the case, we would not have all these varying versions throughout the history of the character. I think Burton noted this himself when talking about adapting the material -- that comic book continuity was unsound and was constantly reinventing itself as far as the character. That seems to bother many purists (who, oddly, miss the point that the character has no single version to point to), but the freedom allowed Burton on this project is what makes it so special -- basically an artist given free reign, which I think should be applauded.Like it or hate it, it's a rare commercial blockbuster that is clearly and deeply personal, and that seems to really rankle many -- i.e. it's not a typical, safe comic book movie as far as template but is instead something more artistic and bizarre therefore it's *beep* I truly think the film gets a bad rep just for being a Batman movie in various circles even though it's a superior work by Mr. Burton.It's a great movie in my view and a great interpretation of Batman that in its runtime examines the character and makes definitive statements about him within its narrative outline, specifically in its final confrontations when considered with the rest of the film (both Batman/Penguin and Batman/Catwoman have personal duels at the end which give us payoff in regards to the psychology of the titular character). And as far as there not being enough Batman, he's in the film a lot after the first thirty five minutes or so which are clearly dedicated to building up the other characters with this being important to the structuring of the film inherently and to the examination of the Batman/Wayne character under that structure. After the first half hour, it's very Bats heavy in its content and intent.I think depression, though not delved into, was a part of it, if not the psychosis, as shown through their choice of origins for the character and the impetus for his nightly work. Obviously it was not delved into much at all beyond cause and effect, but it's easy to read that into it even within that surface context. As far as definitive interpretation? There is none, even when just considering Kane/Finger's era, which about says it all.For my tastes, I like the depressed, psychotic Batman Burton gave us and think it's a logical idea. Not definitive, but certainly as valid as any other. And Burton certainly did play up the original grim vigilante theme, right down to the killing, that Kane/Finger started with themselves -- on a purely aesthetic basis such as that (and considering the rather blank nature of the character in regards to psychology at this point, mood, overall action and look are about the only important things to translate from those earliest of stories which I think Burton did rather masterfully), it was more based on Batman's early beginnings than most other stuff when looking at its overall noir presentation as far as both mood and character.The Kane/Finger Batman, in simplest terms, was a lone vigilante that was soon revealed to be driven by the death of his parents --all of this can be said for Burton's Batman as well, with the main difference being that he was most interested in the psychology behind the actions of the main character (including the killing that is notably present in the two versions) rather than just the actions themselves as far as point a to point b narrative resolution.I think it's largely forgotten in many comic story lines that the underlying basis for Batman's nightly jaunts is psychological imbalance -- both as far as the depression and the heavily weird/illogical/psycho way he chooses to deal with that, by dressing up as a bat of all things. If you portray this on film and want it to be taken seriously at all, I think the point has to be made that this is not a psychologically healthy character at all, otherwise you get camp. If you don't deal with the central idea being a character that acts out in the manner he does because of lacking mental health in much the same way as the villains he encounters -- it's obvious, but sometimes forgotten, that the basis of so many of these characters stems from their psychological traumas, and that Batman's the same when you contrast underlying motivations.If Spider-Man's a soap, then Batman's a psycho-drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Gross and dumb,"I don't think I've seen this all the way through since it was in theaters when I was 13. I don't remember liking it much then, but I've long been thinking of re-watching it. It's developed a cult because of its excessive weirdness. It is that excessive weirdness that keeps it watchable. That, the awesome production design, Danny Elfman's score, and Christopher Walken. Without those elements, though, honestly, I don't know that this is all that much better than Batman & Robin (I'm not about to re-watch that one, but I did pick up Batman Forever on Blu Ray very cheap along with this - probably both will be a waste of money). If nothing else, it certainly plants a lot of the seeds that would grow into the monstrosity that was B&R. The script here is just awful, first and foremost. It's all just a mess, with all kinds of nutty crap thrown on the screen for little to no reason. It's terribly grotesque. Penguin isn't a rich man in a tuxedo, he's a mutant, and Catwoman is a zombie. It has a really dirty sexual streak. It gets really gross watching Danny DeVito perv all over everyone. It's chock full of terrible one-liners that sound awful even coming out of Michelle Pfeiffer. Batman is more or less forgotten for most of the film. Even when it's being aggressively weird, it's mostly boring. Walken really livens up the film whenever he appears - his murder of Selina Kyle is by far the highlight of the film. It's a shame he disappears for a long stretch in the second half. The first Burton Batman holds up pretty well. This one, not so much.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

What Happened?,"That's the question I kept asking myself after I finished watching this film. I know I'll be stepping on many peoples' toes by writing this review. I know a lot of people loved this film when it was released in '92, and I know a lot of people still love the film to this day. However, I'd like to ask all those people to keep an open mind, and to try to see this from my perspective. I never liked this movie! Not even after I first saw it. I wanna put all of you in my shoes: Your eight years old, Batman comes out, you go see it, and afterwords, you're blown away by its sheer greatness. Shortly after, a sequel is announced, and you're ecstatic! You can't wait for it, you expect it to be all that the previous film was and more, then, a few years pass, the film comes out, you see it, and its a complete dud! That's exactly how I felt when I saw Batman Returns. Batman Returns didn't even feel like it was in the same series as Batman! Where as Batman was exciting and fun, Batman Returns was dreary and depressing. None of the villains were charismatic, or fun to watch like Nicholson's Joker, they were all one dimensional and had no motivations! Keaton still plays Batman fairly well, but nothing at all is done with his Bruce Wayne persona. Which in and of itself, presents a huge problem when a semi love interest is interjected into the film. As with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale, Michelle Pfeiffer does a decent job with what she's given, but that's the problem with her character. You don't know what kind of person Selina Kyle really is, and we have no idea what her agenda is as Catwoman. Why does she want Penguin to frame Batman? We don't know and we never find out. The Biggest problem of the film however, is Danny Devito as The Penguin. Aside from the fact that he rides around in a motorized rubber duck, and that the image of his army of rocket pack penguins is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever seen, The Penguin has to be one of the most poorly done comic book villains ever! The problem is, that The Penguin is done in such an inconsistent way. One minute Tim Burton wants us all to feel sorry for him, and then the next, he wants us all to detest him as the evil villain. As for my experience with the film: It didn't leave me in a good mood or hungry for more, as the first film did. It left me feeling dreary, sick, and empty. For me, going from Batman to Batman Returns felt like chasing Champagne with sewer water. The first drink was great, but the second just left a bad taste in my mouth.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Spectacular!!,"[may contain spiolers]Batman Returns is the best of the bat franchise...Batman was much darker than this movie and the later two, not directed by Tim Burton, were too cartoony and childish. Michael Keaton returns as the caped crusader Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne. One evening a horrible, disfigured man-bird called the Penguin [Danny Devito] surfaces in Gotham City. He blackmails cold hearted businessman Max Schrek [Christopher Walken] to help reintroduce him into society. Schrek convinces Penguin to run for mayor so that his power plant can dump toxic waste everywhere and get more money from the city. His moussy secretary, Selina Kyle [Michelle Pfeiffer in her best role yet] finds this out and he ''kills'' her. She is revived by several cats and becomes the hero-villain Catwoman. Now Batman must stop Schrek and Penguin, clear his name, and romance Catwoman all at once.This is the best movie in the series...not as dark as the first one or as childish as the last two. The writing is superb and there is only one dissapointment. CATWOMAN HASN'T RETURNED IN ANY OF THE OTHER BAT MOVIES. She is the best villain and she hasn't resurfaced.My favorite part of the movie is the end, when Bruce wayne walks in that ally and finds the black cat...and then it takes us up the rafters of Gotham City's buildings and we see the Bat signal and Catwoman appears in the shadows...she not dead!this is a great movie and i give it a 10/10..",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Beautiful. Both story and the visual.,"One of the most charming movies ever made. I love the way Burton builds up his world of dark fantasy and gothic scenes. I could just sit back and enjoy a two-hour movie of nothing but the vision of his wonderful imagination.But Batman Returns is more than a fancy ride into Burton's world. The strength of Batman-movies has been always the villain characters and this one is the best. The dark, but fascinating character of Penguin is perhaps the most tragic figure ever shown in the movies. And the psychotic relationship between Selina/Catwoman and Bruce/Batman might be the most beautiful love-story ever shown on the screen.I strongly recommend. This just isn't an action movie. And its comedy side has the dark, black touch of Burton in it. He is perhaps the most talented of the directors Hollywood has and this is one of his best works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"One my ""Top Ten Worst Movies I've Ever Paid to Watch"".","Top of the list for worst movies.  I don't know why these early Batman movies had our hero fighting two villains at once (actually three if you want to count Max Schreck).  In my humble opinion, just fighting either the Catwoman alone or the Penguin alone would have had a tighter dramatic structure.  However, watching a flock of penguins waddling around with missiles strapped to their backs, supposedly a threat to the citizens Gotham City, was unintentionally one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Dark Knight's Opus,"""Batman Returns"" is not a perfect film in the empirical sense of the word: there really is not quite enough Batman presence, some of the fight scenes (particularly with Catwoman) don't make sense, and some of the plot points are a bit more fantasy than reality (albeit that's probably intentional). But a mathematical stacking of pros and cons is not what makes a film great or horrible, it's the impact of it and the merit of its artistry. In this respect, Batman Returns is a masterpiece.Tim Burton's major contribution to Batman in general, despite his frustrating insistence on being fascinated with the villains, is giving him back, and refining, his dark nature. Burton, along with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns (graphic novel) and a few others, re-imagined Batman into the Dark Knight, perfecting him into the somewhat frightening crime fighter Bob Kane was getting at back in 1939. ""Dark"" characters are often created by piling on violence, sex, or drug use, but Batman needs none of that to be scary. In fact he's better without it. He's dark because that's what he is, and there's a purity to it that no other super-hero can touch. Tim Burton pioneered this image of him in ""Batman,"" then mastered in ""Returns.""""Batman Returns"" centers around four characters: Batman, Catwoman, The Penguin and Max Shreck. These four principles are the force of this movie, and the film's plot serves as an elaborate character study of each of them. Every one of them is both friend and enemy of each other character at different points of the movie, until the conflict between them throws the plot into a frenzy of senseless mayhem at the conclusion, finally succumbing to the insanity of its principles. For this reason, the ebb and flow of the plot is a bit off-kilter, and that would be a problem if any of those four performances weren't absolutely fabulous. Describing someone's acting never does it any justice, so I won't try to get into details, but it should be noted that all four of them spar with each other at full power.The Batmobile is back and still kicking, and Burton and company thought of some great ways of tinkering with their toy, none of which I will reveal now. Suffice to say the Batmobile offers up some of the grandest entertainment in the film, involving chase sequences that stand up to this day due to the sheer cleverness of the situation. The Dark Knight's suit is more regal in this one, slightly grayed, taller and less compacted. Batman looks something like a king in his outfit. As for Michael Keaton, he proves yet again why Bob Kane gave him the nod for the role in 1989. It doesn't matter that the man is not all physically imposing, because that face of his looks so terrifying and dark in the Cowl that his presence is magnified two times over. Keaton's rasp is still on point, able to transform his body language and his voice perfectly under the suit. It should also be noted that Burton's Batman is quieter than anyone else's, including Frank Miller's. I love that. Batman is always too chatty everywhere else. As for Catwoman, Batman Returns perfected her. There is no reason to ever do Catwoman again in any work of fiction, because you will never again create a character so fascinating, sympathetic or more tragic. Burton took a nothing character, some one- dimensional sultry cat-burglar, and made her a vicious look at sexism and the persecution of innocence in an ugly, cruel world. Well done.Danny deVito's Penguin is horribly ugly, completely hate-able, and rather pathetic, which is exactly what they were going for. He's a twisted animal with twice the anger and half the brains, not able to compete with Batman on any real level. But enter Max Shreck, a political monster whom the Penguin happens to have some dirt on, and The Penguin becomes a hand-puppet for Shreck, almost like Max testing to see if he could really make this abomination lovable. He has a mayor in office that doesn't always play ball, so he uses this thing to win the hearts of a Gotham City that is so desperate for hope they will latch onto anything. It's a cruel spectacle executed beautifully, and both actors give amazing turns. deVito will never get the credit he deserves for the film, because he makes you hate him so sincerely you forget to stop hating him when the credits roll. Christopher Walken is chilling, hateful and...(please don't ask me how he did this)...sympathetic. It's impossible to understand, but Walken somehow played Shreck so purely that it's hard not to respect him, even though he is a truly corrupt, twisted creature of a man.The plot is imperfect, some of the fights are odd, and the plot is as much fantasy as that's possible in a movie set in a city, but it doesn't matter. Four fascinating, complicated characters are set into a boxing ring and told to go at it, and Batman Returns is the result. Not to mention the whole film is anchored by one of the most famous superheros of all time. It's a shame Batman gets upstaged by Burton's fascination with The Penguin, but it's a forgivable mistake in a story that's so deeply affecting, and so dark. That's the key thing Returns has that the original kind of missed: the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"For What's It's Worth, A Worthy Sequel","Batman Returns takes place a little while after the events of the first film. Batman and Gordon are working together to keep the streets safe for the holiday season when a new menace arrives in the sewers. A business tycoon, Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken) is captured and taken in the sewers to meet the mysterious man called The Penguin. Penguin uses Shreck's connections to resurface and establish himself in Gotham City. Shreck soon uses the Penguin's new popularity to his advantage and starts a campaign to elect him as mayor.While this is going on lowly secretary for Shreck, Selina Kyle, finds out more than she was supposed to and is killed by Shreck. At least for a moment. Selina survives the fall and creates Catwoman to extract her revenge. She also starts a relationship with Bruce Wayne while frequently going toe to toe with Batman.Batman has his hands full this time trying to stop Penguin's true scheme and contending with Catwoman.This sequel draws the focus more to the villains. This works well at some points, like the origin of The Penguin and not so much other times, Selina's transformation scene. It's not that the scene is terrible it's just it drags a bit long. Batman is still present of course but his role is somewhat smaller this time around. The action scenes could also be better polished as the choreography of the fighting looks sloppy sometimes.But for all its faults what this movie does pull off it pulls off great. I'm most impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman which manages to seem confident and edgy but also a little insecure at times. And I'm impressed with Danny DeVito's Penguin. His character actually comes off as pretty tragic at certain points but he still manages to provide a threat to Batman. There are times when I think he tried too much to mimic Jack Nicholson's Joker but I manage to overlook those moments.Gotham City is still beautifully designed and the supporting cast gives it their all. Michael Keaton still gives off one of the best Batman in the history of cinema and Danny Elfman's score is fitting to the dark tone of the film.Overall, this sequel isn't going to please everyone who liked the first movie but I still recommend watching it. It's a good movie and a worthy continuation of the Batman Saga.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"A Dark, screaming Mayhem !","I liked Tim Burton's style. It's dark, funny and his characters have a certain charming quality about them. Yet, 89 minutes into Batman Returns and I'm having serious second thoughts.May be because this is not something we've come to associate with Batman or may be it's the effect of Nolan's masterpieces, Batman Returns simply doesn't work for me. Instead of characters, we're bombarded with ghastly caricatures. Story resembles an out-of- control bandwagon and the sets are outlandish. It might come out as a dark work of art to some but for all it's managed to give me is a mind- boggling headache.Danny Devito had potential but he's been reduced to a whiny, childish mess. For Michelle Pfeiffer, i've just one word - Terrible. Not that I would associate Catwoman with colorful wondergirl stuff but in fleshing out her character to remember the feline fiend, the writers seem to have gone a mile ahead of overboard. Right from the costume, makeup to the portrayal of the character, every single thing is just nuisance. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck seems a confused soul rather than the shrewd businessman he's supposed to be. Bruce & Alfred try to save Gotham in the midst of all this grotesqueness, just as Michael Keaton & Gough try to save Batman Returns from becoming a complete mess.The movie simply did not work for me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Batman Returns is a great sequel.,"Batman Returns is not the sequel people expected. That could be because director Tim Burton was never too crazy about doing a sequel. In a way it is obvious that he wanted to do something completely different. The film was shot in LA (original in England), Anton Furst's Oscar-Winning sets were replaced by Bo Welch, and the costume has gone through a drastic change. As I write the changes I am also writing the flaws. I prefer Furst's sets, shooting in England, and the original costume. Everything else, however, I think is awesome! Tim Burton is a great artist and I feel like Batman Returns is a great work of art. I am not going to spoil it for you by giving away all the symbolisms. The joy of watching Batman Returns is figuring out everything Burton hid under the surface.RATING: 4 (****) out of (****)For the curious: The plot of the film is that Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is a corrupt business man who uses the Penguin to recall the mayor.

The Dark Knight Strikes Again,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorGrowing up there weren't the kind of films kids have these days. These days kids can enjoy the Marvel films, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Pixar pictures. When I was an adolescent we just had the Disney movies, Benji, and loads of animal films. So a film like Batman Returns was something special. A film that had imagination and adventure.Batman Returns is not as good as the original and the plot is questionable. However, director Tim Burton manages to bring the Batman mythology back to life. While not always faithful to the comics but always inspired. Here Michael Keaton returns as the Dark Knight, this time facing the grotesque Penguin and his feline accomplice Catwoman. Both roles played wonderfully by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer.After Batman getting revenge in the original by murdering the killer of his parents (the Joker) screenwriters Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters further develop the character of Bruce Wayne by making him question his role as Batman. After falling in love with Selina Kyle (Catwoman) Bruce Wayne doesn't know if he wants to continue as Batman or retire and spend the rest of his live with Selina.The screenwriters and Tim Burton use a lot of religious symbolism in this film by comparing Batman to Jesus. Here like in the last temptation of Christ Selina Kyle is a vision of what life could be but what Wayne doesn't know is that to Selina he is also a vision. In addition the whole first-born child thing is a bit Jewish.The great tragedy of Batman Returns is Anton Furst's death. In the original he not only created a great Gotham City but a great world as well. Bo Welch took over in this film and he was a good replacement. The other great tragedy is Michael Keaton not being nominated for an Oscar. I think Keaton is one of the most underrated actors of our generation. His performance in this film was incredible. The prove of that is the scene where he is searching for the corpse of Selina and you see the face of Bruce Wayne searching for hope. Then the Penguin appears from the water and when Keaton turns to face him, although he is not wear his mask we see the face of Batman.RATING: 4 STARS",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

The Christopher Walken show...,"BATMAN RETURNS has the distinction of featuring more memorable villains than any other comic book-based feature film. We have Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (in a role that would've been better served by Sean Young, if you ask me) and Danny DeVito as the mutant Penguin- but it's Christopher Walken as Max Shreck who steals the show: his delivery is the reason. When he catches secretary Selina Kyle going through his files looking for evidence of corruption, he asks her: ""And how exactly did you access confidential files..."" And here his voice drops to a mere whisper as he concludes: ""...May I ask...?"" In a movie chock full of what were probably meant to be witty quips (there's very little real dialogue in the film, but that's okay, it's implied: this is only a ""comic book movie""), Walken's handling of almost throwaway lines is masterful. Catwoman's costume is sexy, to be sure, and the Penguin is one of the most horrific creatures to ever waddle through a comic book cum movie, but it's Walken as Shreck who really stands out.

"Will, can't blame Burton for trying...I think.","I do not like this movie at all, actually hated it, and this is coming from a loyal Batman fan. Every time Tim Burton makes a movie he constantly tries to remind you that you're watching a ""burton film"" rather then just a movie, and for Batman Returns, it's just that. I stopped watching this after my love for ""Mask Of The Phantasm"" came to DVD. Batman is still a homicidal maniac who hasn't been locked up in Arkham yet, speaking of Arkham Aslyum, where is it? Burton just rathered to kill off the criminals rather then adding the influential mad house from the comics. Batman is yet again playing second fiddle to the villains, having the Dark Knight in only about 25 minutes of the movie. Anyways, I'll get to the point. There is a new nutjob running around Gotham...wait? in the sewers? Finally, Killer Croc is introduced to the movies. No, wait....that's not Croc...that's...the Penguin? Burton portrayed Oswald Cobblepot as a sewer mutant freak, with feces on his pajama bottoms, puking black and green mucus from his mouth with an army of penguins with rocket launchers on their backs, marching around the town like nazi soilders from the '40s. The Penguin has always been a sophisticated gentlemen, a rich greedy crimeboss and owns a local dance club. Oswald always only carried an umbrella with him because his father died of pneumonia when he was a kid, and his loving mother didn't want him to catch it. In Batman Returns, his parents hated him, disown him and threw him into a river. Catwoman was shown as a psychopathic terrorist, killing random strangers and blowing up everything in her path when she was thrown out of a window and revived when cats tried to eat her. This movie is poorly plotted. Burton disregards anything he sees in the comic book and makes it his version and to me; that is not the Batman I grew up to love.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
One Of The Best Batman Films,"Truth be told, ""The Dark Knight"" is probably the best Batman movie in terms of action, story, and characters. If you saw that one first, you probably won't find this movie to be ""better"", per se. But Batman Returns is one of the greatest. And that it took DK to finally surpass it speaks volumes.This film was what a Batman film *should* be. Dark and menacing. Rich characters and story. It's funny that it was polarizing when it came out: The studio considered it ""too dark"", and it led to the immediate sequels being rather campy and lighter in tone. ""Batman Forever"" was still *good*, but ""Batman and Robin"", well...This movie best captures the grimy atmosphere of Gotham City, better than other films, in my opinion. And of course, Batman films are really about the villains. Even without having my personal favorite villains (Joker and Two-Face), this movie still shines. Maybe Danny DeVito's Penguin isn't quite as endearing as Jack Nicholson's Joker was. But he's just as menacing. Especially for a character that wasn't a natural villain. Just someone who misguidedly and malicously wanted respect from a world that rejected him. DeVito was outstanding, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of an actor who could have brought better justice to that character. And we get a great origin story (capped off with an outstanding performance by Michell Pfieffer) in the classic anti-hero that is Catwoman. She nailed it.This movie has one of the best climaxes of a Batman movie, IMO. Perhaps that's the biggest reason I consider it the best. It definitely fit the film well, and is worth admission alone.This movie is a classic, and a must-see for any Batman fan. If The Dark Knight is your standard, will you necessarily re-evaluate your rankings? Probably not. But will you think any less of this film? No way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A great batman sequel the best out of the four batman films,"This film is probably one of my favourites. I love everyhting about it it's tone, the fact that tim burton went dark. It also has some fun comic moment in it as well.Michelle pfeiffer steals the show as Catwoman/ selina kyle. She plays the dual role to perfection. She has some fantastic lines and did most of her own stunts. Micheal keaton and her have good chemistry. Danny devito is also good as the penguin.

"Not only a great Batman movie but, a great Christmas movie","This is beautiful, gothic and champy movie perfect for the family during the holidays. This movie is a well done sequel to one of the best superhero movies of all time. This movie has perfect casting, an incredible score by Danny Elfman, beautiful set design that screams 'Burton'. Micheal Keaton continue to kill it as Batman. Michelle Pfeiffer gives my favorite Catwoman performance of all time and favorite in the movie (she is my Catwoman). She is able to have the most complex character in the whole movie and give a performance with two alter personalities but never bore us with either. Keeping us glued to the screen whenever she is on it. Danny DeVito kills it with his over the top but, entertaining performance. Christopher Walken is just an absolute delight through out this whole movie. The set design it something out of a beautiful gothic horror movie that makes the Christmas time setting all the more beautiful. This movie is not as good as its predecessor. It has some warts but, I love this movie warts and all. The movie can tonally feel a little off with things that are meant to be intimating but, just simply aren't.

This movie sucks!  I mean really sucks!!,"I have really never seen a film that is worse than this.  There is one improbable situation after another and nothing is thought out to make any sense.  It looked to me like the makers of this film figured that they had a gold mine on their hands and because the first made a ton of money, they could make a quickie film that has no concern for detail, plot, characterization, direction, script, stunts or anything that makes a film entertaining.The film looks like it was filmed on a sound stage and you can tell because when it is supposed to be below zero outside, there is no mist coming from the breath of the people in the scene.  And that is only one small complaint.  The biggest one is that this film suffers from what I like to call the respected man is suddenly a bad guy syndrome.Batman is a respected, hard working, guardian angel in Gotham City.  He has been like that for a while now.  Suddenly a shady figure that is grotesque looking and walks like a Penguin enters the picture.  Within days of his arrival on the scene, not only has the penguin miraculously discredited Batman but he has managed to get the entire city against him.  He has been ostracized from public safety and this leaves the Penguin alone to do his diabolical plans.Is this the best they can come up with?  I mean, aren't writers smarter than that?  Can't they write a better way for the Penguin to do what he does? I really hate this movie.  With all that I am, I hate it.  But it made a ton of money because kids love this crap and for the rest of us that want to see a good film and hope to God that this film will be a welcome distraction for two hours of our summer, are not only disappointed, we are disgusted.

Penguin an albatross,"Batman II is a disappointment.  Actually, a better word is gross.  There is really not much more to say about Danny DeVito's Penguin, operating in sewers, grotesque and crunched in features.  By contrast, Burgess Meredith was amusing, carried himself well -- actually, I think he was my favorite Batman TV villain, aside from Julie Newmar.  DeVito is shorter, squatter, grosser, uglier.  Apotheosis:  biting the journalist's nose, just great. The storyline for his part was too complicated, the cinematography too dark and pompous.  The only good thing at all was the attempt at the someone sympathetic look at him based on his origins, but this dies as the rest is just garbage (sometimes literally).Michelle Pfeiffer partially redeems the movie as Catwoman, and her sympathetic storyline is thus enhanced some.  In contrast to his role in the battle against the Penguin and company, in which he is almost a footnote, Batman (and Bruce Wayne) square off against Catwoman, a sympathetic, modern-woman villainess.  Keaton, however, still seems not to quite measure up, overall presence, monotone or whatever.  Thus, he was told, skip it next time.Regardless of some good Catwoman moments, a so-so Batman and an abominable Penguin man have the overriding aura in this film.  No ride into the sunset, or the moonlight, but into the abyss.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
between the lines,"It's a Tim Burton movie, folks! As such, you should know before you even see the opening credits that you will have to read between the lines. Burton is never concerned with stereotypes, he considers them as given. Instead, what he does is - he twists the stereotypes to their most nightmarish extreme. The perfectly incompetent secretary becomes a feminist anti-hero. The child that has been casted away wants to become the mayor by using his sad past. The cold power plant owner is a nice father. The millionaire is not only a superhero, but a superhero who is looking for a soulmate. So, give this movie a couple of chances before you decide about anything.

The Best Batman,"This film has really been unfairly lambasted over the past decade or so since its release.  I feel that its reputation comes from the darkness of the film and also from the fact that McDonald's marketed it to youngsters by throwing Batman Returns toys into their Happy Meals.  This is not a child's movie, nor is it the first film.Batman was a triumph in its own right, but I find this second film to be superior.  The characters are interesting, the scenery is spectacular (Michelle Pfeiffer included), and the script is actually very well done. Every time I watch this film I pick up more subtleties.  One of my favorites is when Penguin visits his parents grave and says, ""I was their number one son, but they treated me like number two.""  This line has a great double-meaning.  Penguin being treated like a number two son, not quite as well loved or cherished, but also Penguin being treated like number two, as in bodily function, in the less vulgar vernacular, crap.  There are many lines just like this one laced throughout the film.  It is true, the screenplay does have a few holes in it, especially towards the end of the film, but it turns out to be very enjoyable.  There is great character development to be found with Bruce Wayne maturing and Selina Kyle having to deal with her newfound duality.  The relationship between Selina and Bruce is the most interesting of any of the films.  While the Penguin and bad guy Max Shreck are static characters, they really do contribute to the feel and plot of the film.  Heck, Penguin drives the main plot, or is it Shreck that drives it?  You decide.The Batman series would go downhill from this point.  Batman Forever is actually pretty good, although Schumacher's vision is a little to ""bright"" for my tastes.  Batman & Robin is one of the worst films I've EVER seen. It's no wonder that we haven't seen a Batman film since its release. Batman Returns and the first film really make Batman and Gotham City seem real. Tim Burton should be commended for his vision on these films, especially Batman Returns, the crown jewel of the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

The Most Wicked 'Batman' To Date,"What happens when you give a director virtually every freedom possible when making a big blockbuster sequel? Well, if you are Warner Bros. and are working with Tim Burton, ""Batman Returns"" is what you get. Lots of things can be said for this movie. Naysayers could say it's too graphic, dark, depressing and flat-out mean. However, those who appreciate the dark-side of the Dark Knight should appreciate this entry in the franchise. Perhaps I was a little too young to be watching this movie in 1992, but yet, I was still intrigued. I could not look away, almost as if my favorite superhero was in a horror movie. Now, you should note that ""Batman Returns"" is not for everyone. If you thought Burton's original ""Batman"" was dark and scary, this one might put you over the edge. Little kids, in general, really should not be watching this, which is ironic considering all the action figures this movie spewed forth. In this movie, Bruce Wayne (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) is pitted against the sewer-dwelling Penguin (portrayed spot-on by Danny Devito), falls for Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and deals with a devious megalomaniac in Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). If Batman doesn't have trouble while he's at work, he at least has enough emotional troubles to deal with at home. ""Batman Returns"" is really quite a complex and dense movie. On one hand, it is a big summer blockbuster, and a sequel. On the other hand, it is a bit of a psychological thriller that really pokes into the Batman/Bruce Wayne psyche. Everything about this film evokes a certain mood -- from the Christmas-time setting, the grey skies and snow, too Penguin's gloomy lair and Selina Kyle's dumpy bachelorette-pad. It's almost too well made. ""Batman Returns"" surely isn't an everyday movie. Personally, I find I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate it. Which is simply why the movie didn't make the intended splash at the box office and why many critics panned it. Regardless, it is still a Batman movie, and in my opinion, still stays true to the character. If there's any fault, it's that it's too risky for it's own good. But still a deliciously evil 'Batman' flick that's always good for the holidays.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Burton Bores.,"In the first Tim Burton Batman movie, Jack Nicholson stole almost every scene he was in as The Joker, but the film was still very much about Batman.Three years later, and Batman returned, but on the strength of this sequel, perhaps it would have been better if he had remained hidden away in his bat cave.Nowhere near as much fun as his original, Tim Burton's follow up focuses less on the bat and more on the villains: the Penguin (Danny De Vito), who emerges from the sewers, ostensibly to discover who is parents were, but in reality, to wreak terror on the people of Gotham City, with a little help from unscrupulous industrialist Max Schreck (Christopher Walken). And Catwoman, psycho secretary Selina Kyle, who loses her marbles and turns nasty after being pushed out of a window by Schreck.Michael Keaton, as Batman, hardly gets a look in.As well as featuring not nearly enough of its hero, the film also suffers from an air of unrelenting grotesqueness (Burton going overboard on the freaky stuff), a really drab aesthetic (the winter setting leading to lots of dreary grey and blue visuals), and a boring plot in which the Penguin runs for mayor. At over two hours long, I felt my eyelids drooping a lot.4/10, minus one point for Walken's crazy hair and the unconvincing mechanical penguins/men in penguin costumes, some of the Stan Winston Studio's worst work.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Cyberpunk, meet German Expressionism","Raise your hand if you've ever heard the term ""German Expressionism."" If your hand is still timidly at your side, but you've seen this movie, put it in the erect position.Tim Burton returns to the age of silent movies and the spooky mise-en-scene of the likes of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu (which starred the real, and naturally hideous, Max Schreck as the vampire) with his follow-up to the Academy Award winning Batman.German Expressionism is rather simple in theory, but takes a master to execute. Basically, it means that the scenery surrounding the story is not an accurate representation of what we would expect to see, but rather an extension of the attitudes and moods of the central characters. In this case, we get a abysmally dark and lifelike Gotham City. Burton intentionally mixed clashing architectural styles so that nothing seemed to make sense in his phantasmagorical world.Score composer Danny Elfman is also back and provides a soundtrack that feels more like an opera than simple movie music. He writes and edits his notes and dynamics so that they line up with everything, right down to the physical movement of the characters. For a crash-course in how to create a great film moment with music, pay special attention to the meltdown of Selina Kyle in her apartment.Just as with Jack Nicholson in the original film, the focus is again on the villain(s), not Batman himself. Some people, especially connoisseurs of the comic book series, seem to despise Burton's decision to do so. However, I find it captivating and mesmerizing when coupled with the almost-cyberpunk landscape in which the story unfolds. DeVito and Pfeiffer do well enough to carry this responsibility.However, this film does not ride on the coattails of its stars. Rather, Burton's imaginative genius and Elfman's haunting score create a world that I feel like I've visited in my dreams, though I know it exists only in the depths of a few creative minds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The most fully realised of the Burton Batman films,"Both Tim Burton (director) and Michael Keaton (as Batman) return in this direct sequel to the previous film. This time there are new villains to contend with. Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito) haunts the criminal underworld but is desperate for acceptance from mainstream society after being abandoned by his parents as a child. While Selina Kyle/Catwoman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) is intent on revenge after being thrown out of a multistory building and left to die. Alongside this, Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken) is attempting to manipulate the people of Gotham City in order to cover up his corrupt business schemes. All three of these individuals have diabolical aims but there is one man who keeps on getting in their way: Batman. Thus, they have to find a way of removing him from the scene. This could involve murder but that seems too simple. Discrediting Batman and turning him into a public villain could prove to be a much more effective strategy.As is often the case in Batman films, Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, also has a role in a romantic angle. After his previous relationship with Vicki Vale was unsuccessful, he finds himself powerfully drawn to Selina, a woman who, in a different guise, acts as a mortal threat. How compromised will Bruce Wayne become? And how will this impact his ability to rescue the all-too-vulnerable citizens of Gotham City?Batman Returns, for my money, is clearly a superior effort to Burton's previous Batman film. The dark, Gothic atmosphere remains and is even given a new spin with the Christmas setting and constantly falling snow. The characters are given actual back-stories and there are genuine attempts to develop and express the motivations of the villains of the piece. This heightens the stakes and allows for much greater emotional engagement.There is also some genuinely witty dialogue this time around. Christopher Walken offering ""money... jewels... a giant ball of string..."" in order to attempt to pacify Catwoman was a personal highlight. And The Penguin at one point declaring ""They refused to put me on a pedestal, so I'll lay them all out on a slab"" does a wonderful job of conveying both the insecurity and childish malevolence of his character.Danny DeVito's Penguin sets the standard for how comic book villains have the ability to generate both pathos and revulsion. Into his character is written abandonment, vulnerability, and societal rejection; consequently, one can understand why he would develop feelings of callousness and antipathy towards his fellow man. But, for me, it's Michele Pfeiffer's Catwoman who is the most memorable character in the piece. Beginning as a frowsy, overlooked 30-something who seems to be nearing the point of an emotional breakdown, her self-reinvention as Catwoman provides a lease of life that future Heisenbergs and Lester Burnhams could quite easily have given a nod to. Pfeiffer's performance in this film is quite simply magnetic. Her neurotic, anarchic, feline energy perfectly encapsulate what a Batman villain should be in Burton's universe. She is as unstable as she is alluring and no Catwoman since has come close to the intoxicating energy her performance.The only serious downside to the film is the fact that Batman himself is clearly overshadowed by the aforementioned villains. His character arc doesn't really go anywhere from the previous film and his involvement in this one comes dangerously close at times to becoming an afterthought. Fans of the Batman character have long levelled this complaint at the film, which is understandable (it is called ""Batman Returns"" after all). Yet, as a fan of cinema first and a Batman fan second, I have to say that I think the decision to focus so much attention on the villains is very much justified. Their stories are more interesting than Batman's, the performances are exemplary and the film is an engaging watch as a result.There is still some silliness in the film, which has an almost playful tone in various moments. But this serves to typify Burton's style. It is worth noting that this film feels much more a piece with Burton's general oeuvre and this effort acts as a much more fully articulated expression of his vision than the previous Batman film. Those who are not particular fans of that vision may be put off but there is value in watching a unique director operating very close to the height of his powers.In my view, Batman Returns ought to be considered among the very best of the Batman films. It certainly does not provide the best story for the Batman character, but it is one of the most immersive, entertaining, and original movies which take place within the Batman universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
This movie blows,"The difference between this movie and the original Batman movie is that there was no Jack Nicholson to carry the movie and make up for Tim Burton's obsession with being weird and artsy and not knowing anything about the subject matter. Thank God Batman Begins came around to right the wrong created by ever hiring Tim Burton to make a movie about comic book characters when he thinks it's beneath him to actually learn about the comic book character's history.Aside from trying to cram two villains in to a movie to make up for neither one being Jack Nicholson and neither one pulling off the performance and adding in Christopher Walken's character for no apparent reason, the movie goes out of its way to disgusting for no reason. Being dark is one thing, but this movie goes over the top just to satiate Burton's ego.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Possibly the best screen version of a comic  ever.,"This pitchblack screen version of the batman figure is simply as perfect as it gets.First of all the winter Gotham in which the movie takes place, is a stunningly beautiful, dark and gothic place, a precise interpretation of the best of the batman graphic novels, and perhaps simply the best scenery that Tim Burton so far has produced (even counting Sleepy Hollow). Second -the story line, often accused of being far to black, to me is pure perfection. Never has the dubiousness of the batman figure been better put to light, and the dark corrupt world in which he lives, is to me the essence of the batman myth. After all we are taking about a man who has dedicated his whole life to the vengeance of something that happened to him as an 8 year old. If people want batman to be light family entertainment, they can go watch the 60`s tv-series (""quick robin get the shark spray""). Third, the acting is sublime, Michael Keaton (normally not a favorit of mine) plays him with an intensity that makes Val Kilmer and George Clooney look like something out of the above mentioned shows. The rest of the cast is equally perfect, what makes the difference from the later films is that this cast actually bothers to act, not just make caricatures.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

I've also noticed that most of the good reviews are from admitted Tim Burton lovers, something I make no claim to be. ""Batman & Robin"" is constantly maligned for being the downfall of this franchise (before Chris Nolan got his hands on it, of course), but this movie is just as bad as that one.

"Michelle Pfeiffer was born on April 29th, 1958","With the huge success of the first Batman (1989), Warner Bros decided they had a franchise on their hands and ordered up a sequel. We had returning champs, Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, Michael Gough (as Alfred), Pat Hingle (as Gordon) and even Danny Elfman, all returned. What limited some of the creative content in the first film, was pressure coming from the studio, that impeded Burton's actual vision of the film. Since the first film was a success, financially and critically, the deal for this film gave Burton more space away from the studio, which garnered more creative control and hopefully an even darker, more Burtonesque mood to the film.This time around, Keaton's Batman has to face the Penguin (Danny DeVito). He also has to contend with a brutally, evil businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who tries to kill his secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), because she stumbles across secrets of his, which triggers her turning into Catwoman. All this and DeVito's Oswald Cobblepot, runs for Mayor, with an emphasis on corruption. There is some romance between Bruce and Selina, while she tries to figure out how she will kill Max for trying to kill her. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a pretty convincing performance, as she and Burton delve deep into the psychological side of a woman, who died, resurrected as a Catwoman.I like this film, just a hair, more than the first film. It is my favorite from the Gough-Hingle universe (for lack of a better description for this franchise) and I think it has a lot to do with the added dose of Burton magic. This film has technologically, sweet art direction styles, costumes, set pieces, you name it. Burton's camera catches a colorful array of cinematographic gems, while Danny Elfman's soundtrack increases the mood, as the darkness of Cobblepot's day of reckoning approaches.9.2 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

"Equal To The Iconic Original, Albeit In a Completely Different Way","For many years, I held the staunch opinion that Tim Burton's 1989 Batman was clearly superior to this 1992 sequel. But every time I watch Batman Returns, I like it a little more. I now put it about on par with its predecessor, albeit doing so in a very different fashion.For a very basic overview, Batman Returns sees two new villains introduced to Gotham City: the mysterious sewer-dwelling Penguin (Danny DeVito) who seemingly just wants to find his long-lost parents (but also may have more nefarious goals in mind) and the frazzled secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfieffer), who is harangued by her boss to the point of mental breakdown and the creation of Catwoman. The villains form an uneasy truce due to a common ""enemy"": Batman (Michael Keaton). Concurrent with the superhero business, Gotham mega-mogul Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) hatches a nuclear power plant scheme that involves everyone in various ways.The '89 Batman resurrected the titular character in spectacular fashion-there would be no Christopher Nolan films or DC Universe without it. It was an iconic film. However, it did so in rather serious, sometimes even dour fashion. A few of Burton's touches are seen, but Batman is clearly a Warner Brothers studio-controlled origin story picture. Batman Returns is far more free-wheeling and fun. Clearly, Burton is being allowed to delve deeper into his gothic aesthetic-and it mostly works wonderfully! Penguin is a literal monster, Catwoman is deliciously over-the-top, and even Batman gets some wise-cracks. The whole thing reminds me of the Tobey Maguire Spiderman trilogy-like a comic book literally sprung to life, not at all overly self-serious or reverential.Of course, at the end of the day it is the acting performances that will always make Returns utterly rewatchable. DeVito's Penguin is genuinely terrifying-in all honesty far too grotesque for the children watching (but wonderful for the adults!). I'm not sure a better Penguin could ever be created. Pfieffer's Catwoman is equally iconic-strutting around in her latex suit and espousing a girl-power aura that easily resonates some 30+ years after being released.Overall, I ultimately land on 9/10 stars for Batman Returns-the same as I give Batman '89. While that film is the serious, gritty franchise-establisher that loses a star for maybe being a little too dour, Returns is the off-the-wheel, free-wheeling fun one that loses a star for maybe being a little too nutty.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Perfection achieved.,"Batman Returns is a poem of a film. As Kit Ramsey would say: ""It's a film, not a movie!"". Michael Keaton has totally become one with the character of Bruce Wayne and DeVito and Pfeiffer justify their casting the second they appear on the screen. Nothing short of a miracle. And as much as Burton is my favorite director, Danny Elfman is the magician this time around. The score he created for Batman Returns is in my opinion the highlight of his career so far. The music is absolutely beautiful and supports the imagery dead on. I'm very much looking forward to Nolan's fifth Batman film, 'cause Batman Forever (****) was on the limit of being complete failure and the almost legendary Batman and Robin (*) WAS just that.

I didn't like it like I did the original Batman and walked away really only appreciating Michelle's outfit.I mean...I was 12 and...hell, I still appreciate it.Thank you for that Cat Woman outfit.But I was 12 then and it was sort of disturbing and they made Danny DeVito look absolutely disgusting and I was so not a fan of that at 12...which goes to show you how things change because now I love how they made Danny DeVito look positively disgusting.Now I appreciate the stellar job they did in transforming him, and now I love how he took to the part and...well, I have so much respect for what he did with that role. He was his own kind of crazy. He did a better job than Jack did in the first one and Jack is always a pleasure to watch.So now that I am 37 it's still ""Thank you for the Cat Woman outfit,"" with ""DeVito was awesome in this!!!!!"" screamed at the top of my lungs.And of course you still have Keaton playing Bruce Wayne playing Batman, which adds even more depth now that the series has continued and....Walken.Walken is like Jackson, you'll sit through a crap movie because he's in it won't you? I know I do.And all in Burton's beautiful world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Best BatmanMovie EVER,"I'm an enormous comic book geek, and I've aways had a fascination for the darker comic book characters like Spawn, The Spectre, Deadman, and Batman. My favorite visual manifestations of the dark knight always lean towards the dark and exaggerated work of Kelley Jones, Sam Keth, Norm Breyfogle, or Ted McKeever. Tim Burton's Batman films (espescially this one) are the closest of the 6 Batman movies to capture this aspect. Unlike The Dark Knight(in which Heath Leger doesn't steal the show, he IS the show), the best performance in the whole film is Micheal Keaton's incredible Batman/Bruce Wayne. He really nails it as the caped crusader. From the subtle humor of Bruce Wayne to the dark brooding as Batman.But the supporting cast is excellent. Danny DeVito is absolutely brilliant as the Penguin. The film's portrayal isn't exactly true to the comics, but the Penguin is usually pretty lame with a bad origin and the Burton update is much more fascinating than to ridiculous comics version. As for Catwoman, sexy has a new name. Michelle is spellbinding as the Catwoman and I positively love that costume.When I draw Catwoman, she's always in a costume similar to the one in this film. The shiny leather and stitches are way cooler than the purple spandex in the comics. Also note the Batmobile, by far the best Batmobile ever. I love how much style Burton brings to the movie. The villains(DeVito,Pfeiffer,and Walken) all have a silent movie quality to them which is great. The Gotham City in the film is way more stylish and original than the other films.Danny Elfman's score is incredible and the costumes are some of the best I've ever seen. If you're a Tim Burton fan, see it. It really is one of his best. If your Batman fan, see it. As I've already said it's the best Batman yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Best Batman,"The best thing about Batman Returns is that, when you watch it, you manage to forget how much Joel Schumacher has destroyed the franchise. Batman Returns takes these famous characters and explores them deeply and disturbingly. What Burton started in Batman, he continues in this wildly stylistic sequel.Though in terms of writing and acting, the greatest success is celebrated by the villains. In Catwoman, we see Michelle Pfeiffer transform from a twitchy, nervous, and undertrod secretary into a dark, confident psychopath. Pfeiffer's performance in Returns is one of the most unsung in the history of film. We see her degenerate from scene to scene, slowly losing control, until the breaking point at the climax.Then there's the Penguin, bent on revenge against all the silver spooners who thrived where his parents abandoned him. His interaction with society can be easily compared to that of Edward Scissorhands. When they first recieve him, the city is thrilled at the novelty of his otherness, but they turn on him in an instant. The only difference is that the Penguin deserves it. In the end, he's abandoned once again, by the city, by his co-conspirators, and finally, by his avian minions themselves.Batman Returns takes what could have easily just been another pop culture action film and turns it into a twisted reflection on some very disturbed characters. Gotham City, under the direction of Burton, remains dark and gothic, unstained by the neon and blacklights that Schumacher would later invade it with.Returns is, and probably will always be, the last Batman movie to stay true to what Batman was truly about, a dark man, in a dark city, trying to find the light.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Spectacularly dark and cinematic,"Batman Returns is the 2nd Tim Burton Batman film and is a lot better than the first in terms of cinematography and atmosphere (which is difficult in itself as the first Batman did a good job there too). The film has some of the best Batman villains of the lot with the brilliant Christopher Walken as Max Shrek, Danny DeVito as the very sympathetic but equally murderous Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as the slightly crazy but incredibly dangerous Catwoman. As well as, of course, Michael Keaton as Batman.The plot's a lot better than the first film with more twists and turns and although there's 3 villains they seem to compliment each other and don't over-bloat the film, a common critique is there's not enough Bruce Wayne or Batman in the movie and I think I do probably agree to a degree but it's not as bad that he doesn't appear at all.8/10: Beautiful Tim Burton cinematography and great villains give this film a lot of points.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
From Cat-Scratch to Kitty Litter & Flightless Birds of the Sewer,"I get sick thinking about this movie. Really, seriously, legitimately sick to my stomach. It's either because it was really bad, or it had so much muck in it that cinema screens across America had to be scrubbed after showing it.Actually, it's both.This sequel to Tim Burton's groundbreaking 1989 version of ""Batman"" features the return of Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight. With Burton's trademark directorial style, there's bound to be some darkness. But not only darkness-- dankness as well! Danny DeVito, as the sewer-reared Penguin (there are penguins living in the sewer?), looks like an escapee from a low-budget toothpaste commercial. Michelle Pfeiffer, as the other villain, the kinky Catwoman, looks like she lost her way on the road to that elusive porn awards ceremony.Even the Joker's tumble into a vat of green acid was pleasant compared to the sickening imagery of this movie. Beyond the look and unsavory feel, the film dreadfully wastes such talent as Burton, Keaton, and Christopher Walken (of course, he visits the bottom of the barrel quite frequently) on a much more nauseating re-tread of the exact same shtick.The one main thing going for this movie is something it only acquired in 1997: the fact that it was nowhere near as bewilderingly awful as ""Batman & Robin.""",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Family values come up unexpectedly in Batman Returns.,"Poor Danny DeVito is the Penguin, a fine-feathered villain who turns out bad because he was dumped by his parents. The baby was raised by birds, and now it's hard to tell if he's foul, or fowl. His sad saga is only one of the many threads that tangle the plot of Tim Burton's partially successful, but really bad, sequel to his 1989 Batman. In Returns, we're given three villains for the price of one, but more is not always better. Any one of them could have carried his, or her, own movie, but here they just keep stepping on each other's toes (paws? claws?). The paws are provided by the marvelous Michelle Pfeiffer, as Catwoman. She gets the funniest lines and knows just what to do with them. She is spectacular in her basic black, home-sewn catsuit and her spike-heeled boots. The bullwhip is the perfect accessory to complete the outfit. Too bad the script can't quite figure out what she represents. DeVito is fine, but his birdman of Gotham, badly in need of a visit to the dentist, grows a tad wearisome. Christopher Walken completes the villainous trilogy as Max Shreck (great name), the unscrupulous businessman whose greed may be the downfall of Batman's hometown. He wisely, and skillfully, plays it down.Oh, yes, before we forget--there is what seems like a cameo appearance by Michael Keaton, as the caped crusader himself. The story is overly complicated, the transitions between story lines rather bumpy and the characters (with the exception of that darn Cat) don't really grab our interest. Still, the movie is a visual marvel, great at putting its money where our eyes are, and that's no guano. Would love to see more of Pfeiffer's kitten with a whip in future installments. Don't miss the credits at the end of Batman Returns, to see who plays the Penguin's daddy.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
I ashamedly admit: my favorite movie,"Whenever anyone asks me my favorite movie, I cringe and say ""Actually, it's *Batman Returns*.""  Then I cover my ears when they yell out ""What?  Are you crazy?"" Actually, it's a fair question.  This film is really an acquired taste, and yes, it does have its flaws.  For one thing, of course, it's not at all true to the comic book: Batman kills, Catwoman is not a thief, the Penguin is not an aristocratic mastermind.  For another thing, the acting borders on awful, from Michelle Pfeiffer's irritating ""I'm-so-lonesome"" schtick at the beginning, to Danny DeVito's thoroughly repulsive histrionics. But this film somehow transcends these picayune concerns and becomes a dark, almost poetic masterpiece.  Tim Burton fills the screen with haunting, daring, and nightmarish images, that capture the essence of the Dark Knight, if not the details.  If you're a Tim Burton fan (which I most assuredly am), you should know that this is probably the most Tim Burtonesque film he has yet made.   I dunno...guess I can't really put it into words...I am a longtime Batman fanatic, and for me this movie captures all the darkness, fierceness, and tragedy that surround the legend of the Dark Knight.  It IS worth renting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
A Wonderful Mess,"First off, this film has no story. It's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.That said, the film is kinda brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing -- and I mean amazing, as Catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. Walken is Walken -- but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable.Keaton is underrated as Batman.And the music and style are pure cinema thrill. True, the 3rd act doesn't work. But the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, Joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of movie fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Batman at his finest!,"I'll start by confessing a few things-Batman is my favorite superhero and Tim Burton is by far one of my favorite director/screenwriters. This film beautifully melds storylines in a way that are both dark and captivating, while also having a campy, comic element that few films are able to achieve. Michael Keaton as Batman is the absolute best, as he is believable as our tortured hero, and Michelle Pfieffer as Catwoman?? Who wouldn't love this film?!? Danny Devito as Penguin Man is both disturbing and believable, and you can't help but empathize with him as his story develops. I remember watching this movie as a kid and being intrigued by the character development and being both terrified of and sad about Penguin Man's storyline...I recall being drawn into the story...I still think that Oswald's intentions were pure at first when he was seeking out his parents, but I digress.No film Is without it's flaws, but if you're looking for a fun, campy, well acted yet disturbing rendition of Batman and the villains of Gotham, this is the film for you. It's a classic, one of those films you could watch and watch again just for the sake of the amazing costuming, soundtrack, and decent storyline...if you haven't watched it yet, please do, you'll be glad you did!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Loose narrative structure,"Batman Returns is one of the missed opportunities in the Batman film series. Tim Burton was given full creative control, and to those who know the production history of the previous movie then you're likely aware Tim didn't really care much for the comic book source material. Screenwriter Sam Hamm kept both of the movies having the most connection to the comics, and while parts of his script drafts are present for both movies they both got rewritten at some point by different writers, for this movie it was Daniel Waters.While Batman's name is in the title, the script doesn't have a clear protagonist in the movie all the time. In most cases your protagonist undergoes some sort of change in their character arc, and the closest we get to this is Selina Kyle/Catwoman, however she shares about the same amount of screen time as Batman, Penguin, and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken. With Selina Kyle we see her go from the timid, lonely, and down on her luck secretary to a mentally unstable vengeful fighter in the Catwoman persona. Since the movie pays a lot of time to other characters there isn't always as much focus on her story as it could've been, as the middle portion of the movie mostly focuses on a bizarre plot of The Penguin running for mayor and teaming up with Catwoman to stop Batman. Catwoman's main motive and goal in the movie is to kill Max Shreck for his attempted murder on her, which isn't focused on for most of her screen time. The most fascinating scenes are the one's she has with Bruce Wayne and Batman whether in or out of costume. This is mostly due to how the character relate and reflect each other's personas. When the movie ends and you realize Bruce and Selina won't end up together it's somewhat sad because you get the sense they'd make each other live happily.The performances in the movie are somewhat good, but are hampered down by sometimes dreadful dialogue (""Eat floor. High fiber.""). The movie's plot bounces around too often to get too invested in any of the subplots. For instance, Max Shreck has a boring plan to monopolize and stockpile the power supply in Gotham, but this plot is abandoned and then the movie chooses to focus on him running a campaign to get Penguin to be mayor of Gotham. Neither plot goes anywhere really, with the latter more being there to create occasional roadblocks for Batman to overcome. The Penguin's main goal is to kidnap and kill all of Gotham's first born children, but this is also abandoned for most of the movie for the mayor subplot and his team up subplot with Catwoman. It's not until the third act when he actually acts on this, and it's easily thwarted by Batman within a handful of minutes. He then all the sudden has an army of penguins with rockets strapped on them intending to shoot at Gotham plaza which is also stopped by Batman in about 2 minutes.There are also very bizarre unexplained occurrences in the plot such as the Penguin somehow having the blueprints to the batmobile and knowing how to sabotage its control system. Selina Kyle, whom there was no indication of knowing acrobatics, martial arts, and how to handle a whip knows how to do all of this when revived from her fall. There's also the silly mirror setup outside Wayne Manor having the Batman emblem, and it leaves you to wonder how many people could just drive by and notice it in Gotham.The movie does have great art direction and cinematography, so it's a very easy movie to look at, but not always the easiest movie to care for. Danny Elfman's score for this movie is almost as good as his score for the first movie, so there's plenty to enjoy with the music. Overall it stands at about a 5.6/10 for me. There was a lot of potential, however, the movie likely would've been better served if the Penguin was removed since he's often tied to the least interesting plots in the movie and would save more time on Catwoman's arc which is by far the most interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Very dark and sometimes very silly and inaccurate.,"Batman is back to save the city for a second time. And this time he has two main villains and a circus gang to fight against. As if this is not enough, Max Schrek is badder than Penguin and Catwoman together. This film is very dark, but also pretty camp. People complain about Batman Forever for being campy. OK, they may be right. But look closer at the Penguin and the circus gang, and you will understand what I mean. Some of the characters in the gang even have similar Jim Carrey - expressions. And Penguin drop of one bad joke after another. Catwoman howewer is very dangerous, but not just for Batman. And about Batman in this film: he kills !! Batman has sworn to NEVER take a life. In this film he kills of two members of the circus gang, with purpose. This is odd, because in the first film he does not kill of people.He tries to save Jacks Napier when he is about to fall in the acid ! And they made Penguin a monster. From what I recall, Penguin from the 60's TV - series and Batman TAS was more of a gentleman. And they have to kill him of in the end.

We get no new character development of Batman, no look into his motivations, psyche or past.  The character of the Penguin is bad enough, but the origin of Catwoman is absolutely absurd. Let's see if you are pushed out of a window and fall to what surely would be your death and then a mob of cats gathers around you, you will wake up a world class gymnast, an expert at martial arts and a master with a whip. You can also survive being shot 3 or 4 times at point blank range and survive and electric shock strong enough to fry someone else, heck if you get all this, push me out the window right now!

Sickos never scare me. At least they're committed.,"Batman faces several villains in an effort to protect Gotham city.'Batman Returns' is a great sequel by Tim Burton with wonderful visuals and memorable characters.The plot is character-driven, with freak-like individuals who clash in the darkly humorous and gothic backdrop of Gotham. The Penguin and Catwoman are portrayed as downtrodden outcasts with tragic origins like Batman. I think the development of these characters is the most compelling aspect of the movie.Immediately from the opening credits we learn the Penguin's story with fantastic visuals and it continues throughout the movie. This is a memorable character thanks to the makeup, costuming, and Danny DeVito's raging, lecherous and truly disgusting performance.The Penguin's credibility as an antagonist is aided by the inclusion of the Max Schreck character. Christopher Walken lends his immense charisma to a character who embodies a greedy, ruthless business mogul looking to exploit everything and everyone for his own gain. His portrayal works as an instrument for the Penguin's rise to prominence and to further corrupt the soul of Gotham City. His character also serves as a CATalyst to development of Selina Kyle.Kyle is portrayed as a lonely city dweller implied to have a diminishing fairytale outlook on life before her dramatic rebirth as Catwoman. Her character is wonderfully presented by the set design of her apartment and Michelle Pfeiffer's phenomenally entertaining performance. She has the best lines in the movie and delivers them with great comic timing. In fact as Catwoman she lights up the screen with each appearance and steals most scenes.As you would expect from a Burton picture, the art direction is brilliant. I love the grim facist style of Gotham Plaza, the murky sewers, the derelict zoo and the atmospheric interiors. There is more than hint of Citizen Kane about a number of images and themes, particularly the huge Wayne Manor fireplace, bleakness of winter, parental abandonment and general feelings of isolation driving many of characters.Ultimately it is a comic book movie and it builds to solid confrontation involving all the main characters. It might not have the modern day effects and computer assisted spectacle, but it is a triumphant piece of filmmaking.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Burton´s triumph!,"In this movie Tim Burton really succeeds to put Batman in the dark world of Gotham where he actually belongs.

But of course there are several highlights. And who can resist a dialogue with lines like: ""Oswald, It´s some BODY here to see you..."" followed by the entrance of lovely miss Pfeiffer.Add to this Danny Elfmans music and ofcourse the outstanding settings and you have this great movie.

Even better than the first original Batman (1989).,"Maybe I will go a bit to far, but this movie, for me, is even better than it's predecessor. Yes, in the first movie Jack Nicholson's Joker is outstanding, his role is beyond great, he is the icon of the movie, but still, nothing is darker than this sequel. Here we have more than one main bad guy, we have The Penguin, The Catwoman and also Shrek, the businessman. The Penguin played by Danny DeVito is something else, it is beyond good, it is something that can never be replayed. The costume work done both for The Penguin and The Catwoman is pure art. What can I say about the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeifer ? The best female semi anti-hero ever played on the movie screens ? She does everything in this movie with a feeling of crazyness, power and emotion, all three at the same time. There is nothing do discuss about Michael Keaton as Batman, he has already proven himself in the first movie, altho he is even better and a more complete character in this sequel. Also the city is once again beautiful, dark, gothic, cold and full with criminals, one of the most beautiful aspects of the movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"doom, gloom, and a lotta ""kaboom""","Before tonight, it had been a whopping 14 years since I'd seen ""Batman Returns"" (upon its initial theatrical release)...probably because I didn't like it much the first time around. With old(er) age and a more well-rounded appreciation of cinema, I decided to give it another shot, and...well, it was a LITTLE better than I remember it being when I was a tyke. The plot has something to do with a deformed child dumped in the Gotham City sewer, who is befriended and raised by penguins, and somehow amasses a face-painted sideshow cult to do his bidding, rising to the ranks of Penguin (an extremely unrestrained Danny DeVito); meanwhile, put-upon secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) stumbles upon a shady deal her industrialist boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is looking to pull, and is murdered for her efforts, only to be resurrected as Catwoman, a nimble minx in a bondage outfit. Batman (Michael Keaton) spends most of his time in the background of chaotic scenes, and is hardly in the movie. ""Batman Returns"" shows off director Tim Burton's big-budget stylistic flair, with a taste for the macabre and a morbid sense of humor; the script, however, takes a colossal misstep in putting the Penguin at the center of things, as he is easily the most obnoxious adversary the Caped Crusader has ever had to confront. His endless one-liners only randomly hit the funny bone, and the plot surrounding him feels fabricated. Catwoman has more seductive charm, as does Walken's Shreck, but even they can't detract from this overcooked movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"""Let's Make A Mayor!""","This is dark like the 1st film but more of a fairy theme. Christmas never seems to happen in this film but then I think director Tim Burton has a fascination for the magical anticipation of the run up to Christmas that is such a part of childhood-witness Nightmare Before Christmas too! Burton blends a number of myths and famous stories into this film- e.g. a bit of pied piper, Moses (Oswald Cobblepot being abandoned as a bay and put in a basket in the water) . It's a good basis for his take on the hero.I really feel the film captures the sense of divide between the rich and poor in this world, the costumes and fashion seem heavily influenced by the depression era 1930's fur coats and top hats for the rich, old dull looking clothes for the rest. For a film called ""Batman Returns"" it's interesting that Batman is hardly in it and there is basically no character development for him. Burton seems more interested in the villains, the Penguin and the morally ambiguous Cat-Woman the later of which sort of goes through quite an arc over the course of the film. In a way I might have preferred a story focused more on the battle between Batman and Cat-Woman and cut out all the silly baby murdering, circus show, giant rubber ducks and flying umbrellas.My main complaint about the film is the use at the end of it of 'rocket strapped commando penguins', the dark Gothic tone was ruined for me at that moment, it just came across as a bit wacky and goofy. De Vito as the penguin though was a great choice and he's clearly having a ball with the role. The film also lacks the strong emotional connection which Bruce Wayne and Alfred have in the Nolan version, in this version though Bruce Wayne is more mature than the Christina Bale version and seems to need less emotional support. The film really succeeds in capturing the comic book feel of Batman with the set design, haunting visuals, great lines and Wonderful villains.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
I get why people have mixed feelings about this movie; and I stand by those who love it.,"Batman Returns is one of the edgiest mainstream 90s blockbusters you'll EVER see. It's got so much edge that the film was unsuitable for McDonald's planned Happy Meal tie-in promotions for the movie so they cancelled those plans. So how does this film compare to the multitude of Batman films after this one came out? Pretty good I'd say. Even against Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy it's still a solid movie in itself. Where Nolan got the crime and neo-noir aspects of Batman down-pat, Burton accomplished for the Gothic overtones present in a lot of the classic Batman stories.Batman Returns is not exactly a feel-good superhero film: its villain, Oswald Cobblepot, is a misfit who was thrown into a river left to die (by his parents), and Selina Kyle turns regular woman into crime-fighting-and-committing vigilante by night. And Batman is still that same tormented orphan we've all come to know and love through the years.Batman Returns is a dark Batman story but its Gothic imagery compliments the story and direction, even if the style sometimes out-performs the story to some extent.

this movie went so wrong!,"Although Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return for this sequel to BATMAN (1989), this movie was a terrible followup to the blockbuster film. While the original film was dark and terribly entertaining, this film was far, far darker and offered little that could be seen as entertaining.Instead of a funny and over-the-top villain like the Joker, this one features Danny DeVito as one of the ugliest and most repellent villains of all time. In addition, the back story just made no sense at all and was just 100% stupid. A horrid couple have a horribly deformed baby. So, they do what most folks would do--chuck the kid in the sewer! There, he is somehow transported to a land where he is raised by animals. Later, he creates an army of evil armed penguins.Now, no matter how good the film is from this point on, the premise and characters are so stupid that it can't help but fail. It's visually impressive but also ugly and nihilistic. After starring in this mess, I can understand why Keaton bowed out of future Batman films.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Another Batman classic from 1992,I enjoyed this Tim Burton film as well. Danny DeVito did an excellent performance as the Penguin. I especially like the part when Batman drives the Batmobile and takes out the Circus gang. But I also really like the fight scene where Batman fights the Red Triangle Circus on the street. It's almost like Batman: The Animated Series coming to life. The story was great and even darker than the first film. The film alienated the audience when it was released. Although there were mixed reviews about the film and this wasn't Tim Burton's greatest project but I still like it to this day.

"Batman returns, should we care? Yes!","More free to apply his personal vision when compared to the first Batman, Tim Burton turns the Batman mythos to a feverish stylized Gothic fairy-tale, on whose core lies poisonous cynicism and pessimism.Gotham City rots. It's business elite sinks in a ruthless corruption and manipulates the political system at will. It's citizens are scared and weak-minded pawns. Catwoman is basically a repressed and suppressed suburban housewife/ working-woman. Batman is a lone and slightly sad, but heroic, figure. The Penguin is ultimately the most tragic figure of all - a direct result of society's anthropophagy.Tim Burton sinks himself in this Gotham abyss, turning it to an almost attractive dιcor, whose heroes let themselves pinch and scrape.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"equal to the original,except for one small problem","to me this sequel to ""Batman"" is as good as the first,except for one minor complaint.i'll get into that later.first,the good.this movie improves i think,on the fighting scenes.i think they were a bit more spectacular.i also think the suit looked a bit different,darker maybe,which i liked.Michael Keaton is good again as the the title character/Bruce Wayne.this movie, while generally staying dark like it's predecessor,occasionally takes on a more magical,almost whimsical tone,which is not a bad thing.this time there is more than one villain.first,there's Danny Devito as the Penguin,and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman.Devito is great as the Penguin,clearly relishing his turn as a psychopath.nothing wrong with that performance.but here is the one small complaint i have:the look of the Penguin itself.to me,it just seems like you could tell Devito had padding on to look fatter.this annoyed me a bit.Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman is terrific,a dream to many males out there.she certainly looked good in that leather outfit.there is also a bit more chaos in this one,a few more explosions,but not so much that it becomes ridiculous.if it weren't for how not quite real the Penguin's bulk looked,this movie would rate as high as the first.however,instead of 10/10*,this film still gets a very strong 9/10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
best action drama film,It was great just like the first one Michael Keaton did another excellent role as batman. Danny Devito and Christopher Walken did good playing a bad guy. the movie was exciting and great to watch. Tim Burton did another excellent job on this film and to bad it was his last of doing this film. The cast did a excellent job and writing was good and the cast match there character respectfully. Not to mention the performance of Catwomen was excellent and made a great screen performance with Batman and made it a great to watch film that kept every one of there seats. And there on screen Romance kept every one wondering what going to happen,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Icky DeVito's performance.,"As a writer, I'm more sensitive than the Regular Joe to plot devices and character motivations. While Nicholson offered us a top notch performance as the Joker in Batman, neither DeVito nor Pfeiffer provide enough strength or motivation to become the so called villains of this motion picture. I went to the theater with high expectations (I even rented Batman to get back high on the subject) and came out utterly disappointed. Even a Luke warm homage to Burguess Meredith would have been a better sequel to the first Batman.Imagine this: DeVito could have played a millionaire eccentric bird lover whose fortune had been taken away, (obviously a rip off plot from Trading Places) but it would lend the character some more power. Then he attacks the city with his army of penguins. Lovable!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
My view on the film,"Batman Returns is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. Like the original Batman, Batman Returns provides Bat-fans everywhere with what they want in a Batman film. It is a very original sequel and doesn't copy the first film in any way (unlike Batman & Robin which just seemed like a not so good re-make of Batman Forever). Michael Keaton, once again, plays Batman brilliantly and , once again, the only thing letting him down is his look. He just doesn't look like Batman, plus, I think Batman should be at least six foot whereas Michael Keaton is under six foot. Danny DeVito is great as The penguin and Michelle Pfieffer is purrrr-fect as Catwoman. Batman Returns, quite simply, is great!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The last great batman film,"Batman and Robin and Batman Forever are two great examples in the history of motion cinema that proves the theory that you don't need a worthy script to make a movie. Thank the Lord for special effects. Batman Returns not only has excellent performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle ""Pussy Cat"" Pfeiffer, but remains loyal to the original film having Michael Keaton return as Batman. Also, Batman Returns is set in a realistic ""Fictional"" city. The next two sequels to the Batman trilogy are set in fantasy lands right out of a 1970's comic book. Buildings that are 200 story long with giant Rome like statues that surround this crazy Gotham city. It goes to show you how special effects can carry a film. The true Batman trilogy ends with this film, the other two are just for show and marketing value. Take my word for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Another great Batman film by Burton,"With a great cast and beautiful visuals, Tim Burton has done it again. This is a great second film to the first. Keaton as always is THE Batman in my opinion and Danny Deviyo does great as the Penguin. Pfiefer nailed it as Cat Woman and Christopher Walken is great I'm everything. The premise is great, the story, the characters......perfect. People who down this film know nothing about good movies and must be too young to appreciate how good this is.

Mediocre Sequel That Got Too Carried Away,"I saw this movie on opening night and would start my junior year in college that fall. I initially loved this movie when it first came out and saw it twice in theaters. However, I don't particularly like it as much as I did when it was released. Why? I'll explain all that shortly. First, here's what I do love and still love about Batman Returns. 1: Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He did an excellent job. 2: Catwoman: Michelle Pheiffer was superb in the role and she not only stole the movie, I felt she was the best thing about Batman Returns altogether. Selina Kyle, the costume, and the attitude and her relationship with Batman both in and out of costume. 3: The Penguin's mutated look and nothing more. Nuff said. 4: Wayne Manor and the Batcave. The only two sets I really liked. 5: Michael Gough as Alfred. 6: As I said before, Batman and Catwoman's relationship as foes and in regular clothes, we see Bruce pursue Selina, unlike the first film where Vicki pursued Bruce. Plus, the reference to Vicki from the last movie gave it a nice touch of continuity.Okay, here's why I don't give Batman returns the high praise given by many. The four Batfilms of the 80's and 90's share a common link when it came to the directors. To me, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher both did good on their first films, but got too carried away with their own visions in their second go around, only Schumacher was worse about it.But yes. I feel that Tim Burton got too carried away with his vision in Batman Returns.1: Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. I absolutely refuse to believe that set for downtown Gotham was actually Gotham Square. The Zoo where the Penguin's hideout looked like something of a hybrid of the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. 2: The Penguin. While I like Danny DiVito as an actor and the mutant bird man look, the Penguin's storyline was totally disgusting to me. The Penguin was portrayed as an ugly character who was a product of circumstances he could not control (his deformity at birth) I hated his storyline. After watching the Penguin on Batman: The Animated Series, I kept thinking, gee, why couldn't they have done that in Batman Returns? I liked it better when the Penguin is highly intelligent and considers himself a member of Gotham's elite. 3: The Red Triangle Circus Gang. What a sick filthy joke! I really hate these guys with a fierce bloody passion. They made the Penguin look even worse. I would have preferred real underworld thugs in comparison. Tim Burton got too carried away with this part. 4: Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. I liked the concept of the evil businessman, but Shreck's look just did not fit into the Batman universe for me. I'd have rather seen somebody like Rupert Thorne over Shreck any day. 5: I know that Dark Knight fans prefer Batman Returns over the Schumacher films, but I am one of those fans who like the Dynamic Duo, so I am a Robin fan and the fact that he was excluded from this film is one reason I don't care for it as much, even though he had been given a much better costume in the comics. But then again, there was talk about Robin being a street guy played by Marlon Wayans. So I guess I am grateful that Robin wasn't included just for the sake of not messing up a popular character.Overall, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns and I love Danny Elfman's musical score on the soundtrack, but the film got way too Tim Burton-ish for me. Batman and Catwoman really made this movie, even though Batman is once again upstaged by the villains. But to be honest, I like Batman Forever over this installment. Batman Returns to me, is mediocre at best.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
So much yummier,"Cast your mind back to the scorching summer of 1989. Remember what a huge deal Tim Burton's Batman was? Those restricted set-reports! That massive press campaign! That Prince soundtrack! 'Batmania' they called it.However, this writer also remembers a conversation between two girls at a bus stop, slathered with that ubiquitous black and yellow poster, a week after it came out. ""Saw that the other day."" ""Wossit like?"" ""Bit boring."" History hasn't been particularly kind to Batman (less so to Prince's score. Wither 'Lemon Crush'?) Nevertheless, it did generate $750 million worth of merchandise which meant sequel time.Burton hadn't originally signed up for a follow-up (ah, such innocent times), describing such a prospect as ""a dumbfounded idea"" and even admitting the original was, yes, ""a little boring at times"". Any subsequent film would have to be treated like ""another Batman movie altogether"".And so it was: without stinting on the pathos (Danny DeVito's Penguin) or sex appeal (Michelle Pfeiffer's astoundingly horny bad girl Catwoman), Burton would give full vent to his German Expressionist tendencies (see Christopher Walken's second-tier baddie Max Shrek) and cartoonish indulgences. This was more like it! Pre-Batman Begins, Batman Returns is the best Batman film in the canon. No Prince, either.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
The Bat.  The Cat.  The Penguin.  This tagline perfectly summed up Batman Returns.,"Following the blockbusting success of Batman (1989), Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Tim Burton returns to the director's chair in Batman Returns. This time there are two villains, The Penguin and Catwoman, that Batman must face off against. The film is noticeably darker compared to the first movie, and some parts were violent. Looking back now, its no wonder many parents were complaining that Batman Returns had scared and upset many young kids. Despite the fact Batman Returns was a box office success in 1992, it was a shame that Warner Bros asked Tim Burton to step aside from future directorial duties with the Batman franchise and in return Joel Schumacher took the family-friendly route with Batman Forever (1995) and Batman and Robin (1997) which did the franchise more harm that good. Michael Keaton also declined to return as Batman when Tim Burton did not return, with Val Kilmer and George Clooney respectively donning the Batman suit.Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne who as Batman must take on The Penguin and Catwoman who both have sinister motives to cause chaos in Gotham City. Also, Bruce Wayne must contend with shady businessman Max Shreck who has sinister motives to build a power plant to drain Gotham City of its energy as well as pushing The Penguin for Mayor. Besides Christian Bale, I have always liked Michael Keaton as Batman. He brings a very darkly comic side to his role as well as maintaining a heroic and dramatic edge.Danny De Vito is totally unrecognisable in one of his best roles as The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot, who lives in the sewers after he is dumped into a river as a baby by his high society parents 33 years ago after the discover to their horror that he is deformed. Oswald Cobblepot is raised in the sewers by a flock of penguins thus he later adopts his alter ego as The Penguin. The Penguin hatches a plan to unleash chaos onto Gotham City with the Red Triangle Gang made up of circus members, but not before kidnapping Max Shreck and blackmailing him into helping him become an accepted citizen in Gotham City as well as Max Shreck pushing him as a mayoral candidate in order to win over the support and appeal of the citizens of Gotham City.Michelle Pfeiffer is the mousy secretary Selina Kyle who Max Shreck and other corporate bosses treat her with contempt. Selina Kyle uncovers Max Shreck's sinister motives for his power plant and is pushed out of a window, believed to be killed. Selina Kyle is revived by a flock of cats and later violently lashes out, destroying her apartment and transforming her new life and personality by donning a new costume, adopting her new alter ego as Catwoman. Selina Kyle's personality also has transformed from meek and mild to deranged and sexually charged.Christopher Walken is the shady businessman Max Shreck who is seen as Gotham City's larger than life savior yet has sinister greedy motives to drain Gotham City of its power supply through his new power plant which will also see him rake in a lot of profit. Christopher Walken also bring an occasionally dark, deadpan and subtle humorous side to Max Shreck.Tim Burton is a quality director and he continues to bring his dark, brooding vision to the Batman franchise with this welcome sequel to the 1989 blockbuster. The story is excellent, art direction and make up top notch. The standout is The Penguin's make up, transforming Danny De Vito into an unrecognisable villain. The main cast which includes Michael Keaton, Danny De Vito, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken were top notch.Besides The Dark Knight trilogy, Batman Returns did have a reputation for being violent and dark for children, however The Dark Knight trilogy did not seem to receive any criticisms, with audiences accepting that it would not be suitable for young children. As a 8 year old, I was shocked that Batman Returns received a M 15+ rating in Australia, however upon seeing it on home video, I wasn't bothered by its dark tone at all.After Batman Returns, the Batman franchise became family-friendly which may have seen the decline of the Batman franchise. To the relief of many Batman fans such as myself, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale resurrected the Batman franchise with Batman Begins (2005).Batman Returns is still a pleasure to watch, although nothing can surpass the first Batman movie. Though it may be dark for a Batman movie, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"

Again, I liked the action scenes in the movie and I thought it was great when Selina (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) turned into Catwoman because of her out-of-control behaviour and the way she trashed her house.The reason I think some people say this one is better than the first is because it is more action-packed, which is probably what the comic book is supposed to be. I also thought Danny DeVito looked great as the Penguin and played him very well. To me, this is nearly as good as the first and is also recommended for fans of Batman and DC comics.

He was abandon by his parents due to his appearance and the only family he has are the penguins and ex-circus performers.

Will this bird guy get what he wants? Not only that but BatMan also has another problem to deal with. Another new villain has made her appearance in the crime wave and justice system of Gotham. Her name is CatWoman who is a woman with the instincts of a cat. It's undetermined whether she's friend or foe.With 2 psychopathic characters running around Gotham. It'll be interesting on how BatMan will be able to restore peace to the city.This sequel is as great as the first one.

Best in the series.,"Pros: Sets, directing, humor, characters, costumes, score, action sequences.Cons: A bit dark at times, last 20 minutes ludicrous at times.Batman returns, Tim Burton's follow up to the 1989 blockbuster screams his trademark directing. Burton got more control over the production and the result is a fantastic film even thought the studio execs and the public didn't like it. Danny Devito is manical as the penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy as catwoman and Micheal Keaton returns as batman. Christopher Walken as Max Shreck nearly steals the show and Elfman's score is basically the same from the last movie except for the choir he used. Gotham city is much darker and this film looks like it cost more. The batmobile is featured more and the action sequences are outstanding.

One of the Biggest Disappointments,"The first ""Batman"" was far from a masterpiece, but the second installment in the series is a dark and utterly disgusting mess.  Tim Burton's direction is so overbearing and mean-spirited that the film was doomed from the start. Michael Keaton does return as Batman and does about as well as he did in the original.  The absence of Jack Nicholson is felt throughout this film though.  Michelle Pfeiffer (Catwoman) and Danny DeVito (Penguin) never do add drama or intensity to the ultimately shallow and dull screenplay. Christopher Walken (Max Schreck) is also wasted as yet another super-criminal who wants to drain Gotham City of its power supply. Overbearing and ultimately stupid, a huge downer.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
an underrated classic,"This may well be one of my favorite batman movies. The acting (specifically from Michelle Pfieffer, and Danny DeVito) is impeccable, the action is top-notch as comes with the genre, and the story is amazingly fun, mostly due to the magical weirdness of director Tim Burton. Catwoman may be one of my favorite characters in this movie, followed very closely by DeVito's Penguin, specifically due to the acting. Fun Fact, Pfieffer actually did all of her own stunts for this movie, including the shots with her whip. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this movie.

Deliciously dark,"This, in my opinion, was the best Batman movie yet made, because it achieved the right balance between realism and insanity. Batman Begins tried to find realistic explanations for the freakishness behind its heroes and villains. The world of a comic book hero should not be deconstructed so. Mystery and fantasy should be encouraged, because it makes things so much less predictable. It also allows the creative art director to go absolutely bonkers!!!The Gotham City that Tim Burton creates, projects the world of the comic book onto the big screen with complete faithfulness. Floating somewhere between 40's Chicago and 90's New York, its mass of high rise structures provide a glittering backdrop to the predominantly night time scenes, in which silence is torn apart by flame juggling clowns and psychedelic carnival freaks, a mad business tycoon who wants to rule the city and a vengeful seductress in skintight black leather. All driven by a stellar cast who clearly love the saga and enjoy every line given to their characters. One thing that can be said about the cast is that the primary focus is completely stolen from Batman by the villains. However, the magic used by De Vito and Pfeifer to portray their characters Penguin and Catwoman is so damn alluring I can't see it as a bad thing.The tone oscillates zestfully between child's play and adult fun; the conventional quips are loaded with slick wit and raunchy innuendo, and hearty laughs are followed by harsh violence. It's a roller-coaster, a guilty pleasure.I might agree that Batman Returns is a little more icing than sponge, but when the icing tastes so good, who cares?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
Gothic Camp at its Finest,"Batman Returns is a classic. But is so incredibly campy that I just couldn't rate it too highly. But it's no usual camp but a brooding, gothic camp that becomes a lasting landmark of Tim Burton's directional career. Even though the story may not hold an incredible gripping plot.

So we get Catwoman, Penguin, and stock villain Christopher Walken taking Gotham City by storm and never really seeming all that dangerous. Batman shows up, of course, never really seeming all that impressive. Tim Burton is not great at creating action sequences, but he makes up for it with a very cool look for the sets, the costumes, and the film itself.

Batman returned with style,"After first Tim Burton 'Bat' movie we all expected second one to be if not better then at least equal to its predecessor. While ""Batman"" is mostly one man show (Jack Nicholson) coupled with capable direction of Burton; this one full field my every expectation and I think it is even better then the first and holds a nominee for best Batman movie ever made. Let me tell you why...""Batman Returns"" has a great story and every character is elaborated to tiny details. Batman's enemies are Penguin and Catwoman and by entrance of new and interesting characters ""Batman Returns"" gained only pluses. Here, I must say that all the cast done their job with no stains. Michael Keaton had tougher role then in first one and he passed the test. As always Batman movies is as good as the villain is. Danny DeVito in role of Penguin is amazing, just like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman who had acting transformation from boring secretary to a deadly Batman opponent and love. If only makers of the ""Catwoman"" and Halle Berry watched what real Catwoman should be, maybe they wouldn't make one of the worst movies ever. To round this excellent casting I will mention Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Classic staff and here Walken is memorable.But what movie would Batman be without dark genius, and my favorite director, Tim Burton. Burton created Gotham city that none of the directors after managed to copy (we've all witnessed on how low branches Schumacher took it and how Nolan tried to raise it from dead with success). So dark, creepy and atmospheric. He plays with light in scene where Walken decides to get rid off Pfeiffer, he creates mean Penguin with classic Burton bright side (benneath all he's a good person that is always abandoned from people). There he reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, another Burton's 'child'.So till now you've realized that I like this movie, cause it's a comic brought to life thanks to Tim Burton and his never ending creativity. He managed to round the picture with no holes and if you don't understand Burton's work then you probably won't be able to enjoy in this Batman fully. Cause this one has Burton signature all over it and now it's official that Batman returned with style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
"Batman returns, but does anyone care?","One word to sum up the sequel to the 250 million dollar grossing first film Batman, freak show. First lets look at the facts, Burton's odd casting choice I mean Pfeiffer is built for the slim kitty suit, but doesn't quite feel right as Catwoman. DeVito as the fat freak Peguin is no were near as cool as the Joker and there are much better villains to choose from in the Rouge's Gallery. Also I didn't like the trend of paring up two villains because one is enough to focus on. Keaton is the only saving grace of the film and the only person you care about in the movie. Burton almost makes the same movie again, but not as good or fun. At least Elfman's score soars and the themes match the mood of the characters. The one thing that made the movie even worse was that Gotham looked to Burtonish for me and felt like a sideshow and not a city of crime. I look at the movie like this, an art film with Batman in it.The first Batman was new and fresh while Returns has that been there done that feel. Where Spider-Man 2 topped the first one, Returns took the series one step back and for me one step back is to far.

Batman Returns with a darker edge,"Batman released in 1989 breathed new life into the enigmatic crime-fighter. With a brilliant over-the-top performance by Jack Nicholson as the Joker and beautifully dark set-designs that captured the true essence of Gotham City, made Batman a huge hit. A sequel was bound to happen and it did in 1992 but did it live up to the expectation of the first Batman?Well, to be honest it comes down to opinion, while the first Batman may be the more popular choice of the two, there's no denying Batman Returns has evolved the Batman story wonderfully and while the first Batman may have aimed at kids and young adults, Batman Returns isn't aimed for kids or going for Box Office millions like the first film. It seems with Batman Returns director Tim Burton had far more influence over this film than the original.Batman Returns is a dark, gripping and almost eerie film that doesn't contain the same atmosphere as the first Batman, Batman Returns is far more darker and the scenery helps suggest this. Gotham city is covered in snow and skyscrapers are fully placed around the city. Although, it's quite stunning to view these great sets, it's almost beautiful in that Tim Burton fashion. Movies like Sleepy Hollow, The Nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands feature wonderful sets that are amazing to view and with Batman Returns it's no different.Performances in Batman Returns are all very good. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and delivers a far more deeper and darker performance than his earlier performance. Although, in Batman Returns we learn more about Batman, it doesn't mean Keaton makes Batman more acceptable or open, quite the opposite as in Batman Returns the Batman character is less appealing but more compelling in a peculiar way. The reason for this is because of the way Keaton has made the character more concealed with his emotions and makes us want to observe the character more and really watch his reactions. Michelle Phiffer and Danny De Vito give great performances as Batman's duo adversaries. Although neither performance reaches the extent of Nicholson's "" The Joker"", they still dig into their characters and manage to produce two very good performances that allows the viewer to not only be entertained by Batman's enemies but also be interested in their own story and how the characters evolve throughout the film.Overall, Batman Returns arguably isn't as good as the original but nevertheless still is a very good film and helps reminds us that Batman isn't a colourful and action-packed movie like Spiderman, The Hulk or The X-men, but a far more deeper and dynamic film that stays true to the characters and the story, unlike Batman Forever and Batman and Robin., the following sequels. I personally don't enjoy super-hero movies but with Batman Returns it's different and being a fan of Tim Burton, it's a pleasure to watch his dark and eerie style capture the real essence of Batman in Batman Returns and the snow-filled sets of Batman Returns, I found to be quite amazing and enjoyable to view, vintage Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
My favorite batman film ever!!!!  Luv it in every part,"This Tim Burton film, batman returns is definitely the darkest of the 4. But I love the way they portrayed Catwoman and the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was the PERFECT choice for Catwoman, sexy and mysterious, just the way Catwoman should be. I think that this film is far better than the 1989 Batman. And seriously there is no one better to play the Penguin than Danny Daveito. And the script was very very sharp. I loved every scene in this movie. And Michael Keaton was great as Batman just like in the first film. And I also love the way Burton made Gotham look very slick and cool. Now, many parents were unhappy with this film being darker than the original, and I do understand that, but Really it wasn't all that terribly dark to me. I just think maybe some of those parents were sheltering they're child a little too much. Sooo pleased with this movie. Really, the best one in the 4 filmed franchise.

Stunning and atmospheric,"In many ways ""Batman Returns"" is better movie than Tim Burtons previous ""Batman"". ""Batman"" wasn't, in my opinion, fully in the hands of Tim Burton, thus it didn't look so much of a Burton film. It had typical Burton's elements in it, but it wasn't so freely his own. ""Batman Returns"" is fully his to the core and that shows.Visually BR is still a stunning piece of cinema. Gothical Gotham city is drawn beautifully in the front of our eyes while Batman (Michael Keaton) battles against the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Of all the Batman movies (I still haven't seen Batman beyond) Batman Returns has the best and most fitting cast. It's hard to give out anyone who wouldn't fit in their roles.There is some plot holes but in Burtons case they don't really matter that much; he's good in hiding those small errors in the over all atmosphere of his films.I've heard that from the some reason hardcore fans of Batman don't appreciate Burtons vision, but as a person who likes Batman I really can recommend this stunning vision to everyone, because it has style beyond typical comic book adaptations and it really shows what a talented director can make out of a well known character if just given free hands.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Fantasy"
