"Action Packed and Funny at Times,","Transformers is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a decent cast.It is a bit long but the two and a half hours fly by.I enjoyed the action in the movie,although it did go on a bit too long many times,sometimes so much that you would forget whats happening,but it is very well directed by Michael Bay.I enjoyed Shia LaBeouf a lot in this,but,although she is very attractive,Megan Fox is not a very good actress,I feel like she just says her lines and she probably wouldn't have got in to acting if it wasn't for how good looking she is,I definitely think a better actress like Emma Stone or Amanda Seyfried could have put in a better performance as this character.The best part for me is without a doubt the robots themselves,Optimus Prime,Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons are beautifully animated and the voice work is outstanding.While Transformers has many flaws,its still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all fans of Michael Bay and the Transformers in general.A long fighting race of robots,the Autobots and the Decepticons,head to Earth and one young teenager might be able to fix things.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well worth watching for the visual effects alone!,"When I saw Transformers, I will admit I wasn't expecting much. And you know what I thought it was a good movie. It is far from the best movie ever made, but it is well worth watching for a number of reasons.The best thing about the movie was the visual/special effects. They were absolutely mind-blowing, and the whole movie is worth the look just for them alone. And the robots especially Megatron were convincing enough, and the movements weren't jerky in any way. The sound is absolutely terrific, and the music is great. The storyline is original, fast-paced and gripping on the most part. There is some nice humour thrown into the mix, however the dialogue for me was a little too cheesy in places.The performances are spirited and bring a sense of fun to the proceedings. Shia LeBoeuf brings some charisma and appeal to the title role of Sam, and Megan Fox is hot. John Tuturro has fun in his role, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White are both hilarious as Sam's parents. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and Peter Cullen makes the most of his character Optimus Prime. In fact, the only weak performance came from the talented Jon Voight, he just seemed out of place. And while there are plenty of visual thrills, I wasn't a massive fan of Michael Bay's direction, it just seemed as though the visuals, story and performances were doing the work and Bay was just there making sure it was all going to plan.Overall, it is flawed but Transformers while not the best or worst of its genre is worth the look, especially if you are looking for terrific visuals, great sound and a good story. That way, if you overlook the flaws it does indeed have, you are in for a treat. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Escapism Film-Making At Its Finest,"Sometimes (probably more often than not in this day and age), movies are not meant to be intensely analyzed and picked apart. If one were to do that to ""Transformers"", the review would likely come back a negative one. However, this flick requires its viewers to be one simple thing: sit back and enjoy the ride! If that can be done, ""Transformers"" will thoroughly entertain you.For a basic plot summary, ""Transformers"" focuses on high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). While leading a relatively normal teenage life and trying to get the ""hot girl"" of his dreams Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox), Sam is swept into an invasion of Earth by the evil Decepticons transformer robots. Allying with the U.S. government and the benevolent Autobots, Sam becomes central to the action due to his family lineage.If one could ever classify a film as ""whiz-bang"", this one be the textbook definition of that statement. It has everything most cinema fans want: pulse-pounding action, cool gadgets, romance, and a script that never takes a down moment...the action is always moving forward.What makes ""Transformers"" a truly quality experience, however, is the fact that the plot and characters contain a great deal of heart. The plot isn't Shakespeare, of course, but who can't relate to ""good vs. evil""? LaBeouf is absolutely perfect as Witwicky, while Fox turned herself into a national sex symbol simply by playing ""that hot girl from high school that all the boys lusted over"" & leaning over the engine of a car (!). Again, a set of characters that most individuals can relate to.Overall, ""Transformers"" will sweep you away if you can let it. Instead of nit-picking or analyzing ""the small stuff"", this is one to ""get your popcorn ready"" for!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much more than I expected,"I expected this to be an action movie only, but it also has a lot of hilarious jokes similar to American Pie, such as when the robots were making lots of noise, Sam's parents asked him something embarrassing. There is some action, but there is also drama. At least the action and drama aren't so bad. However, the characters weren't so likable. Megan Fox was just eye candy (yes, she was hot, at least) and Shia LaBeouf was not a likable character.Pros:Really funnyGood actionCons:Characters aren't so likableReview: 8",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid Popcorn entertainment,"No, it is not a smart movie, or a well written one, but this movie certainly has it's goods, and one can hardly deny it is fairly entertaining.The goods were pretty obvious. Stunning visuals, brilliant editing, mind-blowing set pieces, say about mister Bay what you will, he has always had an eye for the visual. And this is an absolute plus to all his work, basically. But we can also state that Bay's previous work, with a few exception, was nonetheless fairly disappointing. Transformers went further than just the visual shebang.The movie had a good sense of humor too. It was clear that everyone knew that one can hardly take a few car robots seriously, and so no one didn't. Which is a good thing. It made the movie one hell of a lot funnier. The actor's were cool too. Shia LaBouf is a great lead role, John Turturro, John Voight, Anthony Anders and others had really cool side roles, and they made the movie worthwhile.The only downs were the ridiculousness that often crawled onto the screen, of course fault to the slightly preposterous script. Usually I cringe with issues like these, but aforementioned points somehow made the movie awfully amusing. A great watch, especially in the cinemas, but maybe somewhat less entertaining to watch on a TV. be warned",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Shock and Awe, and some gripes","This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this, you will be disappointed on some level (as I was). Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.Now that's out of the way, there's a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn't. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo-realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it's transforming on the move, bashing the living daylights out of each other, or just standing and talking, these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.As for everything else, well... that's when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion, this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however, are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters, names are pretty much luxury. Also, most of the human related humor gags miss badly, which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight's Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me, which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast (including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro) are outweighed by the large set of negatives.However, the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam, and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox's acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime, and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous, he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron (His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere). The rest of the transformers don't say much, which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them (The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff).Another major gripe I have is Bay's ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving, it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action (probably the biggest crime committed in the movie).I could go on and on about the good things (Bumblebee, Frenzy) and the bad things (Anthony Anderson and his family, forgotten Barricade) and the downright weird things (Dubya's cameo, Sam's friend climbing in a tree). Overall, the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed, the amount of potential for the sequel (which just got greenlighted) just gets me giddy (is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting?)(Also, the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I've seen in theaters in years.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything I could have asked as huge fan,It's August 9th 2020. I am watching this again for the 100th time. Never thought about reviewing it until now. As a massive fan in the 80s I was obsessed with the Comics (have them all) the toys and the tv cartoon. When I learned this was being made I had zero expectations except the trailers making it look something special. It really did not disappoint. The CGIof the robots is brilliant. The story is something that falls in line with the source material which okay isn't the most amazing of stories however it's a modern twist with elements of subtle comedy a real babe in Megan and a badass Megatron. I know people were upset with the decision to scrap Megatron turning into a gun but how would it have worked? This is by far the best of all the movies made so far. If you are a real fan you'll appreciate the efforts made I know I am.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best summer flick of 2007.,"I watched this film at an advanced screening in New Zealand. I loved Transformers as a child, but was not a die hard fan, so I did not complain over the changes. However, I had decent expectations for this movie as people were saying it's better than expected.I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. However, it did fall a little flat on what I expected it to be. It's Michael Bay, ladies and gents, don't expect anything more.Transformers begins with the reason for the alien robots' existence. How the all important AllSpark (essentially the life giver) was lost into the vacuum of space after the robots divided between good and evil. Falling onto Earth, a handful of these entities travelled the galaxy to find this all important device. Great premise, but how about the execution? Visually, the film is astounding. ILM have outdone themselves once again and have created top notch visuals for others to measure up to. The robots look real, feel weighty yet elegant, and with every Bay movie, there are explosions. And what beautiful explosions they are. This is complemented with a hit-and-miss musical score. At times, the score is cinematic brilliance. At other times, you wonder why Linkin Park was included, when sequences with emotional pieces are suddenly juxtaposed with the current Billboard Hot 100.The acting is competent. I thought that with a cast mostly compromised of underwear models and hip hop artists, I would be disappointed. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky), Josh Duhamel (Cpt. Lennox), Tyrese Gibson (Sgt. Epps), and even Megan Fox (Mikaela) delivered surprisingly well. Even with Jon Voigt in the cast, you cannot see a distinct line in ability between the seasoned vet and relative new comers. But although the acting was top notch, it was severely hampered by the script.The script, to put it frankly, does not take itself seriously. At all. Firstly, there was a lack of story. Autobots and Decepticons want the AllSpark. One wants to defend it. The other wants to use it. Battle. Fin. Secondly, I could not remember one scene that did not have some humorous one liner put in to make the audience laugh. Even in the most grave of sequences, did some joker blurt out something (admittedly) funny, making you wonder ""Wait.... Earth's in danger, and you're cuing for a crash on the drums?!"" Some of the script was clever, and in the parts which were appropriately funny, hit the nail on the head (Shia LaBeouf is a child prodigy in comedy).Transformers. Everyone wants to know ""What about the Transformers?"". Well, personally, they were simply awesome. They could have been more 2D than they were and I still would have liked them. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Jazz, Frenzy, Ratchet... Megatron, Starscream, Bonecrusher, Barricade and Ironhide -- they were masterfully put on film.However, only two of those actually got a decent amount of character development -- Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Bumblebee, being the first Transformer Sam sees, and Optimus, of course gets plenty of screen time being the Autobot leader. It's a shame that the Decepticons were only there to be the ""bad guys"", even Megatron. It would have definitely benefited the movie if all the robots were fleshed out and given some emotional attachment to the crowd. It doesn't, and this does have a few repercussions towards the end of the movie. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to see them wreak havoc in different countries, and with the inevitable sequel, one can only hope that we get to know more about these ""loveable"" mechanical beings.It is definitely the must see summer flick of the year, and whilst not Oscar material, it is one of the best 'popcorn' movies of recent times.7.5/10**Upon a second screening, I found the impact of the movie to remain just the same as the first.

Transformers,"Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged.

What if this movie is just another Independence Day and War of the World. It is unmistakable that aliens taking over the world is an idea that has been worn out but what makes this movie shine is the personality. What its predecessors failed to do was give the alien/robot personality which is very different in Transformers.

Wild/Loud Summer Fun w/Robots,"I was not a Transformers kid when I grew up in the 80's and I think that's why I wasn't so hard on Michael Bay's film when I caught it in the summer of 2007. Going into the film for the first time, the only characters I knew by name were Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee (and I only knew of him through the mention of friends). So, without having the fanboy mentality, I was able to enjoy the movie as it was...and I did. I thought it was a fun action flick and one of the best popcorn movies from the year. Based on the Hasbro toyline and it's resulting animated series/comics, the film follows high-schooler Sam Witwicky who discovers his Camaro is a shape-shifting alien robot; he is soon brought into the middle of a war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, warring factions of a race of sentient robots.Let's be honest. The only things that matter about this movie are the special effects and the action sequences. ILM did a fantastic job with the Transformers in this film. The robots look amazing and their transformations are seamless. I've heard that some classic fans aren't satisfied with their designs but I felt they did a good job adding what realism they could to giant fighting robots. The action sequences aren't as abundant as one would expect, but I'm not complaining. I felt there were enough action scenes without going overboard and drowning out story. The battles feel epic and they aren't heavily edited into quick jump cuts so you can still understand what is going on.The cast does an adequate job and keep the movie from feeling B-grade. Shia LaBeouf was charismatic and had a good sense of comedic timing; John Turturro was a fun addition as the mental Sector 7 agent Simmons. Jon Voight seemed almost out of place in the film, though added a bit of class. I know there have been a lot of complaints about human characters in the movie, but it's a necessary element and I'm not complaining. The supporting cast did a great job; my favorites had to be Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's eccentric parents. I felt the movie shouldn't have gone over 2 hours as it does begin to strain on the patience after a while but it still made for a fun ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch this if you know what you are in for,"For those of you who are not fans of Michael Bay: for starters, do not watch this movie. It's really as simple as that. But, I've read some of the negative comments on this film, and it baffles me to read that all this film consists of is hot girls, hot action, and not the greatest acting. Come on, guys. This is a Michael Bay film, and let me emphasize the words MICHAEL BAY. When I think about him, I think about entertainment, and entertainment only, because that is what his films are about. With films like this, I don't go in expecting some great story, with amazing dialogue. This movie is not academy award worthy, nor should it be. This is an action film, that's what it's meant to be, and when it comes to action films, Bay knows how to deliver. Again, the storyline could be better, and Megan Fox could use some acting lessons, but like I said, when you watch these movies, you should watch them for entertainment. So, if you know what this film delivers, and you don't like Michael Bay, then by all means, skip this movie. But, if you do end up watching this movie, and say that it's nothing but a bunch of clanging metal and hot girls, well then, welcome to the world of Michael Bay. I saw it in theatres back in 2007, I went with an open mind, and I enjoyed it. 9/10 for me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The first and the only best!,"Transformers (2007) is the only best one science fiction action film of the last three movies that I enjoy. Okay it is not the greatest or the best science fiction film but it is still a good one. It's the only, only movie I watch several times. Transformers 2 I watch three times in a row so far and that movie made me exhausted, Transformers 3 I watch it twice. Once on the computer and once on the DVD I rent it in the Library. I have the third movie on DVD till today I haven't watch that DVD and I think I give 13£ for it.I have enjoyed this movie much better than the last three. In Transformers I loved the car chases with Sam, how the story began, than the war and the chase for the glasses All Spark. I love it. I love actor Jon Voight. Now I know why he did not return in the sequels. The movie was really awesome and I can't say anything bad about it. It had a great plot great action and great excitement.This movie is great out of the four, which I think Age of Extinction is the worst one so far, over too long. Shia does an amazing job, the soundtrack is awesome and the special effects/sounds are ""out of this world."" I REALLY Love Transformers! A big fan of the original cartoon I grew up with the cartoon's as a kid. Could it only disappoint? Especially after all those less than OK ""second generations"" of the Transformers tale, and seeing that everyone's favorite Bumblebee character was no longer a VW bug, but a Camaro? Well, it was fantastic! It was great to see some of the characters adapt and come to life in this version, and the movie provides great action, really good humor and plenty of realistic effects for anyone, not just fans of the old collectibles. But it can only be even more exciting for fans when they are finally re-introduced to Megatron, Optimus, Jazz and more. The film does a great job of creating the feeling of helplessness for humans, which would only make sense against technology like the Transformers. I couldn't help buy find my hands continuously gripping the arm rests tighter, and that was during my second watch! Minus a few cheesy scenarios or brief moments that seem to creep into many an action movie.The Music score by Steve Jablonsky was awesome, I love all the music soundtracks in the film. Transformers is Michael Bay's first attempt of making of a Transformer movie and it succeeds. I saw this film and I was blown away, not only by the story, but how good the CGI of those robots were, these robots were looking like they were walking downtown In Los Angeles, they didn't look like CGI at all. They looked like realistic robots and that was great okay. For a movie that was under $2,000,000 that is right this film cost $150.000.000 and the robots looks that sweet, it was just great okay. The best thing about this film is not Michael bay heavy, you know what that means? It means there is no stupid and I mean stupid dialogues spoken trough the whole movie, the dialogues that was spoke trough whole this movie smart and somewhat funny in most parts funny mainly, it wasn't too over the top were feels like is not funny, that is stupid. Action in this movie is good, the movie is well paced at 2 Hrs. 24 Mins. is not the longest one that was the fourth one. Made was by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures, they a lot and I mean a lot of Disney channel stars in in this film you got a Arwin (Brian Stepanek) from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and that fat blonde boy that was talking about Armageddon. I think that was a joke that Michael Bay put on him self, this is hundred times better than Armageddon, and I was you mean Aramgeddon the film or the joke, because that was good poke, because Armageddon was awful, that was great I like that part.The mythology that was made for director Michael Bay. This is the beginning of the trilogy that tells the story of the long, galactic feud between the Autobots and their nemesis, the Decepticons. As a child of the '80's, how could you not love Transformers? I love it. I love the science action mythology flick of the first film, which did great.The interstellar battle between the Autobots and Decepticons rains destruction down on planet Earth as director Michael Bay adapts Hasbro and Takara's popular Transformers franchise into a big-budget, live-action summer tent-pole extravaganza in this ambitious sci-fi action feature starring Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Bernie Mac, John Turturro, Jon Voight, and, of course, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Enormous aliens have chosen the third rock from the sun as their ultimate battleground, and as the villainous Decepticons struggle to obtain the key to unlimited power, a young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) may stand as mankind's last hope for survival.I am giving it a 10/10 It is not the greatest movie or the best one but it is a good entertaining film.Transformers is a 2007 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line.

My childhood up on screen....sort of,"For me just hearing the words ""Autobot"" and ""Decepticon"" brings back so many childhood memories. I was a massive fan of the G1 cartoons (never watched any of the spin-offs) and the Marvel comic books from the UK and US. The cartoon appealed to me as a child, while the comics took the mythos deeper in my teenage years with cosmic battles between Gods, a yin/ yang conversation regarding why certain Transformers are inherently good or evil. It was cracking stuff and it was with a lot of excitement that I greeted news of a new big budget movie.Transformers (2007) delivered! OK, so they fiddled with the origin story a little bit, but so do most of the different versions of the show. I thought they got the major characters spot on. Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and Starscream were all the same characters as in the TV show and comics. I really liked the fact that Bumblebee could only communicate through radio signals, and, after the execrable scene introducing the minor autobot characters and Optimus Prime's various sermons, really wish that had been the case for all of the autobots. The decepticons are far more interesting, though we see nowhere near enough of Starscream. Megatron and Soundwave are both effective and the best realised characterisations in the film.The humans in the story all do a good job. Shia Lebeouf had not yet been over exposed, and is actually quite entertaining as Spike. Megan Fox was a smoking hot brunette bombshell, still playing a stereotype (hot girl with a blokey hobby who deep down just wants to fit in), but at least not a damsel in distress as we typically see in these films. Spike's parents are awkward, but funny. John Turtorro's character seems to have accidentally stumbled into this film during a coffee break from a Coen brothers film. He seems like he has something much more interesting to do in an edgier film than this one. But his presence, while out of place, is welcome.My big complaint with this is that the the film, after doing a nice job of setting up for a finale, seems to go in light speed in its last twenty minutes. It's often difficult to tell who's fighting who. There's also a death scene that we are supposed to feel sad about, involving a character who's been in a handful of scenes, and had a maximum of two lines of clichéd stereotyped dialogue. The resolution is neat and sets up well for a sequel. Overall, this was a reasonably faithful big screen portrayal of the characters I loved growing up, if not the story. The arrival sequence, and Armageddon-ish soundtrack are both breathtaking and really hammer home a sense of awe and wonder as the Autobots arrive. The awkward attempts by Prime to communicate with humanity are funny. The human characters, apart from Turtorro (who acts like no human I've ever met) all seem to react to the Transformers and their war in the way a normal human being would react. It is a very different back story and beloved elements like the Autobot and decepticons Volcano and underwater bases are lost. But what's left is a the characters we love fighting out the same war, in a way a new generation will find accessible, and didn't alienate me, well not in this original version anyway. I am more than happy to share Optimus, Megatron and Bumblebee with a new generation of fans.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"For a ""kid"" movie, it's pretty solid","You might feel a bit hesitant to watch a movie about cars and household appliances transforming into robots to save the planet-over and over again-but honestly, I found it pretty engaging. It's true that many scenes could have been trimmed or left out, reducing the 2-hour runtime; however, this would likely have sacrificed some of the humor that actor Shia was also able to bring into the role.I get the sense that even the filmmakers didn't expect the movie to be as successful as it was, as the ending didn't exactly set things up for a second or third movie. Despite this, they managed to maintain a solid storyline across the sequels, even tying in historical events to explain certain plot points (from the second film onward), so I have no complaints.

A combo of amazing action and over the top comedy,"It's not a faithful adaptation, that transformers deserves, but now that we have a real Transformers movie, I can appreciate michael bay's first attempt for what it is. ""Transformers"" gives what you'd expect and it delivers it great, with incredible effects and breathtaking action, but then there's the human stuff, I find it kinda hilarious. A lot of the humans are annoying and others are boring but it's their over the top acting and dumb decision making that keep me entertained. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky he is a good enough teen though his motivation for most of the film is Megan Fox. ""Transformers"" is worth watching just for the Transformers themselves with their ground breaking Transformation animation consisting of hundreds of moving parts and the action is just awesome and it's all it needed to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's Entertainment. It's Michael Bay,"Stop acting like you're honestly going to expect something more serious than an action movie and a lot of great special effects. It's Michael Bay, he's amazing at making Blockbuster popcorn kind of movies. Honestly, this is his transformers masterpiece. First transformers, amazing. He brought it to life. I mean, Bay is awesome at bringing modern action films to life. But he took all his elements both in military action films and science fiction and brought them both together and made this movie, and perfected the Transformer's movies to a end. Sucks he went on, but this film captivated all the elements of Transformer's purpose. Bay did an amazing job of balancing humor, action, suspense and most of all a summer blockbuster ever time he brought a Transformer's movie to the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still the best of the series,"This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and ""shaky cam."" Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"I remember this being so unique and cool when it first came out, and it still gives off the same vibes today. The action and CGI are amazing, the acting is well done, the actors and robots are well cast. It's a Micheal Bay movie, so of course it's just a bit too long.

"Optimus Prime says ""eBay"" in this masterpiece","It's far from a subtle work, and its action definitely takes place of a decent screenplay- but somehow Transformers is just enjoyable and entertaining enough to make for quite a fun ride. First off, needless to say really, the CGI is amazing. Not only does it continue to age rather well, but was certainly very ahead of its time. The acting isn't anything great but Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, and Megan Fox do prove to be charming leads at times- and are very entertaining to watch- despite their horribly written dialogue at times. The action scenes can feel a bit too drawn out at times, but when it works, it works very well, and it's certainly impressive to see these iconic characters at this scale. Its pacing is decent, its soundtrack is rather fitting. Its cinematography is a bit wonky at times, mainly towards the end, but only puts a small inconvenience on the film in total. In the end, Transformers is a mildly enjoyable action flick that certainly doesn't have as much brains as other films today and of the time- but charms just enough to memorable and at times a rather heartfelt and genuine tribute to the toys and cartoon a whole generation grew up on.My Rating: 6.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best action film in a while!,"Hats off to Michael Bay, who went beyond anything - or any visuals - we've seen before to bring us this action fantasy spectacle. Almost every scene is masterfully done. The film is visually stunning and the action scenes are INCREDIBLE! The film combines so many elements of danger and suspense, and its also actually really funny during the lighthearted moments. It blends perfectly.Shia LaBeouf is very good in this film. The score by Steve Jablonsky is also really good and very effective. For a film with a running time of 144 minutes there literally never was a dull moment, as it kept the viewer engaged and captivated all the time. There honestly hasn't been an exciting action film like this is a while - certainly not on this level! Bloody hell, it was awesome! This was an absolute delight and feast to watch.

Spatial Flitting,"For once, what I see in a film is what most others do. So unlike most comments I write, this one will be ""mainstream.""The way this is put together is based on fractional narrative. Its the notion that if you leave big holes in the story, things are stronger than if you seek to explain and fully reveal everything. Its a solid technique, often used in the story itself. Its used that way here, almost automatically as the cosmology invented here was devised for what, 8 year old toy consumers. But its extended. One extension may be an accident: characters appear and disappear at random with none of the completion or agency that we expect. I believe that's because Bay is a nitwit in this department and the guys in the front office thought it wouldn't matter. Also, its likely that Bay shot a 6 hour movie that makes some sense storywise and then he took out all the parts that got in the way of the ""value.""But there's another ""incomplete narrative"" element that I think was by design. The camera sees and understands very little of what is going on in the battles. The camera is looking in the wrong directions, is too close, shifts in panic and jumps from view to view (when close in) as if it didn't actually know what was to happen next. So you don't actually ""see"" a full transformation, or a battle event. Often you can't tell who are the good and bad robots. Often you cannot tell actually who's up and who's down as you could, say in your classical fight, all of which it seems come from that 1938 ""Robin Hood"" sword fight at the end.This cinematic technique is not new or novel. Its the first resort of filmmakers whose CGI aspirations outstrip the budget. But this is a whole new reason: that business of what you don't actually see is always grander than what you do.Combined with this is a second phenomenon, and here it fits perfectly. Its the use of the dimensional camera. In this case, sometimes the camera is as a human would act. Sometimes it is disembodied, but there's a very strict vocabulary here too, determined by the restrictions of cranes and helicopters. What we have now is something new, the camera that flits, that moves in all three dimensions. We saw it first on 100% animated cartoons. I think ""Treasure Planet"" was made just to test this. Pixar created a whole philosophy and took over Disney based on it.Then we saw it in CGI-heavy films. It was thrilling in ""Van Helsing,"" and there a new convention was tried: show something on screen that has similar behavior to the eye we will shift into. In Van Helsing's case, it was the three flying harpies, in particular (of course) the redheaded one. She flits with precisely the same gestures as the camera.Then we saw it full bore in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and ""Kong Kong."" In the former it was architectural, and the latter fully integrated into the action. WETA led the way on this. There's a new technology that makes this within reach of even dopes like Bay. Its called preanimation, and what it does is completely model the scene before any work starts so that the camera has absolute freedom and isn't static as storyboards would have it. Then the virtual worlds and real shots are just busy work, all the creativity is in the design at this stage.You can see precisely which sequences were done by the preamination ""director,"" and which by Bay. The new ""law"" is followed in the sense that we have an on-screen avatar as exemplar of the flitting eye movements. Its a hypercaffeinated skeletal robot. It helps us understand how the eye moves and why it sees incompletely.Oh, and its not an offhand thing that the central goal of the plot is a search for ""spectacles.""So when you see this, and you wonder about whether we are worth saving as a people (which is the reason for the story), and you seriously do teeter on indecision, consider this: we are evolving very quickly in the way we see, the way we model things visually and the way introspective representations are internalized. For that alone, we deserve a chance at survival.Until next summer.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The beginning of Bayformers, a unique friendship between a teenager and an alien robot. Excellent transfer to cinema!","Fantasy/action/invasion film. Transformers: The Beginning. The launch of Michael Bay's biggest franchise, which even mentions in the film that it is many times better than another of his works, Armageddon. Excellent directing, performances and plot, but also very good work in effects. An invasion film, with plenty of action, romance, but also a special friendship between the new protagonist and an alien robot - transformer. The story of the transformers into a special realization that if one removed the immature elements of Bay would be truly top notch and much more serious film. However, as a whole it is an excellent transfer of transformers on the big screen, and it is clear that it mainly targets young ages, but not young children. More young and teenagers, but of course also nostalgic of those times with the transformers and of course the entire film audience of the genre of action/invasion.

Now I know why this film gets the highest score among Transformers franchises.,"I rewatched this film and even though I'm familiar with the ending,it still gives a refreshing and satisfying experience. Shia protrayed the protagonist very well,a little quirky, clumsy at first meet,but turn out to be loyal, decisive and very protective for his car. His performance was quite natural and smooth that it became a retreat after I watched the newest protagonist's numb acting. And another highlight of this film is the very capable,calm and well-organised Squat team,how amazing when they fight bravely and brilliantly when they first encountered the abnormal enemy. The trust and dedication they have can be seen through those gripping, fast-pacing fighting scenes. And most of all,the Transformers,they are just powerful and reliable. The relationship between them and human is just simple,they took the responsibility to protect and take care of human,and in turn,human gave their help after misunderstandings.

"Great visual and sound effects, lots of humour and a lot of flaws.","Transformers is a very mixed bag. There are great things about it and there are some not-so-great things about it...The good:The visual effects. Perhaps the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. The transformations are amazing not to mention super-awesome. The CGI fits in seamlessly with the live action and it's easy to forget how logistically difficult a lot of it would have been to film.The sound design. The sound effects complement the action perfectly making everything twice as exciting. Probably less acknowledged is the alien atmosphere created by some of the score which heightens the tension very effectively and probably without the majority of the audience noticing.Shia LeBeouf. Without him the movie wouldn't be nearly as engaging. He has natural comic timing and is probably second to none in expressing disbelief of the ""holy crap, there's a giant alien robot transforming in front of me"" variety.The humour. Transformers is funnier than most good comedies which I was not expecting in the least. The transformers themselves are often funnier than they are impressive.The Decepticons. Man are they cool. The opening scene is particularly kick-arse.The bad:Megan Fox. If hot means ""can't act and doesn't weigh much"" then yes, she's very hot. It's not a good sign if you want one of the main characters to die or at least get out of the way and stop trying to act. Her performance just seemed very shallow and probably wasn't helped by her dialogue.The script. Although the overall storyline is good, some of the dialogue is terrible. Too much of the film is spent on mumbo jumbo technical explanations the audience just doesn't care about. The less serious parts of the script work very well though.Michael Bay. Although some of the action scenes are very well put together and the humorous parts are timed very well, Bay can't help but ruin some of the scenes with unnecessarily flashy editing and over the top drama accompanied by none-too-subtle dramatic music. It's not that Michael Bay's style is too loud, it's that it's too clichéd.The music. Nothing new here (other than the alien sounding parts). Practically rips of Batman Begins and is otherwise forgettable. The music should enhance the film by bringing out interesting themes or emotions, not force feeding us the drama we can plainly see on the screen in super slow motion.The ugly:Megatron. He's ugly. And super cool.So, my verdict? The good outweighs the bad pretty comfortably. If you took out the bad you might even have a classic on your hands. Instead you get revolutionary action scenes and some great comedy with Michael Bay's unique brand of mediocre directing sprinkled throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, but weighed down by a sloppy script and humans","We all knew the Transformers would be well made, well crafted creatures due to the utter genius that is Industrial Light and Maghic. But its too bad the human element was what bogged this movie down.Sure, we'll watch the movie, but there was just too much exposition and for us impatient, Ritalin-riddled miscreants of the world, it was excruciating. First of all, the script was pretty lousy. Now I know the guy who wrote this film supposedly wrote X-Men, but lets face it, that was a good seven years ago. There were plenty of things that could have been chopped out of this film. Now I understand the producers wanted to get a little titillation with Raechel Taylor and Megan Fox, but they were both dead weights to the movie and the movement. Without those two, we could get rid of Anthony Anderson, another waste of words, and maybe even expand Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson's roles. Either way, the female element in the film was completely useless. Let's face it, guys watched this cartoon growing up, and we want action, violence and lots of transforming. Who fricking cares if Shia LeBouf's character gets some action. Its completely irrelevant. It would have also been nice to see some conflict between Megatron and Starscream.The only other thing I didn't like was the awful soundtrack. The strings portion of the film was pretty substandard, borrowing the most generic themes one could possibly imagine. Then there is the random songs and generic heavy metal they try to slip in. It was like the people who mixed the film took a lesson from the dopes that mixed Daredevil, which had an equally awful mixture of CD sales-friendly mixing.But I digress. For those that had doubts about the transforming, it was put to rest rather quickly. Dazzling to say the least, it was as realistic as one could have hoped for, making the transformations rather cool. ILM must have put their best and brightest on this movie, because it certainly shows. This brilliance alone made up for the bad exposition and substandard characters.I gave this film a ""7"" simply because it was entertaining, but they are gonna have to tighten up the screws for future sequels. People won't put up with unnecessary characters and bad music for very long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A bombastic to the franchise,"Transformers brings the titular robots in disguise to the big screen in a bombastic live action debut that's got groundbreaking visual effects and is committed to charting its own path rather than adapting any previous incarnation specifically. It's got Spielbergian wonder mixed with Michael Bay's maximalist and ridiculously patriotic sensibilities for an epic blockbuster that's silly, sincere and all the better for it.Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky may not be the most relatable protagonist to see this world through but he certainly matches the crazed energy of everything around him thanks to his manic presence and he can thankfully tone it down when needed. Megan Fox probably should've been the lead due to her agency in the narrative and her character's more personal connection to her love of cars; however, she's still great when supporting.Keeping Peter Cullen in the role of Optimus Prime is obviously a perfect choice because his voice defines the character and no one has the same level of gravitas. This performance also represents the only time in the Bay films where he gets to bring his optimism and unwavering hopefulness before he becomes a psychopath. Hugo Weaving's voicework combines nicely with a much more viscous design of Megatron to make this rendition work.Michael Bay's direction is superb. There's not a single scene that isn't dynamic in its construction. It is astonishing how well the practical elements are blended with the CGI so Bay can deliver his usual crunchy carnage as well as thrillingly acrobatic robot fights. Whenever the Transformers are just talking to each they are framed perfectly, never losing the overall sense of scale which is insanely impressive for fully CG characters on the first go round.The CGI on display here is some of the best that's ever been put to screen. Every Transformer is a technical marvel of many moving parts to look as real as humanly possible whilst still remaining the unrivalled benchmark for this franchise's live action entries. Steve Jablonsky's score is the finest one he's ever created. It transforms into whatever's needed of it without losing the unashamedly earnest nature that makes it endlessly euphoric.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"After twenty years - Transformer's still ""Got the Touch""","I had gone to see Michael Bay's treatment of Transformers with two things in mind. The first was to expect a no-holds-barred action adventure with Bayish cliché's galore and the second was some respect for its source material (namely hardly any plot or decent acting, just big ass robots kicking ten tin cans or crap out of one another). Now, I have not been disappointed. This film gave me everything I expected from a Transformers film directed by said-Bay. Running at nearly 2½ hours Transformers delivers its content fast, hard, loud and hilariously in places.The return of original Optimus Prime voice actor, Peter Cullen, is a welcome sound to the nostalgic ears and to see the old Gen1 Transformers dukeing it out in spectacular CGI and live action is brilliant.My only little problems with the film were Megan Fox's character, who I could not care less for (just a nice piece of eye candy for us fella's). Other concerns were with its running time with hardly any development in Transformer character was rather irritating and the typical token black guy who has to talk crap all the time is getting a little tiresome with films now-a-days.I suppose my hopes for the next Transformers film would be to get a new director (Bay's first films are good but sequels don't always agree with this man), more Transformers and more of their characteristics  particularly Starscream's desire for power over the Decepticons  and less about the humans, they're developed enough thankyou.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Typical Michael Bay,"Gotta hand it to Michael Bay, he really knows how to deliver in typical ""Bay"" fashion. Left the screening here in Bangkok a half hour ago and I feel exactly the same way I did after watching The Island, The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor for the first time -- fulfilled but empty. Bad Boys actually had good character development compared to his later big budget flicks.Anthony Anderson was totally useless here, still wondering why Bay brought him on. Voight started off well but then began to remind me of his Manchurian Candidate character, and soon after that seemed to slip into his Bill Biscane ala Baby Geniuses 2 shtick. Maybe it was just me, Voight's character became irrelevant halfway through this two-hour plus CGI fest. I was actually surprised by Megan Fox, she did a very passable job while LaBeouf was good as usual, nothing great here though. And the usually brilliant John Turturro was a bad choice to play the deadpan secret agent, it was hard to take him seriously in this role. The character was obviously a caricature but Turturro played it up too much, methinks.If you like Bay, you won't be disappointed. Over the top action, good looking girls, unbelievable CGI, even a younger Michael Biehn, played by Josh Duhamel. I know the original series well and I didn't care so much that Bumblebee wasn't a Bug, but the GM product placements were too obvious and overdone. And finally let me say that the storyline left much to be desired. How many times do we have to sit through the long-lost-whatchamacallit- has-been-located- whoever-finds-it-first- rules-the-world plot??? Puh-leeze. It was like another Jon Voight masterpiece, National Treasure, except even less believable.Overall thought, a must see for CGI, robot and Bay fans alike.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""You shoot, I'll drive!""","And drive he does as Michael Bay translates the Transformers world of animation and toys to the big screen.But before I get ahead of myself I have to admit I never watched even a single episode growing up.

Extremely high level of robot detail + shaky camera work = what the heck was that?,"I went into 'Transformers' expecting something that would be good on many levels. I was expecting a well-paced movie with a good story, a good plot, good character development, and of course good special effects. Alas, the only thing this movie really really accomplishes well are special effects. And let me tell you, these effects are totally completely mind-blowingly amazing. To put it bluntly it takes it to a whole other level. This movie sets a benchmark. It will win academy awards for breaking all kinds of special effects barriers.But this unfortunately is the film's one and only ace. I went into this movie expecting an all around good movie. I don't know why I had such high expectations though. One look at who was directing it should have made me know better. Michael Bay. What do you expect? The man doesn't know how to make anything other than big, explosive, shiny, dumb movies that usually do really well at the box office. People like his kind of movies, I guess. But to me, it just seems that they are all rather poorly planned. 'Transformers' isn't well balanced at all. Granted, its a movie about robots, and thats clearly where most of the effort was put. But like others have said, if just a little bit was taken away from the extremely hard-to-follow action scenes and put into a better story with a more intelligent script with more attention to suspense and drama this movie would be much better.Its high point is the incredible special effects, but even the effects are hampered by extremely shaky camera work, unnecessary zooming, panning, rotating, and twisting to make the shot look more ""interesting"" (I suppose). There were times during some of the massive (and I mean MASSIVE) battle scenes were you literally didn't know what the hell was going on. Some battles were really well done - and ironically those were the one's you could actually follow! But most were very shaky, poorly shot, and too close-up to really take in everything that was happening. The robots were of such a high level of detail (which is normally a really good thing) its incredibly hard to see what's what as they swing their arms and legs and jump and fly and run all over each other at a very rapid pace. Was that Megatron or Starscream attacking Optimus Prime? You don't know because everything is moving so fast, the detail level on the robots is so ridiculously fine its hard to really differentiate between them, and the camera is shaking so much. Bumblebee was easy to point out in the battle scenes because he is yellow. So just look for the yellow blurs and flashes and you know you're looking at Bumblebee. The weird part about all of this is that the special effects crew no doubt did an awesome job in animating and detailing the robots. They all look so real and finely detailed -- thats when the camera is steady enough to actually see what they are. But once the fighting begins, its Headache City trying to follow the action. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this. Maybe the kiddies can follow whats going on.Overall, I rate this movie a 6/10. The special effects are totally awesome and I suppose that was the major aim of the movie, which it accomplishes with flying colors. But many scenes were unfortunately degraded by bad camera work. Better directing could have made many of the scenes more suspenseful. And the comedy brings an unwelcome light-hearted feeling that doesn't compliment the huge, violent, and spectacular action pieces.BTW, I don't understand why some people are calling this militaristic propaganda"". I suspect these people are the kind that label everything as ""propaganda"" in knee-jerk fashion, as in ""its all a pro-American military fascist brainwash"" or some BS. Just go home and shut up. This is basically a war movie that takes place in the U.S.A. So, yes, the military will tend to play a large role in war movies -- morons. Get over it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A CGI mess,"The character development in the film is weak, especially with the Decepticons, who are significantly underdeveloped. The side characters receive more attention than the Transformers themselves. The film is overloaded with characters and subplots, including military personnel, an air force team, analysts, Sector 7, annoying parents, and even a dog.The main characters' performances are flat, and the romantic scenes lack impact. Steve's music is heavily influenced by his mentor Hans Zimmer, with some parts closely resembling the Batman Begins theme. The action scenes are frustrating due to poor cutting methods, excessive zooming, and shaky cam. The colors are oversaturated, and the image resolution in some sequences is low, making it difficult to distinguish between Transformer characters during action scenes.

Great film!

With a great storyline mixing action with a slight hint of comedy this film lends itself to both adults and children.

Absolutely worthy addition to the Transformers universe,"I don't think I could hate this film if I tried. I'm not trying, but if I was, I don't think I could do it.It has all the elements of the Transformers' glory days, with the juggernaut of Big Hollywood providing the driving engine. I really like its ability to be true to the original and yet be something new at the same time.The nitpicks I have are significant, but a far cry from a dealbreaker. The big one is, about an hour in I leaned in and said to my friend, ""Alright, get to the damn point already!"" It drags too long before getting to the action. Bay should be slapped for some of the soundtrack choices, like when Bumblebee is scanning the newer model Camaro, the song popularized in Kill Bill plays for a second. It was tacky in the Vonage commercials; it's tacky here. The initial chase scene between Bumblebee and Barricade, as well as the hacker subplot, as well as numerous other prime opportunities to have some serious on screen fun, go almost nowhere. The Decepticons' personalities are mostly absent–originally there was much more dimension to them, making the dynamic between the Autobots and the Decepticons as a whole significantly more layered. The competitive relationship between Starscream and Megatron is completely glazed over. Prime's closing stinger line. Ugh. Also, it's plausible that the depiction of FBI raid on the hacker kid's house is at least somewhat racist–moreover, though, fewer ridiculous/absurd caricatures in general probably wouldn't have hurt the film (the sector 7 personnel are played to a ridiculous degree.)But its good qualities far outweigh the nitpicks. Solid plot. Original voice actor playing Prime. Great 'bot design. All original G1 'bots–just with a fancier look (I don't fault them for that, personally). John Turturro. Prime's (and by extension, all Autobots') uncompromising honor and selflessness–something not quite so fashionable in fictional (anti)heros nowadays. The inclusion of beautiful women without flagrantly objectifying them (a bit, yes, but relatively tame by today's standards.) Excellent character development on Sam Witwicky's character–well played, multidimensional, not too subtle and not too overt in any department.And then there is, the only good quality the Transformers ever need: awesome robot death match action. Of which there is no shortage.Easily the most admirable thing about Bay's take on Transformers, however, is that it's garnering a new generation of fans. You can see that plainly if you see it in any suburban afternoon showing and listened to the 8-12 year old ""Ooh!s"" and ""Ahh!s"". It was, in short, really cool to see a new generation of youngsters coming into the same experience I held so dear as a child.

Autobots! Rollout!,"Transformers wastes no time getting right to the incredible robot action we're all hungering for, and rushes directly from the credits to eye-popping, rampant robot destruction. What really holds the film together though is that even when it's knee deep in save the world, all out, brawling in the streets, giant freaking robot war, at the core of everything is the simple story of a boy and his first car. For a man, there are few things more powerful than the relationship he has with his first automobile, and it's no different for Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf).Transformers is a truly great summer movie. As an action movie it's a huge success; with awe-inspiring effects, tremendous set pieces and jaw-dropping things which you have absolutely never seen before in any other movie. Transformers brings out your inner child from when you first watched the old fashioned animated series on t.v. screen, but only this time it's on the main screen in a movie theatre. This movie is truly fantastic and different from any other movies that I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent action film,"Decent film but not enough of the villain for me unfortunately. I did enjoy it though and would definitely watch again. Most of the CGI was good for 2007 and it got me wanting to watch the rest of the franchise.

Brain - roll out! Fun - roll in!,"After a series of disappointments this summer (Spidey 3, Pirates 3, FF2) I was not massively optimistic about this one, especially given the involvement of Michael Bay, despite the decent advance press I'd seen. Well, how wrong was I? This movie absolutely nails it, Bay does a terrific job, Shia LaBeouf is superb, the script is (deliberately) hilarious and the robotsahh, the robots! They're uniformly magnificent, setting a new high-water mark for CGI, and adding everything that they should to this thrill-ride. Speaking as a Transformers G1 toy geek (I can freely quote the mottos from the little stats card that was on the boxes  and Megatron was my favourite) I am totally at ease with the design and vehicle changes that have been made  movies are not toys and it isn't the 80s. Everyone should go see this film to make sure that they do the decent thing and start prepping the sequel immediately!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Spielberg's on board, be it ever so minimal! But it shows!!!","Transformers is a film by Michael Bay, the same man behind such action spectacles as Armageddon, Pearl Harbour and The Rock, which is normally the kind of film I steer clear of. However, I decided to view this upon learning that this time out Bay had traded his producer of those three films, Jerry Bruckheimer, for the more acclaimed Steven Spielberg (arguably the auteur of the Hollywood Blockbuster) and it's probably a good thing that he did, because Transformers delivers.Unfortunately I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon series, so I cannot comment on the films accuracy, but then if the film is meant to be an adaptation - how many adaptations are entirely accurate? I have read some critical reviews of this film and the majority seem to be disgusted at the representation of the Transformers - mainly due to their alteration from the original cartoon. I feel that the film doesn't aim to be a direct replication of a cartoon series, but that it aims to be a blockbuster in homage of a cartoon series and I believe this to be something it does very well. When Hollywood makes these films I am almost sure they have a checklist or a personal routine that the maker (usually the Producer) abides by. Constructing a blockbuster is an intricate process and when Spielberg is involved it is often perfected, Transformers contains many of the elements that are familiar with Spielberg's blockbusters and fantasy's including good old fashioned fighting, aliens, a geek, a computer nerd, a hot chick, a funny fat guy, fast cars, gadgets, an old explorer, secret military layers, secret government divisions, the President, Air Force One, explosions, goodies, baddies, a crack code, a hidden map, polished CGI and many more.In an academic and purely filmic sense, the film is floored on nearly all levels, the acting is poor, the script is bad and there needs to be a lot more work done in post-production, but to attack a film like this would be like a Michelin Star rep attacking McDonald's cuisine  it would be mean and unfair. Films like this serve a purpose, and it is the achievement of that purpose that is carried out very well in Transformers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""I bought a car.  It turned out to be an alien robot.  Who knew?""","At the release of this film, 21 years have passed since the animated film came out. In all that time, we've seen two decades worth of cheesy action films, spirited adventures, imaginative sci-fi, and immense special-effects development. And with director Michael Bay fine-tuning his larger-than-life work style and sense of grandeur, it seems that cinematic fate has cumulated in the creation of this epic film. For fans of the classic cartoons or modern action junkies, the film delivers all the way; the action starts off strong and intense, and hardly lets up. Some scenes are quite awe-inspiring; the opening base attack, the highway chase, the city battle are among the best action scenes in any film. The scope and scale is impressive. The pacing is relentlessly fast. The humor is genuinely amusing and helps keep things light and fresh. It's every bit as big, original, and entertaining as some of the best blockbusters out there, and I think one would be hard-pressed to be bored by it.The story for this could probably be picked apart easily by the most critical viewers (it's especially odd seeing a number of scenes turning from day to night in a matter of seconds). But if you're able and willing to forgive the film for its faults, it is a decently-structured plot with a fine cast of characters. It's pretty fun watching the film kick off with the relationship between a boy and his car; but heck, intergalactic robot war is pretty fun too.The film has awesome photography; there must be thousands of gorgeous postcard-worthy shots throughout. Some scenes are a little shaky and editing is pretty darn fast; it might be a major turn-off for some folks, and I do believe it does make the actual transformers harder to see. But it is still mostly coherent, and helps keep the pacing up. Acting iswhat it is. Shia LaBeouf borders on being annoying, but for his character it's fitting. Megan Fox is a little iffy in this role, but she is a looker. I enjoy Josh Duhamel in his role; Tyrese Gibson and Zack Ward are pretty fun in their parts. I didn't like John Turturro at first, but he grew on me. And of course, the voice-acting (including the talents of Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving) is great. Production value is insanely high, featuring top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects; it's also noteworthy for implementing a huge amount of authentic military hardware and real soldiers in action. Music is pretty darn cool too.Recommended! 4.5/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ultimate visual entertainment,"Okay, as those who have seen the trailers will figure, the CG is pretty much the cornerstone of this movie. While it probably will blow you away, the novelty eventually wears off and then you wonder: hey, where did the plot go?! But then your attention is quickly drawn back by a giant robot slamming into an office block - or a wonderfully shot car chase; probably some of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace the silver screen.A hefty dose of cheese seems to have been added to the movie, but most of it can be laughed off. One particular scene was reminiscent of the fighter jet in the movie Stealth downloading songs off the internet. A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that! It has its laughs (even if some are cheap) but the 2.5 hours go fast; I'm sure most people will leave the cinema on a high note. Hopefully this movie gets Bay the credit The Island didn't.And a postscript for hardcore Transformers geeks: go with your expectations at your ankles because you're probably going to cringe when something isn't as it should be (although even a minor fan like myself noticed a lack of original transformation noises). But on the whole this movie has plenty more to offer, and appeals to many more people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Flawed, Yet Still Very Fun","This movie is by no means a challenging one. But I honestly can't see what people expected from a movie about alien robots that change into cars.THE GOOD: The Special effects were awesome. Going into the movie I was prepared for cheesy looking robots. I didn't really think something like that would look good in a live action movie. It wasn't really a concern but I sure am glad I was wrong. They looked really good. Definitely a strong point in the movie. Being a Michael Bay movie of course there is plenty of explosions and such. And I am a simple man. Put giant robots in a movie with lots of explosions and I will be happy. I also don't think Shia was given enough credit for his role. He didn't really have the best lines, but he was very good in his delivery of most of them. He brought some humour to a role that was written to try and be funny, but many of the lines would not have worked if not delivered by someone with talent. He is a better actor than people give him credit for. Megan Fox didn't do to badly herself. The last half hour of the movie was really cool and really captured the way this sort of movie should be.THE BAD: They may have pulled of not being cheesy with the robot's looks, but they didn't do very well with the dialog of the movie. The teen romance plot just seemed unnecessary, and seemed to drag on for a lot longer than was needed. I think Bay may have included in response to people who think his movies are just popcorn flicks. That sort of thing just doesn't seem to work in his movies, and it really didn't work in something that would have worked better as a popcorn movie. The characters were all pretty one dimensional and clichéd. For example Shia's character is a lovable loser and Megan's is a beautiful, but misguided girl.All in all it was a very enjoyable movie that I was more than happy to buy on DVD after seeing it at the cinema. It was in no way perfect, but I am willing to accept the flaws. I found the movie a lot of fun and that's really all I wanted going into it.At this point a sequel looks very good.7.5 Out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily the best installment though 2017,"This was an all around light fun action film with many humorous scenes especially every scene with his parents.There is not any series in terms of blending Computer Generated Imagery, with film locations that has been done masterfully.These are fun films for Generation Xers if they had the ability to do this between 1985-1995 I can't imagine any kid between 9-16 not loving these movies. They'd really have hated the over priced easy to break Transformer toy-line.(Personally I had megaton based on the cartoon transformed into a Giant Desert Eagle 5 foot Caliber gun lol.The main issue though is the action scenes are just too extensive, and can overwhelm the visual senses.Disney has that warning..but on an OLED quality 55-72' set the robot fight scenes can be overwhelming on the senses.The films may have been accepted or reviewed better had they been cut down to 130 minutes max plus credits..But if something can rake in over a billion on a 250 million budget before BLU-Ray and merchandising it will be made.Like anything else movies especially in this genre aren't made to win Oscars but to bring in big bucks.In terms of sequel overkill.... I find Starwars to be more embarrassing as mentioned. The prequels were a nightmare, and JJ plagiarized the first three...Ray is the Emperors Grandaughter...Luke is Vader's son. Mark Hamill was young and mopey now old and grouchy. A Death Star and Star base 1 at least they didn't make a second star base just Imperial Cruiser planet killers.

the best CGI flick I have seen,"This was a must see when it came out and I've just watched it again 5 years later and still it is one of the best CGI flicks I have seen so far. There's nothing else special in this sci-fi flick to see, just watch it for the effects.The story itself wasn't that weak at all a thing we don't see that often with such kind of flicks. And even the acting was believable. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky) did a nice job here as the main lead. Of course he's the looser here and becomes the hero, that you could tell even as the flick isn't started yet. His opponent Megan Fox (Mikaela Banes) became the new big thing after Transformers although she was a bit too young aged 21. But she was voted already as one of the sexiest girls on our planet. The producers new it and she was more sexy in the next episode but it also became her downfall.I enjoyed it a lot with all the action going on between the soldiers and the Transformers but also the comedy added.

Transformers fans will be pleased! Incredible Movie!,"Michael Bay doesn't disappointed us. I've seen Transformers in a press screening today, and I'm under the film's impression right now. The robots are cool as much as they can be. Bay's vision about the cult-comic and animation of the eighties has become one of the greatest effect-movie of all time. However I must disapprove that the Decepticons lost their personality, they're just mainly destroying and killing machines, Megatron and Starscream are more complex characters like they're featured in the movie. But I don't want to tease. Spielberg and Bay has created a gigantic, spectacular and funny summer blockbuster movie, that the sequel manufacturer studios can consider as an example.

Pssst!  If you're a woman -- read this!,"The guys in the audience at my screening were practically ejaculating in their seats. This was VERY exciting for them.For me (middle-aged woman), eh. Not so much.(Look at all those 10 star reviews on here. They're all written by these guys.)See there's this 17 year old boy who has a crush on a girl in his class. Who appears to be 30 and a supermodel. When she finds out he's got a car that's an alien robot, she's all over him. (Yes, it's all about boy fantasies.)Keep your little kids (or anyone nightmare-prone) FAR away from this film! A LOT of nightmarish images. Nice people and little kids have very scary pointy metallic objects reaching for them. Or batting them around. (I'm pretty sure a lot of people were killed -- but they glossed over that quickly.)Even tho I'd never seen a Transformer cartoon or toy or whatever the frick these things are, I was able to grasp the plot easily. But the movie just wore me down.These huge piles of garbage (or whatever the frick they are) were hard to wrap my eyes around. When they stood up and moved they were impressive (frightening even). But when they spoke, they just seemed dorky.The movie whip-sawed between goofy comedy and terrifying action movie. Seems to be a mish-mash of styles. It didn't have an even tone. (And yes, I understand about comic relief.) The movie just seemed cobbled together from a lot of different parts -- like the creatures.Around 3/4 of the way thru, I got tired of big things whamming each other and shut my eyes for a few moments. Open my eyes: Still going on. And on and on.I couldn't wait for it to be over. At the end of the movie I was headachy and slightly nauseous.But the guys were jumping in the air. Outside they were peeling out in their over-sized trucks way too fast. (""Look at me! I'm a Transformer!"")Ah.

Tremendous fun,"I've been looking forward to this movie ever since they started thinking about it. I had such high hopes, then they announced that Michael Bay was going to do it. There was a collective ""Uh-Oh"" from everyone at this announcement given the trail of bad movies he's given us over the years. Over the course of production, the scares kept coming - Megatron's design, no Frank Welker, no Soundwave, Optimus as a different style of truck etc. Hopes started to become dashed. Until the movie came out.I went to a special preview screening, found a good seat and sat down to enjoy the show, trying to forget all the negativity surrounding the movie and trying to clear my head to have an open mind. The film started. From the very opening moment when Optimus Prime started speaking, I was smiling from ear to ear. Optimus is back! So many memories and feelings flood back to me.Bay made a good decision in getting stuck straight into the action. When I saw the very first transformation I just went ""wow"" in the cinema from the awe of watching it happen. The effects were amazing. All the transformations were amazing, for that matter.The film was also really funny - funnier than I expected. Shia LaBoeuf does a fantastic job as the awkward hormonal teenager Sam and puts in a really convincing and funny performance. Josh Duhamel is passable as the typical standard GI Joe movie marine, though thankfully keeping his shouts of ""move"" and ""go go go!"" etc. to a minimum. Jon Voight is...well...Jon Voight. He's not bad, but his character is one of those that won't exactly stick in your head. John Turturro was incredibly funny as the Sector 7 agent Simmons, very over the top, although perhaps a little miscast. Megan Fox is true to her name as the human eye candy in the movie with an interesting back story, though her acting impact is perhaps less potent than that of Shia's. There is a very funny scene with her in Sam's bedroom though. Bernie Mac is also a legend.Who cares about the humans though? We're here for the robots! The transformations were all amazing. The effects are really second to none. Megatron's design was interesting - I didn't think it was great but I'm sure it could have been a lot worse. Frenzy is funny as the angry little spy robot. Prime is brilliant and exudes leadership, but the lips thing...I'm sorry, but it just didn't wash. However, he speaks his lines like we all remember him, especially those lines that are little nods to the original series. Hugo Weaving does an alright job as the voice of Megatron, but I didn't feel it was particularly menacing - more like a standard bad guy voice.There are a few gripes I have with the movie - not enough Megatron, not enough Starscream, the lubricant thing, Prime's lips, calling Brawl Devastator instead, the lack of the original theme music in any form outside the credits, the obvious product placement (some parts look like pure car adverts), the thinness of the other human plots (the hacker group working on the sound was pure silly) and sometimes the screen was just a little too busy.Despite all this, the movie is clearly and easily Bay's best. Say what you want about him, he's given us some awful trash in the past, but occasionally he can put in some nice touches and exciting action, and this movie is tailor made for him. Do not expect the next Citizen Kane or Star Wars - just go in and have some fun. Well worth a watch.Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robots - Thumbs Up;   People - Thumbs Down,"I went into this film not knowing much ""Transformers,"" only that they were some toy robots you could re-assemble into other things, like trucks. When they were popular in the '80s, I was not a young kid who cared, being past that age-wise, so I had no preconceived notions about this story.What I found, on the positive end, was a goofy story but a great visual and audio movie, one that I heartily recommend you see on Blu-Ray high-definition, if you have the equipment. You will be blown away by the sharpness of the picture, one of the best BDs I've seen so far.The other highlight to me was the special-effects. These ""transformers,"" aliens who could change shape from cars and trucks into giant robots, was jaw-dropping at times. True, the action was overdone in the last hour, but that's normal for a modern-day action film. Most of it was fun to watch. I preferred the second half of this film, anyway.While it was fun to watch, this movie was not fun to hear, meaning the dialogue, which was extremely annoying, mainly in the first half of the film. Maybe if I was a lot younger I could have enjoyed Shia LeBeouf's wisecracking lead character, ""Sam Witwicky,"" but he was too smug, too obnoxious for me. So were the other ""good-guy"" characters in this story, who were all young, edgy and loud stereotypes. You know, grubby-looking 17-20 years old people who all know more about computers and science than anyone else older than them. It's very offensive to anyone over 25 watching this film.Speaking of stereotypes, the worst was the portrayal of every adult in this movie except one (Jon Voight's Defense Secretary character, who was fine). Everyone else in any position of authority was made to look stupid and totally idiotic. Filmmakers have been doing this since the '60s. There is no one Liberals despise more than a military figure or someone in the government (if they are Conservative.) Voight must have insisted his role was not going to be like the others. If you doubt this, just check out John Turturro's ""Agent Simmons."" It's ludicrous.The worst - the most insulting of all people in this film - was Sam's mother. In one of her scenes, this woman's dialog might be the most disgustingly-unfunny segments I've ever seen on film and total insult to any viewer with any intelligence. It was at that point, I almost junked the DVD and returned it to the store. However, I hung with it and the last 50 minutes was enjoyable and free of most of that stupidity.I was reminded of one thing: director/writer Michael Bay has a resume of overwrought, intelligence-insulting films like this one. He did ""The Island,"" ""Bad Boys I and II,"" ""Pearl Harbor"" (when the Japanese were made to look like the good guys), ""The Rock,"" etc. Thus, I will be very wary of watching one of his films again or anything written by Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who wrote the screenplay. Then again, I have to admit the action scenes in here were pretty awesome and I really did enjoy the last hour or so. I guess you take the good with the bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There were only a few times in the movie where you could see the features of the Transformers clearly.It's my understanding there will be a part 2 and part 3.

The beauty of mashing metal,"Despite Michael Bay's numbingly loud and macho direction, he seemed a good fit for presenting this alternate vision based on the 80's toy superstars.

Mainly this is due to the unsung heroes of movies like these: the computer animators. Here they are allowed to reach new heights with some outstanding point-of-view renderings as these gigantic robots battle for supremacy. In what is this year's most explosive, debris-laden sequencing, these CGI artist's elevate the formulaic and exploitative idea and turn it into a profound tech demo.

"Certainly ""More than meets the eye""","OK I'm rating this movie on the basis of what it is- A sci-fi movie about big robots that can transform into mechanical objects on earth.This is an event movie, a summer blockbuster, a no brains action/comedy film. I will not give this the critical eye of which I might give when reviewing something like the ""English Patient"" or the ""Constant Gardener"". This film is not trying to be anything other than what I described above.So is it any good?! Well yes it is, many elements of the film are extremely well conceived and pulled off.The Cast- Well that was OK, Shia LeBeouf plays the character of Sam Witwicky with charisma, style and competence. I great find for mainstream cinema. The rest of the cast don't have much to do or input into the story. Megan Fox certainly looks stunning, but it stops there, Josh Duhamel provides some slight acting gravitas, but is under-used. Sam's parents played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White both give fantastically likable performances. Overall the casting and performance of the cast was pretty good if not spectacular.The Effects- Well hats of to them, this film is quite the spectacle thanks to those extraordinary CGI robots. All of them good and bad look absolutely amazing. This movie has a Jurrasic park feel to it regarding CGI, you feel that you are witnessing the next step of effects.The Story/Script- OK lets pass on this one, its a let down, not much to it and very weak. I think they certainly could have put a little more effort into this than they obviously did.Direction- Typical Michael Bay, loads of explosions, loads of jumpy camera movements, loads of slow-motion, loads of sunlight, etc etc...... Overall I was satisfied with what he did.Overall- 2 hours of class no brain entertainment, its funny, charming at times, and exceptionally well made. As I'm from the generation that played with the original toys and watched the G1 cartoons I wasn't that disappointed about the changes. So go along, pay your money then sit back and enjoy a fantastic spectacle.******** out of **********Points lost for poor character arc's and a pretty weak plot and script.

A well staged sci-fi action film,"There are people who like Michael Bay for his work and others who don't. I only like Bay for certain films and Transformers (2007) is one of them. Because this is the first live action adaptation of the transformers toy line, I am amazed at how well all of it was brought together. Everything from the action, the special effects, the music and the acting.Just like the TV show, transformers involves two sides of alien robots; the autobots (good) and decepticons (bad). Both of which fight for control over each other. This conflict soon brings them to planet Earth where the autobots join forces with the human race. The first human contact (dialog) that the autobots have is with an ordinary individual named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). Witwicky is like any other young guy; he tries to find a good-looking first car so he can impress the girl of his dreams. The girl of his dreams; Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox).Both LaBeouf and Fox look great together on screen. It is easy to see that they have good chemistry. Along with them are Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson who play two military officers who become one of the first people to experience coming in contact with the ""transformers"". And this happens around the beginning of the film. As for the autobots and decepticons, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime returns and Hugo Weaving voices the menacing Megatron. Along with others, these voice actors give great performances.The action in this film is exhilarating. Right when things seem like the movie isn't going anywhere, something either blows or lights up to get the audiences' attention. That's where the special effects come in. What amazed me the most about this is that the special effects department made sure that every single component of whatever vehicle the alien robot took form of, was all in the transforming action. Also, the sound itself of the robots transforming was so unique that it is one of those noises that can't be mistaken for something else.The musical score composed by Steve Jablonsky was well executed too. Each track has its own tone and represents each scene accurately. It also has a memorable tune for when Otpimus Prime is on screen and that makes the action that much more entertaining. My only quarrel with the film is LaBeouf's character. If I were in his situation, yes, I would be quite nervous as well but his jitteriness gets tiresome really quickly.

When did Bay fire the editor?,"Overall, I liked the film, but instead of a 7, this could easily be an 8-8.5. There are so many pointless scenes in this movie that are supposed to be ""developing characters"" but the majority of them are so awful and awkward, you're more wondering why the heck they were included rather than learning about the characters.There are long, extended sequences with Megan Fox and Shia LeBouf that drag on unconscionably long. The sequences with the hackers are abysmal, as well. That whole story arc has almost no bearing on the film, and the most annoying part of it all is that the development of the Transformers was sacrificed in order to develop an abundance of useless characters.Forgiving the plot holes and other weirdness (Why would the Secretary of Defense be constantly addressing the nation in a time of crisis?) the movie's decent.I really wish Bay would have tossed far fewer ""Oh look, nobody noticed the GIANT CG ROBOT IN FRONT OF ME"" sequences and slowed down the robot fighting sequences so you could possibly see what the heck was going on. In nearly every sequence, all you can see is, ""Oh, there's a mass of metal."" If Bay would have cut the hackers, and trimmed the some of the awkward character sequences this would be a fine 1 3/4 hour film with some nicely fleshed out Transformers, with more than 4 lines to differentiate explain why the Autobots were not jerks, and that the Decepticons were.Also, the lips do look weird.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I feel nostalgic,"""Autobots, Roll Out""When the first Transformers film was released in 2007, I was in fifth grade, and I found it utterly mesmerizing to witness these sleek, gigantic vehicles transforming into talking robots. I wasn't particularly interested nor was I aware of their history, or the slew of animation series or movies that came before, all I cared about were their majestic transformations and some jaw-dropping action sequences that I never envisioned seeing on screen.Despite the extreme hostility that some segments of the viewers have been directing at this set of movies since its inception, the Transformers franchise has always held a special place in my heart. It has been almost sixteen years since its theatrical debut, and I'm still fascinated by it. Even though I have seen the film a dozen times before, it still appears as if I am viewing it for the first time. This never gets old, and it never will.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

You've got to be kidding me...,"SPOILER: I can't believe the ranking this movie has gotten so far on IMDb. First off the good things: the special effects are great, without a doubt. The comedy in this movie is also great, until it turns to cheese. Shia LeBeouf is great. Unfortunately that's it. The plot is riddled with holes - check out the ""Goofs"" to see just some. There were superfluous characters - Anthony Anderson. Characters were unbelievably weird for no reason - John Tuturro. The soldiers acted absurdly - why would Sergeant Lennox charge the Decepticons with a hand-held weapon when he just called in an air strike. The Transformers went from near indestructible in the beginning of the movie, to Bumblebee getting caught with a net, back to being nearly indestructible (Ironhide at the end battle). Also, I know it's a little more visually pleasing to have the transformers be giants, but how exactly does a camero turn into a two-story robot or Frenzy turning into a boom-box and then a tiny cell phone? And even while the special effects were great, the cinematography was so shaky and close-up that you couldn't even tell what was happening when the Transformers were fighting. Also, I understand that you want to do a little tribute to the original Transformers cartoon and movie, but did ALL the dialog between Optimus and Megatron have to be so cheesy? Michael Bay dropped the ball on this one. In fact, I'm changing my vote to a 5/10, and that's being generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Bays CGI Transformer MasterPiece.,"Transformers Is A 2007 American Science Fiction Action Film Based On The Transformers Toy Line. The film, which Combines Computer Animation with Live Action, is Directed By Michael Bay. with Steven Spielberg Serving As Executive Producer.If You Haven't Had A Good Time With TRANSFORMERS. Then Transforming you to be a fan again in the ""modern"" way will be difficult. If You Haven't Had A Good Time A t The CGI Transformations. then That's just beyond me.Transformers will transform some into fans and already have, its just that good of a movie. This Is Michael Bay's CGI robot Masterpiece! The CGI is Just Awesome, with each unique robot taking up the screen. No Robot Is Lifeless, No Robot Is Boring, No Robot makes you wish it wasn't up there on the big screen ( or little screen ). The Autobot's made me truly believe they aren't so different from us humans, despite they're obvious size and abilities. Both Autobots and Decepticons are cool looking and has enough depth into them which look amazing and sound amazing. The robots are fun and exciting to see. Especially in the FIGHTS.Oh Yes the fights are indeed an ""awe"". Its's those amazingwhirrling transforming gizmos's/ bots fights that really entertain. At first, it was a little hard to tell who was fighting who, but that's been like FOREVER. Now, I can predict like every scene and picture it perfectly. This is a really entertaining movie, with lots of exploding stuff. That's Michael Bay folks! Tanks, Helicopters, Jets, Cars, Cellphones, Trucks, radios, these bots can transform into anything! They can speak our language and they can destroy ! Good versus bad. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Starscream, Bone Crusher, every transformer is magic!The transformations are awesome ( as I mentioned ). I liked Optimus Prime's little speeches, they felt important and kind of heartwarming ( if you know what I mean ) The humor was also a success. Loved that blonde ritish speaking women, I found her more good looking than Megan Fox.""I ate the whole plate, the WHOLE plate""""Get Off my Momma's Carpet! She doesn't like NO body on the carpet!

Started off great but went nickelodeon after 45m!!!,"I had high hopes for this movie because of its special effects and Director.

Does the entertainment outweigh the neural damage?,"I'm a person who likes bad movies. I like good movies, too, but I often like the bad ones better. Why is that, silly me? Because they're entertaining. Self-building truck-shaped giant robots from outer space? Searching for some cuboid McGuffin to save the world? Fighting robots, exploding robots, cursing robots, robots urinating motor oil on people? Bring 'em on. But please make sure that I will have a good time with them.Which is exactly what I didn't have with ""Transformers"". Maybe I'm getting too old for the kids' stuff, or I need to adjust my Ritalin level. But watching this was very much unlike watching a popcorn movie, it was more like having my brain replaced by popcorn, by people who happily assume that I don't have much of a brain to begin with.The major problem is not that the movie is so heartbreakingly dumb. (Dumb in a way that makes you slap your head at times). Indeed, some scenes are so inane that the next ""Scary Movie"" film will have a hard time spoofing them (the scene where the two photos are compared -- indescribable; and the Camaro has its own in-built car wash?). The major problem for me was that it was all so annoying. The action pieces were visually uninterpretable, the robots were moving too fast for my poor visual cortex, the explosions didn't stop before the next ones started. It was simply too much for that 35-year-old brain of mine.So even as an audiovisual trip, is it even entertaining? At least not for me. There was no story except for the absolute necessary, the bleached-out skeleton of a plot. There were endless military clichés. There were Jon Voight and John Turturro embarrassing themselves. There was no humor except the unintentional sort (the other one didn't work). The action scenes were undramatic and uninvolving. The love story was generic and flat. Worst: There's real and present danger of a sequel.Looking at the professional reviews on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", I'm surprised that many critics treat this cinematic bomb so tenderly. Maybe it was too expensive to have an independent press?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A well run dry,"Let me just settle this: The first hour of ""Transformers"" is incredible. It's everything you wanted, and more, including humor, acting and special effects that are beyond reason. Michael Bay's take borders on action-comedy, with charming robot slapstick and tons of giggly one-liners taking turns with the hyper-realistic and often brutal action sequences. Shia LaBeouf does a nice job as the human main character, and the cast (including a hilarious guest appearance by Bernie Mac) does an honorable job, without stealing the thunder of the movie's real stars: Optimus Prime and his band of vigilante robots. And again - the effects really are mind-blowing. Fight scenes are messy and sped-up (as seems to be the norm these days), but with the incredible attention to details, such features only enhance that sense of immediacy that carries much of the movie. And although the plot is pretty thin at times, and the clipping strange just as often, it's all nit-picking compared to the massive impression the movie makes.And so all is well until about half an hour is left. The story has been worn pretty thin by then, and without revealing any plot points, it then suffers a deadly blow. The main characters unanimously make a decision that, at least to me, defies any rational thinking, and after a couple hours of swallowing camels, the whole thing suddenly becomes quite hard to accept.This is however nothing when faced with a sudden and extremely bland ending, seemingly rushed together at a tenth of the effort of the rest of the movie - it's like watching the final minutes of Spielberg's ""AI"" all over again. It all sums up extremely off-balance, with a climax that in no way meets the expectations built up by so many excellent moments before it. One can only hope that the sequel rectifies some of that final impression.That being said, ""Transformers"" is a movie well worth both your time and your money, and even a crummy finale cannot overthrow this film's position as action flick number one so far in 2007.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid,"Not bad. The special effects were amazing but I think they went a little overboard. There were so many explosions and bullets flying, at times it was hard to see what was going on. This I think, is a function of creating movies on computers. Monitors are sharp and detailed, you're looking at the action on a smaller screen, over and over and frame by frame when it's being created. Then it's unleashed on a big screen and it's just too much to take in at once. Especially with the overwhelming sound. I kept wanting it to slow down for a second so I could see the robots in all their awesome animated glory. But they were too busy shooting at each other and throwing themselves into things (which then disintegrate in a very satisfying manner). Storyline-wise, there wasn't any. But let's face it, it's a popcorn movie with giant robots adapted from a cartoon. You don't go to see a film like that for telling insights into the human condition. I thought the romance between the two main characters was a bit Disney, and the offhand jokes were pretty hokey, but hey, they joined the dots nicely between the explosions. All in all, a good fun film, I'd watch it again - maybe on DVD when it comes out, but I don't think I'll be adding it to my top 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Noisy and expensive but offers little else,"The US secretary of defence calls together all experts at his disposal to try and decode a signal that will reveal who just wiped out a military base in Qatar in an attempt to hack into the central computer network. Had they known that a small group of survivors had made it out led by Captain Lennox, they would have known that the attack was a helicopter that changed into a robot and used devastating weapons to destroy everything. Meanwhile, back in the US, nobody officially knows anything so the fact that high school student Sam Witwicky believes his second hand car has a mind of its own, gets him nothing but trouble. But could he be a bigger piece in the puzzle than anyone knows?In the middle of a disappointing summer for blockbusters, I must admit that Transformers went from being one I was planning to see, to become yet another film that I had no desire to rush to be disappointed by. However my girlfriend took me along and I suppose it helped that really nothing about the film suggested that I should expect anything from it. With this in mind I found it mildly entertaining in a simple-minded and noisy way, but this is very different from saying it is a ""good"" film.I sort of fall in a strange place in regards viewing the film because technically I should be a massive fan and very touchy over the details. I loved the toys as a child and got the weekly comic until it finished in the UK at issue 300-something but then on the other hand I really have few affectionate memories of them (and all the possessions are gone!). To a point I did think ""well, that's wrong"" here and there but really I didn't care that much. What bothered me more were the countless weaknesses in areas I would associate with storytelling and film-making rather than the details of a fictional race of robots. First I suppose I should give credit to the effects, because this is what the film is all about. They are excellent and they were so convincingly real that I never found myself looking for the joins. The scale of them does mean it all gets a bit frantic at times and too often I lost track of what was happening.Too often though, the action didn't engage because I just didn't really care about the characters  human or not. This problem is nothing that any extra money spent on effects can solve because it comes from the writing, the acting and the total delivery of the film; I am finding it more and more  too many films are doing whatever effects allow them, rather than letting the film dictate the effects to be used. Anyway, the script is full of clunky dialogue and has all the narrative logic of a drunken argument after closing time. It is best not to ask too much about the importance of Witwicky etc because it has all the strength of wet tissue paper, obviously hoping that action will help cover up all the cracks.The dialogue is just as poor and nobody really comes off talking like a normal person. Of course with such a lacklustre collection of performances, it doesn't really matter so much what words they have to say. LaBeouf is so-so while Fox has a good body and a very impressive tan  neither of them would make me see one of her films again but I suppose pretty young actresses will never want for work (well, so long as everything is as tight as it is at age 21 I guess). Duhamel is bland and even Tyrese lacks spark. Voight and Turturro are both weak and seem even worse due to both of them having been much better than this. The voice work from Cullen, Ryan and others is a nice touch and mostly avoids being corny. The actors aren't helped by the messy direction from Bay. On one hand he is delivering a silly comedy, on the other it is an all-out action movie with a budget that could fund a small country. The comedy is more daft than funny and the romance side is just plain dumb. Action is delivered with a typical lack of restraint and lack of understanding for what makes engaging action  so instead we get the usual grand music and sweeping camera shots.Overall then, the film has loads of noise and lots of money right up there on the screen. However it doesn't have a good script, characters, performances, tension, excitement or memorable content. The summer crowd looking for noise, action and nothing else will find their boxes ticked, however those looking for more will find little.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Maybe they shouldn't have..,"I'm going to keep this short and simple. Michael Bay who remade Miami Vice saying this was not going to be an 80's staged remake did the same thing with the Transformers.

I think the original fan base aged between there mid twenties and early thirties is an more interesting audience, revenue-wise, then today's kids.The movie is definitely putting all it's hopes on the effects. The storyline is slim, lacking depth.Some specific let downs:Optimus Prime's character is plain old weak in the movie and his knowledge which made him stick out back in the days is has come down to some simple one liners. He did not live up to his role as leader of the Autobots.I could handle Optimus Prime's 2007 make-over because in basis he looked the same. But the whole Predator-look they gave Megatron 2007 -> what the hell were they thinking?!?The faces on the robots were too slick. We're talking about robots people, they should have kept them more mechanical.Transforming from a vehicle or animal seemed to take ages while transforming back to this state was just a matter of milliseconds.Did somebody order an 2 1/2 hour during GM/Mountain Dew/Panasonic/Nokia/Burger King commercial? Did I miss anyone?The only reason I gave this a 6/10 is because the effects were great. But I'm still awaiting the 80's remake who really makes use of these pro's and combines these with a solid storyline, great character buildups andIs this movie going to smash the box offices? Yes!

"Open Letter to Michael Bay (warning: spoilers, as if it mattered)","Dear Michael, ""Transformers"" was palatable, the most I can say about any of your movies. But I see a disturbing pattern: your movies are too damn long.Two hours is too much. Your movies are about gun fights, explosions, car chases, the requisite hot chick, product placement and in this case, robots.Your successful peers manage to tie these ingredients together with a thin string of a plot that lasts ninety minutes, just enough to fill us with adrenaline without being boring.Transformers is over two hours along. For intriguing Oscar-worthy dramas that include character development, plot twists, and witty dialog, this is acceptable. For movies about giant robots fighting over a hot chick wielding the latest Nokia, it is not.Not only does Transformers drag for long stretches, but the plot sucks. I can handle bad plots in action movies -in some cases they're encouraged- but not when it drags the movie out unnecessarily and clutters it with awkward moments. I've regrettably compiled a list of things this movie could do without: -Why did the Scorpion robot attack the military in the desert? Granted, it was a good scene, but it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Um... explain? -Was the young black kid simply pandering to the inner-city audience? He was introduced to crack a code, but the code didn't say anything. I don't even know what happened to him at the end, I think he disappeared.-Same with the Australian girl. You already have a hot chick, adding another one only confuses the males in the audience and gives them false hopes of a threesome. Not only was she annoying, I don't know why she was there. Eliminating her out would've cut five minutes from the film.-The scene where boy meets girl: too long and irrelevant. You've shown that he has a crush on her in the classroom scene, and that he's the nerd that needs a car to impress her. That's enough. You don't need him showing up uninvited at a party, as it added seven early, unneeded minutes to the movie. Remember: explosions, robots, hot chicks, product placement. You suck a dialog so don't bother.Furthermore, ""boy lusts girl"" belongs in another movie; like ""Pearl Harbor"", you forget your point. Like the ADD addled audience you target, you suffer from quick jumps from unrelated subjects and the inability to focus for more than five minutes. That's why you make action movies.-Speaking of that scene, remember his friend? The blond kid who hung upside down from the tree? Yeah... him! Why is he in the movie? Don't addle it with unnecessary characters.-How did the glasses show that the cube is in the desert? The glasses were imprinted with the location of the cube when Megatron was frozen in the arctic. Goddamm, that's a confusing plot piece, such a development needs some explanation, like a sentence ""Megatron had followed the Cube to earth... (pause for digestion) but he got off course and crash landed in the Arctic (further pause). THE CUBE WASN'T IN THE ARCTIC, IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE"" If you clarified that part, you wouldn't even need to try explaining how the cube got to the desert.OK, I hate to nitpick, but you're making Transformers II, I'd really prefer not to have to sit through thirty minutes of pointless back-story in order to see robots battle over a hot chick, turn into cars and explode.

Visual Effects were phenomenal...yeah i know Michael Bay loves explosions but I still liked the use of explosions here, the transformations look amazing and to me it feels like the robots are successfully brought to the big screen. Some of the acting, Shia Labeouf does a decent job as the main human character Sam Witwicky but others felt...flat especially Megan Fox, it feels like she is just there to be the love interest of the main character. I liked the story and some of the action scenes. Optimus Prime is bad-ass in this movie.Bad things-Some of the acting sucked(Megan Fox), Besides Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the other robots feel so underdeveloped that makes me to don't care about some of the robots especially when Spoiler... When Megatron kills Jazz, I thought Jazz was just there to be killed. And also some Decepticons like Bonecrusher( the one Optimus fights in the highway) just pop out, he just appeared. Some sexual jokes in the movie kind of ruined it to me in some parts, especially after I knew this movie was based on toys.Overall it is a good time if you are looking for a fun movie, it's a good popcorn flick, maybe some fans will be disappointed with this movie but I am a transformers fan and I actually liked this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transform your life,"From Director Michael Bay comes the most visually spectacular film of the year. Transformers which takes the summer action movie to a whole new level. While the film is pictorial masterpiece, let it be known this is Michael Bay we're talking about here. There is cheesy dialogue with a quasi-stupid storyline but the entertainment aspect is there from start to finish.Transformers tells the story of Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), a teenage boy trying to cope and be accepted by his peers. His solution for acceptance comes when his father purchases Sam a car. Little does he know it's ""Bumble Bee"" an Autobot from a distant universe sent to Earth to protect Sam and mankind. From beginning to end, there is non-stop action and we cannot wait for the next explosion.Shia LeBeouf is becoming our new ""it"" boy especially with an earlier breakout this year, Disturbia.

Unsurprisingly disappointing,"Just another typical Michael Bay film. It's pretty much a mishmash of all his previous films, with some impressive FX and a silly story added in. Shia's plot line was the only one I really cared about, up until it merges with all the other ones, and it's too bad that it was cut up by lame stories about soldiers and hackers. The slapstick bit with all the autobots at his house while he's trying to retrieve the glasses was brilliant, and the fun found there was sorely lacking in the rest of the film. The big action scenes weren't all that impressive - mostly due to Bay's ineptitude as a director - even if the Transformers themselves looked great. By the time the final battle rolled around, I just wanted the film to end. A big disappointment, but I was foolish to expect anything else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bay's all-too-familiar approach falls flat,"Overblown, clunky sci-fi/action movie about a young high school nerd who has never had the guts to pursue his nubile, popular classmate. He reaches a milestone when he buys his first car, only to discover that the car is actually one of many sophisticated alien robots that have come to Earth to fight a definitive battle against a rival robotic race. Despite having the prestigious Spielberg name attached, the latest project from director Michael Bay is, like most of his previous efforts, swift and flashy but equally hollow and cheesy; loud and annoyingly overlong it grabs your attention with destructive action scenes and high-octane, high-tech gadgetry that move at a breakneck pace, but who cares? An abundance of eye candy can't hide its lame characters, nearly nonexistent plot, and extraordinarily stupid dialogue that lead up to a noisy, video game-like climax. With sloppy direction, a corny script, and visual effects that try but fail to leave you in awe, this one really only works on a no-brainer level. **",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic!,"I just finished reading the last comment and I can say with all my heart I think he is completely missing the point. 1. I never liked the cartoon, and I don't think the other 110,000 viewer that gave this movie above 7 points average are all fans of comic books or the cartoon either. 2. This movie is probably for kids around the age of 5-17ish so I doubt they really care too much about where the planes are flying low or high. 3. Its supposed to be cheesy-ish; You want them all too sound like what exactly??? 4. 'After seeing this film, I almost feel like everyone in the movie was a robot' You mean you must be the stupid one and spent all your time and money wasted whining about it! Instead of sitting back, chilling out and enjoying this action packed, outstanding animation and explosions. 5. 'but absolutely ruin the movie for all of us' Speak for yourself egotistical egghead.

Robots in berserker blockbuster disguise.,"Transformers is directed by Michael Bay and written by John Rogers, Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman. Based on the Transformers toy line the plot sees Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets involved in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery. Also involved in the carnage are Megan Fox, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, John Voight & Mark Ryan.With a production budget of around $150 million, Transformers went on to make almost $710 million worldwide. That is some hefty figures, almost as hefty as the mighty Transformer robots that dazzle and wreak mayhem up on the screen. The plot of course is bonkers, but is anyone seriously watching this expecting high end literacy? The out-shot ultimately is Good Robots Versus Bad Robots, with humans either in the way or aiding the Autobots to save mankind. There's been plenty written about the film, both good and bad. From the quite brilliant transforming sequences to the rather staid dialogue; to the wry observations on the world we now find ourselves in, Transformers has got plenty for the critics and film watchers to ponder. As popcorn summer blockbusters go, it's one of the most fun in recent times; and the box office figures tell you that it found a considerably large and appreciative audience. Great ""brain checked at the door"" entertainment it is, then. But crucially, it's not just for the kids to enjoy, it happens to be a fully rounded family treat. Go bots! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's OK.,"I watched this again having seen the new movie, and not thinking too highly of the sequel, I found I actually like this one a little better.This is a typical popcorn fun blockbuster, but the human characters and the humor prevent it from being totally mediocre. Unlike Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't really find the characters annoying and I thought the humor was much more fluent (as opposed to forced) in this one.POSITIVES - I like most of the humor in the movie, and I got a few good laughs out of it. The action and special effects sequences are all excellent. Bumblebee is awesome. It sustained my interest throughout, and I liked most of the characters. In fact, none of the characters really made me angry, which is a definite plus because the new one had several annoying characters.NEGATIVES - Ad placements are everywhere. Granted, they're there to pay for special effects, but they are... everywhere in this movie. - Some of the Autobots' dialog was a little corny (especially Optimus Prime) but they're working based on dialog from the cartoons, so I understand. - The plot is pretty silly with everyone trying to get a cube and hiding ancient robots under the Hoover Dam, but, again, the original material is a little silly. - There are also a lot of plot and story logic errors in the movie (a problem carried to the second one) but it didn't make me angry. More like, ""That's just silly."" Overall, I feel the movie is entertaining popcorn fun. Not everything will appeal to everyone, and I felt a little silly at times watching it because I felt the plot, story, and some of the characters were a little goofy. However, it doesn't get to the point where I'm really mad or irritated by the movie. I gave this one a higher rating than Revenge of the Fallen because the sequel has moments which just made me cringe in disgust.6/10 - Recommend for anyone who just wants to sit back, relax, not think too much, and eat some popcorn.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I Enjoyed this Movie So Much,"Coming from a girls point of view, I fell in love with the movie Transformers. I could probably list on one hand the amount of actions movies I have seen in my life and the only one I can truly say I enjoyed was transformers. Director Michael Bay did such a wonderful job of making sure the audience felt like they were right there in the action in each of the scenes.I am a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf's and felt like he did an outstanding job of bringing comedy to an action-based movie.

Transformers,"With all the gazillion planets in the galaxy to choose from, the warring Cybertron races of ""Autobots"" (the sort of goodies) and ""Decepticons"" (the sort of baddies) descend on Earth in search of a missing cube. This ""allspark"" - landed on our planet aeons ago and for many years has been unwittingly in the custody of the always competent US military and their ""Section 7"" operatives - currently led by ""Simmons"" (John Turturro). Now it transpires that there is a clue to the location of this gizmo - and that is to be found on the spectacles of the grandfather of ""Sam"" (Shia LaBeouf), only he doesn't know it. The goodies decide to protect him by providing him with one of their number, the ultimate convertible car ""Bumblebee"" but that doesn't actually end up being much use as his bodyguard and soon poor old ""Sam"" and his gal ""Mikaela"" (the startlingly wooden Megan Fox) are embroiled in the action-packed Meccano movie. The star is easy on the eye and has a soupçon of charisma to bring, but otherwise this is just a shockingly derivative series of repetitive fight scenes featuring robots between whom it is almost impossible to distinguish. Their vocals all seem to involve them speaking into the microphone through an old pair of socks, and as it lurches on I gradually found I really couldn't care less whether the red robot beat the black one - you just know this is but the start of a never ending franchise with only two purposes. 1 - to restart the flagging career of Josh Duhamel and 2 - to sell toys, thousands and thousands of toys. Marketing has often been behind some of the most successful movie spin-offs, but somehow this is just a touch more cynical than the rest. The story is weak and the characterisations, such as they are, are about as deep as a hoof print. Plenty of pyrotechnics, though, but at all but 2½ hours long, this is a long old haul.

Yawn,"Transformers is definitely aimed at the kiddies and I feel sorry for them. Their young ears are going to be blown out by the obnoxious volume of this film. Their eyes are going to be blinded by the obnoxious explosions. Transformers is just a very expensive cartoon.For the teens, there are Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox as the next Bogart and Bacall. Actually, they are the next pair of 20 year olds playing 13 year olds. Their ""steamy"" sex scene is when LaBeouf gets Fox to sit on his lap in a car. Being a PG13 film, nothing can happen, of course.A lot has been written about how cool the transformers look. Big deal. Just because someone has fond memories of playing with transformers as a child doesn't excuse the fact that this is a terribly inept movie.Directed by master hack Michael Bay who directs by throwing in as many explosions as he can and padding content that would be interesting for 5 minutes into a 144 minute explosion extravaganza.For those with time they don't want to waste, watch 20 minutes of this garbage and call it good. It doesn't get any better.A total waste of time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quintessential Bay,"Ground-breaking in its attention to detail as far as effects go and honest in its intentions as a loud and bombastic series of action set pieces, it has a surprisingly fitting aesthetic that both tips its hat to the source material while adapting it for a modern age. However, Transformers '07 is at its core call-back to the blockbusters of the late 90s, where character and development take a back seat to effects and spectacle, making CG the star of the show in place of story and causing the players in this multi-million dollar play-date to range from flat and forgettable to insulting and exploitative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Much more than meets the eye!!!,"If you want Transformers then this movie delivers in spades.The CGI, the story, the human characters and of course the robots.If you're a fan of the original cartoon series then you will be a fan of the movie. Some elements from the original story have been changed but that in no way detracts from the movies excitement.From the opening helicopter attack at the airforce base to the final battle in the city the action is unrelentless.I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for good old fashioned rumbles. Even the transformation are spectacular. The highlight would have to be Optimus Primes transformation when he is squaring off against Megatron.Shia Lebouf puts heart and soul into his role and makes it believable for the audience. Megan Fox is good eye candy but also had a good role. Anthony Anderson was a little wasted as far as comic relief. John Turturro does a far better job in that department.Overall, I know that many people don't like Michael Bay and what he does with his movies but here, in this movie, his style of direction fits the bill to a tee!

WOW! What an awesome & entertaining movie,"When I saw the trailer of the film I thought that Transformers was going to be another silly action movie without a story but I was wrong. It did have a story although it was simple but it was better that way because you can concentrate on the laughs in a few scenes and the ultra cool action.The story was a bit hard to follow but I managed to understand so my advice would be to don't concentrate on the story too much, just sit back and enjoy the amazing action sequences. Most high budget movies always have a very weak or no story-line especially Spider-man 3 which had a paragraph of story but Transformers had about 2 pages. Also Spider-man 3 is probably the most expensive film ever made but there isn't a single thing that looks expensive but Transformers you can see every penny spent in the movie, in fact it looks more expensive than its budget.The actors were not very well known, I haven't seen any of them before except the funny Black guy who ate all the donuts in the police station, he was in the film Kangaroo Jack. I think his name is Anthony Anderson he was the funniest and he never fails to impress. Probably the filmmakers deliberately got actors with low payment because most of the money is gone to the SFX.The Transformers were the best throughout the whole film and there are also small robots that can change into a CD player or even a mobile phone. Overall while I was watching it my eyes were locked on the big screen and I needed to go to the bathroom but I did not go until the film ended because I didn't want to miss a second. A must see especially on the cinema and when the film ended the audience were clapping & cheering. When I left the theatre I was saying to myself WOW! What an awesome & entertaining movie.

A good start,"This is a great introduction to the series, bringing all of the favourites to the big screen and live action for everyone, but especially the eighties generation to enjoy. I have to admit that I only really remember Optimus Prime from those days, but I know I loved the series regardless.It's an interesting story, although it does take a while to really get in to it.It was a good choice to use humour and romance to break up what could have just been a film about fighting robots and full of explosions. In that respect I feel that the casting was appropriate and although he can only ever play himself, I feel sorry for the flack that Shia gets. I imagine that he had a tough childhood, being a celebrity from such an early age. In this role he is perfect.As for Megan Fox, she could have been played by anyone for all that I care. I don't think that she specifically added anything to the film apart from the lusting audience of teenage boys that flocked to the cinema over and over again so that they could unzip there trousers in the dark.The special effects including the Autobots themselves are done very well. There is never a moment where you might doubt that they are real. They do move so fast it's hard to see anything at all sometimes though.It's a typical action/adventure made to be enjoyed by young males from 12 up and you can expect all of the elements that go in to a film like that, but it's done well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So, there are some certain parts the editors messed up on but these movies are fun, and entertaining because I mean in 2007 they way they looked was just amazing and still hold up today better then a lot of other movies.

All Style but No Substance,"I know many people loved Transformers as in the movie and its history of past shows and movies. I am not one of those people. I am just judging this according to how it was as a film and wasn't too impressed. Here are some reasons why: The acting was borderline horrible to bad. Shia LaBeouf was the only standout in this mess of a movie. He has something very attractive about his personality that makes him perfect for movies. He has the ability to make things so ordinary in a movie work. That shows that he has something special within him. Megan Fox is very attractive too but that doesn't include her personality or acting. She is very beautiful and good looking. Still for how many other bad actresses can you say that about? Rachel Taylor though not quite as good looking fits under this category of good looking bad actresses. Tyrese Gibson and Anthony Anderson are not exactly known for their great acting either. Jon Voight and John Turturro are known for their acting though. Voight has even won a well deserved Oscar. In here though they played worse than Megan Fox. The only thing more disappointing than bad acting from actors is bad acting from good actors. This happened in Transformers which made it so frustrating.The writing in here didn't exactly help the acting though. I can't blame the acting completely because the writing brought it down even more. Some of the plot explanations were horrible in here and so many over used themes and clichés were in here you can't even count how many they appeared. Worst of all was the dialog. Man how bad it was.The special and sound effects were amazing. Unlike the rest of the movie it was top notch. Some of the action sequences were a real spectacle some were a bit overdone though.The director takes responsibility for all of this. To me and to many other people Michael Bay is one the worst movie directors around. He can not direct one serious sequence or scene in a movie. He is just reserved for action if he is used for anything else that movie will be doomed from the start.Anybody who is just looking for pure action you should definitely watch this. If you are expecting the slightest bit of a meaningful movie of some sort of message don't watch this movie. In fact don't even acknowledge it. Transformers has now message at all (no substance) and that is really sad all, it has is a lot of nice effects (all style). I guess people need meaningless trash though.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A total blast,"Every now and again there comes a movie that you don't expect to like at all and then it goes and surprises you.'Transformers' was a real shock to me as I have never been a follower of the cartoon series and the trailers I had seen didn't do much for me.The simple truth here is that I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to.It is pretty much action all the way here and the movie very rarely let's up.It is perhaps a touch too long but it never really feels as though it drags at any time.The acting is pretty good and Shia LaBeouf does a good job in the lead role as he shows humour and a serious side when he has to.There were a couple of moments when I was worried that things were going to get too cheesy but luckily the action soon kicked in again.Also,there were genuinely funny moments and the film didn't seem to take itself too seriously,that would have been a BIG mistake.The direction is crisp and Michael Bay deserves credit for such an entertaining ride.There will be many people that will turn their noses up at this movie as just a brainless action flick but that does the film an injustice when it is as well done as this.The effects are brilliantly done and I recommend this film to anyone with an open mind.My mind was already made up before I watched it and the film proved me wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Transformation Into Catastrophe (Review Has No Spoilers),"Like many others on this forum, I grew up with the Transformers. So understandably, they hold a special place in my heart. Imagine my excitement when I first heard they were announcing a live action flick for my beloved Transformers. Imagine my despair when I heard Michael Bay was on board to direct. Despite my perpetual distrust of Michael Bay's directing abilities, I wanted to cut the guy a break and trust that he would come through with a great movie in Transformers. That confidence came largely due to Steven Spielberg's endorsement of Michael Bay.In the end however, my initial instincts were right. Simply put, the film was a disappointment. Michael Bay's Transformers suffers from the same ailment that all other Michael Bay films suffer from: A lack of character development. A lack of story development. A lack of proper editing. A lack of proper dialogue. An over indulgence in jittery camera work. As in any other prototypical Michael Bay affair. The magnificent effects, the amazing explosions and the ""jitter cam"" are simply hiding the gaping holes within the film...It's complete exclusion of anything coherent. At no point did I feel I was fully invested in either the story or in any of the characters.Shia LaBeouf does an admirable job with Sam. Given the painfully limited capacity in which he is used, Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is affective as well. Meagan Fox is nothing but eye candy, all be it, a very beautiful candy. Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and company are mere pawns with little purpose. The likes of Jon Voight and John Turturro are sparsely used to forward a plot that is already clinging for dear life. It is a talented cast, if you read some of those names back, but nothing in Transformers is fully fleshed out. Therein lies the problem.Expecting a high end drama or Oscar material from your usual summer ""blockbuster"" release is foolish, I'm very much aware of that. Still, I expect some portion of intelligent thought in my summer blockbusters meals. The kind I could wryly shrug at, all the while, just as easily, admitting it was a lot of fun.For every single ounce of life in me, I cannot fathom how this film is getting rated 9 on 10's or 8 on 10's. Which essentially means, people are putting this utter example of garbage film-making, right up there with the likes of: The Matrix, Star Wars, Alien, Terminator, Gladiator e.t.c. Now that is amazing! When it comes to films like Transformers, I've heard people say ""I didn't even have to use my brain. That's what made it great!"" I can understand this to a degree, watching dramas all the time isn't fun either. But putting your faculties on hold altogether, is simply asking for far too much. Filmmakers like Michael Bay all to often try to peddle ""flash and bangs"" under the guise of ""summer blockbuster"" or ""popcorn films."" While conveniently and completely disregarding mere basic tenants of film-making.Take for example Star Wars. The film that started the whole summer blockbuster tradition, the mother of all popcorn films so to speak. Yet it's still a film that stands head and shoulders above the likes of Transformers. Why you ask. The reason is simple. George Lucas was wise enough to develop a good story and flesh out the characters. If you think about it, films such as Star Wars, Alien and The Matrix take place in an equally preposterous universe. Although, in each instance, their filmmakers decided on creating a believable storyline and believable characters. A skill that Michael Bay, rather unfortunately, is desperately lacking.I've nothing personal against Michael Bay or Transformers. I take no pleasure in giving Transformers a bad score or giving Michael Bay a hard time of it. I do happen to think that there is talent within Bay. He does have a knack for action sequences and all things combustible. Though again, his absolute disregard for everything else hampers the impact of what he has managed to do right.The film isn't without a few positives (few being the operative word). There are some very nice effects on display here. It's obvious that a great deal of care went into creating all the robots. The skill with which the CGI interact with their environments is amazing. The stunt work and pyrotechnics within the film are top notch as well. Though again, with Michael Bay's incessant need to use jittery camera work and disorienting edits, one isn't able to fully appreciate the aesthetics in their full glory.To be honest, I really did want to like this film. God knows I tried my best. I kept holding out for something, but the end credits rolled on and the proverbial fat lady had sung. Very loudly and very badly it would seem. Ultimately, It's a very shoddy and an extremely mishandled piece of film-making. I can put up with the jittery camera movement Bay is so fond of. I can put up with the disorienting edit jobs. I can even put up with the horrible dialogue. What I can't put up with, is a poorly conceived storyline and atrocious character development. Even if it is for a ""blockbuster/popcorn"" film. Michael Bay's Transformers is akin to a huge state of the art luxury cruise liner, all the bells and whistles attached. With a crucial exception. The engine needed to power it.Thumbs Down.NOTE: The critic James Berardinelli at Reelviews.net sums it up quite nicely with a bit more detail. Something that I didn't want to get into on account of spoilers.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointment.... not here!,"Growing up watching the original cartoons and loving them more than almost anything else, I was really really REALLY hoping not to come out wanting to hit someone, like I did with that waste of time money and hype that was Thunderbirds.... GRRRRRRR... and I can gratefully say I wasn't.Although there was a moment or two where I was very worried that I was... It does take a little while to get going... but once it does ohhhhhhhhhhhh boy!!!! This is a typical Bay film, lots of shaky cam work, which is a bit of a shame really (especially as I was stuck 3 rows from the front!), and some of the acting was a little duff (Mr Leboef was good though I have since decided!), but lets be fair that isn't the reason we went to see it, we went to see some kick ass transformers fighting to take us back to our childhood.... and we got it alright! Prime is awesome and looks great, updated for 2007 but still has the style of days gone by. In fact every one of the transformers is very well done in the same way (Megatron is not as good but still a solid character). And their interactions with each other, with the humans and their enemies is spot on. My advice would be to watch the original film just before you go and see this, or as much of the original series's as you can cram in! The only reason I can't give this 10 out of 10 is that the film, like SOOOOOO many other remakes for the 2000's, is the inclusion of kids again... Leboef was good I'll give him that, but still.... if they had 2hrs of transformers fighting with no storyline (and NO KIDS) I would watch every time!

Well action packed and a profoundly epic film based off the classic toys by Hasbro,"LaBeouf plays a decent lead character in this film, as he and others get blown away by an almost-unstoppable alien species, the good side known as the Autobots and the evil side as the Decepticons. Optimist prime and Peter Cullen go arguably well together creating a bold and well known Autobot that fans can really look up to. I never played the toys much when I was younger, but people told me these movies were decent. I can certainly agree in many aspects, but overall, the series as a whole is not all that well made. But on a more positive side though, this first installment is probably the best out of the ones that are out so far. I will also admit too that even though each of the films are a bit poorly made in reality, I still enjoy the thrill of watching them all as they are one of my favorite types of intense action films just to sit back to.

But then when they started to show the trailers I was very like---I don't know! Now that I have seen it I think that Michael Bay and Co. has absolutely pulled of the most UNBELIEVABLE CARTOON TO LIVE ACTION conversion, EVER!! This movie has everything that US Transformers FANS, loved about the cartoons. When I saw that they had recruited the same guy that actually talked for Optimus in the cartoon, I was already like this is going to be really good. This movie is nonstop action all they way through and also this movie was funnier then some other comedy movies! It was perfect in every way and I might go and see it again! Oh, For those that hated it, I guess you would rather see a bland transformation of the more that meets the eye bunch. Michael Bay, Shia Lebouf, and the rest of the cast, I have a Message from the rest of us Transformers Fans: YOU'VE GOT THE TOUCH!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good for what it is,"Transformers is a good popcorn movie, and this first installment is easily the best one in the franchise. It is about cars that can transform into giant alien robots and it works. The plot is very simple to understand. The fight scenes are ok, sometimes you can't really understand whats is going on in the fight but it is enjoyable. Some people complain that the movie focuses on the humans more than in the robots, but the movie is set on earth, differently than the 80s show, that was completly about the robots. If you're going to watch a movie, expect explosions. A lot of them, actually.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie!,"I saw the movie yesterday in the theaters, and I was surprised how funny it was. As expected, the movie has brilliant special effects, and a sometimes predictable, but good story. OK, some of the Autobots-Decepticons-dialogs were a bit corny, but not bad after all. Like they said in the movie, I mean Transformers is one hundred times better than Armaggedon, another Michael-Bay-film.I also like the new design of the Transformers, especially Megatron's, and the play of Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, especially the outstanding performance of LaBeouf. I think action fans will be very pleased. Transformers is clearly one of the Year's movie highlights.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Every boy's dream,"I still remember the feeling of watching this movie for the first time. It is very great. Every boy has that feeling and the CGI brought it out clearly and completely. The feeling of witnessing a giant robot transforming, with the sounds of machines colliding as they move, is truly thrilling in a joyful way. The story about Sam is also quite simple. A foolish boy gradually becomes a brave protagonist who saves the earth and gets a beautiful girlfriend. Everything is a bit like comic style. But it's convincing enough to watch and enjoy. I quite like the music and sound editing. If you are a boy, you should watch this movie at least once lol.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best movie of the summer hands down.,"This movie was freaking awesome. I would suggest for anyone to go. It is crazy funny, had a decent storyline and amazing special effects and fight scenes. It was nice to have Michael Bay join with Spielberg to get more of a storyline rather than just action and comedy. It was just flat out awesome.They did a good job of casting as well. LaBeouf was a good fit for a kid that just get freaked out the whole time and added a good level of comedy. I was pretty impressed with Megan Fox too. She is crazy hot, but did a pretty good job with her role as well.It was really amazing to see the special effects of the film. It was hard to tell that it was not real throughout most of it. But that seems to be a Michael Bay specialty. Overall, this movie was really one of my favorite movies in a long time. It has been a while that I walked out of a movie so excited about it that I would have turned right around and watched it again. Seriously, amazing that is all there is to it. For those that don't care to be crazy critical of movies and just want an awesome movie that will grab you with the action and make you laugh throughout, then this is going to be one of your favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Massive Machine Mayhem on the Big Screen!!,"Transformers is the one that started them all back in 2007, a massive live-action movie based on the cartoon from the 1980's that so many children watched growing up. This Michael Bay film stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, the every-teenager in the film and the link between the humans and the Autobots in the movies as well. His sidekick and love interest in the film is well played by Megan Fox, as she plays Mikaela Banes, popular girl at the school that Witwicky eventually wins over and the pair eventually teams up to win over the Autobots to help them on their quest against the evil Decepticons. Like with the cartoon of the 1980's, the Decepticons are led by Megatron as he goes head-to-head against Autobot leader Optimus Prime for the allspark, an ultimate power source that - in the wrong hands - could cause certain death to the entire human race. Transformers is very well done by Bay, in fact none of the Transformers live-action movies are poorly made. One of the nice things about the movie franchise is that the transformers themselves get more and more realistic looking as the movie line progresses. Chalk it up to technology in my book, there just seems to be a crisper and tighter picture with each movie as time progresses. Nice performances by Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and Jon Voight add good human element to the movie. It's a great movie for people of all ages, its fun for the young who might just like the transformers and fun for more mature audiences that may like the drama and humor of the human actors. Transformers, the movie this time, also has a great live soundtrack to it, going back to the days of of movies like Batman Forever where soundtracks by popular bands supplemented great summer movie releases. Great story, great directing, good writing, good acting, great special effects, good sound track, and a great sense of fun make this a good movie to see!! 7 out of 10 stars!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stunning unlike anything ever seen before,"this movie is far and away the best visual achievement in any media ever ever ever. It is so unbelievable. Everyone is talking about how Michael Bay went too ""over the top"" with the visual effects. This is ridiculous. That's kind of the point! This movie was not meant to be some epic drama like the Godfather. No. This is like Star Wars, but 30 years better graphics technology. The only reason this movie isn't on Star Wars level was that the script could have been better. Looking back, there were some very corny lines, but in the moment of the action, they just work. I don't know how it didn't win Oscar for best visual, somehow the Golden Compass beat it, which is ridiculous, because the Golden Compass would have to be the best visual of all time to top transformers. I actually haven't seen that movie, but it has ""Eragon"" dreadfulness written all over it in that it will have 10 million new concepts every 5 minutes, no character development whatsoever, which Transformers actually did have, despite what the critics say.This is the kind of movie that has so many dimensions. You'll watch it once, and you focus on the transformers. The next time you'll notice more things about Sam and Mikaela, then the next time you'll focus on the Army officers, then it'll be the Pentagon lady with the accent. Their characters are actually far more complex than you notice at first, because you're so zoned in on all the action. ""Bring the rain"" is now my favorite line of all time. This movie is so amazing you must see it i can't even tell you how much you need to see it. Even the drama-loving, detail-focused, picky critics will be awed by the action, despite what they will say about it's other ""flaws"" (i swear the script is the only one). This movie has something for everyone, and if you play COD4, R6V, or some other game like that then you'll really appreciate the weapons used in this movie.Please see this movie, it should really get like 9.5 stars, because 10 is perfect, and the script could have been better, but really, it works in the moment, and there are some really great lines, mixed in with some bad ones.This movie should have won, maybe 5 or 6 Oscars, and it probably would have if the critics had watched the movie 4 times, but they only saw it once, and only saw the action, thus, it wins no Oscars. I cannot stress enough how you need to see this movie more than once to appreciate it beyond its special effects, which are the greatest part about the movie, but you really should see it again, it just kind of all fits, it's kind of all wrapped up nicely. It's like a great book, everything just works.Lastly i would like to comment on the use of lines/scenes/shots/ideas from other movies used in this movie. Transformers does use lots of that, such as the fighter pilot scene from Independence Day, the Bunker scene from Terminator 3, and there's more, but the thing is, these are great scenes/ideas/etc. that Michael Bay borrows, so it is actually a good thing.Cannot say enough about this movie, you need to go see it, even if you don't speak English, it's worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oh please... not a movie about 20 year old toys.,"I never really understood the fascination with Transformer toys. I always thought they were kinda stupid the way they transformed into inane things like cars, boom boxes, and ugh.. dinosaurs. I have friends that love them... but even they could not make me sit though the 80s cartoon movie. Never was a fan.So, in my inbox pops the invite from this same pack of friends to their outing to see the Transformers movie. I was not interested and declined this particular fanboy cinemaplex Pilgrimage but the next invitation was not so easy to decline, my kids asked me... repeatedly... to take them. I finally relented as I have sat through everything from Chicken Little to The Santa Clause so why not Transformers? After all, I am a veteran of sitting through crappy kids movies.The next 2.5 hours would be a blur of unanticipated cinematic goodness. As much as I love the Spiderman franchise and counted the days until SM3, there were times during that movie that I wanted to hang myself from the nearest thing that would be high enough to hang myself from. This movie on the other hand had me wanting more... 2.5 hours can seem like half that amount of time when a movie succeeds in captivating you like this one does. The movie moves along at a good clip with action to spare, very good acting, and even a decent storyline thrown in for good measure.There are some parallels you can draw between this movie and Independence Day. ID4 was a good movie but it didn't grab ahold of me and refuse to let go like this one did. This movie is perhaps one of the finest action movies made... finally, an action movie with style AND substance.If you don't like this movie, then check your pulse my friend because you are probably dead.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big goofy fun,"Score me as one of those who liked it.Went with my 23-year old son, who also liked it.Plot - no plot of any great significance.Dialogue - entertaining, often very funny.The Transformers - faithful to source material, humorous at times but treated with respect.John Turturro - eye rolling over the top scenery chewing. A performance drawn from the Jack Nicholson School of Subtlety.Shia LaBoeuf - going to be a big star. A lot of screen presence.Effects - mucho eye candy extremely well done.Yup.

This is actually a good Transformers movie.,"I was a massive fan of Transformers as a kid, I remember watching the various tv shows and collecting the toys. So naturally, when I heard that there was going to be a live-action movie based around that property back in 2007, I was really excited to watch it in the theater and I ended up loving the movie. It's also worth noting that this was the first Michael Bay movie I watched in the theater and this was when I was a really dumb kid. Now as an adult, I decided to give this movie a fresh rewatch to see if I still love this movie or if I hate it now as an adult. After this rewatch, I can say that there are a lot of problems with this movie, but there is still a lot of fun to be had with this first live-action Transformers movie.Positives for Transformers (2007):
The main thing that stood out to me about this movie especially since I am someone who as an adult is not really a big Michael Bay fan that he manages to give this movie that Ambilin Entertainment atmosphere with the Transformers. I do appreciate that at least with this movie, the humans characters serve as the point-of-view protagonists as they are experiencing this larger-than-life scenario with the Transformers in this movie. As someone who is now put off by how he tells his stories and portrays his characters, this is one of the few times to where Michael Bay actually put in the effort in making us care about the story and his characters. This movie was my introduction to a lot of people Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Megan Fox, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Jon Voight and Peter Cullen. I do appreciate that they cast Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime in this movie especially since he was the original voice actor for that character back in the 80s. I loved the CGI for the transformation sequence in this movie and they still hold up to this movie. I also really appreciated the use of practical effects with some of the Transformers in this movie. The movie is also paced extremely well with its 2 hour and 23 minute runtime. And finally, the action sequences in this movie are awesome and honestly that's the one nice thing you can say about any of Michael Bay's movies.Mixed for Transformers (2007):
This is one of those movies to where you love it as a kid, but you start to notice all of the problems as an adult. First off, the main MacGuffin of Sam Witwicky's great great grandfather's glasses doesn't make any sense and I didn't understand how the Autobots and Decepticons know that it has the map to the location of the AllSpark. Some of the human characters in this movie are not all that interesting with the exception of Sam Witwicky played by Shia LaBeouf. They, you have Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes and she's a little bit bland and boring, but I don't think she's not as terrible as people have made her out to be. Honestly, she's only here to serve as the love interest for Sam Witwicky and to look good, but then again that's a common criticism with any of Michael Bay's movies. Nowadays, his way of portraying of female characters looks subtle compared to other people like Sam Levinson. And finally, the first half of this movie is a bit annoying to get through, but thankfully the second half saves this movie from being bad.Negatives for Transformers (2007):
Despite all the praise I give to Michael Bay for his work with this movie, this is still a Michael Bay movie. You have the overly patriotic feeling with the U. S. military in this movie. You also have the overly sexualized female characters and racial stereotypes in this movie. Sam Witwicky's parents are very irritating and there's a point to where I wanted the Autobots to kill them off. The product placement is very annoying in this movie. And finally, the humor can bey very juvenile and annoying in this movie.Overall, Transformers (2007) still manages to be a good movie despite its flaws. This is one of the few movies to where Michael Bay didn't go full-on Bayhem with one of his projects, which sadly cannot be said for almost all of the Transformers sequels that he directed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformed me into a fan!,"What a fantastic film! That's the first thing I thought when the credits rolled up. I saw this only on TV a while back on one of the digital channels. This was much better than the terrible sequel because the film was a new idea with a fresh plot, the special effects were excellent and I loved the car transforming into the robots and back again. Shia LaBeouf's performance was great with decent support from Jon Voight and Megan Fox who played the loved interest. It was also very funny and not childish like the second and the camera-work wasn't all over the place. I will always like this first film, which Michael Bay has done well with but not the second. Yes this film is long but it holds your interest because it's new but the second was just repetitive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The start...,"""Transformers"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ancient fight between two Cybertronian races, the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons. They both come to Earth because their fate and their power are held by a teenager who does not know anything about it.I liked this movie because as a fan of Transformers I found it very good and interesting since it was consisted of plenty of action and very good visual effects. The direction which was made by Michael Bay was good but a bit dark for me.

Avoid if you can resist!!!!,"This movie is very BAD, but I bet you're gonna watch it anywaysThis has to be the most disappointing movie I've watched this year. What a let down! It's probably up there with great franchise flops like Dungeon & Dragons (which was really really bad) and Terminator 3 which was nowhere close to the very much dated T1 & T2.Sure, I understand this Transformers is a Michael Bay Transformers (made 2007 and not 1980s) it shd be different .yes yes but almost everything lacked character!I guess what I wanna say is a good movie is timeless. It tells a good story and leaves deep impression in the audience. 50 years from now, you may tell people about an excellent movie you've watched in 2007, but it's probably NOT Transformers.If you are a 5-year old kid, you may like the movie. If you are an adult with no great expectations, you may find it visually entertaining.

Transformers disguises its robotic flaws with stupendous amounts of adrenaline.,"Give Michael Bay a budget and he'll spend it. Wisely or not is up for debate. But damn, the man-child that he truly is certainly is presented through his mind-numbing work. Enough pyrotechnics to annihilate an entire nation and an adequate amount of Megan Fox showcasing to transition into the adult entertainment business. So, Transformers. A franchise decimated by needless, unimaginative sequels that tarnished the reputation of the primary instalment. Also known as, the only decent entry Bay ever conceived. A group of Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, sent to Earth to prevent the Decepticons from reviving the antagonistic Megatron and retrieving an extraterrestrial cube.This blockbuster opposes everything I stand for as an amateur critic, film buff and general human being. Its bombastic nihilism, riddled with blatant exposition, surmounts to an unquantifiable splurge of stuff happening onscreen. Seriously. It's the equivalent of being lobotomised and watching a sunset from a stained glass window. The colours, brightness and artificial heat would melt your retinas. That's Transformers.But what people seemingly forget, especially those elitists too afraid to breach admittance, is that Bay's first foray into the franchise is actually tolerable. Good, even. And by that, I don't mean it's the epitome of blockbusting entertainment. Far from it. Yet Bay, a director incredibly easy to pick on due to his accessibly basic yet overly explosive features, implants genuine directorial talent that prove his integrity. Yes, about an hour of the film's runtime is explosive, with buildings toppling and metallic vehicular warfare ensuing.However, what makes Transformers utterly re-watchable is the constant flow of its narrative. It never stagnates. For over two hours, Bay continually pushes the story forward. Whether it be sweaty soldiers exhuming mountains of testosterone, sweaty LaBeouf clamming up or sweaty Fox suggestively leaning over the hood of a car (realising Bay's wet dream...), it doesn't matter. The point is, there's never a dull moment through the frantic action. A commendable quality that provides motion to the narrative's mechanisms. Bay knows how to exploit a budget. You go big, or you go home. He clearly understood that literally.Another reason as to why the first chapter is one of his best films, is the simplistic story. The actual plot is thin, with a couple of robots stopping some other robots from destroying everything. Basic foundations without convoluted lore that is constructed as if the writers are formulating random ideas as they're writing the script (*cough* Revenge of the Fallen...). Yet what furthers the script's memorability is the humorous characterisation. The Witwicky clan in particular. LaBeouf delivered a frenetic performance that solidified his leading qualities (which may have backfired on him!). His adolescent antics and heroic endeavours forced him to be both relatable and likeable. Fox, despite being presented on a suspiciously stained silver platter, held her own as well without resorting to the typical ""damsel in distress"" scenario. Supporting cast were buoyant also. The governmental world ending plot merged well with the teen angst situation, even if it was a colossal convenience. And a plethora of memorable quotes that I unknowingly recite on a daily basis. ""Shut up Grandma! Drink your prune juice!"". Classic.It teeters on mediocrity at the best of times, however Bay's focus on the human elements for the vast majority of the first hour ensured that it was more than just mechanical beings punching each other to fluctuating bass drops. There is substance before the clunky visual and auditory extravaganza. Did I grow up with the original source material? Of course not. Regardless though, I think we all need reminding just how solid this blockbuster really is. ""Autobots! Roll out!"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I'll bet they could transform this film to be 45 minutes shorter, with their eyes closed.","I'm a transformer fan, not fanatic  to save you any time reading, I suggest you pass on seeing this in the theaters, wait for it on OnDemand or DVD. If you DO go to see it in the theater, be prepared to not be on the edge of your seat for about half the film.The film exhibits either one of two classic Hollywood film making errors. Either there was a lot of story in the writer's heads that didn't make it to the screen OR too many cooks were throwing all sorts of 'trendy' ingredients into the soup spoiling the meal.Here are some basic notes; The numerous subplots were SO inconsequential, poorly acted, cast, and edited - all conspired to slow down the film. It felt like a committee decided they need to fill the time between the special effects with a cute girl 'scientist' (with a heavy Aussie accent no less), Hip Hop computer hackers, teenage angst and crazy men in Black. (the kids are going to LOVE the zany Defense Secretary!) The romantic tension between the two lead characters (the human ones) was cliché and padded the film with useless scenes that didn't move the story. A degree of this is to be expected but it's so poorly managed here that it only adds more speed bumps to the script. As mentioned already by others, the action scenes use the ""shake the camera"" technique to both mask the effects and make it feel 'real'. Man this was irritating as hell, it made me wish the scenes (that I came to see) would just end. The fights were so chaotic that generally you didn't know what was happening until it was over and even then you don't get a good sense for how it went down. I'm not sure if it was the print we watched but the film itself shifted between good quality to super grainy, and it wasn't being done for effect, it was like they used the wrong speed of film when they shot it.I really wanted to like this film but sadly the more I think about it, the worse it gets. If they do a sequel (and that seems inevitable) I hope it's darker and better written.--------Post First Week Box office note: I'm glad the film did well, I REALLY hope the sequel comes back darker and allows the Transformer Characters be more the story and not this 'Independence Day' style of disaster flick.Maybe get Ronald Moore or the team from Batman Begins to write it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Painfully bad,"I used to love Transformers as a kid. The cartoons were great and I loved the toys. But then a few years ago I got the toys out of my loft. Bloody hell they were crap. Cheap, flimsy and poorly made. How could I have been so wrong? How could something so awesome secretly be a pile of toss? Well, I guess children are both stupid and easily impressed.But I guess that assessment must be extended to a lot of teenagers and young adults, as a lot of people are saying that Transformers is a good film. Well, it's not. It's a horrendous example of film-making. The action is dull and uninvolving, the characters are annoying as hell and the writing and the acting are risible. What an atrocious piece of crap.That being said, the special effects are pretty good. But why would anyone want to watch a film just because it has some nice graphics? And anyway, even though the Transformers themselves are impressively rendered, you rarely get a chance to look at them properly. The camera never lingers on them, so you only get glimpses. Therefore there's no sense of awe. They never take your breath away like the space station did in 2001 or the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. They just look...nice.But unfortunately they don't sound very good. Yes I can imagine it must be pretty damn difficult to think of dialogue for alien robots, but the stuff here is just painful. 'My name is Optimus Prime, we are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.' 'You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!' 'Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.' Just awful.Not that I was expecting Kafka from this film. But it would be nice to watch the film without having to cringe every five seconds. The dialogue here isn't even serviceable. It's floating about in the toilet. And the plot itself is almost incomprehensible. Okay, so a big cube thing lands on Earth and the robots want it and, er... Yeah, I've lost the will to live. I'm sure the film explains it all in its dim-witted way, but the movie is so restless, so eager to move onto the next explosion or next joke that everything just washes over you like a tide of effluent.But what about the characters? Okay, so even if the writing and the direction are pants, maybe the characters can save it. Er, no. Nearly all the people here just made me want to kill them. Whether it be Jon Voight as the Defence Secretary, the fat black guy who's mouthy but a genius, the blonde Australian bimbo, the army guys, the Transformers themselves or Megan Fox's airhead heroine. The only people who don't totally humiliate themselves are John Turturro (who's always fun), Bernie Mac (who's gets to be an amusing jerk for about ten seconds) and Shia LaBeouf (who's passable as the film's hero). Everyone else though can go to hell.And Megan Fox can go there first. She's got great legs and a flat stomach that I'm sure loads of men are dribbling over, but she seems barely sentient. She has no charisma, no screen presence and no ability as an actress. She's a dull fantasy for teenagers and men with no taste. I mean, there's a scene where she looks under the bonnet of a car and tells the panting LaBeouf what's wrong. Maybe I'm asking too much in wanting believability in a film about alien robots, but I can barely believe that Fox knows how to open a door let alone know her way around an automobile.But now that I think about it, there is something worse than Megan Fox  the annoying little Decepticon robot that runs around. It's meant to be a Puckish figure. A cheeky little rapscallion. But every time it was on screen, which was often, I wanted to rip Michael Bay's arm off and slap him in the face with it. This little robot is one of the most irritating screen presences I've ever seen. I'd rather have five hundred Bette Midlers dancing around. They'd infuriate me less.And is it just me or is there the whiff or something unsavoury in the way that the Decepticons (minus Megatron) all speak an alien foreign language and want to destroy the world and the way that the Autobots all speak perfect English and want to protect it? Take this robotic bitch-slapping surrogate Muslim fundies! But how to explain Megatron speaking English? Maybe he was the smart one that was sent overseas to learn a proper civilised language. And then something went wrong in his brain circuits and he turned loopy.But this would give the film too much credit. Transformers is really just all about building up to one large robot face-off. Too bad, then, that the final sequence is a snoozefest. Part of the reason for this is because we don't care a jot about the characters and their fates, but it's also because the direction is so poor. We rarely get to see what's going on. Indeed, half the time it's hard to know which side the robots are fighting for. Is that big thing an Autobot or a Decepticon? At least in the cartoons you had helpful logos on the characters to tell you who was who. But here you're screwed. Yeah, you might be able to recognise Optimus Prime and Megatron (maybe even Bumblebee, seeing as he's actually given screen time), but the others are just anonymous blobs. And as such, the one reason to watch the film, to see gnarly robots beat the snot out of each other, is rendered pointless. You might as well just get those toys out the loft. As bad as they are you'll probably have more fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fairly Solid Action-Packed Ride,"One of the standout aspects of Transformers is the stunning visual effects. The seamless integration of CGI and live-action elements brings the iconic Autobots and Decepticons to life in a way that is sure to please fans. The attention to detail in the robot designs and the dynamic action sequences showcase the immense effort put into the film's production.The cast, led by Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, delivers commendable performances. LaBeouf brings his trademark charm and humor to the role, providing a relatable and likable protagonist. The supporting cast, including Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes and Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox, adds depth and charisma to the story, making the human characters more engaging amidst the chaos.Transformers succeeds in capturing the essence of the original series and the nostalgia associated with it. The inclusion of iconic Transformers, such as Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, will undoubtedly satisfy long-time fans. The film also manages to balance its serious and humorous moments, infusing lightheartedness into the intense action sequences.However, the film falls short in a few areas. The script, at times, lacks depth and relies heavily on clichéd dialogue and predictable plot points. The focus on the human characters sometimes detracts from the Transformers themselves, leaving fans craving more robot-centric storytelling. Additionally, the runtime feels unnecessarily long, resulting in pacing issues that could have been better managed.Despite these shortcomings, Transformers is an enjoyable ride that provides a dose of nostalgia and exhilarating action. The impressive visuals, solid performances, and faithfulness to the source material make it a worthy adaptation for fans of the franchise. While it may not be a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece, it offers a fun and entertaining experience that is worth checking out, especially for those seeking a dose of robot-driven excitement.In conclusion, Transformers (2007) earns a solid 7 out of 10 rating. It delivers on its promise of explosive action and nostalgia, even though it falls short in certain areas.

Everything I expected and more,"I'm 26 - one of the lucky people who got to grow up with the animated series, and once upon a time used to drive a plastic Optimus Prime around, and as a fan of the original, I must say I love this movie. It's everything I expected and some more.""Transformers"" is probably the best cartoon-to-movie adaption I've seen so far. It's funny, with underlying seriousness, and honors the old animés. The actors work for me, and I won't say anything more about them, 'cause lets face it - this is not the movie to watch for the sake of human actors. (A regal curtsy to Shia LeBeouf, though, for his great interacting with the robots.) The robots, on the other hand, I could go on and on about. (Don't worry, I won't.) They look simply awesome. This is CG at its best; balanced and believable. From the moment Blackout started shooting things up and on, I sat with a happy grin on my face, that only got wider towards the end.The voices are better than I imagined. Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will forever stand alongside sir Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi in my memory, as two actors who managed to pull off some, at times, very difficult, bordering ridiculous dialog. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and makes the Decepticon leader the menacing madman he is. His ""You've failed me yet again, Starscream"" was music to my ears.As a hardcore fan of the animés, perhaps I haven't been very critical about this movie, but I don't want to be either, because this IS Transformers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid blockbuster,"Even with some stupid human characters, easy solutions and bad comedy is still a good movie. The cgi and action scenes are beautiful to watch and the plot is simple and solid.
The focus is Sam who's serves a purpose with Mikale and the story, bumblebee, optimus and a little of Megatron. But the other characters still get some unique thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A mindless, out  of scope, CGI orgy. Michael Bay I think is used to take the blame for the all-time King of Crap, Steven Spielberg","Yes, I loved Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but Steven Spielberg is the executive producers of garbage flicks like War of the Worlds and AI, both testimonials to lavish over-budgeting and plot less rambling in scriptwriting. Well, I guess he put Michael Bay in front of this over-bloated silly mess, Transformers, so that he could be the crap shield.This movie is the war sequence we wanted but were denied in War of the Worlds, played in over-sized, out-of-focus for the most part, and boringly-repeated fashion, between the ""good"" Autobots and the ""evil"" Decepticons who are after a source of unlimited power that landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and discovered by the grandfather of soon- to-be-metro-sexual-wimp Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf. Apparently the map of the location of this ""Allspark"" is etched on his grandfather's glasses, which he possesses.At any rate, through twist of fate, Sam obtains a car, which is an Autobot in disguise, and picks up a jock-chasing chick Mikaela Banes, played by Megan Fox. From that point on, the movie is a mindless array of action sequences as the Decepticons make their way to Earth and attempt to cripple all defense and communications prior to a battle with the Autobots.My main problem with this film is that it spends virtually all its time in overblown (and out of screen scope) CGI action sequences that are either too close up to fully comprehend or almost too fast to make any sense of. John Voight is wasted in the role of the Secretary of Defense, choosing to take the paycheck and act like a slightly-intellectual hard-headed redneck bureaucrat instead of playing an interesting character.The rest of the performances by cast are really unmemorable, and the action sequences are just a jumbled mess. The other annoying aspect of this film is that it is a virtual commercial for Chevrolet, Taco Bell, and every other kind of franchise item (candy, tools, and cars), and the actors use their names with great repetition. I have to assume that the executive producer of this film (no stranger of cliché ad usage, remember Reese's Pieces in E.T.?) was banking on merchandising revenues if the film failed at the box office.In the end, it is another brainless, mindless thrill ride we expect from Spielberg. Thank God he has Michael Bay to point the finger of blame should this thing fail. This movie has the indelible mark of the ultimate King of Cinema Crap, Steven Spielberg, and has a similar feel of his ""epic"" action films.I would not even bother renting this one. It really is not worth the viewers time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Less than meets the eye.,"I have low expectations for summer movies. I realize that they are often mindless entertainment with minimal plot and multiple explosions. That's fine. There is a place for such flicks, and I watch them without much hope of something grand. Remember that as I say this with no exaggeration: ""Transformers"" is the worst summer blockbuster I have ever seen. Let me take you through the anatomy of this horrible movie.From the stiff opening voice-over that details the backstory, you sense trouble. Thirty minutes in, you're still waiting for the movie to gain traction, even though a big action sequence already happened. As the action wanes, the awkward dialogue blares through. You realize this isn't Shakespeare, but George Lucas could have improved this script. Simple words in the midst of action are one thing, but as the focus of several too-long scenes, the lame dialogue is painfully amplified. When you're not sure if the humans are delivering their lines better than the robots, that's a bad sign.But you know more transformers are coming, so you wiggle your feet impatiently while anxiously awaiting their arrival. Finally the rest of the good guys show up. ""Wow, those are sweet looking robots!"" you think. You begin to settle in for a rip-roaring second half, until you realize there's not much else to them. It's like finally getting a date with that hot girl you've been crushing on, then realizing how unbelievably vapid she is before the main course is even served.By then of course you're stuck for the remainder of the evening. You deal with the ill-fated attempts at creating drama. Every ten minutes, you wonder what the heck is happening or question the movie's logic, which is awful even for the genre. You laugh several times, though the causes are largely unintentional. Is that John Tuturro wildly out of place? Does Tad Hamilton actually have a leadership position in the military? You hope desperately that the show might end with something redeeming like an epic battle. Here come all the bad guys (out of nowhere), this could be good...but no. The final clash is big and loud, but also confusing and by that juncture, pointless. Emotional attachment isn't necessary in a popcorn movie, but there needs to be at least a minute level of curiosity. You don't care if they kill the humans or kill the robots or kill all of them. Whatever.You sit through the credits, unsure of whether or not you want to be rewarded with a bonus scene. Yep, there's one. Yoikes, that was bad. At least it was short. Wait, there's one more, a final reminder of how miserably the movie failed, like the last rock that always crushed Wile E. Coyote.The worst part is that ""Transformers"" has potential, as the trailer proves. Vehicles turn into giant robots! How is that not cool?!? But the flick scarcely if ever delivers on that promise. The visuals are representative of the whole movie. Well done, occasionally impressive, but too often fights or transformations are seen either from a distance too great or too close, depriving the audience of the true scope of the shot, and of any interest in the movie.Perhaps a knowledge of the source material, with which I am only passingly familiar, would make the movie more palatable, but I doubt it. Director Michael Bay, whose projects have steadily declined since 1996's The Rock, has reached a new low.Bottom Line: Please don't encourage a sequel by seeing this movie. 2 of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Again With The Love,"I can't fit all the pros on this review so i'll tell you that this movie is awesome due to great visuals, great acting, and great sound. The cgi looks real and I can't think of a movie with better visuals than this one. The sound is perfect and the acting is mediocre. Now for cons: too much drama and too much attention is put on the love story...especially a movie based on a story about war! One example that bothered me was Sam and Makala holding hands and talking in the middle of crossfire! They are trying to stay alive and not die. What was Michal Bay thinking? That is so unreal. Love in the middle of a battle when Brawl is bombarding soldiers. Wow! Anyway these cons shouldn't stop you from watching it. So remember I am giving it a nine out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Superb visuals, crappy storytelling","I really don't get all the superbly positive comments. Sure the effects are sublime, the transformers are cool and the choreography of the action scenes is fantastic but thats not all.This movie starts out great in the 1st hour with great humor and tension build up, but then turns into some overacted overemotional ""epic"" storyline that really does not cut it. From one moment to the other the main characters suddenly are portrayed as heroic world savers. This includes slow motion effects and violin music.Talking about music, what's up with trumpets and cello's? I mean, when some tank transforms into a rampaging 30 ft monster robot with guns the size of my car, wouldn't heavy-metal or techno be more appropriate? Final conclusion is that this movie is worth seeing simply because the designers and art directors did their job sublimely. Michal Bay ruined the rest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Certainly a transformation from Michael Bay,"Now, i do not consider myself to be a big Transformers fan. The show was before my time, and the animation a little dated. However, when i heard that the Transformers were going to be projected onto the big screen; i was greatly intrigued. I wasn't disappointed with what i saw.The basic plot is there is a war between the Autobots (good guys), and the Deceptacons (bad guys). Megatron, the leader of the Deceptacons has been frozen on Earth, and is in captivity. A cube of energy known as the Allspark, which has landed on Earth, and along with Megatron is also held by the American Government. The Allspark has the ability to turn any machine into a transformer. However, Megatron wants the Allspark in order to create an army of Deceptacons and rule the Earth. Luckily the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime intend on preventing Megatron from succeeding, and attempt to destroy the Allspark.The plot is strong, and is able to keep an audience entertained for the duration, although the sub-plotted love story, although expected is a little clichéd and predictable.The script is well written, with a number of witty jokes and genuine laugh out loud moments. However, it was my greatest disappointment to see such little dialect between the Transformers, and especially the Deceptacons. However, perhaps the character developments are being saved until the sequels.The acting is of a good standard, although i found Shia Le Boeuf to outshine the rest. He's come a long way from Even Stevens.The CGI is faultless, and the transformations are slick and intricate, and the Transformers themselves look fantastically lifelike.In conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie with enough explosions to keep the adrenaline junkies on the edge of their seats, whilst retaining a clever script to keep everyone else entertained. This movie can appeal to young and old, and it is certainly a surprise to see Michael Bay make a decent movie for once. I only hope he doesn't ruin the good work with the sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"I guess I'm either too intelligent or rather not quite dumb enough to enjoy this movie. I had heard all the reviews going in saying how excellent it was IF you could suspend some belief and not focus on the plot etc etc. Well...I can't I guess. This movie had so many ridiculous plot holes, worthless characters, under developed characters, etc etc that I found it impossible to truly enjoy it. YES, the action seems LOOKED really cool. But that was it. Plenty movies have action that looks cool but if you don't care about the characters AT ALL (i.e. Jazz...boo hoo he's dead, the only thing I knew about him was he break danced and talked like a rapper wannabe). The odd thing was you got the feeling that if the writers, director, editor etc had taken a little more time they'd have gotten it right. It is OK to have a simple plot but at least make the characters buy into it and live it. This movie went from War of the Worlds, to Herbie the LoveBug, to War Games, to MIB, to Bad Boys but never became a complete movie of its own. How can the team that did a silly comic book toy line like XMen get that SOOO right the first time but the team behind this puts out XMen3 on the first shot? For you who have seen it here are a few of my complaints / ideas.SPOILERS 1) No tension building in opening scenes. Blackout/Scorponok scenes could have had real impact if they had been built up a bit more. If they had removed all the Capt Lennox family bs (since it never had a payoff, his family life never comes into play by effecting a choice he makes or is felt in some other manor by say having the town his family lives in being wiped out if he doesn't do something.) they could have spent a few more minutes investing in building tension prior to Blackouts transformation and attack and/or developed the soldiers trek through the desert and Scorponok tracking them more.2) No tension built up in the Barricade/BumbleBee meet/fight. Again, skip the classroom scenes and some of the scenes with Sam's friend (again a character never utilized in this movie at all) and instead spend some time showing BumbleBee and Barricade searching for Sam, who'll get to him first type of thing.3) Frenzy - could have been a cool character if he was a little more serious and a little more mysterious. I know the writers must have thought he was good for kids but he isn't. My 5 year old kept asking me what he was saying and never really laughed at anything he did. (By the way, if you're trying to make a kiddie character don't have him use subtitles to speak, Frenzy was a Jar Jar Binks you REALLY couldn't understand) 4) BumbleBee - Barricade fight. How about showing it!!! Instead we cut away to the Gremlinsesque scenes with Frenzy and Sam and Mikaela.5) Autobot intro scene is too over the top. Adults think it's stupid/kids (once again) don't get what is going on or said. Character development for these guys should have been done here (and some in Sam's backyard) but instead all we get is slapstick comedy routines that quite honestly are not all that funny. (By the way, from now on can screenwriters have teams for doing movies like this where you have an action writer, romance writer and comedy writer, having two nerds try and write comedy and romance really sucks) 6) Hackers - Completely unnecessary. Especially Anthony Anderson. Not funny for adults or kids. Make no sense to adults. Kids. LOL. Are you serious, get back to the transformers. Again, I can see the point of having that one person who figures stuff out but too many were brought in here and given too much screen time. Keep is short and sweet, ie the guy that busts in the door in some armaggedonish movie and says, ""we have 4 days"".7) Sector 7 - should have been played serious, making them comical takes away all tension and anxiety in late scenes such as when the army guys and sector 7 guys square off on what to do (and your only job is dealing with the transformer threat and you end up being the MOST incompetent group fighting them??) 8)Final battle. Obviously this is where everyone on the production team put all their focus and it is a cool 30 minutes (minus the scenes with the hackers/defense secretary etc) or so but all the failures up to this point really take away how effective it could have been. You don't feel for Jazz dying cause he is under developed, you don't care for any of the Transformers on either side. Love or hate so you don't cheer when a Decepticon gets punked or cry when an Autobot is killed or wounded. The lack of emotions just makes this an eye candy scene that feels like it could have taken place anywhere in the film. There is no tension build up and you don't care who wins or loses.Overall. I walked out thinking, eh, it was OK. Not as good as I had hoped but bearable. But after a few days it started to bug me more and more especially when my son who loves the toys (he has at least 50 of them and it is all he wants to look at at Target and all he wants for Xmas every year etc) didn't care to want to go see it again. He actually asked to stay home and watch the Transformer Cybertron episodes we have on DVR. This could have been to him what Star Wars was to me but it didn't even come close.

Popcorn Flavour of the month,"Or even the summer as another reviewer stated! But before I start the review, I have to say/admit, that I don't or better didn't know much about the Transformers world, before I went out to watch the movie. So I can't tell you any differences between the movie and the series or if they forgot/missed something, reinvented the Transformers or anything like that.What I can tell you, is that this movie delivers exactly what it promises. Fun, action, cars and a hot woman. Is there anything else a movie needs? An actual plot you say? Seriously though, if you're going into this movie, than should know better than that. I checked some of Mr. Bays favorite things above ... a few others are: the always moving camera if an action scene is played out in front of you. The spinning camera around the hero(es) etc. etc. etc.The actors are great too (for a blockbuster), Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox! Some characters come short (come to think of it most of them) due to the amount of time spent on the action and/or comedy scenes in the movie, but that's OK. OK because it's what you can expect. So shut down your brain at the entrance and enjoy this ride. It's worth it (and I'm definitely nothing close to a Bay nor a Bruckheimer fan)!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dissapointmentron,"This movie is probably the most incomprehensible piece of trash film I have ever seen.Its typical Michael Bay fare - an empty but full-of-itself plot interrupted every 10 minutes or so with a half hour's worth of smoke, loud explosions, and metal crashing against one another. (See Pearl Harbor) This one is made particularly bad by Shia Lebouf's spastic, annoying performance. If you've seen anything this kid has done, you've seen it all. Lebouf's acting grab-bag seems to consist of talking fast....and talking too fast.Lebouf's performance is the keystone of a plot that won't be too appealing to an audience who values logic in an entertaining story. Why a group of super space robots so advanced they can shift their shape to mirror an alien race's technology can have anything hidden from them or need the help of the young boy to find it is a question that Bay hopes the audience won't be concerned with as they sit enamored with his signature bells, whistles, and gunshots.However, the transformers were an important part of many of our lives as children, and there were certainly many other people leaving the theater who enjoyed it. If you like the transformers (or are one of those nerds who decided you did because you wanted to wear an optimus prime t-shirt you say at Hot Topic, even though you never actually watched the cartoon) you may still enjoy it.If you respect film and enjoy good movies, rent something and stay home.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the best of 2007,"Alright so there's a lot of hype. And in Hollywood, Hype is almost never good.... well this time we're wrong! Transformers is perhaps the most intriguingly visually appealing film released since the original Jurassic Park, plus the amazing star cast have sparks whenever acting together which makes special effects of its own.Okay let's start from the beginning. I walked into Transformers with my sister thinking ""wow this is gonna be weak"". When my eyes adjusted to the darkness I realized how hard it was to find a seat. Once we finally did settle down I got to see four boring previews (except for Die Hard which is the best of it's lot). Then the movie started... and I was hooked. The sound is almost as sexy as the movie itself. You seriously feel like you're in the world's greatest Roller coaster ride throughout the movie. Shiloh Boueff is Hilarious, and the chick is so Beautiful. Like seriously, I fell in love. Tyrese and the other Soldier have amazing comedy chemistry together in even the worst situations (when u see it remember ""cell phone in Iraq""). But the gorgeous, most amazing, beautifully rendered characters have got to be the Transformers. My goodness, are they real? Did they really tear that city apart? were they really falling through a moving freeway? Did the Scorpion Trans really come out of the sand like that and snap that dude in half? wow it looked so real. So real, that you'll be looking at your car in a completely different angle.Michael Bay has always been an amazing director, but this time he cut through my heart. This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time... I'm going to have to even say it's better than 300... yeah it's that good. When you go see it do not expect a kids movie... there's a lot of sexual references and the two hot lead women (a Analyst with the sexiest accent ever, and the who Shiloh sweats) Jesus Jessica Alba move aside. Meagan Fox is my new dream.But yes. Of all the films out right now (excluding Rattotioue cause I haven't' seen it) This movie holds the crown. Die Hard is tight... but not even close to the intensity of this movie. 1408 is scary, but not as scary as a Megatron... I love this movie, so much that I even went out and bought the game, an action figure, and I'm gonna reserve the DVD. Transformers is the best movie out this whole year.

IMDb ratings have gone to the dogs,"I was astounded when I saw the ratings on this movie. nearly 40% of people had given it 10/10 stars.Now I give it 5/10. The story is facile to the point of not really existing. Except for Shia LaBeouf, the acting was phoned in. The soundtrack was, well, just loud. It seemed to me that the whole point of the movie was to be a vehicle for product placements. In principle, with these flaws I normally wouldn't give a movie more than 4/10 (watch it on DVD on a rainy afternoon).But I'm willing to cut it some slack because it does have some cool FX and there are some funny moments in there. I did laugh several times. And of course it is supposed to come from a cartoon heritage so maybe we shouldn't expect *too* much. (But there are other cartoon-based movies that were way, way better. Remember Spiderman, Dick Tracy, Sin City, even the first of the X-Men series). So I gave it 5/10. （Well worth renting the DVD. Entertaining if not uplifting.) I'm willing to see that rational people could disagree with me and because they have different expectations, give this movie a 7/10. (i.e. very well worth paying good money to see it at a cinema.) I can even accept that some people work on a different scale to me and give it 8/10 because they really enjoyed it.But 34% of people giving it 10/10? Up there with Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, Gone with the Wind, Apocalypse Now, Lord of the Rings, City Lights, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction etc etc etc.... Gimme a break! Seems most of the people rating movies these days are more interested in pushing ratings and driving box office than in giving any kind of honest opinion. Over half the raters gave this movie 10, 9, or 1/10. There is no way you could possibly say this movie deserves any of those ratings.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie was great!!!,"This was a great movie. There was a lot of action. Some people complain about it being told from a human perspective and the story doesn't give a lot of background details about each transformer. It would've been hard to give background details for each bot anyway since there were 13(5 Autobots, 8 Decepticons). I like how the perspective is, it shows just how giant the giant robots are.I went to the movies expecting to see 1 thing: Giant robots kicking the living crud out of each other. I got exactly what I wanted, and more. This movie was very funny. I was laughing so much during Transformers. The level of humor in this movie is great. Some aspects are different than the Generation 1 Transformers, but I think it works. Sure Bumble Bee turns into a Camaro not a VW Beetle. But image a little Beetle turning into all that robot. And the robots are more fancy looking, but again, I think it makes it better. At first I was skeptical of how the robots were designed to look more fancy, but I really started to like the looks of the robots. It worked well for the film.There are people complaining about the plot, but I want to know this: Why would you go see a movie about giant robots fighting and expect a plot that is riveting and deep more like a drama? I don't get it. And I thought the plot was good. A few holes here and there but it worked fine for me.In conclusion, if you want to see giant robots beat the tar out of each other, go see this movie.

No Sacrifice No Victory,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Autobots, Transform and Roll Out!!!Tonight's movie review is Transformers (2007), yeh the robots which can turns into cars. The flick is made by Mr Explosive Michael Bay and boy did he make an explosive flick. Such a epic movie, where do I begin? First - props to the filmmakers making an epic movie with great characters who at first are all strangers however get together for the finale. Having said that the writers chewed more than they could bite, but I will get back to this later. This flick is mayhem due to the CG-buffed explosions and heaps of buildings and cars getting smashed and destroyed.The film's plot is simple, fate of Earth is in the balance between two alien races from planet Cybertron, the Autobots who are the good guys and Decepticons, the baddies. Both sanctions come to planet Earth to obtain an artifact known as the Allspark, which is unknowingly kept by a teenager who has an eBay account titled Ladiesman217.There are three subplots, one is the military special ops team who come across a Decepticon. This crew has a mix of soldiers including Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson who both do awesome to bring the shoot-em-up action between the three subplots. For example when Duhamel's no bs character Captain Lennox get on a motorbike and rides towards a Decepticon and slides on the ground between the robots legs while shooting the baddie robot - classic and popcorn like entertainment. Plus there are comedic sequences including the Speak English Dude, No Spanish plus the emergency telephone goes through an Indian Telecommunications Sales bloke who requests credit cards details and tries to sell a premium service. The second story is the hacker squad led by Aussie glam Rachel Taylor and funny bloke Anthony Anderson who loves yelling at his grandma and has a sweet tooth with donuts which leads him accusing his co-conspirator being guilty in the interrogation room. These two lead the intelligence side of things in the flick. The final story is Sam Witwicky played by Shia LaBeouf who does really well with his comedic timing with the people he interacts with including love interesting by wowwww Megan Fox, the police officer who questions him about whether he is clear as crystal about how his car just stood up and his highschool mate who likes to climb trees. The best interaction really are his parents Ron and Judy, especially Ron who tricks his kid in buying a Porsche while driving literally through the retail car's entrance and exit path. Then you have John Turturro who plays an agent from Sector 7 and Jon Voight as Secretary of Defence.A lot of character right? There plenty more and as mention the filmmakers chew more than you can eat as some of these character mentioned along with the secondary peeps literally go missing either after the finale or in between the third and final act. This is one of many criticisms of the movie - couldn't execute an epic movie due to diving into other subplots more deeply hence causing a few cut scenes which you can notices by the editing team.Having said that this film was fun and popcorn like entertainment. There is a kid who wants his dream car without his plan going caput and finds his dream car at an old junk card yard. The owner of this establishment is none other than Bernie Mac who plays Bobby B - B like Belize, who loves yelling at Mannyyyy and provides solid advice to Sam, ""a driver don't pick the car, the car picks the driver."" This mystical bond between man and machine is illustrated with Bumblebee, the Camaro Autobot who is both funny and electrifying in this flick who plays old school tracks to spice up the mood between Fox and LaBeouf including Player's Baby Come Back. Sam's dad to me the scene stealer in this flick as the old timer who doesn't like anyone stepping a foot on his garden and fits bumps his kid when he sees Megan Fox in his son's bedroom. The battles on the desert or in the mini city where heaps of skyscrapers get destroyed are fun and enjoyable but of course again heaps of roided special effects. There is a smart Armageddon (yes the movie) reference in the first act of the flick, the Autobots trying to play incognito in Sam's front yard, heaps of slow-mo scenes including the chesty lady in blue and Fox's character Michaela who is soooo hot with her 2000's clothing and freckles...let's get back to the flick, when she tells Bumblebee ""You shoot, I drive"" just gives you chills.Of course, the voices of both the Autobots and Decepticons are also to be commended, especially the master voice man himself Peter Cullen, who voices the leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime. His voice is gold and just gives you that gravity you need of a truck who kicks butt with his built in sword - goosebumps. Hugo Weaving also does an equally & admirable job as Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons. I really enjoyed the dialogue between the two leaders, although I would have liked to see more dialogue of the two between their team factions in order to see more interplay.Overall, a great flick regardless if you are a fan of the cartoon or toys, its just popcorn entertainment. A major flaw is not completing the character scenes as mentioned and the editing as it creates issues with continuity. This takes out the fun of the flick. Having said that go watch it moviegoers - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Technically of course of high quality but some more and better work on the screenplay wouldn't had harmed the movie.,"This movie mostly disappointed because of its story. The movie is muddling on too much and for too long. The story would often simply feel as a lame excuse to let Autobots and Decepticons battle and make lots of stuff blow up and cause mayhem everywhere they go. Often events occur without an obvious connection to the other. It was like the story came secondary and the movie was all about it's images. In that regard this movie does not disappoint. I mean, the movie is technically well made and good looking.Typically for a Bay movie, there are lots of characters put into the movie. Some characters really don't seem to serve a purpose at all in the long run, despite their heavy introduction and actors portraying them. I don't think I ever complained about this before in a Michael Bay movie but he now have seemed to have reached a point by me that it becomes annoying, mainly because it's so completely unnecessary and probably also one of the reason's why the movie is about 2 and a halve hour long, though it easily could had been simply a more bearable 2 hours.I'm no Michael Bay hater. Quite on the contrary! But this just isn't his best movie. His most ambitious perhaps, yes. Which perhaps made the movie all the more disappointing to me.Seemed to me they couldn't really made up their minds whether they wanted to make a serious straight-forward action flick, or a more fun and comical like one. The result is an unbalanced mix of these two opposite generic elements.The action is also somewhat disappointing. Yeah sure, it's always cool to see lots of things blowing up in a Bay movie but as for the fights between the Autobots and Decepticons, which is what the movie in essence is all about often; Most of the time you can't really tell what's going on, also because it's going so fast and all you basically see are just 2 big pieces of metal running, flying, firing and jumping at each other. It's also confusing because you often really can't tell who is fighting who at the time.They obviously tried to put in an emotional tie between the human main characters and the Autobots, who are basically being presented as the protectors of humanity. But the whole relationship between human's and droid's doesn't work out very convincingly and effective. The movie feels like there is an human part in the movie and a robotic part. It just never really feels as one whole, as if both were happening in a total different universe. Often the Transformers also weren't given enough room in the movie. Also Megatron (and a couple of the other Autobots and the evil Decepticons) makes his appearance way too late, which does not allow him any time to really shine and impress as the real big main villain of the movie.Shia LaBeouf was perhaps the thing that surprised the most about this movie. I already expected and predicated great things from him after seeing him for the first time in the underrated movie ""Constantine"" but I didn't yet expected him to already completely carry an high budget summer-flick such as ""Transformers"" on his own.Technically there is of course little wrong with the movie. Leave it up to Bay to blow up things in am impressive big, yet convincing way. The Transformers are also all greatly designed, though they perhaps a look a bit too much alike in their robotic forms, as I all previously had mentioned. No doubt the movie shall score a couple of technical Oscar nomination's.I'll most likely watch ""Transformers 2"" but I hope they put some more effort in the story and the flow of it next time. That way it can be the perfect summer-blockbuster of 2009, if it's still being released by then that is.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just an absolute travesty of film-making.,"TRANSFORMERS is a thoroughly depressing movie for all the wrong reasons. I knew it wasn't going to be particularly good, as I am in no way a fan of Michael Bay, but literally EVERYONE I know who saw this film has been raving about all year long. I finally Netflixed it and I'm sorry I did.The original Transformers wave hit when I was in the middle of my teen years, so it pretty much passed me by, but I was aware of the comics and toys (never watched the cartoon). I ""get"" why they were and are huge. If I were a kid, I'd probably love this stuff unconditionally. But maybe I'm too old or too discriminating, 'cause TRANSFORMERS is without a doubt the WORST film I've sat through all year long. All of the ""Sins of Michael Bay"" are here... the obnoxious characters, the migraine-inducing soundtrack/sound effects, the ridiculously over-done explosions, the hyper-editing and the over-the-top schtick.None of it works. What's worse is that most people couldn't see through what a completely lazy, talentless and unimaginative movie this really is. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself, but he's sitting on a giant pile of money thanks to this dreck, so what do I know? Just bloody awful.

short retrospective review 10 years later,"When this little gem first came out, everyone thought it was a pretty cool little flick. But that's about all.With the benefit of 10 years of hindsight, and keeping in the mind that every successive installment has become progressively worse, we now see this as the pinnacle, the high point, of the franchise.Laboeuf and Fox actually had chemistry. In fact, Fox's career more or less imploded with Jennifer's Body, so in many ways this may be the only work she will leave to the historical record.(Also don't forget Fox's famous scene at the 25:00 mark where she opens the hood of Bumblebee to check out the engine. It has now become iconic.

This is NOT a real Transformers movie,"As the title of the film suggest: ""a Michael Bay film, Transformers""Transformers (2007) is Michael Bay's version of the Transformers of which he described as a ""stupid toy movie"" before he was educated about the subject matter by Hasbro. The movie therefore reflected Bay's vision of the Transformers which in ways are different from the original.Apart from that is also the fact that the movie is just a commercial film for the mass market filled with Product Placements.Even with all the effort and brilliance in creating the live action movie using CGI & special effects (which is entertaining to the mass market), the movie really fell short on capturing what should be the essence of the original Transformer characters.As a film it did not do strongly on story telling, creating a compelling atmosphere & developing characters. What it did however was to put on a show of explosion, crashes & cheap humor.Sure the film entertained in terms of giving its audience a cinematic experience with visual & sound (mostly bass) effects but is a good film based just on that alone?Whatever happened to script writing, screenplay, cinematography, directing, editing & complimenting musical score?Is this the way movies should be made even if the audience should cheer & applaud them?As a media of great influence, shouldn't movie makers at least consider what values & messages they are sending out by their creation?When Optimus Prime & his Autobots made up their mind to save earth and the human race, just what kind of a world are they really saving?A world of destruction, a world that sees commercial values above all else and a world whose people view a film like Michael Bay's Transformer something of high regard?Just who are these robots in disguised as the Transformers?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Michael Bay's Transformers is an energetic, hyperkinetic explosive fun. Someone pass the popcorn","This loud, explosive live-action adaptation of Hasbro's popular toy franchise powerfully represents the signature big-budget filmmaking methodology of Michael Bay. It is 144 minutes of loud explosions and heavy metal-on-metal mayhem compiled in a dumb popcorn movie deluxe. Upon sitting through the hour mark, it is clear that Bay does not intend on engaging viewers at an intellectual level. That does not meant this film aborts on deliver an enormous amount of fun. Produced by Dreamworks and Paramount Pictures, This bombastic science-fiction piece sees Michael Bay operating on his trademark visual style, pumping the adrenaline-fueled testosterone through over-the-top explosions and brisk pacing. The outcome is a wild ride flowing with just enough to distract from the sporadically clumsily narrative. This film follows 17-year old Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf), a high student junior who is surprised with a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro by his father (played by Kevin Dunn). What the young man doesn't know is that the car is an autobot in disguise. When the car morphs into the giant Autobot, Sam and his beautiful crush Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) find themselves into in between a war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who are in pursuit of a mysterious cube known as the Allspark, a powerful cube capable opening up a world the afterlife of both the Autobots and the Decepticons. In the process, they must escape from the suspicious law enforcement officials led by Agent Simmons (played by John Turturro).With Michael Bay behind the steering wheel, this movie discards from the elements of the 1986 animated movie, with the first one being the feature of human characters put into the others. The second being considerably less kid-friendly than what long-time fans have been devoted to. This movie takes the violent robot-on-robot action and cranks up a notch in a noisy, explosion-laden galore; in addition to some teen-oriented humor. Nevertheless, Bay knows how to deliver the fun and fulfill the promises of rambunctious action set pieces -- and there is plenty of it. Building are crumbled to pieces, cars are flipped over, and the streets are littered with robotic debris showering everywhere. These sequences are the biggest attractions to this bombastic thrill ride, and manage to stand above all other aspects, particularly the plot. Surrounding the plot involving a hot conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons is a slew of subplots that at times put the story in a little topsy turvy, one involving the government agency pursuing after Sam and Mikaela for questioning on the whole giant robot chaos, another involving Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson in which makes very little sense. Above all, the best thing the writer give the story is that it at least make somewhat sense. But for those who just come in for the action and visual grandeur, the story may likely be the least of their concern. As for the acting department, Shia Labeouf is okay in the role of Sam Witwicky, swarming with cheeky humor and humility. Megan Fox on the other hand, stands out more for serving as eye candy with her sex appeal than for her performance. With frequent lingering shots of her body, this film holds very little restraints for sexualizing her, for better or worse. John Turturro has a few odd laughs in his scenes, but nothing that is likely to raise the eyebrows.Transformers is an explosive action thrill ride bound to please not only fans who grew up with the popular toy franchise (or TV shows), but also most certainly those hungry for a near-two hours some heavy special-effects mayhem. It is loud, it is feverishly energetic, but most importantly, it is a whole of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing special effects cannot totally make up for how disappointing the film is,"Despite some of the negative publicity surrounding it, Transformers was one of the most hyped movies of the summer for me. The trailers suggested it was going to be an all out action-orientated blockbuster, and despite the shoddiness of some of the films in Michael Bay's repertoire, I got pretty excited for it. Sadly, it failed to meet all of my expectations, and left a rather sour taste in my mouth that has lasted for the weeks since watching it.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is in high school, and is desperate to get his own car. He uses eBay and even his own history class to try to hawk off some of his grandfather's prized possessions in the hopes of making the money for it, but seems to be failing on all counts. Eventually, his father Ron (Kevin Dunn) caves, and helps purchase one for him. It runs beautifully, despite some rather strange occurrences in the used car lot, and is just the kind of car Sam has dreamed for. But rather soon after, the car begins to move on its own, and no sooner does Sam realize this when he actually witnesses the car transform into a robot and fight another car turned robot.This is the basic set-up for Transformers, which merges in elements of government intrigue, blatant Middle East war propaganda, epic CGI action sequences, and rather absurd humour, all revolving around the Autobots (good transformers) centuries old battle with the Decepticons (bad transformers), and both of their races' search for a highly technical piece of rock that just happens to be hiding somewhere on Earth.Regardless of any fanboy pressure, Bay created the movie he wanted, and it turned out to be a totally convoluted and mixed bag. Looking away from the basics of the story, it seems like the writers and Bay himself tacked on a bit too much in the way of getting the film from point-to-point like any good highly stylized action film attempts to. Scenes with lengthy hacker technical jargon go on far beyond the point they pine for, and scenes where they attempt to go simply for laughs fall flat on their face as near frivolous wastes of time. I rarely see movies that seem to jog around the point for much longer than they should, but for a master of cuts and edits, it seems like Bay just wanted to add in every idea any writer could have ever had for this film, and just make the film a lot more bulky in its running time than it needed to be. It just begs of needing a qualified editor to tell Bay just when enough is. It ruined the near great concept he had in The Island, and it almost ruins everything here.But the story is really secondary here to the CGI. And does that ever deliver on the promises of the trailers. Every transformer looks sleek and polished, to the point of looking above and beyond realistic. Their interactions with each other, and even human characters is at a level of animation that is rarely seen with mainstream films. Where the likes of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix just has their characters look almost blatantly fake in front of their CGI backgrounds or characters, the animators on Transformers have actually taken the time to make everything look authentic and look real. Half-way through the film you stop thinking these robots do not exist, and start wondering how long it is going to take before you actually see one up close and personal. And that is just looking at them walking around, the scenes with them in battle between each other are even better (even with them being highly stylized edit-wise).The voice acting is all top notch, across the board (I particularly dug the ever reliable Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime yet again, and Hugo Weaving as Megatron). The real actors acting is not as great. LaBeouf does his best to support the robots, and pulls off a fairly decent performance. We have obviously seen him in much stronger roles demanding much more of his acting capabilities, but for the little amount of real acting he has to do here (which does not include the running, screaming or genuine awe at what is going on in front of him), he does pretty adequately. His mandatory love interest, Mikaela (Megan Fox), does about as much as her gorgeous one-dimensional character needs to. The rest of the supporting cast, rounded out by Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro (in his most uselessly over-the-top performance ever) and Jon Voight, all do sufficiently enough, but like all the supporting characters in Bay films, basically serve the function of helping the film move from beginning to middle to end (and of course, help explain the jargon being employed by the extras).But while the film may have its follies, what truly destroys the foundations it successfully employs, is the deliberate product placements scattered throughout the movie. Unlike the cartoon versions of Transformers, almost every single car is a brand name one. Mentions of eBay literally fly through character's mouths, and there's even a whole two minute long conversation about how great Nokia is. I understand the need for product placement, but when the film dwindles on these symbols for more than a mere second, it just shows me how unashamed these filmmakers were in creating this film. If I wanted to see an advertisement for cars, phones, Burger King and Mountain Dew, I would sit through a television commercial or read a magazine.It disgusted me to see just how far Bay and company milked the placements, and to me, stands as the one true killer of everything that Transformers has going for it. Yes, it is a fairly good action film with some amazing effects, but at the price of being one huge commercial.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Foundation Set.,"Transformers was a very good film that I enjoyed enough to watch three times when it was in the theater. It is pretty entertaining and also sets a good foundation for future sequels to be made.Sam Whitwicky has a pair of his grandfathers glasses. On these glasses are coordinates to find the cube, the cube is a cube that is able to give life to machines and turns them into transformers. The autobots arrive on Earth and warn Sam and must have the glasses. Unfortunately the Decepticons also arrive on Earth.I think the effects were outstanding in this film. All of the Transformers in this film looked very real. I like how they gave them a new look, and did not just 100 percent give them the same look that they had in the cartoon. This shows that the director and effects people gave new interpretations to characters.The story was good, not great. But I think that at times it gets a little complicated, especially with the military. Not overly confusing, but a little. Also I think that the film tends to drag a lot, I understand the importance of build up, but it takes a while for all of the Transformers to appear.The human characters were OK. However I think there were way too many human characters that speak a lot in this film. I want to see lots of different Transformers, not humans.Now for the Transformers. I think they included most of the ones they needed to in a first film. Optimus Prime was great as were the rest of the autobots (Jazz, Bumblebee, Ratchet, and Ironhide). The Decepticons were awesome as well, however it was interesting how some of the decepticons were not similar to what they were in the television show. Like how Frenzy was a boom box and Bonecrusher was a minesweeper. The decepticons, other than Megatron, did not get to say much of anything nearly as much as the autobots.The action is OK. BUt when the Autobots were fighting the Decepticons it kind of gets hard to tell who is winning and who is losing. Basically the fight scenes are fast and the Transformers blend together and as a result you have no idea what is going on.Megan Fox was great, I love her assets. Not much more to say on that topic.So this film is very good. IF anything this film set the groundwork, so while it may lack in some areas you know that the next films should be great thanks to this film. I recommend this film and also can not wait for the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I don't know whya you say good Shia, I say it blows. Kinda.","The good news is that this formulaic, high-octane action movie from Michael Bay is pretty entertaining stuff; the bad news is that it feels like it was directed by a semi-retarded spider monkey on crack. Jarring visuals, incomprehensible fight scenes, and overblown special effects are at least somewhat mitigated by appealing performances and, of course, state-of-the-art CGI.In this remake of the 1985 film that was spawned by the cheesy cartoon series, evil robots have arrived on Earth to reunite with their leader, Megatron, who came to the planet a couple of millennia ago in search of the Allspark, a box of something or other that will enable Megatron and the other Decepticons to rule the universe! Only Megatron crashed into the Arctic and froze. Well, as much as a robot can freeze; he was merely paralyzed. Meanwhile, the good-guy robots from the same planet, the Autobots, have tracked Megatron to Earth, also in search of the Allspark.Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf is an awkward teen who's trying to earn money to buy his first car. Of course, since he's awkward and somewhat smart, we know he's the hero. And we know who his enemies are, too, because they're the ones who laugh at him. They'll all be sorry! They're not too sorry when Sam's first car turns out to be a beat-up yellow Camaro, although they might be a little bedeviled when they find out the car's really an Autobot.It's up to Sam, his new galpal Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), and the U.S. Army to somehow defeat the Decepticons, who will stop at nothing to find the Allspark, even if it means exterminating all the ant-sized humans. Luckily, Sam and company also have the Autobots on their side, and a showdown of giant robot versus giant robot is ON, brother.One puzzling problem with the movie is that the Autobots don't show up until a good half hour into the film. I guess this was to establish the all-important Sam-Mikaela relationship, which naturally will eventually blossom into something bigger. Because, of course, the dorky guy always gets the hot chick, even if he has to defeat giant robots to do it. But it's true, presenting the backstory of the characters before showing us the Autobots does add a more human aspect to the film; otherwise it would be just a big, violent robot-versus-robot extended fight sequence. Wait, it was that anyway.Michael Bay movies are not immune to clichés; they revel in them, exploiting them to complement the loud pyrotechnics. Or maybe the loud pyrotechnics are there to distract us from the inane characterizations and dopey plot. In any event, how many movies have we in which an intern/trainee/cadet is the only one, out of literally thousands of experts, to solve the problem? How many have we seen in which someone working for the forces of Good manages to sneak something secret out of an otherwise-secure facility? On the other hand, this was one movie in which the military is actually competent; where the guys with guns know what they're doing and aren't the shoot-first, ask-questions-later types? That was surprising, and amusing.And I realize this will confirm me as a cranky old man, no matter my chronological age, but what was UP with all of the loud music? Every scene was shot as if it were a crappy heavy-metal video, circa 1986. Grating guitars turned up to eleven on the volume control drowned out some dialog and a lot of sound effects, such as robots doing robotic things. Add that to the hyperactive zooming, panning, and scanning, and this is certainly not a movie that an epileptic should ever watch.Nor is it a movie that young kids should watch, in all honesty. Transformers is rated PG-13, but it's pretty violent; the only thing that's lacking is actual blood. People get blown up, smashed, crushed, and shot by robots, and it's pretty intense stuff. So be careful when bringing little Timmy to this one, unless you want to put up with a week of nightmares and nocturnal enuresis.

I'll Drive you Shoot!,"Transformers is from the director named Michael Bay. He is well known besides for Bad Boys, The Rock This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes sadly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative side ward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this.Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing.

A recipe for mediocrity,"I loved the first 15 minutes of this movie. Unfortunately, the film didn't end until almost two hours later.Here was the recipe: start with fifteen minutes of interesting character development and mysterious robot attacks. Next, throw out all efforts to deepen character development in favor of moving the lame plot forward. Next, bring in several unnecessary and uninteresting characters (the blond computer hacker and her black friend) to confuse things and take up time. Then, make the audience wait for the action by adding unnecessary attempts at humor (i.e. the scene at the boy's house and the addition of the John Tuturro character with Special unit 7 or whatever it was called). Finally, be sure to fill the remaining time with cool shots of the transformers transforming and shooting things (which were good I must admit). The audience will be awed by the special effects and won't realize what a poor movie they've just seen.By the way, how is it that one robot could destroy an entire outpost earlier in the film but a whole fleet of robots couldn't hit even one marine later on? Those guys must have trained at the G.I. Joe headquarters to be able to dodge so many bullets.This movie started great but quickly transformed into a sub par action film with shallow characters and little plot.

Dazzling effects cannot support a feeble plot,"We are far beyond a time when special effects alone could carry a movie. Unfortunately, that's what they have tried to do here.A weak plot full of one-dimensional human characters leaves barely any room for the Transformers fans went to this movie to see. Terrible designs aside, the robots had little character and practically no dialogue to speak of. The plot itself is simple enough to follow, and yet somehow they still managed to leave it chock full of holes and loose ends. A pointlessly long and drawn out introduction leads to a rushed and underwhelming ending- and If you're hoping to see any epic robot battles, you had best not blink during the movie.There were some humorous scenes mixed in, but most were tacky and some were downright insulting.Overall this movie was a huge disappointment, even for someone going in with no expectations.

"Entertaining, but still lacking in places","I went into Transformers expecting to see a childhood memory butchered into a mass appeal CGI fest. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not so, and the movie had me well entertained almost the entire way through. The cast was good and likable, even though the script had some seriously dodgy dialog in places it did the job, and the Tranformer effects and character designs themselves were well realized.The main problem I had with the movie was the way the Transformers were treated as side characters to the human cast. The characters I remember were reduced to mere CGI set pieces with little personality, and most only have a few lines of dialog and are only introduced briefly towards the middle of the film.I also am not particularly a fan of the way Michael Bay directed the more hectic action scenes, with the camera shaking all over the place.

Good and Bad but never Ugly,"Transformers, for me, is a film that veers somewhere between the absolutely spectacular and the cringe-worthy, the predictable and the plain bad.First of all, the good things. Transformers, in all likelihood, contains the best action sequences that you will see all year. They are as bold and exciting and as crazy as anything in Michael Bay's career. The opening assault on the desert base is fantastic and the final forty five minutes that takes the action from the Hoover dam to the very heart of the city is sustained on pure adrenalin.Alongside this, if it doesn't pick up awards for its effects come Oscar season it will be a crime. There's a fantastic sequence in which Optimus Prime transforms before our very eyes in near slow-motion and we get to see every piston and bolt and panel twisting into shape. For that alone it's breathtaking. Similarly, the Transformers are as real and believable as King Kong was eighteen months. If Peter Jackson was rightly lauded for breathing such humanity into a giant living breathing ape, then Bay should be afforded even greater credit for the enthusing his giant robots with such lifelike traits and dignity. My only complaint would be the lack of Megatron until the final thirty minutes!As well as this, there is a performance that stands out as well. Although much attention has been drawn to Shia LeBeof (who I shall reluctantly come to later), the real standout, for me, came from Josh Duhamel. Admittedly he didn't have his limits stretched in the role of Captain Lennox but what he did have to do he did extremely well. Perhaps the biggest compliment that I can pay him is to say that he reminded me of a Terminator/Aliens era Michael Biehn. A piece of casting that Bay no doubt intended but, nonetheless, Duhamel pulled it off charismatic aplomb.Unfortunately, there is little more positive that I have to say. For whilst I thoroughly enjoyed Tranformers whilst Bay was doing what he does best, the whole film is let down by a lacklustre script, weak two-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy attempts at humour and a crushing level of predictability.We've simply seen Transformers so many times before. I mentioned Aliens and The Terminator earlier on but this movie stomps on narrative territories that have been de rigeur in modern blockbusters since Independence Day. That is not to say that Bay has ripped anything off but simply that there is very little original here. Multiple narratives that pull together to include geeky boys, attractive and seemingly unattainable objects of affection, computer experts who are ignored, US military overwhelmed by higher civilisations (apart from a single hardcore special ops unit of course) and shady Government organisations kept secret from even the highest ranking politicians. Transformers is a positive melting pot of modern blockbuster clichés.Duhamel aside, the casting doesn't particularly help either. Megan Fox simply seems to be included to satisfy the audiences objectification needs, the heavyweight Jon Voight simply coasts his way to another paycheck and Bay shoehorns in every single African-American stereotype into the roles occupied by Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac. Whilst it is always a pleasure to see John Turturro on screen, you could practically see his tongue protruding from his cheek in almost every single scene! As for Shia LeBeof, I am mystified how his star is rising so quickly in Hollywood. I'm all for studio's moving away from the bland leading clones of the early 00's but he's like the terrifying result of genetic experiments of Corey Feldman's pickled liver. An irritating smart-ass who here appears to be regurgitating his performance in Constantine.Which leads nicely to the films biggest problems. The script. Oh dear. Right from the offset the script hums with a mixture of cheese and sleaze. If I were a cynical man, I'd argue that half of the reason that the action is so effective is simply because we have been aching for Bay to show some mercy and shut the characters up! LeBeouf and Anderson are prominent offenders but the characters of Ron and Judy Witwicky are by far the most grating. Intended as comic relief no doubt but ultimately an embarrassing instrument of torture. Like the Levensteins dumbed down and living under the Witness Protection Scheme. One can only presume that any sequel will have Alyson Hannigan returning from band camp to win Sam back from Mikaela!Indeed, it's the moments in which Bay is trying to be self-consciously funny that really grate. There are some humorous exchanges that genuinely do work (""I'm gonna count to five""... ""I'm gonna count to three"") but when Bay steps out of his comfort zone the results often induce uncomfortable seat-squirming. The extended sequence in which the Autobots ""hide out"" in the Witwicky's back garden is the case in point. Heavy-handed, laboured and below even cartoonish. Transformers is, unfortunately, riven with such moments.I left the cinema last night with the same mixture of satisfaction and disappointment that I felt when I watched King Kong. There is a lot to enjoy about Transformers and if you are looking for big, dumb fun then this film ticks all the boxes. However, be warned, there is a lot of dumb, not-so-fun, small talk to wade through too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great Action Film,"I always thought Transformers seemed like one of those franchises that wouldn't transfer well onto film. This actually transfered pretty well. By no means is it perfect, some names have actually been changed, and some of the Transformers' alternate forms have been changed, (most likely for legal and copyright reasons). Those minor changes don't really harm the film at all.The Special Effects is what makes this movie a great action film, you are aware that these are giant robots, so you know it's special effects, but they move so fluidly and blend into the real-life setting in which they've been placed, that it's hard to not forget that they aren't real. I do wish that they made the Transformers a little more character, you get that there are GOOD and EVIL but you basically only get that because you're told who's evil or good. The film relies on the Human's perspective of the situation, not really the Transformers. Some more character development for both the Decepticons and Autobots would have made this movie A lot better. I do realize that sounds weird, but the movie is called Transformers for a reason.This is Mr. Bay's best film in my books.7 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lame attempt disguised as a blockbuster,"While I know I'll get wailed on for this especially since its my first comment, I have to side with the haters on this one. I like so many others grew up in the 80's watching and loving Transformers. And when I saw that the movie was coming, I actually didn't have high hopes. With everything else that we loved as children being reinvented, revamped, reworked, retooled, reloaded, rehashed, and any other words that describe something wonderful being fed into a wood chipper then spat back onto our movie screens, this was no different than those three Wolverine plus ensemble films, or Willy and the chocolate factory. This movie could have been so huge, and everyone else other than me and my sister raves about it. I suppose I was immune to the LSD in the Pepsi. What film did they watch.This is supposedly an action film that somewhere gets sucked up in a tornado and lands into a bad comedy. Practically every scene is laced with moronic jokes. The plot tries to focus on way to many non sequential characters. Am I watching a movie about robots? About military guys fighting a scorpion? About computer hackers? An American Pie teen sex comedy?Shia Lebouff comes off as your typical done a thousand times teen underdog who is shy, and socially inept, yet gets the hot girl anyway. The girl comes off as very slutty to me for some reason. And the chemistry between the two just isn't believable. The girl's dialog is tedious at best with lines like ""They know your name"" yeah thanks I caught that 2 seconds ago when they said it.The Transformers themselves are sad shells of their cartoon versions. The transformations themselves while cool are very confusing, many of the robots are similar in color scheme and you loose track of which one is which. I'm not even entirely sure what Megatron transformed into.....a jet of some sort? He was always a gun or a cannon in the show.Basically if you loved this show as a child and don't get swept up by the hype and the thrall of ""Its transformers, so I'll love it no matter how bad it sucks"" mentality, you will hate this movie. You'll spend your entire time cringing at masturbation jokes, and peeing Autobots. Personally I think the taco bell dog joke was pretty bad, that social reference has been dead for years, let it go.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best of the series,Transformers 2007 is where the movie franchise should have began and ended it had the makings of a good stand alone film but money clearly motivated Michael Bay. That being said this movie is really good sure they changed all the designs for everyone's favorite alien robots but the CGI was really well done for them and they looked really cool. The actors did fine with what they had to work with and that's okay it is still a good movie. Overall I think they should have stuck with the G1 designs because those are what most fans are familiar with but we got that with Bumblebee so I can't complain too much over all good entertainment.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Terrible, terrible film!","I can't fathom how anyone gives a film like this a 9 or a 10...but, then, I can't figure out why people enjoy Jerry Springer or went to the theatre to see The Dukes of Hazzard.This film passes the most important test in Hollywood which is to make money. In that sense, it's a success. The problem is, that's the only parameter that seems to matter anymore.The story is weak, which can be forgiven since it's based on a children's series. But there are issues with the story and characters that any mediocre writer could have handled. The film couldn't decide if it wanted to be for kids or adults, or somewhere in between. The movie starts off as a typical Michael Bay project with lots of action which keeps it interesting. When the Autobots finally show up, the film degrades into a miasma of adolescent lameness with robots speaking in ""characterizations"" that are stupid, unrealistinc (even for a film like this) and annoying.I can enjoy a mindless popcorn movie. I had fun with Armaggeddon. This is the worst film I've seen in a very long for more reasons that I can even get in to.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
VIsually stunning and funny..,"I have a lot of nostalgia coming from this flim ever since I watched it as a kid. I mean giant robots that could transform into vehicles and planes was just awesome to think about it.Solid story with some minor flaws but was surprisingly thematic at times and had some funny cultural tropes. Though the writing could be a bit cliche and cheesy at times. The characters were decent though they weren't deep or anything they were likable and they had their own quriks and personalites. The visuals is probably the best thing about this flim. The cinematography and the camera work was really good also. The music was decent and the sound choices were lovely especially when the transformers transformed into their main mode.Overall an enjoyable film. Nothing special or anything crazy, a recommended watch.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Noisy Mess,"I was, as a youth, deep in the prime years of Transformers. I owned them, I played with them, I watched the show avidly and was 11 years old when the first ""Transformers: The Movie"" came out. It is with some sadness I report that Michael Bay has tarnished my fond memories.The movie had such great potential; the action, art direction, the characters, the powerful themes of humanity and triumph over evil. Bay mangled them all. This movie suffers from many critical flaws which result in it being simply a bad movie. No character development is created for the title characters: The Transformers. We never care about their battle, we simply watch it. This leads to the next problem, with the exception of the Scorponok scene, there is no suspense or interest. Big machines just trade gunfire. If I wanted that I could play the video game - and at least be involved. The action is either too fast to see or in Bay's trademark groan-inducing slow motion. The Transformers take too long to transform, there's way too many moving parts to make it even believable, and the film makers lose track of what they should be doing (telling a story) and instead focus on fancy lighting and excessively complex noise.Please let someone like James Cameron, who can direct technological-oriented films and not lose their heart, direct the sequel.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fun, silly, entertaining. Unleashed my inner child!","I feel very sorry for those many people who jumped on the bandwagon of hatred towards this series and forget how outright enjoyable the first movie really is.A simple story of a boy getting his first car, only to discover his car is an advanced alien robot in disguise! He finds himself caught in the middle of an intergalatic civil war between the noble Autobots and merciless Decepticons, and Earth becomes the battlefield.When Michael Bay stepped up to direct the first live action interpretation of the 1980s cult cartoon Transformers (yes, I use the word ""cult"" specifically) there were some groans and doubts. But think about it, what does he do best? Explosions and cars. What does Transformers constitute of? Explosions and cars. Under the executive producer eyes of Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks Studios, Bay's outright silliness is restrained and this film actually feels structured. This comes from some decent acting from/direction of Shia LeBeouf as Sam, regular boy who wants to win the affection of Megan Fox's Mikaela. It takes a good forty minutes before the action takes off and our planet is bombarded with thirty-foot tall talking robots. As a fan, my inner child was (and still does) itch with anticipation! This is the Transformers mandate, heck it is in their motto: Robots in Disguise! We see Bumblebee, Sam's guardian, as a regular car... the film knowingly holds off showing us transformations for as long as possible. This makes the reveal of all the others, especially childhood cartoon hero Optimus Prime, incredible to see!You have to understand. As a kid this sort of thing, showing real life Transformers, was only a thing of dreams, the technology wasn't here until this movie. This film glorifies the act of these regular vehicles changing shape and continuing on their way. I still get some chills as Starscream swings around, leaping into the air and transforms.Another thing this film achieved is often overlooked now. It was a massive success. I mean a massive success. Not only was it nominated for Academy Awards for special effects (and was robbed in broad daylight, The Golden Compass, seriously?!?) but Transformers was always a geeky, disrespected cartoon even at its height (sorry fandom, but it was) and this film broadened the franchise's influence tenfold. Everybody loved Bumblebee, for example, and learned how people like me respected Optimus Prime as a character. It was wonderful! So many newformed fans appearing everywhere. Even my sister enjoyed it! If you are one of these people and in denial of your initial feelings towards this film, I feel very sorry for you. There is a huge number of fickle-minded people out there.Is it perfect? No. Michael Bay still has some influence, though not a great deal, and there are a handful of human characters who do not belong. The story takes unnecessary detours and bypasses just to include human characters who could have been cut completely to make a sharper film. Does it detract from the film as a whole? No. Yes, there are suspensions of disbelief, yes it is silly and the climax is a myriad of explosions but honestly! This is Transformers! For a first try at making something so ridiculous as this cartoon a living, breathing film, this hits it out of the park and lays a good foundation for improvement. Sadly, for this film (not unlike The Matrix) its sequels do their best to avoid improvement...It is a fun, entertaining action romp. Exactly what Transformers was and should forever be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Popcorn Cup Overfloweth,"Michael Bay has sunk a small flotilla of his Pearl Harbour demons with the high-octane, CGI-laden, robopron that is Transformers.Sure the fanboys will bore us all to the planet Tedium with their critiques of the minutiae and demand some sort of supreme interplanetary justice that the Camaro gets redrawn as a VW Beetle in the Director's Edition DVD-set with Limited Edition Lube Dispenser. But for most of us, who gives a flying box of bananas? The film successfully treads that fine balance between kids-own-adventure-that-will-sell-gazillions-of-toys and popcorn actioner explosive enough and well scripted enough to have the more discerning set checking in for the ride.Armed with a rudimentary knowledge of the Transformers mythology and an increasingly underwhelming view of modern blockbusters (Spidey 3 and Pirates 3, 300, most other 3's, your number's up), I turned up to the film with low expectations but left eagerly pecking stuff like ""best CGI eva"" and ""Shia's gonna rock it as young Indy"" into my handset.Though not quite perfect: the goofy Sector Seven team dragged the middle act into high camp territory and the hacking team seemed to get totally lost in the flying climax debris, such flaws only mildly tarnished the metallic sheen of a masterpiece of metal-shredding mayhem. Let's face it, who doesn't drool over squadrons of A-10's pounding searing rounds of whatevernium-tipped shells into 50ft robots, it's bloody great.Oh and you may want to start updating all your home cinema components to HDMI.

Impressive,"Since the new Transformers movie is coming out soon, I thought I would re-watch some of the old ones. I had forgotten how awesome the first Transformers was. I hope Transformers 4: The Age of Extinction is at least AS cool as this movie. Some people rip on this movie because it is too impossible. The only thing I have to say to that is it is not supposed to be realistic. If there is a movie that has giant robots that can transform into cars and planes and trucks and back again, you should automatically know it isn't going to be realistic. But once you get past that, it truly is an awesome movie. The special effects were amazing, considering that the movie was made 7 years ago. The special effects people really did an amazing job on this movie. In fact, they paid so much attention to detail, they even made the Transformers blink, move their teeth, and even breathe, I think. However, because they were robots, it was hard to read their emotions. That doesn't bother me, though. The acting was also great. It was a good idea to have the Transformers have different styles of talking and behaving. In a way that made them seem a little bit more human, and you feel sympathetic for them when one dies or gets hurt or injured. The actual humans in the movie were very believable characters, and you feel for them as well. Everyone in the movie did a very good job, and kept the movie fun to watch. I always look for that in a movie. The story was somewhat taken from the 1984-1987 TV series, but it was still kept original in some ways. I haven't seen the series, so I can't really expound on that. Sorry. Although, the story was kept very entertaining by the writers, and there were only one or two dull moments. Michael Bay did a wonderful job directing this movie, but there was one thing I had a problem with. I don't know if it was his idea or the cinematographer's idea, but the camera was way too shaky in some of the battle scenes. There was too much going on to have a shaky camera like that, and that is the reason I give it an 8/10, because there is way too much of it. But if you are OK with shaky cameras, you will enjoy this movie 100%. Probably. Hopefully. Maybe. You might. Anyway, the dialogue was good, too. There were no bad jokes, no dull speeches, and nothing else of that sort. That's really all I have to say. I hope you found my review helpful, and feel free to check out my other reviews.

I find it ridiculous,"Still I can't rate it below 5 stars. If you went for the story, Transformer wouldn't be the best choice -- the structure is loose, I don't understand why Mr Voight would choose to be part of this film, the way the film narrative treated the US govermetn is just a satire -- stupid defensive team, listens to a soldier's opinion. It felt like bits and pieces been put together. I suppose its due to the fact that the film's an adaption from the comic strip. And Sam's parents -- why are they there?! And the omnipresence of the teenagers'-sex-comedy feel really bugs me and makes me laugh.On the other hand, if you went for the visual and sound effects, the film has brought the ""human technology"" up to another level -- which kind of makes me look forward to Harry Potter the 5th actually.Summary : Not satiable.

I feel like playing with Transformers toys after watching this,"As a kid I didn't know that Transformers is a set of toys. I only used to think that it is an anime series. The first time I learnt about the movies was when one of my friends got a Nexus tablet to school and played this movie when there was no teacher in the class. I really liked the opening scenes and decided that at some point I will watch this movie. Little did I know that the opportunity will come 8 years later when the lockdown would happen. I watched it and enjoyed it very much.Transformers is exactly what I wanted to watch when I used to see the terrible anime. I didn't like optimus Prime very much back then but in this movie I understood why he is so important to the franchise and now I am a huge fan of Optimus Prime. There were so many other Transformers whose names I got to learn as I watched this full staff I used to see this movie in parts on TV and I used to think that Bumblebee was Hotshot. After watching this movie I was feeling like replacing the the logo of my car with the Transformers logo.All the Transformers movies have very good CGI, cinematography, choreography and colour grading. What the other movies lack in, however, is a good story and acting. This movie has all of that. I really wish all the other Transformers movies were also like this. Here I cared about Sam, the army guys and of course, Mikaela (°""U""°). This is one of the only two Transformers movies which actually has a good plot (the other doing bumblebee).If the future Transformers movies had built up on what this movie created they could have actually been very awesome. But instead they focused more on creating a bigger universe with more cars and more merch to sell rather than on character development.

"Entertaining enough most of the way through, but certainly not great","Okay, I'm pretty much of the generation to which this film is aimed. I was a kid when this show was on the air. I wasn't a huge fan myself, though. I was more of a He-Man kind of guy. I only barely remember watching Transformers. My parents were unwilling to buy me the toys because they were too expensive and they broke easily during their transformations. I really wasn't at all interested in seeing this movie, except maybe on video to see how bad it was. But I'd heard a lot of good word-of-mouth reports and my friends wanted to see it, so I caved in. A one word review: Meh. A little more: it ain't terrible, certainly a lot better than I expected. The film sustains itself with a beleaguered and just plain weird sense of humor that, if not hilarious, is undeniably amusing. In general, there's just too much going on. There are like fifteen different plot threads. The story isn't too hard to follow and mostly makes sense, but a lot of it could be cut out (for instance, the second most important piece of female eye candy, Rachael Taylor, and her hacker buddy played by Anthony Anderson). The action is quite fun most of the time, but the giant final battle has so much going on that it gets more than a little difficult to follow. I might have actually given the movie a passing grade if not for the quick and unsatisfying final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Transformers is pretty close to being worthwhile, but in the end it's too big , exhausting and disappointing to really recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Self Indulgent Piece Of Bay-Mania,"Michael Bay is the amalgamation, the collective whole, the personification for everything, the entirety, the complete set of what is wrong with modern day cinema, and still movie goers lap this schmaltz up and make ridiculous claims built from ignorance that films like these are the ""greatest movie of the twenty-first century"" and some even have the gall to claim it ""best movie of all time"". For many I can appreciate that film is entertainment, that it is pure escapism, it's a place where you can sit back, unwind, drink your beverage, scoff your food and turn off your mind for ninety-plus minutes, however for people like myself whilst cinema could and should be entertaining, the entertainment doesn't always have to derive from tripe which can only and from hence forth be described as ""Bay-Mania"".So what does this newly devised term mean? How is it applicable to Transformers? Well in short, I shall explain. Michael Bay is the type of director that produces grade-a cheese on an epic scale and Transformers falls foul of his mature cheddar touch. All of his films, barring possibly the original Bad Boys, have the same generic feel embedded deep within them, where it becomes almost like the Pixar film collection, same story, different animals. So within Transformers the (new) movie, we have the autobots taken from their quaint 1980s setting and placed in the manic action packed world of 2007 as they search for an object which, apparently, holds the fate of the world, and of course those evil decepitcons are after them. The Transformers themselves, well, they're a touch on American muscle side, big, colourful and brash, pretty much everything you'd expect from Bay-Mania. The special effects used for them is pretty staggering and there are some genuine moments of severe coolness emanating from quick-fire transformations which appeal to the kid within all of us, but unfortunately people become too obsessed with the look of a film and not the feel, and herein lies its major fault.Typical Bay-Mania suggests that by sacrificing the storyline for special effects you can 'wow' audiences into an unknowing submission so that they go along for the ride rather than connect. This is atypical for most summer blockbusters, but even the first Spiderman film, and indeed the Batman 'prequel' managed to grasp the audiences attention with character development which made their stories rather unique. When your main protagonists however, are fifty foot mechanical entities whose personalities are predefined by comic book conventions, it's difficult to associate yourselves with them. Also the humans that become further associated with the autobots are far too generic, i.e. nerdish guy who 'believes' in the autobots, attractive female who tags along but has a great deal of knowledge over cars, standard American marine with sense, and politicians and generals without sense. The story meanders along from one 'cool' transformation to the next and eventually builds up into an all out frenzy in which thousands of extras, we daren't use the term people in a Bay-Mania film, are quite literally caught up in this mass free-for-all as one by one they all scream, run around and get trampled on, or hit by huge ten foot tow missiles. It's all harmless computer generated fun, but to be honest, I want more from a film these days.People brandished Spielburgs name around, from his seat in production, citing that he would make sure this would be an ""awesome"" film, but it doesn't work like that these days, as even he succumbs to the sirens call that is the over indulgence in CGI over plot. So what does transformers bring to the film medium? Nothing, not a jot. It's inoffensive fun to a degree, despite all the jaunty unnecessarily confused angles in the fighting sequences, but a mere firework display of a film isn't enough. It's films such as these which have convinced the mainstream movie going masses, that this is acceptable, that this is what we should want to see and what we should aspire to create and critique, and I'm sorry but that's just not acceptable. Michael Bay represents all which is wrong with Hollywood, and that's profit over prolific, money over mesmerising, more revenge of the sith than return of the jedi, and what only infuriates me more is that Hollywood allow him to continue, and now I hear they're going to remake The Birds? No doubt there'll be eagles transforming into giraffes, and needless car chases as the heroes are hunted down by ten foot tall pigeons. I digress from the film at hand but this is what you get from Bay-Mania, unnecessary genericism, and for those that enjoy this film, you're the ones only furthering his narcissism.

A terrible fx  movie from a truly talentless director  2/10,"This film was a disaster. A mess. Unwatchable. The worst direction of a movie since the Island. I don't know what I enjoyed less, this or the Star Wars prequels.The script was non existent. Confusing--stupid. Not even the writers of the cartoon show would have stooped to a level as mentally challenged as this. It wasn't even tongue in cheek or camp. It was just bad writing. Shame on the screenwriters--though is suspect the director had a lot to do with it so let me save my venom for him...The fx: yes the compositing of cg into live action was very good--not as impressive as Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean but still very good. Unfortunately, the direction was so rotten as to spoil the sense of awe you might have expected from it and the fx sequences. For one thing--these 10 ton machines ran around like..well, 8 inch toys. They were hiding under bridges, stumbling through backyards without making impact tremors, basically reduced to a joke. Truly. There were very few moments where they behaved like actual gigantic machines. But who cares right? Its fantasy. OK well then give me great action sequences. But they weren't great. They were confusing and poorly edited--so much so you could hardly stay focused on the action.This is why Michael Bay deserves a kick between the legs for being such a failure as a storyteller. Above all its his fault(and Spielberg's for urging him to do it.). If I go to see a movie about giant fx monsters, I expect bad writing, even bad acting, but I want to see cool action scenes if nothing else. But he directed them like he did the Island, confusing, choppy, constantly moving cameras that didn't focus on the characters long enough to stay absorbed in the moment of the story.The only irony in the film is that when i heard about it I thought it was like Small Soldiers in reverse, so it was amusing for half a second to see the father from that movie playing the same role in this one. Small Soldiers was a much better movie.Masters of the Universe 87 was a better movie. The animated cartoon movie better (and that is saying a lot). I actually wish it was as good as the first Jurassic Park--which had a lame story and weak dialogue--even that was genius next to this.Its a shame someone like Paul Verhoeven couldn't have made this--he knew how to do an action sequence and if he was going to throw humor in it would have been more sophisticatedI give the film 2 points. 1 for the fx and the 1 for the casting of Cullen as Optimus Prime (even though his design was an eyesore and he didn't behave in a very dignified fashion).I read somewhere that Bay used to work for George Lucas and when he heard about Raiders of the Lost Ark he dismissed it as a ""toy movie."" Well Bay really showed that he knows how to make a movie as if he was a 3 year old playing with a camera. This was one truly infantile movie.A big budget Hollywood movie at its worst.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Uncle Sam Wants You (to See This Movie),"I was actually slightly motion sick after leaving this film, so my final impression of it is somewhat marred by that, but overall this was dumb summer fun at its best. I was the right age for the transformer toys, but I never really got into them. However, having played with them is not a prerequisite for enjoying the film.These kind of movies crack me up. They are so obvious in their intentions to traffic in the gut emotions of an audience not used to thinking very critically about what they are watching. This film, like most of Michael Bay's films, is a gussied up military recruitment ad, the kind where all of the soldiers in it are muscled and oily, and where they do a lot of walking toward the camera in emphatic slow motion. There are girls in the film (two of them, to be exact), but they're basically just guys with breasts and nice legs. The government is to be feared and distrusted, because they keep secrets from the American people (like the fact that the Hoover Dam was really built as a facade to hide alien robots and their belongings), while the military is heroic and manly. To make itself feel relevant, the film even throws in some action scenes set in the Middle East.It was refreshing, though, that for once all of the chest-thumping is not reserved solely for the United States, but rather for the human race in general. The message in ""Transformers,"" other than that geeky teenagers have the stuff soldiers are made of, is that the human race isn't so bad after all, even if we have a lot to learn.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Love those Transforms..,I love this movie so much it makes me smile when I think about it. (whole childhood memories)!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mindless entertainment,"I'm always a bit on the defensive when it comes to making movies about things i remember from my childhood. Mostly i guess because my memories are probably not that accurate, and in the case of ""Transformers"" i was also mostly interested in the toys and not so much the comics. What made me watch this was mostly the fact that a lot of things were actually changed from the ""old"" Transformers. Especially the look was completely different, and i guess more adapted to live action as opposed to the cartoon-look.And what did i think? Well, after watching this movie i was happy i did. I have always been a bit of a sucker when it comes to really nice-looking movies, and this is definitely one of those. It's no surprise though since it's Bruckheimer behind the wheel. He might be about as subtle as an earthquake, but he does deliver the goods when it comes to high-octane action. And it doesn't get much more high-octane than huge robots fighting it out in the middle of a city. Also Bruckheimer has started to get his stuff together now. Previously i thought he was probably the worst budget-waster in Hollywood. And i guess in a way it's true, but he still seems to get a lot more out of his money today than a few years ago. The 150 million dollars they sunk into ""Tranformers"" gave them what is arguably the best special effects i have ever seen in a movie. And as far as blowing money goes, that is a decent deal.And what about the rest of the movie? Well, i guess that is where you might object. Aside from the effects there isn't much of a movie left. There is a little love story here which is cute in a ""80's high-school-movie""-way, but other than that it's mostly just action all the way. And lousy comedy. That was my main complaint with this movie actually, the lousy comedy. There is in particular one scene that shames the whole movie. It's the lowest form of silly comedy with huge robots reduced to clowns. A real mood-breaker to say the least. Also one of the robots has clear Jar-Jar Binks-tendencies with silly noises and moves.In the end though this movie is all about the robots, huge ones. They fight, they transform and they talk and scream with deep voices. There are a few truly huge scenes here, not least the battle scenes in the desert in the beginning of the movie. I would have liked more time with Starscream and a deeper story, perhaps based more on the comic. But in the end this is a huge blockbuster the way one of those are supposed to be. And as long as you don't think too hard about it, it's mindless entertainment at one of it's best.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Complete crap,"Honestly, was this the best they could do with a huge budget, computer animation for the robots and people like Stephen Spielberg on board? Where do I begin? First the robots... the CGI is neat looking but the robots themselves are over designed and look like they were drawn by Louis Wain. It is very hard to distinguish one transformer from another unless they are changed into a vehicle at the moment, which makes the quick moving battle scenes a confused mess where you sometimes find it hard to know who is on which side.Next, let's tackle the plot. You have a very thin and contrived (not to mention cliché filled) plot which wouldn't even have made a very good comic book story. Very disappointing indeed. They could have come up with something more interesting than a weird cube and a frozen evil robot found by some obscure arctic explorer 100 years ago.Finally let's look at the characters and their interaction and development. For the transformers themselves, you know very little other than they are robots and the some are good, some are evil. Some turn into cars, others into tanks or jets. You get no background on them at all and unless you have seen the 80's cartoons, you have no idea who they are and you really don't get to know these characters during the movie. While many people might remember them from the 80's cartoons, a little more background would be nice for the younger generation who missed out on the 80's altogether.As for the main human characters, there is little to redeem them. They are poorly acted and are mainly there to scream and tremble as robots battle around them and destroy the city they live in. Sam is a complete loser who is sadly trying to win the heart of a girl (Mikaela) who is way out of his league and looks more like someone who constructed in a plastic surgeons office than a real girl. Why does every movie today involve a couple who is either separated and hate each other or in hopeless crush situation that you know will not last past the adventure? You just don't have normal kids in films anymore (though Sam comes the closest). The are either super crackers who can break into the pentagon while typing with their toes, modified to look like pageant models or have some mysterious figure in their family history that destines them for some great adventure.The movie is poorly executed with CGI battles one moment and a sickening crush on the hot girl scene the next. The characters are shallow and have few it any redeeming qualities to them. You find yourself wishing they would get killed no matter who comes out the winner among the robots just so you didn't have to put up with the slow and boring scenes of the boy trying to make it with the plastic girl. In the end the movie becomes just one big smash fest, which while fun to watch, is ruined by the length of time spent griping about how annoying the human characters are. Once the real action starts, you are just ready for this crap bomb to be over. 1 star, and that is because they had so much potential and came up with such an empty movie in the end.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Transformers""-  Surprisingly fun and breezy compared to it's over-bloated and under-written follow-ups.  Still a great, entertaining treat nearly a decade later!","One of the most fascinating franchises in the world of modern cinema has got to be director Michael Bay's near decade-long cinematic opus known simply as the ""Transformers"" series. Inspired by the classic cartoons and toys of the 80's, the current line of feature-film releases is quite something to behold... Four films with a fifth on the way next year to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original film. And all four having been massive hits financially, bringing in billions in revenue. Yet all four have also suffered from consistent and even growing disdain from not only critics, but from general audiences as a whole. Every announcement or trailer for the latest entry is instantly met with rolled eyes and exasperated scoffs from film-goers the world over. It's what makes the franchise such an interesting one... They are so frequently dismissed and ridiculed, yet people keep going back to them with each new release.And I do think a big part of why this happens is this film, 2007's ""Transformers."" Because it was such a surprising Summer-time treat upon initial release... it was just good, plain fun and it won many people over with its quirky sense of humor and grand visual scope. So no matter how many follow-ups of exceedingly low quality they pump out... no matter how many missteps the franchise takes with each and every sequel... no matter just how terrible some later films have turned out... we all keep paying for our tickets and popcorn when the newest entry is released, in some hope that it will recapture even a fraction of this film's splendid sense of entertainment value.The film starts with the sort-of classic tale of a boy and his car, as teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) gets a yellow Chevrolet as a gift. However, he soon discovers that his car has a life of its own, and belong to a race of shape-shifting alien beings from the planet Cybertron. These aliens have split into two factions- the heroic Autobots lead by Optimus Prime, who Sam's car Bumblebee follows... and the dreaded and vile Decepticons. As it turns out, the Decepticons are tracking Sam, having come to learn that he inadvertently holds the coordinates to an ancient device known as the ""AllSpark"", which they are seeking at all costs. And so, Sam and his massive crush Mikaela (Megan Fox) must team up with Optimus and the Autobots in order to keep the Decepticons from getting their hands on the mysterious AllSpark device.The film is very much an exercise in pure escapism. From the cheese-fest opening monologue to the thrilling but overlong climax, the film never loses sight of its goal, which is to entertain first, ask questions later. And I think that's a large part of its success. This is not a film that wants to bog itself down on complex characterization or sublime story development. If there's a scene of characters talking, there's going to be a joke. If a robot is on-screen, there's going to be a fight. And thanks to a solid enough script and Bay's trademark kinetic directorial style, it works very well. There's hardly a dull moment to be had, the human characters are all instantly identifiable archetypes, the robotic characters are just a ton of fun, and the visuals are all too often stunning. You'll be shocked at just how perfectly realized the Transformers are in this film, especially for a mid-2000's release.Beyond that, I found the cast to be fairly charming as well. Despite his public downfall in recent years, LaBeouf shines as Sam, giving him a wonderfully awkward social sensibility and a great physical performance. He really is quite engaging as our human lead. Fox is obviously here more for looks than personality thanks to Bay's constant oggling of her character, but I actually thought she did a halfway decent job here. The film may treat her as little more than eye- candy, but I think there's a little more going on with her than many will give her credit for. Supporting roles by the likes of John Turturro, Jon Voight and Anthony Anderson are all a ton of fun. And the voice-over rolls by a cast include original cartoon alum Peter Cullen and the wonderfully insidious Hugo Weaving give a great deal of depth to the animated characters on-screen.Look, ""Transformers"" isn't going to win any major awards. It's a popcorn movie at its heart and it knows this and celebrates it with each passing moment. And while I could drone on and on about the faults that are present, it wouldn't change the fact that I got a huge kick out it. I love it. And I still watch it here and there, even ten years later. While the subsequent sequels that followed have been of a generally sub-par quality, it doesn't change the fact that the original is a fantastic, breezy bit of good fun.And so, I give 2007's ""Transformers"" a very good 8 out of 10. Pop it in. Shut off your brain. And get ready to have a good time!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Good,"When I first heard that Transformers was going to become a live action movie my first thought was ""Oh no, How will they ruin this one?"" After seeing the trailers i decided to go see and was extremely surprised. The story/action ratio stayed in a good range with just enough story to keep the movie entertaining and enough action to keep you wanting more.Though I have to say some of the plot holes can easily be overlooked, some just stand out. Not downing the movie just the people who made it. I have to say the characters were done so well I almost believed that they were real and not just CG. Bring back the original voice of Optimus Prime just sent this movie over the top. I highly recommend seeing it if you haven't already. Its not as bad as the other reviews show it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you haven't seen this movie, don't vote ten. It really really sucks.","Pardon me if this review comes out as somewhat unorganized. It's just that all of my thoughts are currently jumbling together because of how bad this movie really is.This is by far the worst movie of the year. It's bad, even for Michael Bay. Whoever said earlier that the action shots were full of too many zooms, kudos to them because they are right on the money. My friend nearly puked a little when they played music from ""Kill Bill Vol 1"" in it. Another problem I had with it was that it kept changing from day to night at random when it was obviously a continuation of the same scene. John Turturro was highly miscast in the movie, as well as Jon Voit. Please, don't waste your time. It's awful. It makes me ashamed to be an American. ""The Triumph of Will"" was a Nazi propaganda movie that brainwashed millions of people into believing that the Nazi's were fighting for a just cause; that's still not half as bad as ""transformers."" I even refuse to capitalize ""transformers"" because it is so rotten.PS - QUIT RATING THE MOVIE TEN STARS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers is a perfect action/sci-fi flick that everyone needs to watch before they die!,"In all honesty, I completely forgot how epic and perfect of an action/sci-fi this movie was. I'm not a huge Micheal Bay fan yet this movie wouldn't have been the same without the madman. Every mechanical lash, every technological pulse fed that little destruction craving demon inside from chaotic (and momentarily perplexing) yet captivating action pieces featuring flawless CGI that crossed the line between digitally animated creatures and pure flesh made man. Shia Labeouf performance was ultimately scary for how exceptionally realistic and convincing he built the character of Sam. Furthermore, every role was perfectly acted; both actors and actresses actualized a plethora of characters whom felt formerly grounded in this world before the plot called for their aid. In light of this, the dialogue was creepily faultless and featured the naturalism that comes in arguments, fearful conversation and disagreeable banter. Moreover, the comedy was on point and didn't try to be anything it wasn't, withal it depicted the messy reality which is humor between several voices. The pacing this movie planted was endlessly aggressive with little to no breathing room but it was brilliant; assisting the 'end of the world' concept to a near perfect standard and always keeping the audience on their feet with no blunt moments. In pair with the stunning, picturesk visuals delivered from the anamorphic lenses, Steve Jablonsky's godlike score conquered the science fiction aspect this movie so desperately reached for and undoubtedly achieved. However, not to be fooled, this movie featured a wide variety of plot holes and awkward tangles that tears from the piece of art it is. My biggest gripe being Sam's and Makaela's underdeveloped relationship that required only a fraction more screen time to further captivate. Nevertheless, in combination with all it did well, especially with the addition of the astronomically incredible, jaw-dropping sound design; Transformers is a perfect action/sci-fi flick that everyone needs to watch before they die!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Worth the admission, but leaves a lot to improve","Personally, I give Transformers a rating of 7.8 -- high enough for a movie that is intended to entertain. Michael Bay's shortcomings persist, but it's still well worth the admission.Best plot layouts and dialogs are within the 1st hour, most of which I doubt are Spielberg' efforts, not those of Michael Bay (MB for short). Top-class sitcom jokes except the Chris Rock-like cliché performed by Antony Anderson.The quality goes downhill from where good robots hide from the parents. Lengthy, repetitious, with too few punchlines.In the fight in the last third of the movie, MB's usual weaknesses go abound.Superfluous, childish heart-warming dialogs and background music (reminds you of Peal Harbor. Did MB read too many ""Washington cut the cherry tree"" stories?). Contrary to the 1st hour, multi-threaded plot lines begin to scatter here and there. And don't forget the meaningless slow motion takes.But this part edges out in special effects. The ensemble is not too sloppy, compared with camera manipulation of his previous works.As a whole, it's a must see, but leaves a lot of room too improve.To me, MB is a 2nd-class director. There's must be something missing in his character,unable to judge ""what's to be left and left out in movie composition."" I wish this film would have been directed by James Cameron, Steven Spielber, Tony Scott,or even Ang Lee. MB probably will never be on the same level of the above-mentioned great directors.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Grown up CGI with a little kids script,"I'm an 80s kid and almost everybody I know was excited about this movie coming out. Who doesn't love giant fighting robots? Michael Bay's website has an awesome t-shirt available, it's black and says on the front ""Giant F-king Robots are Coming."" A movie like that doesn't even really need a script.What it needs is one single minded direction in all aspects of all movie production and promotion. Based on what I saw from the previews, I thought it was going to be a revamp of a cartoon, shooting for the 13-31 male demographic with lots of action to boot. With that it mind it did an excellent job updating the look of the transformers and the way they fought to satisfy anybody with ""OMG Giant Fighting Robots"" in mind when they walked into the theater.However, as I was enjoying this movie I kept on being slammed back to earth by unnatural dialog, weak character motivations, and a superficial character arc. Some of the scenes stuck me as odd and conflicting while watching it, but it didn't hit me until afterwards that the script wasn't bad, it was just meant for kids. If you're looking for the next Terminator 2 this isn't it. Every character has one purpose and is obviously striving to get it once it has been narrated to the audience. This is summed up perfectly when Sam (Shia) says ""Okay, I got a car, now all I need is a girl"" or something to that effect.I have also heard people complain about John Turturro's character pointlessness within the movie and must agree that he is pointless within a ""grown-ups"" script. Almost every single kids movie has some good character in authority who impedes progress of the protagonist for really no reason and eventually comes around. It is someone that needs no explanation to kids because they already know what's gonna happen and what that character is about even though it made me feel unsatisfied.Same thing can be said about robot hiding scene. The silly humor there in definitely reminds me of characters in an animated children's film, especially so with the ""lubricating"" scene. While the scene is overly long for my tastes it would be an important scene in a kids script helping them to identify who are good guys and bad guys almost immediately.This movie is not bad, and definitely has some action sequences worth seeing on a bigger screen. If you're looking for well polished script that has intriguing characters to back up that action you'll find it lacking. I gave it a 6/10 for what I was expecting, though I think if it had been pitched as more of a kids movie through the trailer and buzz I would have been able to overlook what I didn't and enjoyed it more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The start of the Transformers franchise,"In 2007, there was a movie that premiered on July 3rd, 2007 in theaters. This movie was Transformers. It was the first live-action film made since the animated series in the 80's. The director is Michael Bay, who previously worked on films such as Bad Boys.The story is the Autobots and Decepticons are searching for an artifact called the Allspark that will save their planet. The Autobots wish to restore their world Cybertron while the Decepticons wish to destroy Earth. Humans are left in the middle of this.Bay had a view in mind for this first film, and it was big explosions, eye candy and superb CGI for the Transformers.The characters introduced in this first one are Shia Labeouf, well known for that kids TV show Even Stevens and Holes. The eye candy is the gorgeous Megan Fox, who I had not heard much of until this movie. Josh Duhamel plays the commander of a group of survivors after a base attack. Another cool thing is Peter Cullen, who was in the animated series voicing Optimus Prime, reprises his role again as Prime.The acting is very good and the background characters like Shia's parents create a sense of humor that will have people laughing every time they appear on screen.What makes this movie great is the Transformers themselves. Bay focused a lot of his time to them and did an amazing job with their transforming.Transformers is an amazing start to the franchise and does follow up to several sequels which I will do reviews for as well. Definitely everyone should give this a chance especially if you were a fan of the animated series like me. Check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie you want to like more than you can.,"Since this film is directed by Michael Bay, I went in expecting it to be terrible. And it wasn't terrible. Just sloppy.The strongest element of this film was the story line. The pacing is very nice, and with the exception of the opening sequence dragging on a bit, the film flowed exceptionally well. Unfortunately there were many flaws in the script that really brought down the quality of the film. The most noticeable problem was the dialogue. You have to feel bad for actors when they are given lines drawn from a hat, which get used over and over again, and have to make them come out naturally. A lot of the dialogue seemed forced and unnecessary. Many of these lines could be simply cut, for the words say things that we already understand the characters are thinking or feeling. There were also secondary plot lines that were introduced and not sufficiently wrapped up. The stories of some characters were left up in the air.The characters also were greatly underdeveloped. The only human character who the audience begins to care about is Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Everyone else is, simply put, just there to push a wheel-barrel. The Transformers draw more sympathy from the audience, which may or may not have been the intention of the filmmakers.Shia LaBeouf does stand out among the cast. He has a great deal of talent and is excellent in the film, considering what the script gave him to work with. Hopefully this will open the door for him to do some really promising work in future films.Anyone who studies film knows about the reputation of director Michael Bay. He has a knack for being flashy, focusing all of his attention on the look of the film. In this film, he continues to show that he has a hard time giving actors helpful direction, as well utilizing an effective array of shot selections. He seems to not understand the idea of motivated shot selection, where the tone of the scene dictates what shot should be used. Not every angle of a character needs to be a close-up, which Bay always overuses. This is unfortunate, because if he could have progressed his directing skills, this film could have been very special. But with so much attention on creating a flashy, CGI driven spectacular, a good story was left misunderstood.As for the special effects, a lot of effort went into creating the Transformers and the action sequences. It does look very nice, but in my opinion, the CGI seemed to be a crutch to hide otherwise poor cinematography and principle photography. The images seem to detract eyes from very unrealistic lighting. There was also a noticeable discrepancy between the CGI and effects done in photography (i.e. some explosions, debris, etc). The filmmakers obviously could not destroy downtown Los Angeles, but it seems very clear that the structures were in a completely different layer from the CGI. Maybe I am a stickler, but this made the film seem even more sloppy to me. The impression is that principle photography was rushed just so the robots could steal the show in the end.But technical stuff aside, the film is largely enjoyable. There is a great deal of humor (some fitting, some pointless) to keep the audience entertained during the ""slow"" portions of the film. And like I said earlier, the storyline keeps the audience at attention as well. And as far as epic Science Fiction films go, Transformers is able to stand the test of time. The idea of aliens being at war with aliens, and Earth is caught in the crossfire, is an idea that has not been exhausted like many sci-fi themes. It is a fresh take on the ""interstellar war"" story.To conclude, the average movie-goer will likely enjoy this film at face value. Those with a more intense eye in film making will undoubtedly have a lot of criticism. But for me, this was at least the most enjoyable film by Michael Bay thus far, and I have to say that I am glad that I saw it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A cinematic Hindenburg,"Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3, and Fantastic Four 2 were all terrible, but in comparison to Transformers they are each a Citizen Cane.

Stereotypes: two sassy black grandmas; an Hispanic whose Spanish annoys the WASPs; a dumb, aggressive high school jock; the transformer named Jazz is presented as an American black (jazz music = black, apparently).Cheap, sophomoric humor: teenage masturbation; dog peeing on transformer; transformer peeing on man; ""can I ride you home"" instead of ""can I give you a ride home.""

Who keeps letting Michael Bay make movies?,"Well, as a long time IMDb user, I've always come here for generally fair and even reviews on films. Normally you get the general ups and downs reviews and I find most movie web pages give an accurate representation of what to expect. However, after anticipating this movie greatly, and seeing the rave reviews on IMDb, I eagerly set out to the movie theater with a few friends.I could barely contain my laughter during the most serious parts of this film. Never have I seen a plot so butchered by poor directing, and even WORSE dialog. There were two aspects of this film that I liked: 1) The transformations. Watching the robots morph back and forth between vehicle and killing machine was absolutely incredible. The CGI was impressive. 2) Shia Labueff gave a very good performance.The rest of the film was awful. The plot is filled with holes. And the never-ending unnecessary small plots are confusing, unnecessary, and often left unfinished. The action sequences were always on the BRINK of being cool, but then would stop or cut away before you saw anything. The robots fighting to closely to actually see the reality of what they were doing to each other, and the needless shrapnel, smoke, and fire often obscured what could have been some epic fights. The needless plugs for BOTH political parties and views on Iraq, and one for one of Bay's own films were disgusting. Characters whom play significant roles rarely are given a name, and only 1 of the transformers(prime himself) has anything beyond a three scentence dialog. Most simply shout things like ""Want of piece of me!"" or ""I wanna blast him!"" However, if I had to sum up this movie in one word it would be Cliché. Bay manages to use EVER cliché I could imagine. They range from the clichéd high school movie: a 27 year old high school juniors who is a jerk to his girlfriend; A sociology teacher who doesn't like his job; an eccentric mother who says awkward things in front of her son. To the flag waving army movie involving marines who ""just want to see their daughter for the first time,"" or like to ""remember weekends,"" to whom 'losing isn't an option.' All the way down to the stereotypical overweight African American, who shouts things like ""stay of my gramamas floor,"" and enjoys eating donuts. The list goes ON AND ON AND ON.So, I IMPLORE you, wait until this film is out on video to see it. Save your 10 dollars.

Another franchise ruined,"If you want a short review of Transformers here it is: it's a loud, badly written disjointed mess of a movie with a nonsensical plot that ruins yet another potentially good franchise.So what? Well that's pretty much Michael Bay's reaction. If you read his biography page he defends himself in two ways which I'd like to address in relation to this movie.He's made a lot of money. That's his first point. Well, yes but you'll notice that most artistic people don't make a huge amount of money and when they do they generally don't see that as being their primary motivation. This movie has made a lot of money from 13 year old kids because that is who Hollywood markets their films to. In fact if you spend enough on marketing it's virtually impossible to lose money on a film, though obviously it does happen from time to time. If you went to the cinema ten years ago you'd see people of all ages enjoying the spectacle of the big screen. Now you only see kids and their weary looking parents because there's virtually nothing for a discerning adult to enjoy. This brings us to point two of this hacks justification for creating drivel like this.I make movies for 13 year old kids - big deal! Yeah, in fact it is a big deal because takings are now down 20% and it's part of a consistent pattern over the past ten years or so. The more you alienate the adult market by making crappy PG13 guff like this the narrower the market becomes and the more you have to pander to their taste.People like Micheal Bay are poisoning Hollywood for everyone and if people disagree bear in mind that you aren't 13 forever, your taste will become more complex and there will be literally nothing to see at the cinema. Hollywood would like to pretend that their abysmal takings are down to piracy of their product and to some extent I'm sure that's true, but the main reason is that the films on offer are generally awful and if you get stung by a few utterly awful movies in a row you have little motivation to keep going to the cinema.In short he's an idiot and so are the people who only see cinema as a financial concern. It's an art form, we go to see art and this is about as far from art as you can get. It's not even financially viable in the long term because the people most likely to pirate movies are teenagers.In short, it's moronic crap like this that is killing cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh....Not Bad but not Great Either,"You get the impression that the word ""cool"" was uttered many times during the making of Michael Bay's port of the TRANSFORMERS TV cartoon to the silver screen. After seeing the trailer a few times before other features and reading some reviews, I'd have to say my expectations were met. I saw it with Code Monkey (ex-work) and Ken (work) at Hoyts Melbourne Central. We grabbed some pints of beer at the Lion beforehand, during which Code Monkey revealed the Transformers T-shirt lurking beneath his office attire. That was a funny moment  in a good way or bad way, Ken and I aren't so sure yet.On to the movie itself, well, there is a lot of CGI animation that is too fast and busy for its own good. Often I couldn't figure out what was going on because the action was just too fast and choppy, thus defeating the purpose you'd think. Code Monkey explained his theory on this syndrome to me on the train coming home and it seemed plausible enough: audiences are not given enough time to analyse the action and perhaps see flaws, so they just assume it kinda makes sense. Whatever the deal is, you know by now it's a pet hate of mine. It is a pity, because in many sequences the animation and special effects really are convincing, even beautiful. The story and characters are more problematic. For starters, TRANSFORMERS takes a long time to get going. Related to that point, we don't hear the Transformers themselves talk until the half way point or later. From then on the narrative flows better, since the machines take on actual personalities, albeit totally one dimensional, but at least we get some motivation and basic exposition. Then again, the interactions between the humans and the robots suddenly becomes awkward, plus you have ridiculous moments where massive hulking killer robots can't snatch a little box off a wussy teenager who is more than likely still a virgin, fer chrissakes.As with most of Michael Bay's movies, some of the supporting characters (human and non-human) are amusing. And once again for Bay, his military types are for the most part cardboard cutouts: either steroidal Neandertals, humourless top brass, or lovable rouges. Also, this is yet another action picture that depicts violent scenes but avoids any bloodshed or one-screen deaths  any nastiness is rapidly blurred from sight by something computer generated flying past. So there it is. Heavy on spectacle, light on logic, with a few chuckles, and some female eye candy to enjoy for the blokes. A bit more restraint (or less caffeine, speed, cocaine, steroids) on Michael Bay's part could have turned this into a great blockbuster. Oh well. Bring on DIE HARD 4.0, which was apparently censored before release. Why bother at all if it's not going out with a US R, like the previous three DH movies?

"Big-budget movie, and money does its job.","Great entertainment value. For the first part of the movie, I thought it's gonna be a bombardment of actions, car chase, and bombing, but it has turned out okay in the storytelling part as well.How the screenwriter utilizes autobots is very smart. They are not just sidekicks or tools for action. They are heroes themselves with charming characteristics who protect humans and communicate with humans.

Fun Family Film,"While the film caters to an audience of teenage boys, it was quite entertaining for the whole family. The visual experience is like nothing else. The CG transformers blend flawlessly with the natural environment and the actors making it enjoyable even for adults. Because the film relies so heavily on CG the action sequences are a bit hard to follow because of there detail and speed making it difficult to really see what happening, especially if you see this film in a theater not using digital projection technology.The story is fun, and the humor is appropriate for all ages. The film solves the problem of what to watch when Dad wants to see ""Die Hard"", and Kids want ""Ratatoille"", sorry mom...""Evening"" is next door.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Balance of action and humour,"This film is exactly what you'd want in a Michael Bay blockbuster. There is a better balance of (crude) humour and exciting action.

Absurd.  Ridiculous.  Insane.  Utterly Outrageous.  DON'T MISS IT.,"A special military outpost detects an aircraft that's way off course. Two leaders on the team, Sergeant Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are present with the troops to greet the aircraft, which by military record, crashed and burned some time ago. All havoc breaks loose when this aircraft reveals itself not to be what it appears. When most of their unit is wiped out in the resulting assault, the sergeants are less concerned about making a report to superiors and more concerned with making it home with the other survivors in one piece. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, fast-talking high-schooler Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf--in just about every movie this year) is prepared for an important rite of passage. His dad Ron (Kevin Dunn) has agreed to buy Sam his first car. However, Sam somehow settles on a beat-up yellow Camaro, not realizing that there's--ahem, ""more than meets the eye"" to this car.Okay, let me start by saying that this is very much a Michael Bay film--and as such, we know what to expect. (See the title) Grand doses of horrendous dialogue. Extreme twists in logic. Editing that would make most of us run screaming to the nearest kung-fu flick. That's all here, but it's far from the point. THIS is a summer movie in the way we've come to expect! High action, incredible pacing, and way cool music played very loudly. Bay channels a little David Zucker as well--there's some dead-on, rapid-fire humor that's actually funny! Note Lennox's frustration as he runs across tech support in India in his attempt to contact Washington. The one-liners we'd expect from him are also accounted for, but he has wisely stocked the cast with a who's-who of expert one-liner delivery personnel. (LeBouf, Gibson, Anthony Anderson, and John Tuturro to name a few.) Of course, the center piece of the film is the Transformers themselves, who are a sight to behold. I grew up on every incarnation, from TMS to Sunbow to Mainframe and beyond; and while I'd often say ""That's cool"", I knew in my brain of brains there was no way to make me believe cars and planes were capable of such transformations. Now Digital Domain has shaken hands with Industrial Light and Magic and...well...let's just say I'm now in the market for a car, and I'm going to scrutinize those puppies VERY closely. You needn't be a fan, you just need a desire for solid summer diversion. If that's what you want, roll on out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Good Time,"A lot of people have problems with the Transformers series, including the running joke about the crazy amount of explosions. Critics savage this entire series, and just look at the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. There are two opposing sides for the Transformers line, that being the standard movie audience, me and you, and the critics. And these two sides just can't seem to get along. The point of these movies is to have a good time, and that is exactly what I did when I watched this movie. Now, I do agree with the critics in some certain areas, such as the more than obvious tie-in with Hasbro, some critics saying it is just a glorified Hasbro commercial. I can agree with that, but does that really matter?First off, I do have some problems with Transformers, certainly. One of which being the run time. It is hard for a movie to stay very interesting for 143 minutes, and for a while in the middle it got rather stale. The variety of the camera tricks and action sequences can be considered at least somewhat lacking as well. That's for sure. Also, the camera work can be somewhat annoying at times as well. It was clear what was being attempted, but the execution was just a little off. Shaky action scenes and heavily repeated camera tricks can get a little old sometimes.But never mind that, I'll move on to the good stuff, which was much more abundant. Most important, the movie was fun. That was what it should have been, and that is what it was. Big explosions, big action, and lots of fast-paced, adrenaline-filled scenes. The CGI was a big part of this, seeing as how it was near flawless. It's difficult to make giant alien robots turning into cars and back multiple times look real, but, there you go. And honestly, maybe that's the only redeeming quality of the movie. Acting is par-level, script has shaky legs at times, and the rest of the movie is generally average. But the insane action scenes and purely amazing cinematic rush, to me, is deserving of an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
wow - thank god for CGI,"first of all, i would just like to say this could very well be the WORST movie made in 2007. EVERYTHING (well, almost everything) was complete crap: the horrible - HORRIBLE script (ex- the extremely painful scene in the boy's bedroom, with topics ranging from masturbation to a random hot girl), shitty acting from EVERY actor!, the stupid celeb cameos which ended up detracting from the movie, etc...however, were it not for the BEAUTIFUL - GLORIOUS - STUNNING CGI visual effects, i would have given this movie a 1. sorry - it just didn't strike a chord in me - i'm honestly confused as to why it received such a high rating among fans!but back to the effects... i haven't seen the golden compass yet but its effects must have been a gift from god for them to have won the Oscar! (i'm sure they're not and i bet money transformers had better effects. i think the problem in the end is that the movie in general was so darn bad. at least the golden compass was a movie based on a popular book and didn't make everyone want to throw up in their seats)that's about all - i hope if you haven't seen the movie yet - you don't... unless you want to see one computer-generated miracle after the next",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Cool way to start TRANSFORMERS,"I do my film review of the TRANSFORMERS movie franchise and I am going to start with the first installment of the franchise, released in 2007.The film follows Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery.The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth.The film was developed in 2003 and the film went into production in 2006 and it was released on July 3, 2007 and the film was really amazing when I first saw the feature film and I was impress to see the Transformers on screen and I really did not know what they were until I went online and found out more about them.The CGI and action sequences were amazing and the Autobots and the Decepticons were really created well with the help of computer-generated imagery and the final fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron is my favorite action sequence in the Transformers film released in 2007.My favorite Transformer characters are Optimus Prime, Bumbleebee, Jazz and Ratchet. Peter Cullen does the voice of Optimus Prime and he does a great job. Mark Ryan does a really great job as Bumblebee. ""Family Matters"" actor Darius McCrary plays Jazz. Robert Foxxworthy plays Ratchet and they are both amazing in their performances. Hugo Weaving from V FOR VENDETTA and THE MATRIX TRILOGY does a really great job and it is amazing to hear him as Megatron.The human characters are also great. Shia LaBeouf is really good as the lead, while Megan Fox is really hot and is amazing and she was the right choice to play the love interest of Shia LaBeouf and the two on-screen together is really amazing in this film. Tyrese Gibson is real cool. Josh Duhamel is really amazing too. Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor plays their parts really amazing in their performances and the screen time they have.Steve Jablonsky's score is really amazing in this film and I really enjoyed Linkin Park's song, ""What I've Done"" and I loved the music video and their other two songs from the other two films, ""New Divide"" and ""Iridescent"" in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon and the song by Imagine Dragons from Age of Extinction is called ""Battle Cry"". I liked that song, too.Overall, TRANSFORMERS is a perfect movie by all means and I am giving this an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could have been so much better...,"In my books, it's never a good thing when the special effects (or a teaser trailer not set to release for another half a year) are a movie's strongest point. Still, I found it hard not be in awe of how realistically the Transformers were realized by the CGI team. Aesthetics have to count for something, right?Outside of that, 'Transformers' mainly struggles to intrigue. The basic story is a race of alien robots search for a powerful relic that landed on Earth years ago, which culminates in Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting the evil Decepticons to save mankind with the help of a teenage boy and a small assortment of other humans.What failed the most? The script was so atrocious that it's as if the screenwriters knew the only way to keep the audience's attention was with shtick rather than engaging dialog. A movie doesn't have to be funny to be fun, which an action/adventure flick should be. Yet most of the humor was inappropriate for the mood of the scene and lent little to nothing to story or character development or an all around fun time.And the director, well his name is Michael Bay. Enough said there.Unfortunately, Bay's best talent, action, was a mixed bag. At times it was great popcorn fare, complete with explosions of epic proportions, lots of guns, and of course the impressive Transformers themselves. At other times though, the pacing was odd, destroying any tension that had built up. I also found it hard to tell exactly who was who and what was what when the Autobots and Decepticons were fighting, a sentiment I've seen echoed by other users, which is not a good thing for a movie that so clearly defines good and evil.All in all, I would have liked to see a new script, a new director (come on Spielberg), and more development dedicated to Transformers not named Optimus Prime or Bumblebee (this movie is called 'Transformers' right?) and less to Sam and Mikaela's blasé relationship. Yes still, this is a huge summer blockbuster, so I suppose expectations can only be so high. It's just disappointing that Hollywood feels it must water down something that could have been so cool.6.3/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a BAD movie,"First of all, the movie was not bad. It was a little slow in the beginning. The special effects were all pretty much in the previews. What I didn't understand, was why Herbert Hoover was brought into the storyline? Did Michael Bay stop to realize that we didn't have the technology to move Megatron from the South Pole to the United States in those days? Heck, airplanes barely existed. Also, what is the deal with that City that the battle took place in? It sure as heck wasn't Las Vegas, Nevada! If you go from Phoenix to Las Vegas you go right THROUGH Hoover Dam. Also, remember when the Decepticon's activated and said ""All Hail Megatron!""? It seemed like only 10 minutes before they all DROVE from various parts of the globe and ended up at Hoover Dam. Shame on you Michael Bay! You should have used shots of Las Vegas if you were going to use the CITY as a battleground just out of Hoover Dam!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great action movie,"I remember when I first saw this movie and I absolutely loved it and thought it was best movie ever but I was 8 years old, now that I'm older I've noticed there are some problems. The plot could be better even though I like it, the humor is sometimes cringeworthy and some of the human cast (Sam's parents, John Turturro's character...) is sometimes annoying but it is still really enjoyable movie. The CGI and the action is pretty amazing, autobots and decepticons are both great and Shia LaBeouf is also good in this movie!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't really expecting to see anything very good when I started watching this movie on TV. After all, it was based on a line of action figures, so I didn't think I would enjoy it enough to continue watching. But I was very surprised by how quickly it drew me in, and kept me in the action at all times, with never a dull moment.Although the plot seems a bit out of wack to me, everything else is very well-done. The acting is great, especially by Shia LaBeouf (also rest in peace Bernie Mac, who had about two minutes of footage). The special effects and battle scenes are really well done, and there are a lot of captivating subplots that all eventually tie in to the main plot seamlessly. The movie's suspenseful at times, action-packed at others, and downright hilarious also.So overall, this is a good movie, bordering on great. I just think the plot needed a bit of touching up. So if you get the chance, go ahead and watch it, you won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie!!!,"The premise is absurd because it lacks any reality and it is not possible to realistically portray the characters.With that said, it is entertaining and endearing. You actually did feel for the good transformers and there was a good amount of good and evil portrayal to keep me interested.This certainly isn't a great movie but it is definitely not a bad movie.It's a fantasy movie for kids and adults alike. Something an adult and child could see together and enjoy.I wish the family was more in the plot and I would have like to see more of his father.Some of the action was difficult to watch on a smaller screen.Some of the action was not easy to follow and the plotting was not well laid out in some areas.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Now the duration time the movie is a pretty long movie the movie storyline keeps you occupied so u cant even tell that the movie is long well overall i give this movie a 10 and that it was the best movie for the year of 2007 and i hope that the sequel is going to be great as well this movie is the best.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
worth your while,"so before i saw it i heard how amazing it was for all these different people. it was a good amount of people too (including the never wrong IMDb) and nobody said it was bad, nobody said it was OK, nobody even said it was pretty good. all i heard was that it was OMG AWESOME! i had been wanting to see it since i came out so i waited over a week to see it and these comments only fueled that fire....so i went into the movie theater two days ago with very high expectations. i was thinking that it was going to put the matrix and lord of the rings to shame, that it was even going to pass 300. being the idiot that i determined the movie before i even saw it. i had this fantasy in my head that no movie could live up to. and because of that, through no fault of the movie, i was disappointed by the action. and I'm not saying that the action wasn't enough, I'm not saying that this movie didn't give me goosebumps a few times, I'm just say that its not that jaw-dropping action extravaganza that i built it up to be in my head....on the flip side of my disappointment in the action, i was pleasantly surprised by the comedy in this movie. i had no idea that this movie was going to be so damn funny. everyone is talking about how all these other movies have been this year but i think i laughed more at transformers than i did at any other movie this year. i know I'm probably going to have people disagree with me here, but i think this movie if funnier than knocked up or even almighty or any other comedy I'm forgetting....the story was very implausible, but who wasn't expecting that with transformers? the acting and visuals helps u forgive that anyways. this is the kind of movie where u don't ask questions, u just enjoy the amazing things your seeing and hearing....Shia LaBouf comes out of nowhere and comedic genius with his delivery and timing...the robots look as real as they can get...and the actions sequences (although less abundant than i would've like and filmed in a way that made me feel as if i couldn't see anything) were the kind that made u lean forward and shout ""WOOOooo"" or ""DAMN!""....my only problem with this movie was that the Transformers really took a backseat to the humans involved. the only robots that really got significant screen time were Prime and Bumblebee. there seemed to be one too many story lines; Sam's was the only one that really seemed necessary. i would've liked to see more robots instead of Anthony Anderson and that blonde girl he was running around with....they left it wide open for a sequel and i have no problem with that. this movie is all about explosions and jokes and a sequel isn't going to ruin anything....i hope that in the sequel i could get to know the transformers other than Prime and Bumblebee...other than that, rock on ;)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much less than meets the eye,"I don't think this really needs yet another review, but I feel duty-bound to do my bit to offset the totally undeserved 10-stars given by so many persons apparently with no taste, or else involved with the production.This is unquestionably the worst Michael Bay ""film"" I have ever seen. It makes some of Uwe Boll's stuff look Oscar-worthy. Perhaps it is the combination of Bay and Spielberg which resulted in something much worse than either could have managed alone. Mr. Spielberg, the king of schmaltz, has his stamp all over this one.I guess the bad taste came from Mr. Bay's side of the family. I found the ""Bros before Hoes"" line to be downright offensive. And robots peeing on people. What is this, Scary Movie 5 or something? Absent plot, lame dialog, vomit-inducing camera-work, rotten acting, this movie has it all, no need to seek out a Uwe Boll film.On the plus side, Megan Fox is pretty easy to look at. Too bad she can't act.Oh, and the CGI isn't too bad. Must be where all the money went.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow! Outstanding Action adaptation of Retro Cartoon.,"I watched the original cartoons as child in the 1980's and i was always hooked. When I heard that there was going to be a big screen movie based on the cartoon I thought dreams had been granted.This movie ticked all the correct boxes. Great action sequences, effects, story, music and laughs as well. There were so many moments that stood out and the comedy also enhanced the film.I thought it was a surprise that Shia LeBouf had been cast as the lead character, all i could remember watching him in the children's programme Even Stevens. I did not expect him to pull off his role, he did not look like the stereotypical hero, he excelled and handle the delivery of his lines superbly, especially one liners. A brave and well casted. Well done Shia.Everyone will enjoy the film, it has everything for everyone and the pace is well suited. An awesome and well executed piece of work from Michael Bay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Best entertainment of the summer: Light on the brain, but all in good fun","Is anything in this movie ""more than meets the eye""? Certainly not. If there's one thing Bay is good at it is delivering the goods up, front-and-center, with no subtleties but also no restraints. Is this necessarily a good thing? Not when he's trying to direct something that is supposed to have any sense of seriousness, such as Pearl Harbour. But on a movie like this, anything goes: I mean, it's about giant alien robots from outer space who have come to do battle on Earth. That pretty much opens almost endless array of doors to Bay's disposal, and of course doesn't leave much room for subtleties. This film's characters are flat but believable; the plot is implausible but not ridiculous. Somehow it all comes together and works in the long run.I give credit to Spielberg, though, for setting the overall tone of the film and ultimately restraining Bay. Quite unlike his previous ""epics"" such as Armageddon and The Island, Transformers unfolds with an always-vigorous sense of light-hearted fun and adventure. The film has many cheesy moments, but never does it get preachy nor kitschy, and for Bay to have avoided such obvious opportunities to sneak in that kind of nonsense, I salute the picture and the producers involved that prevented a moment such as Bruce Willis' sacrifice at the climax of Armageddon. This never-serious tone comes across also in the sly and razor-sharp sense of humour, which I thought was absolutely hilarious and worked wonderfully.The acting, quite surprisingly, also worked. Sure, actors like John Turturro and Jon Voight pretty much play caricatures, but the true shocker is Shia LaBeouf, the young up-and-rising star who was too annoying in I Robot and Constantine but who delivers a sharp, witty and very human and believable performance as the young protagonist. His turn in this film quite reassures me of his potential in the upcoming fourth Indiana Jones movie. I expect good things.But this movie has one main central purpose, and I salute it for never once trying to hide it: to entertain and deliver mind-blowing visuals. And it more than exceeds in both of these fields. From the earliest, relentlessly thrilling car chases and all through the final showdown in downtown L.A., this film is a wild, wild ride that grabs you by the collar and never lets you go once. Its speed and pace is impeccable and relentless, and it always keeps you engaged with even more bombastic, even grander, even more insane set pieces and action sequences as it progresses. Bay has of course by now perfected the art of the high-octane action sequence, and with such a broad palette of flashy cars, giant robots, unlimited advanced weapons and the broad, sprawling wide spaces of the American West, Bay, quite unlike some of his counterparts and, dare I say, imitators, knows exactly when to film with intense chaos and when to treat us with a wide, slow-motion long-shot to let us take it all in. In terms of the cinematography and visual style, every shot is flawlessly constructed and gorgeously stylized in terms of lighting, composition, angles and movement. The computer graphic work by ILM is utterly stupefying and probably more convincing than most any other CGI work I've seen lately, as is the excellent sound design by Eric Aadahl, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film nabs an Oscar or two in these categories. And with imagery like a fighter jet flying at full speed only to transform into Starscream in mid-air, grab onto the bottom of a bridge and flip around, landing on his feet on top of it, or a slow-motion shot of Optimus Prime and Megatron literally flying through a high-rise office building, one cant help but sit back and grin.While watching this film, one also can't help but sit back and wonder: what would it be like had Steven Spielberg done more than produce, and perhaps filled in the director's chair as well. What's for sure is that his mark is more than felt on the movie with Bay at the helm: the whole bond between Sam and Bumblebee is strongly present, and scenes such as the one where Sam goes to his house to fetch the glasses while the Autobots wait impatiently in his backyard are pure Spielberg. Would the film necessarily be better? Perhaps, although perhaps Bay was the perfect man for this project with his loud, over-produced and over-the-top approach. But what's for sure is that it would have been very different. I can imagine the family aspect, especially Sam's relationship with his father, far more emphasized, as well as his friendship with Bumblebee, who as the silent visitor from outer space who forms a bond with the protagonist, is an extremely Spielberg-esquire character as it is. Perhaps the military aspect would have also been far less emphasized. It is definitely an interesting thought, but maybe considering the already-ridiculous nature of the plot to begin with, Bay's easy-on-the-brain-feast-for-the-eyes approach is exactly what it needed.It's loud, it's over-done, it's exaggerated and populated with caricatures and flat characters. It lacks any value in plot and characters. But it is irresistibly entertaining and undeniably well-made, far more so than the other big event films prior to it this summer. And its overall light, all-in-the-fun tone really allows one to just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a thrilling, relentless and fantastic ride it is. Ultimately, Spielberg's production along with Bay's visuals match perfectly to create the ultimate brainless summer entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I got just what I expected, all the Hollywood boxes were ticked, and for a couple of bucks it was worth the entertainment.The only thing that really irked me was Bumblebee was not Bumblebee and Megatron was completely reinvented - but meh, don't really care.

Get ready to transform your self !!,"First when i saw the teaser of this movie... i found out to be usual sci-fiction movie. Saw the movie in 2008. was feeling too bored so thought let try to watch transformers. The result thrilled, enjoyed watching it. The movie has a got a strong plot along with screenplay. The previous Michael Bay movie i saw as The Island. Liked it thou..but Transformers has a strong impact on me. The Charactisation of the movie is perfect.. all the characters play the roles brilliantly.Autobots.. the good robots shared a good presence on screen... my personal fav are bumble bee, optimus & ironhide.. & looks perfect when they transforms.. iron hide looks strong as his name makes you feel it. In short Autobots are the coolest robots ever hit the history of Hollywood cinema. Decepticons mmmm perfect for the role of evil mean robots... Megatron... the best with his henchmen Starscream.. loved this chase when Bonecrusher & Optimus prime fight on the highway. the second best the when one of the Decepticons transform in front of Sam..Megan fox looks too hot & sexy. She shared the important role screen presence in the movie. The movie has got some humour & its upto the limit in the movie. The movie is gonna blow you away....Its a highly recommended movie.... finally a good blockbuster of sci-fiction movie after terminator ! my rating 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robots of Dawn,"The image of very large robots hiding out of sight around a suburban house is a wonderfully childish scene. The image of a jet fighter plane transforming and turning against the squadron it hid with is quite something.Structurewise, there is little here that is different from any summer blockbuster - slightly superior teen flick standard. But just as LotR declared year zero for visual effects, Transformers give us a perfect blend of live action and CGI. The transformations are stunning, and I never grew tired of watching them.The film is not too dominated by its many set pieces; nor is it ruined by squeezing humour into the bits where proper dialogue should appear. In summary this is somewhat short of real film making, but it achieves its aim of entertaining for its entire length.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great beholderness with flaws - today's independence day,"IF ONLY................................................................. They had made a more coherent (or less scattered) story, not wasted so much time searching for the pair of you know whats and made the script more realistic and natural ( you'll know when you see it) this would have been up there with Terminator 2 in terms of great sci fi robot pics. I can easily see past the changes they made to the transformers of old- ie personality and what the turn into, if all of the above were corrected. I state this because most if not all of the action sequences were astounding. The sound effects, look and movement of the robots in action was almost flawless and this was the film's saving grace- along with the great voices for prime and megatron. Just when I was REALLY loving this, it cut to something else and spent too long on scenes that wern't needed at all. If there's one negative thing about the fight sequences it's that they occurred too often towards the end, spoiling us then building to a finally that ended too suddenly, making the film end with a whimper instead of a bang (the whole film is a bang i suppose, so it's just comparatively speaking).

This summer belongs to the Autobots,"I only watched a little bit of the '80s cartoon as a kid, but that was enough to turn me into a die-hard fan of the Autobots and Decepticons. Though, I must admit, when I first saw the original trailer way back when, I groaned. Transformers the live-action movie? This is gonna bomb.Ha.Transformers is Michael Bay's most recent masterpiece, breaking box office records around the globe. And the best part of the movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It truly is a nerd's dream come true.If you're a fan of the show, then you know what's going down: the Decepticons (the evil alien robots) are looking for the All Spark cube, the source of life from their home planet Cybertron. Now, these robots are bad-ass and, when the US government starts getting suspicious, they aren't afraid to bring on the smack down.This brings us to Sam Witwicky, played by the now-famous Shia LaBeouf. He's just an ordinary loser-like kid who doesn't know how to talk to girls, LadiesMan217 is his screen name, and is just getting his first car: a yellow 1974 Camaro. Quickly, Sam realizes that there's more to his car than meets the eye.The special effects are the best I've seen so far in any movie (second only to Davey Jones in the Pirates series). When you first see an actual transformation, you will be on the edge of your seat, jaw dropped to the floor. The battles are intense, and the car chases are just fantastic knowing that the cars are really giant robots in disguise. The acting is top notch, especially Shia (who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) and his counter actress, Megan Fox. The dialogue constantly flows whenever they are in a scene together, which, thankfully, is often.The only character that I felt was unnecessary and was Anthony Anderson's character, a large, nerdy computer hacker who assists in decoding the Decepticon's messages (long story). He was annoying and clearly placed into the movie for comic relief, which Shia took care of fine all by himself.The story is pretty out-there, and it will take some suspension of belief to take in everything, but the movie is staying as true to the original cartoon without being too silly. For that, I give the cast and crew complete respect.The movie does seem a bit long, especially if you're seeing it for the second time, but it truly is the most fun you'll have at the movies all summer. And, really, who can resist going to hear Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime? Seriously?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
transformers review,"Michael Bay + Transformers = failure + pissing robots.... wtf?PRO = ILM SFX CON = Michael Bay (and the chaos that ensues)A family rambles on about masturbation, and one of the transformers pisses on a human....Every person on this site I'm sure would know better then to have scenes like this in the new transformers movie. Michael Bay in his infinite wisdom of appealing to the ""target demographic"" knows no better. The movie was a disgrace, and I do not blame the producers for hiring (or subsequently not firing) the director since I'm sure he was a integral part of financing. I blame Michael Bay since his ""style"" is all over this film.This is not a Transformers movie, this is a stupid action film with robots that transform. Bay completely disregarded the fans of this property (i.e. comments in Wired magazine stating since he's the director, he's going to do whatever he damn well pleases and put flames on the truck cause visually it looks cool) News flash Michael Bay, you're blinded by whatever you think ""looks cool"" and not about story, heart, the characters or the 99 other things that make a movie good.I confess I didn't follow the story, and I didn't care to. The film starts out well enough, but the bland characters began to beat reality into my head that this was a very poor film. About 30 minutes into the film, where the transformers are standing around in the garden killing the plants etc, I gave up on this film. (shortly before the American pie 4 rejected scene about masturbation) The story makes no sense, and I don't want to point out the plot holes. By the time the action started at the end of the film, I simply didn't care. That's a hard thing to for a director to do, since for the last 20 years of my life I wanted to see robots transform and fight. Yet bay managed to undo 20 years of building excitement in a few hours.I don't even know where to begin with Prime's lips or the robots designs. They are so completely asinine that words fail me. I only think of Bay thinking, ""well, we'll make them have lots of moving parts, really complex cause that's cool"". Another example of his flawed judgment as a filmmaker. They should have stayed true to the original designs of the Transformers.While most will just say, ""well I love the action, so this movie kicks ass"". Well you're letting this movie off the hook. I don't agree with the style in which Michael Bay has his action sequences shot. Overly hyper kinetic and so frantic I cannot tell what's going on. The second this film starts, you know it's a Michael Bay by the filters they use and the generic butt rock. I guess that's why Bay is hired, cause he will give you exactly the same thing over and over again. While that's fine, and I know to avoid his films.... I have a problem when he disrespects everything that is special about Transformers.This movie is a mindless action film. I guess that's all that Bay aspires to, since there is no characters to fall in love with. No hero to route for, no hero is despise. There is nothing here but a hollow, shell of a movie. You might as well just have ILM cut a version of this movie with just all the effects and sell that version. You tell me one person in the audience who gave a rats ass about any of the characters.... and who were not just waiting for the robots to show up? And mind you, Bay removed any kind of connection to the Autobots etc. that I had. I wanted to like this movie with every fiber of my being. I would have been the easiest to please with just a few things to latch onto. There was nothing there.If I made the movie, I would embrace what is loved about transformers. Focus on the transformers (not about a horny teenager). I would have set the film in the 1980's and embraced that whole era of time. At least they had some of the original voice cast for this film, but it's too little, too late. My brain is breaking down now since I'm extremely upset that they ruined this film. Obviously the nostalgia was there since the film opened so well at the box office. Hopefully when they ""re-imagine"" this film, since they would be foolish to make a direct sequel, they will respect what we love about the transformers, and not dumb it down to nothing more then a action film with robots. I wish they didn't call this transformers, since now the name transformers is a little tarnished. shame on you Michael Bay. shame on you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An amazing movie with an amazing experience!,"I grew watching Transformers and playing it with my friends as a little kid in the school playground (I was always a Decepticon). When I saw the trailer for the very first time I was blown away at the special affects and saw my child hood cartoon characters bought to life - something in me said that this movie was going to rock but I have had my doubts since Spider-man 3 that was billed to be the biggest blockbuster of summer turned out to be an over-hyped let down. I am glad to tell you that Transformers was something that lived up to the hype!!! Right from the opening scene one is blown away from the awesomeness and power of these cybernetic organisms and once again you felt like a little child amazed by what unfolded in front you. CGI was definitely what made this movie and without it, its hard to imagine otherwise but it is absolutely amazing as you watching a massive robot turn its self into a fighter jet and back again. It was good to see all my old goodies like Optimus Prime with the correct voice from the cartoon series and an ultra cool paint job and the rest of the gang hanging about and certainly not to mention the bad guys who really meant business. The movie retained a comical tone all the way through with gags and wise cracks from everyone which was funny. The acting was great as all the actors really put it well with the interaction with the robots . My only complaint was that I felt everyone was a little too clued up on what to do and how to tackle the impending problems and he ending left a bit like eh? was that it ? But however I did remember things kicking off and shutting down very quickly on the cartoon series as well which is another reason for old time sake I let the cheesy one liners go. I would of also like to have seen some character development on other Autobots and Decpitcons because any Transformers fan will tell you that they each have their own personality thats why you gotta love them all !Too conclude Transformers was a piece of childhood that I thought I would never see on the big screen but thanks to the modern wonders of CGI done correctly it was kind of like a dream come true , I would ask fans to go with other fans and those of have young kids of their own take them and share a piece of your childhood with them.

Bravo !!!,"All I have to say is that this was a wonderful movie.... completely blew me away. I'd recommend it to anyone who want to go to the movies and just have plain old fashion fun. Can't wait until they make more installments.The CGI was very out of this world. I think most of the people in the audience thought it was great as well.What I didn't like about the movie was that they should have explained a bit more about some of the characters. It really did seem a bit rushed. Although, what they did explain should be easy enough for anyone to follow.Again, BRAVO.....",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A dazzling entertainment for the summer !,"I grew up watching the cartoon series ""Transformers"" in the 80s. The protagonist in the cartoon, ""Optimus Prime"" , was my childhood hero. He was the leader of the valiant Autobots (Autonomous Robotic Organisms) which opposed the tyranny of the evil Decepticons, led by Megatron, on the planet Cybertron. Optimus Prime was a noble king, much like King Arthur, who displayed affection and compassion for others. He was a born-leader who was willing to sacrifice himself for the service of freedom and liberty. I always remember his catchphrase- ""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings"".When I found out that my beloved cartoon series in the 80s would be adapted into a live action movie, I was thrilled beyond words. Finally, after all the waiting, Transformers was released in Hong Kong last week. I attended a screening on its opening night and the movie did not let me down.First and foremost, this movie is not going to win the Academy award for best picture because it is not supposed to win any. It is a pop-corn action flick and it delivers more than that. It is a glorious and dazzling entertainment for the summer!Unlike the cartoon series back in the 80s, this motion picture is a live action movie which is set in real life settings in the 21st century. All the robots in the movie are generated by computer imagery which seamlessly blend in with the live action elements. The CGI work in the movie is groundbreaking and sets the new benchmark for modern film making. Watching real cars, trucks and fighter jets transforming into robots is truly an eye opening experience. The robots look photo realistic and their transformations on the big screen are stunning beyond my expectations. It is a pure joy to watch them interacting with humans and battling their hearts out on the big screen. Suffice to say, this movie lays the foundation for the advancement of CGI work in the modern cinema.For those of you who are action movie buffs, this movie surely will not disappoint you. This movie plays at a fanatic pace which provides an adrenaline surge for more than 2 and a half hours. The action simply grabs you and does not let go. Unfortunately (albeit inevitably), the plot and the human characters have to play second fiddle to the robots and their non-stop action sequences. There is simply not enough screen time for all the characters. The screenplay is serviceable in the sense that it helps advance the story forward but it is certainly not of Oscar caliber. I also think the writer tried to put too many robot characters into the movie as a result of which there is not enough character development of the robots other than Optimus prime and Bumblebee.This movie is in essence about a boy and his first car (which turns into an alien robot). I have no doubt that the gifted Shia Laboeuf, who plays the boy ""Sam Witwicky"", will have a very bright future in cinema ahead of him. His spontaneous acting with his natural sense of humor carries the movie on his back.One critic said if it's true that there's an 8-year-old boy inside every man, ""Transformers"" is just the ticket to bring the kid out. How true. My 8 year old self had his adrenalin bumping when he saw his childhood hero Optimus Prime transforming from a truck into a gigantic robot for the first time on the big screen in more than 20 years.Please check out my review of the 2006 feature film Miami Vice directed by the Academy Award Nominee Michael Mann http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430357/board/flat/53105610",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
When All Hell Breaks Loose,"It is easy to think that any movie that comes from either comic book or cartoon never seems to hit its mark. THis i am happy to say is one of the exceptions.With some of the greatest CG seen since Lord of the Rings there is little fault with the monstrous machines.The casting was almost flawless and the script itself impeccable save for some irrelevant and tiring jokes.The score of the movie is perfect even though at some times corny through Jazz's comical urgings toward Shia Labeouf's character.Although i was constantly kicked in the back in the cinema by two young children and they drowned out important dialog with there constant ""that's Optimus"" or ""Oh no Megatron"" nothing could bring down the spectacle that is Transformers.

Transform my TV (DVD),"Transformers are really big robots but my TV has a small little screen. So I am sure I miss all the fun because the robots seem like wrecked garbage whereas they are nicely designed seen on a theater screen!In spite of this handicap, the movie is still great, not exceptional but great. It's true that the suburbia feeling is a great door to plunge into this robotic world. Another good point is the talented cast: for me, Labeouf and Fox are newcomers but they are promised to a brilliant future (see Indy IV).I remember to have seen trailers but they didn't appeal me. So, another time, you got the proof that trailers aren't trustworthy because a bad one can make you miss a good movie.I am not a die hard fan of transformers so I can't judge the storyline, but it's a pity that is too much militarized. They are not the friendly neighbor anymore! But in a way, like someone said, it changes from suits, boots and wings!The big final action sequence is very well directed so I keep a good memory finally!NB: and yes, as a kid, I dreamed to have a lot of transformers toys but I remember to play with only a green harrier plane and it belongs to their concurrency, the GOBOTS!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bay and Spielberg Smash the Transformers to Pieces,"Transformers (2007)Review: In a world of remakes and rewrites, we get a childhood classic Transformers. The thing is that I was looking forward to this movie. Here is my take:Transformers starts off okay with a pretty terrifying scene at a military base with a first look at one of the Decepticons in the form of a helicopter. Seems like a serious movie is in play, right? Then things go from good to bad when we are introduced to our main character. Sam Witwickey(Shia LeBeouf)is a total dork who is in need of some......companionship. He gets himself his first car that is a really worn out Camero. Of course it is our first Autobot in disguise.What is wrong here is quite simple. First, Our lead character is so overblown as a desperate dork that it becomes frustrating. I GET IT. He is stuck with parents that are so out of touch like they just can't live past the 50's. It's the cliché loser title character. He picks up a hot chick(Megan Fox)and all things get awkward. The car starts playing cheesy music and starts all sorts of problems for no reason at all. This set off a series of irritating scenarios. Transformers suddenly became a 3rd rate teen comedy. Honestly, anything involving Shia's character was off the charts dreadful.We get some more serious stuff from the pentagon finding out info about the alien lifeforms then we meet another set of irritating characters. Another hot chick who just happens to be an amazing wizard on the computer than anyone else in the freaking pentagon. Unreal. Did I mention that she is about 20 years old? Anyway we meet the annoying Anthony Anderson as well.Then we finally meet the rest of the Transformers. One good thing here is that Peter Cullen still has got it. He is perfect as Optimis Prime. Too bad that even the Transformers(or at least the Autobots anyway)are a bunch of idiots too, the scene at Sam's house for example was horrendous.After all of this, we finally get to the point and the conclusion of the movie and it's quite anti-climatic. And the closing shot of the movie could not be in anymore bad taste.So to sum thing up: The Pros: The special FX are dazzling. The transforming was cool as well as the voice-overs.Cons: About 90% of this movie. From having plot holes to shaky action scenes and having horrendous teenage comedy stuck in the middle(about an hour of this movie was filled with this garbage)to guys being the idiots and worthless character development to our ""hero"" and almost none to the Transfomers.Get it?The Last Word: Ick. This is EASILY one of the worst movies of the year. It's comedy sucked, it's action did not deliver, it's acting was wooden, the characters were annoying.....woo..gah.....let me catch my breath. I REALLY wanted to like this. Do not see this. It's not just my final word, I am doing a public service by not recommending this trash. I cannot remember having such a terrible time in the theaters.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What Can We Learn About Software by Watching Movies,"Some things I learned about software while watching Die Hard 4.0 and Transformers:1. A hacker is most of the times a hot chick. 2. A hacker never uses normal operating systems. They have a bizarre OS, that is specifically optimized for their single need - displaying a map of USA with red dots on it. 3. When a computer is hacked into, the screen flickers. 4. Evil hackers, even if hot chicks, will always be proficient at martial arts as well. 5. You can hack a computer system by directing weird sounds at it. 6. Visualization is king - code breaking and pattern recognition are achieved using quick manipulations of 3D images.Review also appeared on www.pashabitz.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good popcorn movie,"This is an entertaining action movie concerning the invasion of Earth by living robots that can mimic Earth technology, like cars and planes etc. Parents should be warned though-the movie is based on a cartoon show which was based on toys...which means small kiddies will want to collect the ENTIRE ""Transformers"" collection of toys, cartoons, etc. So, this movie is potentially dangerous to your wallet and mortgage.Firstly, seeing as the genesis of this movie is so rooted in children's' toys and cartoons, the movie is quite adult in parts-with matters concerning sex and masturbation...so, it's quite odd to see this kind of material in a movie which is presumably not suitable for its child consumer audience.Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite funny in parts, especially as I groaned at some of the early 'humour' of one of the ""Transformers"" (a car, in this case) playing certain songs on the radio which shadowed the car's driver's expectations (in getting laid).The movie features the Italian Dustin Hoffman, John Turturro, as well as John Voight, who both bring the occasional B movie melodrama acting in a self-conscious way...to good effect.The movie is pretty much non-stop action, but yet not in a bad way, as some action scenes/movies can be (like the mass fighting scenes in one of the Planet Of The Apes movies as well as Attack Of The Clones, the second Star Wars prequel). The special effects are excellent in this movie...from the transformation of cars etc. into humanoid looking fighting robots, as well as the scenes of destruction brought about by the Transformers in urban environments.I doubt that this movie is something that can be enjoyed so much on a second viewing, but you cannot fault its entertainment value on first viewing.Its saving grace for older audiences is (apart from the action scenes), is, as I say, the humour. From teenagers, to parents (especially the Transformers themselves), each brings some comedy to the proceedings.However, some of the 'philosophy' in the movie is painful to listen to-the ""Transformers"" spout some non-sense, which is presumably to guide how children play with their toys or something. It's a very ODD combination of adult material and material for children. The movie can't seem to make up its mind on what its target audience is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""based on the back-cover of a toy package""","Watching this, I delightfully realise... ""thankfully, no real writer has to take responsibility for writing this pool of toxic waste."" The story is so obviously written by a toy-making company. During lunch. On a napkin. Using a finger dipped in jam. For example, with names like ""Decepticons"", ""Megatron"" and ""Optimus Prime""... there's no way to escape from toy-land confinement.With much difficulty, I tried to set aside the cheap toy-story, and tried to follow the film instead, however little there was in there. The reward I got from this was nausea and utter dejection. This ""movie"" is made by and for people that played with transformer toys when they were kids (maybe they still do?). The juvenile portrayal of the two protagonists is just silly. It belongs in a direct-to-video movie. Many times I just thought to myself: ""oh no, they didn't just do that, did they?"".Now, you're probably saying ""but it's just a cheap summer blockbuster flick""... and you'd be right. It's exactly that and it deserves no higher grade than 4. Not because it's ""only an action movie"", but because it's very very bad. Even ""only""-action movies need a sane, cohesive plot and somewhat understandable characters. Otherwise what's the point? For me there's none, but judging by the grade it got here, I guess there's many that doesn't need more.I'll give it the benefit of a doubt for the CG. As an inquisitive ""pixel-police"", I admit there'are some nice interaction between the live elements and the CG elements in this movie. People see the climate changes as a threat... I see another threat, perhaps a more short-term one; crappy CG-focused movies. I urge all movie-goers; don't pay for crap! Is this really the trend we want to encourage?! Like MPAA and RIAA says: ""piracy is theft""; I say: so is making crap and selling it as good quality entertainment.Of course, if all you're looking for is some nice CG, watch a car commercial. And you don't even have to pay; they show them for free on TV! But then again, a car commercial has a much more complex plot than this movie...

Good movie as an opening and great explosion effect,"Two large Cybertronian race groups, the Decepticons and the Autobots involved came to earth in search of the desired resource. A young man gets involved in it by being on the side of the Autobots and the Decepticons come to attack them.Transformers is a film directed by Michael Bay that tells the story of the arrival of alien robots who come to earth to find ancient resources lost from their planet. I think this will be the opening film of the Transformers franchise going forward. A great movie premise with stunning visual effects. Neat and detailed details in packaging each form of robot. The appearance of both the Decepticons and the Autobots is made in as much detail as possible. Likewise with the visuals when the action of the fight between them presents interesting visuals ranging from shots to detailed punches. Not to forget the big explosions that became the hallmark of Michael Bay.Those good visual effects are not in line with the plot of this movie. The film has a pretty good story plot. There is not much drama and it is enough to give a good performance of the action scenes. This film is like a pilot film for a film franchise. A conflict that is not much well constructed. The pace of the film is fairly fast and full of scenes that lead to the point. Quite deeply explore and introduce the world of Cybertron in this film. Simple but enough to open the story and become the beginning for the Transformers franchise. In addition, I was very dissatisfied with the acting performed by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.

An expensive piece of degrading tripe,"One of the worst written, vulgar, rude and distasteful movies to come along in a long time. I squirmed in my chair all the way through this waste of good actors...and I only stayed because I hate wasting money. How these respected actors agreed to deliver dialogue a puppy could have written better is beyond me.....I hope they enjoy the money they made. Why does there have to be ugly finger gestures, racist humor, stereotypes, gratuitous sex references and other throw away inclusions in a movie just because the studios think they are pandering to the pulse of society? Well, there doesn't and if Michael Bay and all those other degenerative film makers think that they do, they are as much the purveyors of evil, just as much as a drug dealer is. There were so many problems with this movie, I don't have enough time to list them...I can concur though with others I've been reading....like how Shia's parents were useless, spouting masterbation references, plot holes including the fact that why Shia would carry the cube himself to the top of the building while avoiding the Decepticons when one of the Autobots or Prime could have easily done the same thing was stupid....like him running around the street or how about the building when somehow he outruns a Decepticon up about 30 flights of stairs to the roof. Arrrrrgh...too many things as I said, I can't list all the problems here. The fact that people see this movie doesn't mean it's good for them. This is what is contributing to the decline of western civilization...and their denial (what a great, convenient, pull from your pocket defense) doesn't make it any less true. If the film industry is to have a responsibility to society and to kids, whom this movie leans towards, then go beyond the wallet and think....geeze, isn't a billion dollars enough for you? I compare this movie to The Cat in the Hat, another vulgar cinematic waste....basically because both that and this film are slaps in the face to the authors of the originals....the cartoon as well.

It just makes me feel worried that THAT many people can be so wrong and have THAT bad of taste in movies.At best this movie is a bad ripoff Armageddon, I could feel the story and soul of Armageddon in this movie coming to real while the plot unfolded but not close as good. Most the movie just didn't make sense, I never got any interest for a character in the movie and how could I ? Even if you are a Tranformer freak I cant understand how you could love this film.Sadly I have lost all trust in Michael bay of delivering something real and good anymore, Surly he CAN deliver to the BOXOFFFICE nodoupt. But he sold his soul in return.So what is a good comic series on film? Superman ? No. Batman? Right On! There is a example to follow. what C. Nolan did with Batman Bay could never do.Michael Bay needs to go back to the roots and take more care of the story and keep the balance between blowing up cars and the storyline, like in The Rock. Maybe he needs someone like J. Bruckheimer to hold him back sometimes.In my opinion Transformers lacked human interference. I need to see real people I believe in and see them dealing with the problems that occur. I could never care more about a Robot than a Human.I have seen the movie 3 Times now, twice in the theater and once on HD DVD and its painful to see some of my friends cheering it, and at the same time bashing great movies like The Prestige and Apocalypto.

Transformation...,"It is 2007 (some time ago we had futuristic movies flash forwarding to these years:)) and we need a new breed of action movies. Its time for what we called action flicks to upgrade to smarter and beta versions - dynamic action flicks - possessing all former characteristics but moving up in the cinematic arts scale. Michael Bay, deliberately or not, made an attempt at it with Armageddon. Mr. Spielberg, consciously understanding these ""thin"" moments in cinema, has got the feel for it. Furthermore, they all know that as with software production a final version, that everybody loves and most importantly knows how to use, takes a lot of time and beta versions. From the preview to the actual film - Welcome to dynamic action flicks version 0.1 ""Transformers 2007"". It is not a big surprise most other actions coming out until recently  even though good production and so forth look like a versions 0.0. As in fashion you got to have the feeling, the feeling the ones who now it categorize it as close to psychic - the rest call it a feeling for the trend, the fashion, you've heard it.Well it takes time but they are coming so we shall all have a nice time with future action movies , as copy cats don't waste time and will make us a good favor at least while the trend lasts then boredom again until someone gets the feelingIf interested in seeing how the above mentioned trend is starting to grow on the industry don't miss""Die Hard 4""""I am a Legend""Probably ""Hitman"" as well even though I have not seen it.Also heard there is a Van Dam action coming out that due to all this will be more decent than usual.6+1 = 7/10 (6 for the film itself, 1 for the feeling ;))",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure entertainment !!,"What can I say about this film......first off when I first heard they were making a ""Transformers"" film, I thought uh oh another load of rubbish is being made. How wrong was I?Having just watched The Transformers, I gotta say it was a delight to watch, the special effects were awesome, OK the story line was a bit pants, but hey I won't go there, cos I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't yet had the chance to watch this film, but go on go watch it, cos it really is worth watching, it's good to know that there still are good films being made, the only other thing is....if a sequel is ever made, lets just hope it doesn't bring Transformers into meltdown. Pure entertainment I'll most defiantly be watching this film again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not without its faults, but still very good","I was a big fan of Transformers as a kid and I can't begin to explain how excited I was when I heard that they were going to make it into a full on live action movie.Transformers tells the story of the Autobots (the good robots) and the Deceptacons (the bad robots). The deceptacons are out to get a device known as the Allspark, a device that has the power to destroy human life on earth. The Autobots are there to make sure that doesn't happen. The leader of the Autobots Optimus Prime forms an alliance with Sam Witwicky, a teenager who has the key to finding the Allspark...blah blah blah.First of all, the praises: the special FX in this movie are seamless. You could almost believe that they created these robots from scratch just for this film. The film is also quite respectful to the original cartoon. Optimus is still a truck and is voiced by the one and only Peter Cullen, Starscream is still a jet, but some have been changed, and the changes are very welcome. The humour has also been given special treatment, with a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments.Now the complaints: although this is an action film and people don't normally care about the story for a film such as this, that still doesn't make it right that it was pretty much ignored. There are some blatant plot holes in this film and the script could have been further fine tuned and tested before they decided to say ""oh what the hell, let's just get on with the action!"". Also, Michael Bay's directing is...difficult to follow. Yes, the action comes in thick and fast, and there is no shortage of explosions and metal crunching, but, my God, can't you just pull the camera back a bit and let us see what's going on? The editing is too fast and often you are left gritting your teeth because he simply won't show you what's happening in the whole picture! So, they have green-lit two sequels. This film was a very decent stab at it. It was a good way of seeing the Transformers in life action mode and there are moments when you want to jump out of your seat in amazement. I just hope that in the new ones they fine tune the script a little and please let us see what's going on more!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Good,"From the opening sequence this movie never let up. I never followed the cartoon series, but what surprised me the most about this movie was the realistic intensity of the military sequences.I would have been tempted to give this movie 10 stars in the same category as Bourne Identity, a personal favorite. However, at times the movie took on an Independence Day cheeziness as the heroes consisted of a bunch of misfits clashing with the stereotypically inept g-men which amounts to little more than political statements that I find particularly bland and stupid. However, it is partially redeemed by the efforts of the special ops forces in the end. But rather than watch Shia Lebouef be transformed from his experience, he simply ends up with the girl in the end.Also, what's the deal with the glasses? They are imprinted with the navigation coordinates of the Cube's whereabouts circa late 19th century which happens to be the not yet built Hoover dam? Go figure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Waste of time,"I watched the HBO 30 minute docu-trailer the night before and decided to go see this film. Well, all the good stuff was in the trailer. The rest is pretty embarrassing. The story just sat there for minutes at time and did nothing, and then would get up and do something totally stupid. Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of product shots. This is a 2.5 hour commercial for junk food and junk cars. Chase scenes that came out of nowhere and went back to where they came from. Completely unbelievable characters overacting their way through unbelievable situations. What did I expect from Bay... not EBay!!!! I left my seat early to go buy printer paper. Wished I had seen the cartoon rat movie instead of this piece of crap about walking trash cans.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Film for Everyone,"I never really watched the cartoon, just an episode here and there, but I still enjoyed the movie. It had a good amount of laughs sprinkled throughout the film, and the animation was fantastic. However, in a few spots the movie seemed to stop in order to give a detailed description of what had happened in the past. These long speeches drew me away from the movie. This information could have been better intertwined into the film. However, in this film everything seems to stop in order to let dialog take place. Overall, I thought the film did a good job entertaining all age groups of Transformer fans and the common movie buff alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wicked film, way better than I expected","Yeah, I've commented on movies on IMDb a lot, and I usually give them a ten, and this one is no exception. This is another gem that I wasn't all that certain would be good until the first scene, and then WHAM you are hooked! The movie is roughly about the Transformers, technically called Autobots, who are trying to save Earth from the Decepticons, which obviously are the evil version of these machines. From the name Autobot, you can tell that these Transformers do transform into cars, among them the beat up old Camero bought by sixteen year old Sam Witwicky. Anyway, Sam has this peculiar object that the Autobots require in order to save the planet from certain destruction so the geeky teen is recruited to help save humankind from the Decepticons.As mentioned earlier, I absolutely loved this movie. It has the perfect combination of humour, romance, and awesome action, the effects were very well done (was impressed that a movie as far fetched and ridiculous as a bunch of transforming cars actually seemed almost believable) and was at the edge of my seat the entire time (when I wasn't laughing or even almost crying, but I won't go into any other details, I don't want to spoil it for anyone else). Shia LaBeouf is a very talented young man, very fresh and sweet. An easy ten even if you are not into transforming robots.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bring on the nostalgia!,"I have to admit I loved this film and, perhaps, as someone who was a child in the Eighties at the height of the Transformers craze has some bearing on that. I was a tomboy who loved the toys and watched the cartoon on Saturday mornings so there is a certain amount of sentimental nostalgia when watching this film. However, that doesn't detract from the fact this was a very enjoyable blockbuster.The premise of 'Transformers' sees war between two robotic races-- the Autobots, who are good and honourable, and the Decepticons, who are evil and cruel-- on the planet of Cybertron as they are vying for control of the powerful Allspark weapon. The weapon eventually finds its way to Earth but, in his search for it, the leader of the Decepticons, Megatron, is frozen in the polar ice cap. Years later, seventeen-year-old Sam buys his first car, unaware it is Bumblebee, one of the Autobots who have come to Earth to find the Allspark. War again is looming between the Autobots and Decepticons, this time with Earth as the battleground.The human characters of Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, the military and government people aren't irritating distractions from the robots. Sam is old enough to realistically be embroiled in this situation without coming across as some precocious little moppet who should be tucked at home in bed and we should be thankful they chose the main character to be seventeen instead of ten. Shia LeBeouf, who played Sam, brought humour and the human touch to the film. It also made a pleasant change to see the military portrayed to have some brains instead of carrying on like a bunch of reckless fools who make moronic decisions time-and-again.As for the robots, the CGI used was of excellent quality. The visual effects were able to re-create them in a manner that doesn't leave the audience sitting there thinking, 'this is so fake', which would have ruined the film. The robots were also depicted in a manner that gave them individual personalities that brought their characters to life, which was essential because these aren't meant to be mindless drones.This film is, ultimately, a Hollywood blockbuster, not some deep-thinking epic. People do need to remember that when judging 'Transformers'. The plot is involving without requiring a vast intellect or powerful thoughts and yes, there are plenty of explosions and fight scenes. Take it for what it is and I imagine many people upwards of twelve who just want to see a fun film will enjoy this. It is definitely a must for those in their twenties who grew up with Transformers; nothing like re-living your childhood once again!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Toy commercial with a HUGE budget, still loads of fun!","Whoever says this is ""not a kids movie"" is fooling them self.I really liked it. I enjoyed it emensely. But it is so clearly just a toy commercial with a HUGE budget.Shia steals the show as far as the actors go. I laughed my head off at some of his lines. He did a great job delivering some cheesy dialog and he has a natural talent that sells the story.Aside from him, it's the toys that steal the show! Those GIANT ROBOTS are AWESOME!!! This movie had more action than all of the other summer films this year combined! (The only exception may be Die Hard 4, which I haven't seen yet.)I was one of those kids who purchased the very first Transformer toys back when Optimus Prime was a gun, and one of the characters was a cassette player. So my affection for the Transformers franchise goes way back.Without making this very long, suffice to say that it is well worth your money as long as you can appreciate that it is a Michael (explosions) Bay movie, full of cheese dialog, a ridiculous story, and its main purpose is to sell toys.Heck, I bought four Transformers after watching this. (For my sons, of course.)BRING ON THE SEQUEL!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Winner,"For centuries, two races of robotic aliens?the Autobots and the Decepticons?have waged a war, with the fate of the universe at stake.

"cars, robots, hot girls and explosions: the ultimate boys movie","I wasn't expecting a lot of a movie based on a TV show (which I've never seen) based on some toy. But Transformers look cool in advertisements so when it came to TV I decided to check it out, and it's actually a pretty decent movie. The action scenes are well done, the movie has a fast, consistent pace and I found myself surprisingly interested in what was happening.At the same time, this is not a great movie. The robots themselves are just silly stereotype caricatures, and the dopey humor doesn't jibe with the cleverer humor earlier in the movie (i.e. the car that plays songs appropriate to the situation. The robots fail to generate any real personality, so Shea LeBouf's emotional attachment to them doesn't make any sense. Although it might make sense to undemanding 10 year olds, who are probably this movie's primary target audience.Oddly enough, I found the movie less interesting as it proceeded from a cute action-comedy to a big action spectacular. The final scenes of mayhem were competently filmed, but there are none of those ""wow"" moments you get from really good big budget action pix. In fact, the most impressive thing in battles is the smooth transformation of robots from one form to the other, and by movie's end you've seen that enough to no longer be impressed.Overall the movie is a bit of a hack job, but it's a very entertaining hack job, and sometimes that's all you really need.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
And So Began the War...,"I remember not thinking much of this movie when I first saw it after it came out. That was the only time I ever watched it until recently, and I was surprised to find I enjoyed it a lot more on the second viewing seventeen years later. I'm well versed in Michael Bay. I know what he is about so I am able to go into his movies with an open mind. That being said, I found the fights hard to follow because the giant machines just mashed together making it hard to understand what was going on. This is certainly an issue they corrected in the sequels. The dialogue between the robots was pretty cheesy, but putting it into context, they did a solid job of recreating the same flair that made the cartoon fun. Who expects a film based on a toy line to have amazing lines and characterizations anyway? I never noticed until this time around that it was the ""Lost,"" guys that wrote it, which made it a bit more interesting for me. I'll never like Shia Lebouf but he performed what was required of him adequately. Overall, I think I was able to enjoy it more as an older person, because I wasn't over analyzing it and just accepting it for what it was. A fun premise with great effects...just like all of Michael Bay's work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a lame movie !,"Fellow Americans, wake-up ! You must be either a nerd or a big kid to like this kind of movie. Plot less story, just-OK CGI and one of the most stupid SciFi movie ever-made, period.I mean, how can the robots be 50 times larger than the cars ? Avanced, OK, but how about law of physics ? That's not SciFi. Blade Runner, Total Recall, OK, that's good scifi. Not this.And now, we have confirmation Hollywood and critics are totally gone 100% marketing. I mean, come on ... a B- rate by critics ? Why not an A while you're there...This movie represent all what i dislike in US recent productions and what makes us look so stupid to the rest of the world.At least, Armagedon had so believable story. And ""the island"" was a pretty good movie. But this ... is just crap. I'm happy to be in my late 30's and to have avoided being raised with such Japanese cartoon crap.Go watch ""Ratatouille"" if you like CGI with a sense and just grow up.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the most amazing films ever made!!,"This is a visual feast of a movie!! The special effects are just absolutely amazingly real!! The plot is very much something that would be in a generation 1 episode. I was absolutely enthralled when I found out that Peter Cullen was coming back as the voice of Optimus. He was, is, and always will be Optimus, no matter what!! Megatron was very cool, and I find it interesting that they kept Optimus's axe and Megatron's flail from the very first episode. The action is extremely well put together, the humor is great, and the acting is superb!! This in my opinion, the best way you could spent 2 hours. Transformers was always one of my favorite shows and they put it on the big screen extremely well. I only have 2 complaints about the movie. The first is Starscream's voice. In the show, it was a high pitch annoying voice, but in the movie, they made it deeper and more evil. The second is Bumblebee's voice. In the cartoon he was the kid of the Autobots, yet in the movie, when he does talk, he sounds more like a professor or something like that.

It somehow managed to make the government look bad, but the troops still look good. If that's not a way into the heart of every fence-straddling American patriot, I don't know what is...Not bad for a 3 hour Hasbro/GM/Ipod/Mountain Dew commercial...I'm sure I'm missing some.

Top 5 Best Movie Ever,"Transformers ranks at #3 for my favorite movies of all time. This is one of the coolest concepts and easily delivers. Most impressively from this movie is its quotable lines.

""You've failed me yet again Starscream."" ""I am the Megatron!"" Overall, I thought this movie was very cool. IMDb requires me to write 10 lines of text, so I must continue writing stuff.

You can tell who the target audience is,"and I'm not one of them.Transformers had impressive special effects. But the acting ws subpar and plot was written for a younger audience. Megan Fox's sweet bod was, in my opinion, the best part of the film (narrowly beating out the special effects) My roommate rented the video, so i paid exactly the right amount for it (nothing). Perhaps on the big screen the special effects would have been more captivating but i found myself glancing at the clock on the wall wondering how long the film was. I discovered it was 143 minutes long and I felt it was probably about 43 minutes too long. I can't believe that the entire story couldn't have been condensed at some points.Overall Transformers was an average film that had decent special effects to keep it from being a stinker. I give the Special Effects an 8 and the film as a whole a 4. Not good, not hideous and possibly better than anything i could have watched on TV tonight.Edit-After reviewing other comments, I realized that for many Transformers were part of childhood/growing up. I also remembered that in the 80's I was in high school and i was far more concerned with how to get into Tracy L's (I'll refrain from using her last name) pants than anything concerning toy robots. So I when into this film unbiased by childhood memories. ((Unlike when I watched the re-release of episode 4 (known as STAR WARS when I saw it back in 77-78)The trouble was that the kid that saw Star Wars was grown and the magic was lost in the tide of life)) Anyway, apparently lack lack of bias didn't help much, the film simply wasn't very good. At least I didn't feel part of my childhood memories were being violently tread upon (like others have implied). I also learned that a lot of the charm of the Transformers, the development of their personalities was apparently too (tedious? frivilous? unnecessary? expensive? useful? ) to be added to the movie.

Beyond bad,"First off, the movie focuses on humans which are very secondary to the story compared to the robot. It's called the ""Transformers"", not the winer BS problems of humans. Also, all the people writing about it and claiming that since they are in their 20's are inherently connected or knowledge worthy of said cartoon franchise are full of it. In a society filled with lazy ""time out"" generation parents and kids who have to have special ""playclothes"" for playing outside that they can't get dirty, yes the Transformers might seem a good movie. In the past when I have done critic writings for newspapers I have often stated ""as long as it entertains me"". This is not the case with this piece of garbage that Michael Bay has puked out. This is not entertaining, it is frustrating. Some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and seriously corrupt versions of iconic characters spew out in over 2 hours of CG/live action dullness. As stated, the serious dim-wits and people who can't handle life without a cellphone stuck to their ear will get this movie and like it as they are rarely asked to look beyond the internet for information or (god forbid) made to play outside with toys. This movie represents a farce and an insult to those of us who (actually) grew up watching this cartoon and having fun with the toys. Even if you can't comprehend life before the home computer, time-out Christian mother punishment, ipods, or the damn cellphone that can do everything, at least understand that this movie is just plain bad and an insult and that you would spend your time better trying to get the episodes of the original cartoon off of the internet.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
*Transforming the Future of Action Cinema: A Bold New Era*,"""Transformers"" is not just another action film; it's a groundbreaking spectacle that catapults viewers into a world where metal meets mayhem, and nostalgia dances with modern storytelling. Directed by Michael Bay, this cinematic tour de force transcends traditional boundaries, merging thrilling action with rich character arcs-the very essence of what makes a movie memorable and unique.From the get-go, ""Transformers"" immerses audiences in its vibrant world.

The Autobots, led by the brave Optimus Prime, embody courage and sacrifice, while the Decepticons, with their menacing presence, create a thrilling adversarial force that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.What truly sets ""Transformers"" apart is its skillful blend of heart and humor amidst the spectacle.

This film is a reminder that, just like the Transformers themselves, cinema is constantly evolving, adapting, and transforming into something spectacular.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simple minded but exciting entertainment,"Transformers is thin on plot and coherence, but it's still a blast.The action sequences are absolutely breathtaking at times, even though the camera is so close you often can't tell what's happening. It doesn't matter though because the digital effects are so incredible and the action is so intensely done with lots of speed, explosions and great sound effects. Seeing this in the theater with full sound can give you shivers down your spine.The first part of the movie features the more logical part of the plot, even if it's just a typical and dry high school kid storyline. That's really what keeps it in the realm of logic. The dialogue isn't as bad here and everything makes more sense. It's when the robots show up that everything falls apart.The auto bots are more or less just there for the kids, which isn't a bad thing on its own. Unfortunately, they have some terrible dialogue and their characters are more clumsy and dimwitted than heroic. It's obvious that they're more just there to be cute and entertaining than actually be real characters. They don't really offer anything compelling, instead they're basically just stand ins there to blow up stuff and provide some slapstick relief. The decepticons aren't much better.The plot is equally kiddish. It revolves around this ancient artifact that all the robots are after. Fair enough, but it gets so silly you'll be shaking your head at it.It's still fun though. In all of its simplicity and childishness, you can be entertained. The characters are also likable enough (albeit pretty flat) so that you can care about them, especially Shia Lebouf. He does a great job providing an easily likable main character, and he does a good job with all the comedic bits.It's a fun movie despite how ridiculous and nonsensical it can get. The action will blow you away and you'll like the transformers, even if they are just marketing tools for the kids. Don't expect anything crafty or complex, just sit back and enjoy the fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So disappointing,"I have always been a huge Transformers fan. I WANTED to enjoy this movie yet I can honestly say I can't remember ever being so disappointed in a film. I think I started to hate it when Bumblebee urinated on an FBI agent. Somewhere around there.*SPOILERS* First of all, to even say that this movie is about the Transformers is a bit misleading. In reality, it's about Shia LeBouf's character with appearances by the Transformers. When I go see a movie about the Transformers, I want to see more than one scene containing a conversation between those characters.In fact, the Transformers were so poorly characterized, that when Megatron and Optimus Prime actually do fight, I don't even give a crap, because I feel like I barely know them. Megatron has about five lines and he doesn't even show up until literally 2 hours into the film. And I sure don't want to sit through a lame-ass love story when there is plenty of Autobot and Decepticon action to be watching.The entire film is completely unfocused. It's completely unclear what the Decepticons are doing on Earth and whether or not that Megatron is even the leader. And even though each Decepticon introduces themselves, afterwards it's almost impossible to tell them apart.Another thing that really bugged me was the films annoying obsession with this sitcom-type humor. Don't get me wrong, I love some comedy in my action movies, but the silly lowbrow comedy just didn't go with the attempt to set the action in a real-world setting. There were genuinely funny parts, of course, but I was so annoyed with the potty humor junk that it was hard to enjoy them.Obviously there are many people who have posted positive reviews of this film and they're entitled to their opinion. I guess they just have an ability to enjoy senseless overly long movies with no substance that I don't.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent Action packed movie,I don't claim to know much about the original transformers in fact i know hardly anything. After seeing this movie i sorta wish i did. It has stunning special effects paired with extraordinary sound and a bunch of recognizable actors.Even if you don't know about the show you should know that Optimus Prime and his buddy the autobots take on megatron and the decepticons. In this movie their is a cube that has the power to turn things into robots that the bad guys want to harness to destroy the world and the autobots need to stop it. The first part of the movie sets the stage and their is some great humor paired with some skirmishes. The Real action starts when the big battle between the autobots and decepticons begin fighting.At some points their were too many robots and i didn't know who they were and the decepticons personality's were not shown at all. It wasn't that big of a deal as the big picture is the battle between good and evil. Transformers is a great movie for anybody to see not just the fanatics of the show. It has the potential to be the best blockbuster of the summer.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just too much,The negative reviews for this movie are justified. Cool plot I guess. Incredible CGI. Megan Fox. That's about it.First this may be a persona preference but I did not like how the transformers didn't have any resemblance to the vehicles they were. They all looked like completely different beings. Also the transformations were extreme closeup where you couldn't see anything. The action scenes were way to quick dark and fast. Stuff just kept happening and happening.Also I just didn't care much about the transformers. They had no personality outside of bumble bee. Megatron was barely in it and did nothing. Prime had a bigger part but still I didn't care.I wanted more about their home planet. I know why they were on earth but give us some more history.I wanted more story and less fighting.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Way better then I expected!,"Transformers is an old and lovable Franchise first as a toy then a TV series in the 80's and 90's. I have been a fan of Transformers since I was a small child and I own the 1987 movie(I love it). I always thought a Live Action Transformers film would be a cool idea but would never live up to the original cartoon...but I was wrong.Transformers was an epic movie for all ages, Transformers fan or not, and has a great blend of humor and action. Oh, the special effects in this movie are the best I have ever seen, PERIOD! When the transformation from vehicle to robot starts you can see every little gear move and go into place..Flawless!One of the best things they did for this movie was bringing Peter Cullen in for the original voice of Optimus Prime. I remember that voice perfectly from the show and its just so refreshing to hear again.The only Reason I did not give this movie a 10-10 was because the character development and interactions of the Decepticons was lame but I guess they can do more of that in the sequel.9-10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Transformers, more than meets the eye?","TRANSFORMERS More than meets the eye? So the release is right around the corner of one of the most anticipated movies of the year. But is the anticipation worth it? A good bunch of us have grown up with Transformers, we know the stories, we know the TV show, the movies, and of course, those kick-ass action figures. Finally after all the years we get a live action full blown Hollywood production of the story. I'd like to write this without giving much away, since it is quite a movie, but I'll start with a summary.Basically we have the ""cube"" or better know as the ""All Spark"". This cube has the utmost power to the Transformers, which are fighting over it. Two clans of Transformers exist, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. Both of them want the cube, but one side is good, and the other evil, respectively. At some point in time this cube was lost, and both sides go from planet to planet searching for it. Guess where their last place to look is? That's right, Earth. The story has multiple character sets it follows, one being a soldier in the US Army, another being a teenager, a group of a ""signal analysis"" team, and the Secretary of Defense. All of these tie in at one point and all reach conflicts and disaster.Story = 8/10 Now normally, this story may be a little ""weak"" in terms of normal story telling, but since it has been around and evolved throughout the decades, it is widely accepted and interesting to audiences. It's quite an easy tale to grasp, but greats amount of detail can be placed to it. The overall picture is about the Transformers, but we do get a look into the other character's lives and what they are going through with all of this happening. Some of the story is week in character development, and catches some rather cliché moments, but hold strong to what's going on.Script/Acting = 4.5/10 Ouch. Some of the lines and dialog in this movie were awful, and a good handful of the acting was either dry or overdone, but with the other characteristics of the film adding to this, the movie stays strong.Sound = 10/10 Whomever did the sound design and effects for this film deserves a true award. Every single action and nut or bolt had it's own sound, each being unique. I truly enjoyed the sound, and would buy a sound effect archive of just the effects played in the movie, they were fabulous.Visual Effects = 10/10 These are hands down the best effects I have ever seen. I see A LOT of movies, and as with a lot of the community love them, and this movie by far surpasses everything I've seen before this. The animations and transformations of the bots is flawless, the wreckage and explosions and everything is just jaw-dropping, it was perfect. I don't see how they could have improved anymore than this, seriously. Now I truly believe it took over 32 hours to render one frame. There was only ONE, ONE one second scene where I could tell it was fake, and it was a splash of water near the end of the film. Other than that, it was just beautiful.Length = 144 minutes.Yep, almost 2 1/2 hours of pure Transformers, pretty sick, eh? Overall = 8.8/10 No I didn't average this score, but this movie does deliver. It's enjoyable and will want you asking for a little piece more. It was a good time, and is worth seeing.Oh yeah. And that new Camaro is in it. Nice car indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why do people like this movie?,"This movie was almost as bad as Spider-Man 3. What a disappointing summer for movies (besides Borne 3) While watching this movie i was confused, was it suppose to be an action film? Cause the action was difficult to follow when they were in the city. The ""humor"" was uncalled for when it was presented. The whole government agency was alright at first then they turned into a bunch of idiots that had t-shirts made. That what my high school sports team did. The love story was the worst i've seen since Star Wars episode 2, simply dreadful. The rest of the dialog was bad, the movie also featured horrible lines that just highlighted the lack of acting talent Michael bay picked.The worst part was the blatant ads through out the movie, cars, cellphones, clothes, and drinks were thrown in your face the entire time. The shot would start out on the GM symbol then after 30 secs span out to see the cars only to focus of the Chevy symbol next. I would have walked out and gotten my money back but my friend drove me so i had no where to go.......Michael Bay is making the sequel, both should be stopped from ever seeing the light of day",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"robots, cars, trucks, action, hot chicks...a rough but somewhat dodgy (visual) ride","Just two days ago I went to watch 'Transformers' with my brother. As a kid I initially hated the cartoon but later grew to like it. My summary pretty much explains the movie. I enjoyed the film because I liked some of the comic scenes, special effects, the action and funny appearances of famous actors. Also, all the robots and cars were pretty cool and fun to watch. About the plot, well who cares? The acting...well who cares? I wasn't expecting a great screenplay or standout performances. But if 'Transformers'scored high on those two, I really would have liked it a whole lot more. There weren't really that many hot chicks (which you expect in this kind of films) but the two I saw were hot enough. Visuals, special effects and sound were brilliant. Lots of action which slows down a bit in the second half until the end. An excellent background score (with two tracks from Linkin Park).

However, I was hoping it would link in a bit better with the original: The characters were updated for this movie - that is OK, and expected. But some were SO updated, you could not quite recognize them from the original TV show. Especially the Decepticons were a bit difficult to keep apart, as they were quite similar when transformed into robots.The voices were not kept close enough to the original. Megatron and Starscream had very distinctive voices in the TV series, but they were completely different in the movie. Kudos for keeping Optimus Primes voice like the original.Optimus Prime was wise and tactful in the TV series, but in the movie he at times are quite clumsy - for instance in the scene in Sams back garden. I found that rather disrespectful...Finally I was waiting the whole movie for Megatron to transform into the mighty gun - but he never did! All in all - this was always going to be a movie for the old Transformers fans of the 80-ies. It was never going to be realistic, so why strive to make it more realistic than the original?

Transformers Review,"I first heard about this movie last year when it was being filmed, it would be the big Hollywood action summer film of 2007. This made me very excited and I also enjoyed the original teaser trailer. Then I finally saw this film in some old cinema during a holiday, I entered the theatre with a expectation. So, what did I get? I got a trashy, painfully written, horribly directed piece of garbage.So basically, all the familiar Robots from the old series are back, but that does not help this awful movie. First of all, it is directed by Michael Bay, Who couldn't have done an even worse job on this film. He hasn't brought anything original back to the screen and, instead, has decided to rely on extremely poor editing and CGI to give us the action scenes. This could be his worse movie to date.Performances on this film are not good, but that is the least of this film's issues. I mostly blame the film's script which is worth 30 minutes of a short movie into a 2 hour film making it very stretched. But thats okay! Mr. Bay has relied on senseless editing to make this film out of control. As a result, I almost fell asleep at an action scene (something that I have never done before).Unlike some decent action flicks, the storyline to this film is incredibly unintelligent, and left me unimpressed. If there is one positive thing I could say about this film, it is that it has some good CGI effects, but is that all? Now this film has been rated PG-13, however that doesn't stop my 9-year old cousin from watching it. Now personally, I have no problem with this, but when it came to a extensive scene with sexual humour, I was caught completely off guard. I see absolutely no reason why this is this is in the finished cut, and to have that type of joke in a film that is based upon a huge kid-friendly franchise, this is extremely inappropriate. However if there is a age level which would appreciate this the most, it would be teenagers. Now judging by the story's sub-plot, this is kind of a teen action film, rather than a sensible family film, so with that said, this movie fails yet again.Now I thought that The Simpsons Movie would disappoint me and that this movie would blow me away, amazingly, it did the complete opposite. Now unless you praise the film with good CGI, I can see absolutely no reason why anyone could enjoy this film, otherwise you have been brainwashed by cheesy Hollywood tripe. After the longest 2 hours of my life, my buttocks were ruined, my ears were bleeding and I had witnessed a film that was just unbelievably bad. Just bad! This film succeeded to disappoint me in every way. All I can say is if this film was made a decade back, and with a different film crew, this movie would be good. But I'm sorry, but they left this movie last, all the good action movies have been made, and only a good director could bring the old magic to life again. Now I have run out of words to say, so I will give you a simple overall: This film is too fast, yet too slow.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie makes me embarrassed to be a Transformers fan.,"First of all, let me get this out of the way: yes, I'm a long-time Transformers fan. However, I am by no means a purist (my favorite TF series was Beast Wars), and I'm not giving this movie a low rating simply because they changed things from the original series. The franchise has gone through so many reboots, retoolings and new continuities that it never even occurred to me to be upset about the idea of another one. That's not to say that there weren't elements of this movie that I had problems with as a fan, but they had little to do with my overall opinion of the movie.Since it's the least important element of this review, I'll get the fan-related stuff out of the way first. All of these are things I could easily have overlooked if the rest of the movie had been in any way good, so unless you really care about this stuff, feel free to skip down to the next paragraph. Obviously, the designs were one issue I had. In no way was I expecting a direct translation of their G1 forms, but if they're going to keep the classic names, they could at least give the other characters the respect they gave Prime by making them at least somewhat recognizable. Just look at the G1 repaint of the Starscream toy, for example; some different heads and more G1-based paint jobs could have done wonders. Also on the design front, I didn't like Bumblebee being a top-of-the-line sports car and Starscream's robot mode being very hulking and brutish, as I felt those choices went in the exact opposite direction of the spirit of their namesakes (Bumblebee being the not-too-fast, not-too-strong underdog with a lot of heart, and Starscream being a character who relied on his speed, agility and cunning rather than brute force). On the story side, I disliked the inference that Prime and Megatron were brothers (although at least it wasn't explicitly stated like in the draft script). Also, the statement by the producers that they couldn't do Soundwave because ""the audience wouldn't believe the whole mass-shifting thing"" kind of loses its weight when you have a 20-story cube compress itself to about the size of a basketball.As far as the script goes, it was downright awful. It tried to be way too many things, and pulled them all off poorly. It kept jumping haphazardly and without warning between alien invasion explosion-fest, military/war film, bad teenage romance, government conspiracy movie, and tech/hacker ""thriller,"" each of which had its own unique pacing that didn't mesh with that of any of the other story lines. There were unnecessary plot lines, scenes that were pointless and/or way too long (most notably the failed attempt at comedy that was the yard scene, which was both), characters and plot lines that were just forgotten about, and more plot holes than I could count. The few characters that got any development at all (who were almost all human) were incredibly stereotypical. The Decepticons (who have always been my faction of choice) in particular suffered a severe lack of character development, being reduced to ""bad guys who destroy things."" The dialogue was no better, rife with stilted phrasing, clunky exposition, and instances of natural flow being sacrificed for forced references to sponsoring products. The result was a script so hollow and generic that while I could easily predict what would happen (after all, I'd seen it a hundred times before in different, much better movies), I didn't really care enough to do so.As for the acting, Shia did a decent job considering how little he had to work with, but he's always rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. Still, if you don't mind his other work you'll probably like him here. Megan Fox's performance was what you'd expect; she's there for her looks, not her acting ability. The rest of the live cast were either dumbfoundingly hammy (Turtorro), clearly phoning it in (Voight), or utterly forgettable (pretty much everyone else). The voice actors, though, particularly Peter Cullen, did a great job despite the lousy script. It's a shame they got so few lines.Finally, there was the direction, which was definitively Michael Bay. Like many trendy directors, his philosophy seems to be that the shakier the camera and the more cuts you make, the more ""intense"" an action scene becomes. Unfortunately, it almost always ends up turning it into a confused mess. That proves to be all the more true when the focus of the scene is two incredibly complex CG robots in a hand-to-hand brawl. As a result, one of the film's few redeeming features (ILM's impressive special effects) is largely wasted in baffling fight scenes that come across as a large moving pile of spiky metal pieces rather than two robots fighting for their lives.Overall, this was easily the worst new film I've seen all year. There are only three things that kept me from giving this awful movie a 1. First of all, Peter Cullen and the rest of the voice cast performed admirably. Second, as I said, the CG itself was amazing, as wasted as it was. Finally, there were a couple of fleeting moments where I did get a mild ""it's a live-action Transformers movie!"" rush (mostly due to Cullen). Unfortunately, they were brief, few and far between, and occurred only when the robots stayed relatively still, as that's the only time I could really tell what I was looking at. And that tiny thrill is more than negated by the fact that I can no longer wear my Decepticon logo shirt (which, until this movie came out, was one of my favorite shirts) without the hassle of explaining to strangers who try to start conversations about it that I thought it was an utterly lousy movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It had it all.,"Great movie.Although the plot and concept were actually quite a no-brainer, it pulled it off really well. The romance didn't feel too tacky, the emotional moments really felt emotional (which was a disappointment in, for example ""Iron Man""), the robots were of course awesome and the script was solid and funny. Top notch.The high score mainly comes from the fact that it felt philosophical as well. It wasn't really that strongly intelligent, but it does put you to think. The end monologue by OP also felt really moving.Altogether a great movie and I can't put my finger on why this movie has a 7.5 and a movie like iron man has an 8.3. When the quality of both movies is objectively viewed, I'd definitely switch the scores.Anyway, definitely recommended. I hope they don't make a sequel. I usually feel they should go on with the concept, but this is just one story and it should remain that way. Keeps us guessing. They kinda ruined Pirates that way, if you ask me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Effects were spectacular, but the story could have been MUCH tighter.","The difference between this movie and Star Wars - why this will be a cult fave with a certain segment of society and not a timeless classic - is the lack of a tightly crafted story to hold the terrific special effects together.There are characters that do not forward the story and disappear part way through the movie. There are new characters that should be introduced in the first three scenes that don't appear until mid way through and therefore don't have the impact they should.Every film maker learns that job one is to make every scene move the story forward, and Michael Bay fails to do this, which results in a 2 hour+ movie that leaves you feeling a vague lack of something instead of a tight 1 hour 50 minute movie that ties up all loose ends and gives every story thread the expected pay off.It's worth seeing if you love great special effects and ""Independence Day"" style alien a$$ kicking, but don't expect the completely satisfied feeling you get from seeing a great story brought to life on screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Michael Bay's best movie yet, and easily the most enjoyable movie of the summer.","Michael Bay seems to have a certain philosophy when directing films, when in doubt, blow it up. This has gained him a mixed reputation as a director, some applause him for his ability to blockbusters, while other's think he is a shallow, untalented director.So when it was announced that he would direct the big screen adaptation of a cartoon series which has a huge cult following, as you can imagine, the reaction was mixed. It is therefore could to see that he has defied expectations and made an extremely enjoyable film.Lets get one thing straight first, this film is about robots fighting robots. It does not have any serious issues in the plot, any social commentary in the concept or any intense conversations. It is about robots fighting robots. Therefore, those with any sense should expect this to be fully loaded, brain-pumping and mind blowing as cinema should get. Bay gives us all this, and proves that he is one of people to go to in making kick-ass action movies. The set pieces are incredible, the CGI believable, and explosions breathtaking. Sometimes it seems a little too much, but when you 30ft robots firing missiles and toppling cars, you be foolish not to expect that.Another great thing that helps the film is the comedy. Bay who is no stranger to the genre with films like Armageddon and Bad Boys I+II gives us some hilarious gags, which work great with the rest of the film. The scene in which the transformers search for the glasses at Sam (Shia LaBouef)'s house is a great example of slapstick, and keeps the film on the light tone which makes it so enjoyable. Shia LaBouef is terrific on-screen, and gives the film it's best performance. A natural comedian, he has a great blend of Woody Allen wit and Tom Hanks In-willing hero which makes him a very entertaining lead. Watch out for his scenes with John Torturro, as the two have great gravity on-screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good fun, but nothing else...","To most kids growing up in the 80s, the word ""Transformers"" had one very special meaning: fabulous vehicles able to transform into giant robots. And when I say ""most kids"", I don't mean only American kids, as this concept, created by the Japanese toy company Takara, became truly a worldwide phenomenon when in 1984 the American company Hasbro launched the ""Transformers"" toy line with a captivating back-story. What started as a toy line became a full fledged epic tale detailing the adventures of the Autobots, a group of heroic Transformers who protected Earth from an evil faction of their own people who called themselves Decepticons. More than 10 years later, ""Transformers"" remains a popular concept, and proof of that is the fact that filmmaker Michael Bay has directed a live action film about it. Sadly, the result is far from being more than meets the eye.In ""Transformers"", Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a young high school student whose biggest wish is to own a car in order to impress his beautiful classmate Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). Unfortunately for him, all he can afford is an old rusted Camaro with a tendency to fail at the most inappropriate occasions. One night, he watches his car move by itself, and he follows it to a junkyard, where it transforms into Autobot Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). This won't be the last of his surprises, as after this discovery, he'll be chased by another autonomous vehicle, a police car. Bumblebee manages to save Sam and takes him to his fellow Autobots. Their leader, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), explains Sam that this is only the beginning of a new chapter in their constant war with the Decepticons, but that Sam has the key to something that could end it once and for all.Developed by writers John Rogers, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, the screenplay for ""Transformers"" essentially moves between two main stories: the constant war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and Sam's coming of age story. In fact, this last theme becomes the most important of the two, as the film focuses a lot on Sam's friendship with his sentient car, Bumblebee, as well as his wish of being Mikaela's boyfriend. Several more subplots are added, some very interesting and some pretty pointless, but unfortunately, the writers do a poor job in tying everything together and the result is a convoluted story that feels awkward in its poor balance of action and comedy. The writer's attempt to develop their character is certainly commendable, as they truly manage to humanize them in a fairly believable way. Sadly, it's not good enough to save the script.As usual with Michael Bay films, his style ""Transformers"" is more eye candy than real storytelling, as he puts a lot more emphasis on fast moving action scenes filled with special effects than in the story the writers delivered for him. Of course, I know it's obvious that the special effects of the giant robots is the movie's main selling point, and they are the reason the movie was made in the first time; however, Bay's trademark quick-cut style of editing together with his shaky camera-work make very hard to fully appreciate the work of the special effects team, as Bay seems to believe that to make a dynamic action film he needs to keep the camera constantly moving without a real reason. If there's something to praise in Bay's directing, that would be his decision of making the Transformers look the most realistic possible, as it adds a lot to the epic nature of the storyline.The acting in the film is pretty much average, with Shia LaBeouf making a very effective performance as Sam, although he is in no way remarkable or outstanding. Mikaela Fox is sadly of the ones who make an awful job, as in this movie she proves that she was only hired because of her looks, not because of any real talent. On the other hand Josh Duhamel is truly one of the highlights of the movie, and one of the few who really adds a lot of power to the film. Hopefully Duhamel will become a rising action star in the future. In a nice detail, Peter Cullen reprises his role as the voice of Optimus Prime, and once again gives his character that the powerful presence it had in the cartoon. Unfortunately, that can't be said of Hugo Weaving, whose great job as Megatron's voice gets lost by an overuse of sound effects in his voice-work.Personally, the biggest problem I have with ""Transformers"" is not that it's bad (it is not), it is that it could had been a lot better given the elements Bay had to work with. I'm not saying the script is a masterpiece, as it seriously lacks focus and fails at mixing comedy and action, but the approach director Michael Bay used in the film only made it feel even more mediocre than what it is. While the movie has a wonderful visual look (no doubt thanks to Bay's experience making commercials), his frantic editing and sloppy narrative diminish the quality of Mitchell Amundsen's cinematography and the special effects team's masterful work. I won't deny that there are instances where his style works perfectly, and that the movie gets really entertaining in more than one occasion, but I couldn't help but feeling that I was watching a long commercial instead of the epic battle of robots that the advertising promised.""Transformers"" is one of those movies that provide instant entertainment and give the impression of being pretty cool, but end up feeling shallow when one begins to seriously think about them. That's probably the best advice to enjoy ""Transformers"": not to think too seriously about it, as ultimately it is as shallow as a TV commercial. It's a fun movie with great special effects and some good performances, but it's not the great action movie that it could had been. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

When the OFFICIAL marketing for the movie began..and I realised it was Michael Bay AND Steven Spielberg behind the movie...I knew it was in good hands. The marketing was very well done...lovely trailers..especially the full trailer which is the one that begins with Sam's father taking him to look for his first car.The opening scenes in the movie were action packed...wow...Blackout was wicked!!! I went to the opening night and I was smiling from beginning to end and my friends thought I was going mad...but I was just so excited. Bumblebee plays a very important role in the movie and his character was cool. Michael Bay made you feel attached to Bumblebee. He was a true soldier as anyone watching the movie will realise as the movie develops. The plot was a simple plot..not cheesy..just simple..but c'mon...it's Transformers..what do you expect. It was still done very well...and the special effects were top quality...nothing looked fake. The introduction to the autobots and the decepticons,but mainly the autobots, made me feel like a kid again. WOW!! I want to thank Michael Bay for staying true to the fans..especially in attaching Peter Cullen to reprise his role as the voice of Optimus Prime..it just wouldn't be the same without him. Megatron was pure destruction and the fight between him and Prime was wicked...pure mayhem and destruction in the city. Oh yeah..look out for when any of the robots transform in mid-movement....damn awesome!!! I don't really root for bad guys..but honestly..Starscream and Blackout were just cool. By the way, after watching the movie..went home to dig out my old Super Optimus Prime. Plan to get the new toys too...and they're for me(27yrs) and not for my nephew and I don't have kids. Haha. It's the movie!! It's just SO splendid and brought back wonderful memories. Can't wait 'til the sequel. SPLENDID!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Transformers - The Most Funfilled, Action-packed Summer Blockbuster of 2007","Michael Bay isn't exactly notable for Oscar-worthy plot/character driven films, but he sure does know how to make one hell of a fun and aesthetically pleasing movie. Bay has taken the immensely popular Transformers franchise which had previously only been seen in the light of comic-books, toys, and cartoons and has brought it into the realm of the real world with this movie.The storyline is very straightforward in its structure as the quintessential, thematic Good vs. Evil piece: Two polar opposite factions of a robotic alien race (The Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron) duke it out on our lovely green planet in order to retrieve a cube that holds the power of the universe so that they can destroy it to keep the evil-doers from abusing its powers or use it with evil intent. Stuck in the middle are the two humans, Sam and Mikaela, who become entangled with these (incredibly cool) alien beings. The story goes on from thereon out detailing how the Autobots and Decepticons try to find the cube along with the help of Sam and Mikaela.Now honestly, coming into this movie, you really can't expect it to be American History X or Schindler's List dramatically uncovering deep flaws or triumphs in humanity, but what you should expect is loads and loads of fun, which you will surely receive. From the get-go we get an incredible action scene that has a helicopter transformer wreaking complete havoc on a military base somewhere in the Middle East. Simply put, it's amazing. However, being a Transformers fan as a child, the most thrilling scene was when they introduced Optimus Prime and the other Autobots, which is pretty self-explanatory.The movie is unbelievably captivating--it's stunning visually and the CGI/special effects are flawless. Every single action scene had the audience cheering for more and more of the jaw-dropping effects and ""wow"" moments in the theater I was in.Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox do well in portraying their characters, despite some moments of awkward adolescence. There were some questionable plot holes in the movie, such as some times when certain characters were left in a cliffhanger of a scene and then never heard of again. However, that's totally okay because I don't think anyone actually cared or paid attention to those characters as they only became roadblocks to the next awesome action sequence. Also be forewarned, there is a whole lot of product placement in this movie. Every few minutes you'll be sure to find some kind of product that companies have sneakily endorsed into the movie.9/10 because it achieves what it is meant to be and never tries to be anything else. It is consistent in its structure not to mention (yet again) completely awesome and action-packed despite some problematic storyline details. So be sure to catch this movie, because it's probably going to be the most fun you'll have in the theaters this summer.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Can't get better than this...can you?,"I loved this movie. Being a fan of the G1 Transformers, this movie did not disappoint. There was non-stop action from beginning to end. it had it's awkward moments, if you had kids with you you know what I mean, but they were still funny. I also liked the fact that you could have walked into the theater knowing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about Transformers and still understand the movie, the storyline, and the Transformers themselves. On the downside though...wait...there wasn't one. IF there was though, there's enough robot action and car/robot chase scenes to make that all better. when I first saw it, 7/2/07 I was like...'wow' this movie set the bar WAY up there for movies to come. When I most recently saw it, 7/20/07 it was still packed in the theater, so you know it's good, and at the end everyone clapped. it's the best movie of the the summer!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is a wet dream for anyone of my generation,"Transformers is about a group of robots with the ability to transform into automobiles and various other mechanical things, who come to earth to find the Allspark, the source of power and creation on their world, which was long since decimated by war. This is a wet dream for anyone of my generation, as the cartoon and toys were what I grew up with. But for me (as I was pretty much strictly a Looney Tunes viewer) Transformers was always on the fringe of what I knew. That does not mean that this movie is any less fun. When they make a movie like this, it seems like there are really only two directions to go: ham it up, or take the ""Batman"" route and make it as serious as possible. This one did choose to ham it up and I don't think it was the wrong decision. It is still a very action packed sci-fi fan's movie. Transformers is great propaganda for joining the army, much like the TV show ""24"" makes being a counter terrorist agent seem cool. I enjoyed it anyway. It is super violent, but most of that violence is robot-on-robot in a hyper blown cartoon-ish sort of way. I was definitely struck by how it made being in the military look so cool, with all of its weapons and toys and definitely a lot of respect shown to all of its men and women. One complaint: it is a little hard to see what's going on in some of the action sequences. It is very fast and all CGI. The sound is booming and very effective, but the actual visuals don't always cut it. The plot (as if anyone cares) does the job of bringing the Transformers into this century, with our present world conflicts, and for the most part it works. Any general cheesiness in the dialogue or situations, for me, was easily forgiven by the fact that, well, it's from an '80s cartoon and toy. Good movie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Despite it's flaws, a stellar movie","I must confess I did not feel much smarter leaving the cinema yesterday evening, but despite this, the rush the movie gave by pure action and spectacle was more than enough to keep me not just interested, but excited about the movie for it's 144 minutes, craving more at the end.Script wise, the movies may not be worthy of a Nobel price, but succeeds greatly in transforming the original material from the series into a working movie. Clichés are however to many for a European audience to handle very well. The movie also spots loads of great humor, something which magically blends with what is probably the main feature of the movies: it's spectacular to watch.In terms of special effects, Transformers is beyond state-of-the-art. It literally shines, and the action sequences are incredibly well pulled off. The Autobots also look amazing, despite some weird changes in their size from time to time. Also, the sounds works very well, and nowhere better than in the voice of Optimus Prime, which for some reason gives the robot a character unlike any computer-created actor I've ever seen seen.The movie is quite simply a great experience. It mixes humor with amazing visuals, giving you a rush that screams for a sequel.If they manage to make the inevitable sequel carry the same level of action, but spiced with more depth in the story, this could be the beginning of something truly great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great  Movie with one HUGE drawback for me,"I have to say that this movie really started off strong and I thought that it kept up the intensity the whole way. This is really and 8 out of 10 for me but it had to lose at least one point for a big drawback in my opinion. Optimus Prime does NOT have a mouth. He has a shield over his mouth. Every poster showed him the right way, but them come movie time he has an exposed mouth and the shield only covers it when he is fighting. Are you kidding me, this may be really minor to some people but Optimus is my favorite character and he has been since I was a kid (mainly because of his look). It's like Michael Bay said ""I believe that people can suspend reality enough to believe that cars and equipment can turn into robots, but it's a little far fetched to believe that one could talk without a mouth"". UGH. He doesn't have a mouth plain and simple and for whatever reason that obviously has really gotten on my nerves. Other than that it had great Transformer action, which is all I was looking for. So at least something was done right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bloated, Insulting, Moronic,  Racist, Travesty... BAY MUST PAY!!!","Oh how I longed for this Movie. A Transformers Movie. How could it be anything other that amazing. I'll tell you how... Michael Bay, that's how! The man who gave us Pearl Harbour returns to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory once more. This was a sure thing. It was more difficult to fail than it was to succeed and in that sense it was a real achievement.The plot involves a teenage boy who has the fate of the world in his hands thanks to an item he listed on ebay. No, I'm serious. Hilarious set-pieces involve a dog peeing on Ironhide's leg and a prolonged and excruciatingly unfunny conversation about masturbation. If that's not enough humour this Movie offers us not one stereotyped black comic relief character, but THREE! Unbelievabley, one of these racist clichés is a transformer; Jazz the Token-Ghettobot. Just to further the cliché, he is the only one to die. Classic.As the Movie stumbles to a climax, our bland and idiotic heroes take the allspark (that's an energon cube to anyone who knows anything about Transformers) to the middle of a city to ensure maximum loss of life. Why not take it to a field or a desert or an underground bunker you ask? The answer is simple. When was the last time you saw a Pepsi commercial in a desert?So rather than looking forward to the greatest Movie ever, I'm looking back in utter disgust. Meanwhile Michael Bay is already planning Transformers 2. There is no justice...-. ..- -.-. -.- -.-- --- ..- -... .- -.--",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just like Old Times,"I saw this in Orange on a digital screen on one of the early screenings and kept going back.OK I'm 27 and long ago boxed up my transformers from childhood. But I had to see this movie. If you're like me, you remember Optimus Prime, the hero of heroes. Since Star Wars has come and gone, there are few articles of childhood left to see again on the big screen. Transformers is one of those toy marketing schemes that actually made interesting characters, and of course, sold a lot of toys.I am highly skeptical of Michael Bay. Not only does he make crappy movies, but he has to destroy a nice car in the middle of it all. But here, I give the guy a pass.I like to see my home state on the silver screen too. They filmed the ""Qatar"" scenes in Alamogordo, New Mexico. So about this movie...I was entranced from beginning to end. The dialog was sometimes a little to rapid fire and nervous, poor megan fox had almost nothing to do, some characters were out of place and plotting weird, but in the end, the film is a winner.The effects really do sell the film in every scene. Bumble Bee, Optimus, all of them are extremely well ""acted"" by the talented computer animators. There needs to be some kind of acting award besides special effects for this thing.Yeah, megatron comes up out of nowhere. Lots of the plot make little sense, but hey I sat down and watched some old episodes on Youtube and found that i couldn't even follow what the hell was going on in the cartoon. I would say in the movie, they made an improvement with plotting.The Decepticons are effectively menacing, especially when Barricade confronts Sam on the hood of a car. That one was actually pretty startling. I've had nightmares as a kid being chased by giant killer robots and yeah, this one got a little close. Enough of my freudian fears.This movie delivered, it was superbly entertaining and very very well done. I don't quite acquit Michael bay for Pearl Harbor or destroying the Ferrari 355 in The ROCK, but here, he gets a pass. Can't wait for the multi disc DVD. Bring on the sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely Horrific!,"Trash! Trash! Trash! Do not see! Do not see! Age recommend (8 and Below)(50 and above). How I hate michael bay so much, let me count the ways.

I almost shed a tear for what I had to watch and it wasn't that the movies wasn't exactly like the show or the comics etc. It was just a stupid movie made by an even more stupid man. I must admit I fell for Bay's trap. The trailer is maybe one of the best I have seen. Steven Spielberg as producer. What potential.Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! I want my money back!

chester,I rather enjoyed the comical read that my predecessor has posted about this movie. I find it rather entertaining that he's trying to talk down about so much in the movie. I think its comical how he goes off about all the culture stuff they try to feed you. ITS A MOVIE. It's a great movie. If you grew up in the time of transformers you will be familiar with the voices and all. Don't listen to the guy who just wants to try and bring people down. Should be less negative. Sure there are some spots where you kind of go.. uhh OK.. But in the end it is a rather enjoyable film. I'm sure this chester fellow will talk down about many other movies and try to make people lose interest. If your interested in it.. watch it.It's an awesome movie.Take from it what you want.

"Transformers, Exceeded my Expectations!!!","I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of what seems to be the biggest summer blockbuster, Transformers. After seeing the trailer, I became more excited than ever to see this movie. I expected to see a lot of action and some slight humor. I had very high expectations for this movie. And it surpassed all of them.Though in a competition with some of the biggest summer blockbusters in history, most of which were sequels. Transformers held it's own and exceeded expectations. Which is impressive in itself, seeing that Transformers is held to such high standards. It was not a short movie, by any standards. Two and a half hours is more than some can take in a theater. But, I personally don't have a problem with a long movie, as long as I am entertained. And I was.Half way through the movie, I was curious to see if the movie could sustain its steam. And didn't know if any more excitement, and laughter could come from this movie. But, I was very pleasantly surprised to find, that it didn't lose it's steam. Transformers was incredibly entertaining throughout the entire two and a half hours.I expected very large action scenes and incredible effects, and it transcended all expectations. The new effects, were outstanding. And made the action scenes so much more exciting and captivating. But, what surprised me was the incredible humor that this movie contained. I expected to laugh, and I expected the funny ""one liners"", but I did not expect to laugh so often and with such intensity. Transformers was hysterical, I loved every minute of it. Even more surprising than the incredible humor, was the heart behind the movie. You begin to care for the ""Autobots"" and can't wait till the ""Decepticons"" get what is coming to them.This movie was also very well acted. Adding another notch under his belt Shia LaBouf made a charismatic, funny, lovable Sam Witwicky. While the always charming Josh Duhamel added a great performance as Captain Lennox. Both men were a good add of ""eye candy"" for the ladies to enjoy. But the men have plenty to look at as well, with the gorgeous Megan fox as Mikaela Banes, the girl of Sam's obsession. And Australian bombshell Rachael Taylor as Maggie Madsen.All in all, this movie exceeded all of my expectations. The action scenes were even more than I expected. The humor, was funnier than anticipated. And the movie in all was exceptional, and worth the money to go see it. And I am a person who can't wait for the DVD, so that I can take Transformers home with me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best motion picture,"Simply the best movie i had seen at that time and basically still holding up that standard today, man; the soundtrack, the score, the cast do i even to talk about the visualsMaybe wink* wink* the best film ever made in (my opinion), clearly still dear to my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One long butt kicking commercial!,"First of all let me just say that I am not one of those crazy Transformers fan boys like the Elias character from Kevin Smiths Clerks 2 movie. I am familiar with the Transformers back from my Saturday morning cartoon phase when I was just a lad, but thats about as far as my previous knowledge of them goes. I arrived at this movie expecting a typical Michael Bay summer blockbuster effects driven adventure. I knew it wasn't going to be Oscar worthy material, keeping that in mind, I found myself being rather entertained, and not totally disappointed.While the movie does hold a typical big budget summer flick running time, there is usually enough going on to hold your attention. Shi Labeouf carries his role well as one of the main human characters, I found myself enjoying everything he did more and more as the film went on. His co-star Megan Fox, while very very easy on the eyes, did not totally come across as well for most of the film. Near the beginning when you first meet her she seemed to me very wooden and stiff, but later farther into the film she seemed to get better and more into the role. The real stars of the film however are the Transformers themselves. The autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons led by Megatron duke it out and flex their metal muscle throughout the film. I also thought the cars were cool to, if not really excessive with the product placement. I think that with the exception of the classic camero, all the other cars they transformed into always had the logo front and center aimed at the camera.All and all I suppose that there are worse ways to spend two hours of your life. I think some of Michael Bays more adult rated R movies like Bad Boys 2 are better but I did not leave the theater to disappointed. Take it for what it is folks, a big budget summer popcorn flick, it has some bad, groan inducing moments, but it also had some wow that was cool, and hey that was pretty funny moments to!

Disappointed G1 fan...fun blockbuster w/poor focus,Like many people I grew up with the G1 Transformers and went in knowing that this movie was going to be different than the cartoon that I knew and loved as a kid. I wanted this movie to stand as original yet keep the elements that made the cartoon so special. Getting to know the personalities of each robot was what made the cartoon so endearing. Humans were the supporting cast. I know that it was a tall task to personalize each robot within 2 1/2 hours yet I believe that it could have been accomplished if the focus of the film were truly through a Transformer's perspective and not through Sam Witwicky's eyes. The time that was spent showing off Megan Fox's body (and all of the sexually driven teen-age humor) could have been used to build affection for the fun-loving Jazz (who was my favorite character back in the 80's.) I should have been able to feel some emotion from his death yet I was never given a chance to know who he was... very anti-climactic.All-in-all the movie allowed me to feel what it would be like if Transformers were in our world today. It did make for a solid July 4th weekend summer blockbuster. I did enjoy the brief glimpse into the personalities of the Autobots (especially Iron Hide) yet left the theater feeling that I wanted to learn more about them individually. Disappointment in the movie compelled me to throw in a couple episodes from my season 2 DVD collection of the Transformers it actually helped. Maybe the makers of the next movie will get it right (I'm still hoping to see the classic match-up between the Dinobots and Devastator!) Too much human and not enough robot perspective... which is supposed to be what the Transformers are all about... at least based on what I remember.Overall Grade: C+ Story: C Acting: C- Direction: C Visuals: A,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
American War Ideology,"If we define 'totalitarian regimes' as those which exercise propagandistic control over the values and interests of the ruled, then by this definition most Americans are living under a totalitarian regime. The 2007 film Transformers does not fall short of a militaristic call-to-arms. The conjuring up of post-911 imagery and the clearly modernist plot-purity of good vs. evil aligns this film with the goals of American military generals and Republican politicians. I watched the film in the Netherlands, and it seemed everyone in the audience noticed the film was radiating American military fantasies from the screen into the cineplex. The exhilaration of obscenity, the obscenity of obviousness, the obviousness of power, the power of simulation. It even included a clear recruitment message (which seemed ironic while watching it in a foreign country)--near the end the glorified American soldier, Josh Duhamel, turns to the main character, a sloppy teenager played by Shia LaBeouf, and says, ""You're a soldier now...."" A sappy orchestral chord fills the theater, as we apparently are to feel included in the act of 'becoming a US soldier' and compelled to join the Army Rangers to help the Autobots destroy the Decepticons in a galactic showdown with American accomplishment at the centerpiece.America is the only country which gives you the opportunity to be so brutally naive about films like this. In fact, some of us know films like these are simply part of the militaristic education in America: of learning obedience to our patriarchal authorities, of developing a taste for military 'action', and the constant reassertion and justification of the American military mission on the geopolitical scene. But back in the States, no other American seems to notice the film's pungent ideological consequences. The users on IMDb who dislike the film can only point to plot flaws or technical mistakes, or a general distaste for CGI graphics. Others point out that it simply wasn't violent enough. When our culture is as inundated as it is, there really is no desire to adopt a critical stance on films that represent our own ideology. And in fact most don't notice. It may be that the truth of America can only be seen from outside the fishbowl, since only there will you discover the perfect immanence and simulation of these values. Americans, for our part, have no sense of simulation. We are simulation in its most immanent state, and have no language to describe it, since we are an isolated model that communicates mostly with itself.As a result, just as Optimus Prime observed that humans were violent creatures, Americans are also the ideal material for an analysis of culturally-encouraged violence against other cultures. No more and no less than primitive societies were analyzed in their day. The same mythical and analytical excitement that made us look toward those societies today impels outsiders to look in the direction of America. With the same interest and the same prejudices.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Flashy Entertainment wins Summer 07,"After seeing the most anticipated movie of Summer 07, which was the corny Spiderman 3, and seeing Shrek 3 crumble, and Pirates getting lost in its subplots, the summer of 07 looked bleak when 4 months ago it had an all-star lineup. Then came the hilarious Knocked Up, a dismal and even cornier Fantastic Four 2, and a cliché Oceans 13. Then, it was time for the Independence Day Openers where Ratatouille cooked up a raving reviews. Finally, Transformers was released which exceeded my weary expectations and millions of others.The movie has the most simple, easy and cliché plot set up where two robotic races fight on earth in search of a higher power that a human unknowingly possesses. The plot is stupid, but it worked. Summer blockbusters since the mid 90's have had gaping plot holes, lapses and corny dialogue that critics sensationalize and zoom in on in their reviews. One could argue, that in almost every summer blockbuster the people's grade always is higher than the critics. However, I am fan of most of those blockbuster movies, I even enjoyed Armageddon. The story again is childish, but thats its purpose and the movie has a keen awareness of that, which gives respect to the eclectic viewer. Some critics call this set up garbage, which it is but most viewers ironically find the beauty in that garbage.The entire movie is pure, flashy, loud, intense entertainment. In fact, what critics seem dumbfounded on is, that is the contemporary definition of entertainment, loud, flashy, intense. (Think theme parks). Transformers is a roller coaster thrill ride that has immensely long lines of eager viewers waiting to experience it. Critics are baffled by the worlds taste of entertainment and disappointed in this, making them somewhat pompous but paradoxically sincere. The movie ultimately has no dull moments unlike in Pirates 3 where many were abundant. The movie's pacing is what keeps the viewer distracted from its corniness. The editing is top-notch where the viewer is given not many chances to see the action from a stationary pov. Though, I and many others like that flashy and quick editing, which takes away any dullness and sharpens the entertainment. This is in no way tailored for people who don't like frenetic shots, or quick in yo face visuals. This movie is tailored for thrill-seekers and it is one of the best.Shia Labeouf, a fast and rising genuine actor, like many people have said is the glue of the film. His performance makes everything seem real, his performance pays respect to the audience which gives his character dignity. His relationship with his car, is the aspect of the movie that drew me in. A guys relationship with his car has its special overtones that are found in this movie. At the end of the movie I shockingly found myself caring for Bumblebee and Sam. This relationship in the movie subtlety brought partially profound human emotion to the table, something usually absent from blockbusters shallow and ""convenient"" emotion.The Visual/Special/Sound/Bay effects polished and polished this movie, until it became a beacon for pure eye candy. The photo-realistic robots battling out amongst humans is breathtaking. The transformations are so cool. The Transformers themselves I found a little on the dumb side, but what i think many missed is that the Transformers are almost mirroring society. Though stereotypical it is what it is, most people are hypocrites when they so adamantly state stereotypes are bad, when they are typing every day. The Transformers, basically picked up and were influenced by the media and entertainment side of society according to the script. Very clever aspect of the screenplay.Despite its shortcomings in plot, weak supporting human characters, the movie transforms these weaknesses into pure entertainment. This is the next Pirates. Hopefully its sequel wont parallel the Pirates sequels.8.5/10 cause IMDb needs to get a better grading system.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More humor than action,"Michael Bay's new blockbuster is doing well in the theater. It takes the 80s cartoons premise and puts in the the 21st century with cell phones and ebay...The story is not the strong point of the movie. Afterall, this is based on material made for kids in order to incite them to buy toys. I was one of these kids in the 80s and still have some Transformers somewhere at my mother's house, so I was familiar with the concept, although not hardcore--for instance, I knew about Optimus Prime and Megatron, but only remembered of Bumble Bee once they mentioned his name; I recognized some robots, but no other names. This movie was partly targeted to my demographic that regard this as nostalgic of our youth, but also to a new generation of kids & teenagers.Once you accept that the story is going nowhere fast, the movie is quite successful. It has one-dimensional characters, but excellent one-liners. What surprised me the most from Bay, which I regard highly in terms of action sequences, is that the humor was better than the action. The CGI work was good (not great) and some interesting action finally occurred near the end. I'm thinking of a few great shots in the street like a transformer that jumps over a woman in slow motion... but overall the action was not up to par to Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor & Bad Boys II in my humble opinion.The comedy did work for me and my friends though. We laughed quite a bit and a few nods were there for the casual fans of Transfomers like myself.Overall, this movie was an entertaining summer flick. Do not expect a masterpiece, but expect to be thoroughly entertained for 144mins. Oh yeah, I almost forget for those who care, but the two female leads are hot, very hot. Sure to give a few more tickets sales for a movie like this. But with Bay, it's mostly all jokes and eye-candy anyway.Lastly, there is quite a bit of product placement, mainly GM & eBay.

Brilliant in 3D,"This movie is actually the best one in the genre (if you see '80s cartoons as a movie genre). It has a lot of funny moment, while the plot is being built up. It has very few of the original transformers (there are like 5 Autobots and 5 Decepticons) but they all have a personality and they really act accordingly (although Prime is a bit less static than wee remember him). The movie is a rock solid 8 out of 10. So why did I give it 9 out of 10? In the original movie (cartoon movie) there is a fight between Megatron and Optimus Prime, Prime says it's the final show down ""one shall walk, one shall fall"". I really loved that and this new movie honors that. Like the little bumblebee in the windscreen of Bumblebee, the ""more than meets the eye"" theme is worked into the movie and the only thing they neglected is to put (a new version of) the old theme in with the end titles.

Please don't take my opinion in a bad way, the movie is really cool and it deserves to get praise, especially Shia Lebouef and Michael Bay, BUT I think that a little of the amazing credibility that IMDb had, was lost in the latest months by over-estimating judgements with a lot of the latest movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I remembered the cartoons, and kind of liked them, but it wasn't as if I actually was a fan or anything. Of course, I remembered Optimus Prime and did hope to see him on screen.So the movie started, and I tell you, my mouth has been opened for the complete opening scene. So many things happen, so many things take place, that I was utterly stunned. As Micheal Bay is not a great director (understatement of the century) he needs to get his audience's attention in the first couple of minutes. Well, he sure got me!Transformers has superb graphics; the CGI is amazing. The way Bumblebee transforms, as if it's something that you see everyday. Compliments to those who did that stuff.But I've got to state something. This is a real guy's movie. It's got hot chicks, (yes, I agree, they look great in their skinny bikini type clothes and botox lips)war, fast cars (especially the 'new' Bumblebee, what a fine car) and heroism. What's in it for girls to watch? Well, it's exciting, and the guys are OK. Don't get your hopes up though; this is a typical boys-night-out movie and if you take your BF he might be a little too interested in either the leading chick or the Australian lady. But, whatever suits you!And compliments to Jon Voight. He's still cool, save the Anaconda part.Go and watch this movie, expect great CGI, babes, cool music and excitement. Don't expect a great story, deep characters or a message. It's summer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Different Director=Better Movie,"I saw Transformers the other night and even though I wasn't disappointed, my expectations weren't exceeded.First off, this is a very cheesy movie. However, I can understand this. If you are going to see a movie about fighting robots who transform into vehicles, you have to be able to expect a cheesy aspect to the film. I even thought that some of the cheesiness was funny and was also good addition that brought a good sense of humor to the movie.However, the real downfall of the movie is the directing. I mean the casting was good, the CG was good, the script was alright, and the everything else was pretty decent. However, when it came to Michael Bay, I was disappointed, just like I am when I see most of his movies. I think he has potential, but he is still young and has to discover more of his talent. Really, that is the only complaint I have about the movie.Transformers was one of the better movies I have seen this summer (unfortunately thats not saying much) and I will probably buy it on DVD. However, Michael Bay took the my rating down to a 6.5 out of 10. Hopefully Transformers 2 will be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Man, Hollywood REALLY likes to waste it's money!","It has been only a mere 3 to 4 weeks since I saw Transformers, and, gott in himmel, I will not say anything that someone else have already said. But, man, it really was an awful, terrible movie!!! Why would people like to consume that kind of junk? And I'm a BIG Transformers fan!! I mean, I watched all the episodes back when I was a kid. Not so long ago, I bought a ""special edition"" with the first 4 episodes. And still can't believe how bad the movie adaptation was! Does somebody want's a proof? See ""Armaggedon""!!! See ""The Island""!!! I just saw that one a few days ago, and maaaaaaan, was that a huge mistake!!!!??? You could say that this kind of movies exist with the only purpose of making even more valuables the good movies: you know, the ones with a good story, a coherent script, the ones which don't have as a main purpose to show the tits of the girl o' the moment (though the movie is about some robots and their war?). There is something happening in Hollywood: it's in crisis. Thus, the writers' guild strike.

Cutting 20 minutes would have worked miracles,"I wasn't expecting much more than a parade of special effects. Surprisingly, the human actors helped balance the sometimes over-the-top CGI & cheesy plot. Shia LeBeouff was entertaining throughout. The scenes between him & his family were hilarious. Megan Fox? Yowza!!!The dialog was pretty lame for the Autobots......pretty much like the original cartoon. One thing is certain - Michael Bay is so wrapped up in his ""genius"" that he doesn't know how to edit a film. Less would have equated to more for Transformers. Besides, it's worthy of a sequel. No need to squeeze every possible action sequence into this film. The redundancy tarnished Tranformers' overall appeal.All the Transformers impressed me w/ the exception of MegaTron. They should have introduced a more ""true-to-the-original"" MegaTron earlier in the story.But really, this was a fun film. Surprisingly, it was also a great movie-going experience for me. People weren't talking, screwing their cell phones, or getting up throughout the film. It's rare that a film keeps the crowd engaged from start to finish. Transformers managed to do just that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Top 10 worse movies in 2007,"After seeing the reviews here and the surprisingly big rating, I decided to go and watch this movie. No big expectations though. I saw it 'da capo a fine', just to make sure I'm not missing anything.This must be by far the worse movie I've seen in the past years.This is not the ""it's so bad, that it's good"" kind of movie. This is limitless garbage. The plot is hilarious, with no regards to logic or reality whatsoever, the characters are VERY unconvincing, behind an acting which is absolutely horrible. I would like to point out the tremendously unrealistic ""British accent"" of Rachael Taylor (Maggie Madsen), a sort of mix between talentless acting and parody.The stench of rotten ""politically correctness"", distributed homogeneously in dialogues, casting and plot, is only equaled by the cheesy humour that can perhaps extract a blank smile from participants at the Special Olympics.The special effects are good, the only good part of the movie, but they also tend to become boring, in a flat and predictable way, just after the first few minutes, too feeble to sustain as a compensation the terrible ugliness of everything else.The movie is not a complete waste of time though. It must be seen, as proof that in the 21st century you can still make a bad movie with a huge budget.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformer The Movie Rating,"Transformers the movie was awesome it's the best action movie of the year great actors,special features and everything it is worth buying a ticket for.If you like jumping out of your seat with excitement this is the movie for you lots of excitement and comedy. This is my new favorite movie the theme of the movie is great you know it had to take a long time but it was worth it. Transformers is going to be put up for so many awards and has already won an award before it hit theaters. For best movie we haven't seen yet by the MTV movie awards. If there's a movie that has been nominated for an award and won even before it hits theaters then that is the type of movie i would like to see. There are a lot of action movie's out there like ghost rider,die hard,fantastic four,spider man etc. but transformers wins them over hands down. Transformers like any action movie has it's villain hero problem solution etc, but is taken to a whole new different level of action this movie is compared to a roller coaster it has up's adventurous parts and down's slow but good parts of the movie so go see the best movie of the year(DON'T WAIT GO SEE THE DARN MOVIE).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
horray explosions,"There is a mystery to cinema because it is an illusive art. It is an artistic collaboration and for that reason it resembles a labyrinth with no center. In viewing a film it's nearly impossible to pin down where a given creative touch is coming from and the result is that the aesthetic heat of a film is generated as from a house fire instead of a single match. This analogy holds true that a good script is doused in gasoline and a talented director is like a propane tank in the basement, such that a burning house can take on the impulse of dynamite. And in the absence of explosive potential a movie can simply burn up resources and create a mild spectacle.With this comparison in hand, a Michael Bay movie is like taking 150 million dollars worth resources, assembling them in a huge special effects pile and lighting it ablaze, then stand back and watch it for a couple hours. Yes it is mildly entertaining, and lots of people who happen past will also stand and watch the massive fire, you could even charge admission. But is it art? Well I guess that depends on what you call art.I enjoy watching building demolition. To see a large formidable structure give way by the force of a controlled explosion and crumble into dust and rubble entertains me. I know that these demolitions require a high degree of technical prowess. The buildings structure is taken into account, charges are set with explosives which is not a simple task, and controls are enforced to insure things go smoothly. The result is something that I find entertaining to watch. Do I consider it art? Well sure, why the hell not? It involves degrees of ingenuity and creativity, but it's safe to say that there is no Matisse of building demolition. This is because building demolition is limited by its practical application, which is to take down a building rather than express a higher degree of cultural relevance within the practice of demolition. In the same way a Michael Bay movie is limited by the practical application to make as much money as possible. Can't really hold that against him, but at the same time there is no need to give him more credit than what's due. So to say that Transformers is anything more than an explosive semi nostalgic money grab is similar to saying cotton candy tastes great and won't rot you teeth. That kind of talk gives you cavities.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Enjoyable, but nothing else.","Transformers (2007) is purely an action film. All aspects of the movie are inferior to the on-screen spectacle of massive fighting robots, car chases and explosions. Luckily, most people were expecting just that, as was I.The intensity of the film is indeed one of its strong points. Another is the incredible CGI. The computer generated Transformers blend in seamlessly with the surrounding cityscapes and create a visually appealing action movie. The camera-work and editing is a bit too fast at times, making some fight scenes hard to follow, but creating a certain dynamic as well. Also the plot is as thin as a single sheet of paper.But that is not what bothered me about Transformers. The problem is that this movie was catered too much to a single target audience: young males in the ages 12 to 18. The teenage lead characters enforce this by stumbling around in romantic scenes and blurting out jokes that range from horribly unfunny to half decent at best. The acting is not one of the films strong points either. This combined makes the ""human"" scenes far inferior to the action / robot scenes. Luckily there's more than enough action to be seen, which is the reason why I did enjoy watching this film.I somewhat recommend this film to anyone who can take this movie for what it is: A shallow sci-fi action flick that makes up for its meager acting, writing and humor by giving us a real visual spectacle. Nothing more, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
He is a genius!,"Ah yes, military bases - no tax on goods, cheap gas, and a sneak preview of Transformers. Michael Bay did one hell of a bang up job on this one.I went into the movie expecting a cool, product-placement movie, but what I got in return was a ridiculous but awesome film. From the get go, the movie is fast paced and the action starts quick. Then it slows down into a story building motion, but speeds up again after the introduction of all of the characters. Basically, the movie can be split into two parts: the ridiculous, comedic portion and the action oriented, blow your mind portion.As for the graphics, simply put they are orgasmically good. The transformations from car to bot, and vice versa, are smooth and flowing even in the middle of action. They mesh well with the environments and actually appear to be real without that CGI-texture look.Nerd or moviegoer alike, the movie is great and I would have spent my hard-earned money it if I didn't have the option of seeing this free screening. However, for the supernerds out there, there are a few inconsistencies in the movie but only they would let that ruin the experience.

dismal storytelling and direction. So-so spectacle.,"The film - what you'd expect from Michael Bay. Big, brash, dumb, peppered with irritating plot holes. Thin clichéd characterisation, fetishising military hardware, fetishising ridiculous bloated SUV vehicles. Incoherent and confusing action with diminishing returns (by the third hour, we are really getting sick of watching giant robots punching each other). All that regular stuff. Oh yeah - and at least half the movie takes place at magic hour. It's like sucking on a giant chrome exhaust pipe, while someone hits you over the head, while shining an orange lamp in your face.My point is a small one - but why is that American film makers (and audiences?) find it so hard to accept that other countries in the world have high technology? OK, in the movie we get a crack about the robot probably being Japanese, and about Nokia phones coming from Finland - but what the heck is the point of having a character describe the failed Mars lander ""Beagle 2"" as ""NASA/JPL"", when in fact it was a British craft, carried on a European Space Agency mission!

This movie Transformed the summer!,"This movie will probably be the focal point of the summer. This movie had tons of action and a great storyline.

In some parts I thought the robots were actually there, his emotions were spot on, and he didn't over act. I thought Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson were going to suck, but I was blown away by the acting they showed. I was surprised to hear that this was Megan Fox's first big movie because she seemed like a pro. This movie really appealed to the original audience, and the younger kids.

"I feared the worst, I enjoyed the finished product.","OK.I am one of ""those guys"" - I'm 30, I grew up being a huge fan of the Generation 1 Transformers. I still enjoy the concept, have a couple TF toys on shelves in my home office, that kind of thing. TF was my own ""Star Wars"" - the latter never having appealed strongly to me.Still, I knew I was going to see the movie regardless, just to see what they had done. Bay's movies have been basic no-thinking popcorn flicks that I haven't hated, so I wasn't biased against the directing at least. My girlfriend was equally excited, also a child of the 80s even though TF wasn't her toon of choice back then.I'm not going to detail the plot, as so many reviewers have done so before me. I just wanted to point out some things as one of those grew-up-on-it fanboys.The humor: It was good, for the most part. We all laughed many times in the theater. A couple of jokes were pretty bad (Bumblebee drenching Turturro), a couple scenes a bit too long (hiding in Sam's back yard), and ""My bad"" a gauche line for a noble character; but overall, lots of genuine laughs. Sam was babbling and neurotic (especially in the early parts), like Woody Allen on a speedball, and that got old pretty quickly - but at least he slid in a clever retort here and there.The plot: Not G1, but acceptable, decently conceived and fairly sensical. Sure, it's absurd to think sentient, advanced technological beings would need the help of a 17-year-old kid to find an artifact, but it was fine. Open end allows for a sequel quite easily, but it's fairly sewn-up as a oneshot if necessary. One plot device that I figured wasn't fantastic, would have been better if it was explained to the viewers (Sam does something crucial at the end of the movie, but we're not told how or even *if* he comes to the conclusion that it would work - a little thinking on the viewer's part is needed there).And by the way, I was struck by the sheer lack of TOTAL HYSTERIA that would ensue were even one giant robot appear in any city whatsoever. There were people close enough to the robot battles to almost be hit by them. I would assume those streets would have been EMPTY at the first quaking footfall of *any* of the robots.The bots: Many fans, myself included, were fairly angry at the new looks of our favorite characters as presented in promotional stills. Just not enough of the old charm in the new look, I thought. As for the vehicle modes, I somewhat understood the German car manufacturers' position on Jazz and Bumblebee, but the changing of Prime's truck form so drastically I didn't understand. As for the robot modes - wow, a billion moving parts all at once, huh? Hmmm, I suppose it makes more sense from a robotic-biology standpoint...Anyways - I came away from the film truly thinking of Optimus Prime as Optimus Prime. His color scheme, vehicle mode, and even that one awful line, were not enough to take the character away from himself. Peter Cullen had a huge part in making that a reality, too, and I hope he reprises again in any sequels to be made. Bumblebee was fun and likable, but not *quite* his old self... Aside from Prime, I'd say Jazz was closest to his original character. Ironhide was okay, but I think I remember the G1 Ironhide being more like an old veteran soldier than a hair-triggered munitions expert. Ratchet was the Spock of the away team here, perfectly functional and without exuberance. I don't really remember his cartoon self as much as the others'.The Decepticons were similarly almost-there. Megatron was every bit as menacing as, although there wasn't enough time to give him the sinister criminal mind of, his G1 self. Starscream was VERY de-characterized, having almost no personality, especially compared to the classic version. The baddies were plenty destructive, true to form, and at least they weren't limited to a scheme that would have been a 22-minute plot-foiling-waiting-to-happen in 1983. Oh, and Frenzy was annoying as hell - but I'm glad they saved Soundwave for the future instead of forcing the angular spider-bot on us with that iconic name.Speaking of icons: surprisingly to me, Devastator was the one character I had the most complaint about the change to. In the movie a heavily armed and armored tank, but in the cartoon series a gestalt of five large construction vehicles forming a massive robot. THAT would have been 1. worth the title ""Devastator"", G1 nod or not, and 2. A *very* cool (and large) thing for the viewers to behold.VFX: Everything looked good, realistic as could be done with so many moving parts... I think they stretched the existent mass as far as could go without actually increasing the amount, sometimes, considering a car the size of that Camaro turned into such a huge robot, for example. When he reverted to car-mode from bot-mode as the 2009 Camaro concept, I really had to ask myself ""Now if all that went in there, how is there going to be seating space for Sam and the girl, guys?""Additionally, I'm sure you've read it already, but some of the fight scenes were shown too close to see what exactly was being done on the screen.All in all: I really enjoyed it, and while some of the faults I found with it were fairly big (to me), the overall presentation was good enough to keep the issues at bay.

good,"Transformers delivers what its supposed to ..... for a transforming robots movie. However, as an official Transformers movie, I find it way below potential. The transformation animation was excellent, though the camera was too close to the action to see it clearly in many scenes. i would also have preferred them to look a little less spiky and just a tad more like the original design of the 80s. It was most excellent to see the autobots together and the various homages to old school material was done well (transforming noises, catch phrases, the dam scene from the cartoon pilot). The dialogue was typical summer fare which seemed dumbed down in many places and a few scenes were just plain ludicrous. A side note for the director, if you have to have more human time because of budget, please make those scenes more believable than the invading alien robots that transform scenes. It has the love story thrown in but was done halfway decent with just a few 'groan inducing' moments. I overall enjoyed the movie though it could have been better, much better, epic even but then again it could have been worse. There was too much needless sexual innuendo for my taste throughout imo. Its as if transforming robots who want to completely destroy each other isn't enough to keep the attention of the audience?! My biggest beef with the movie is the same with most movies in that too much time was given to the humans rather than to the robots or aliens, etc. As the movie progresses, not enough time was given to learn the robots personality (Starscream and Megatron for example). I do think it captures some of the cartoon feel yet it is still squashed by too much human time. My BIGGEST want for the next movie would be more robot time and some good back and forth dialogue between them, not just action. And of course Devastator would be nice; The REAL ""Your Destruction is Imminent"" Devastator, hint hint. ""Transform and roll out"" (stupid traffic, if only my car was a transformer :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2 1/2 hours of Power Rangers,"You have to admit there is some truth in the title of my review. TRANSFORMERS was definitely one of the films I looked forward to seeing during the summer. The trailers looked awesome, and I couldn't wait to see the movie. I walked out with mixed feelings, although the feeling of disappointment outweighed my more positive feelings. But time has passed, and I'm slowly appreciating the movie a bit more.The first fifteen minutes are very promising, providing humor and great character development. Shia LaBeouf is in the lead role, and he is fantastic! His character has a great, lovable personality you just can't resist. The scene where he buys the car, however, left me with a strange feeling because it was so fast-paced and different.Next, we're trekking through the desert with a unit of soldiers when they are greeted by a transformer. These action sequences are spectacular. However, they serve almost no relevance to the overall plot of the movie, which by the way, is a very interesting plot.While being your average ""unqualified person must stop beasts from taking over universe and get girl"" plot, it has its own unique way of presenting itself, providing great action sequences and awesome special effects. While the plot is obviously unrealistic (because it's a sci-fi film), it comes with some unrealistic moments, such as a 5 foot Transformer making its way through a sea of people without getting noticed.This is one of several problems with the film: not being realistic. People's reactions to the Transformers are not the way a normal human would react. The humor is just plain awful (Sam's Happy Time was just outright nasty), and the movie seems to take itself seriously during some scenes and then strips away its dignity in others. These problems are what make the movie strange and sometimes hard to watch.This goes for about an hour, right up until Sector Seven enters. The rest of the movie after the introduction of S7 is fine. Most of it is action, and of course the action is some of the most entertaining in movie history.One other problem I could actually feel was the film trying to be dramatic. Car chase scenes were spoiled for me because of random guitar riffs beginning to crunch, slow motion effects were painful to watch, and Optimus Prime talked as if he just came from the recent Star Wars films. However, his voice was done to perfection.I would also like to tip my hat to the others who did the voices of the Transformers; although some of the lines were painful to hear simply because of how strange they were (""this looks like a good place to kick it!""), all the voices were magnificent.Transformers had the potential to be a great film, but it only turned out OK. Right now it's at an 8.2, but that will probably drop as more people view it. There is some truth about the title of my review; whenever it doesn't take itself seriously it feels like Power Rangers. That's the main problem; the film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be serious or not, and that makes it a bit difficult to watch, because you want to take it seriously, but you just can't at certain moments. Overall, I give this movie a 5.5- an OK film with some positive notes and some negative ones.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining and Refreshing. The reason we go to the Movies.,"All i know about Transformers is that it's a huge toy brand with a mass following that spawned a TV show and a film in the 80s. So, when i first heard that a live action film was going to be made i wasn't excited at all. I don't mean to offend any fans, but neither the toys or the cartoons had any effect on me during my childhood. I always found them ""silly"". However, with the release of trailers i knew Transformers the film was going to be one of the most visually stunning films and that it was aiming to have mass appeal.The film did not disappoint. It was realistic and original. However, it did leave me wanting more. Firstly, the cast was spectacular. Shia LaBeouf impresses the most out of everyone and the Transformers are great in design and personality. Not once during the film did the visual effects ""lose it"". They were truly flawless.The first half of the film is a charm. The humor is fantastic and the films story develops well. It's truly a crowd pleaser and i can even see my parents enjoying it. However, as the film progresses and more Transformers are introduced, less character development takes place. Hence, amongst the jaw dropping battle scenes in the second half of the film i felt hardly any emotion towards the Transformers and i kinda got out of touch from the film. Only Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are well fleshed characters that i came to care for. Furthermore, one aspect of the film that annoyed me is casting an Australian with a thick Australian accent in what is essentially an American role and film. To those who have seen the film, they may feel as i do, that her accent was a slight negative factor, too distracting and annoying.Despite the lack of Transformer character development the film is a spectacular beginning to what i hope will be a spectacular franchise. It was very refreshing to watch after a number of underwhelming and disappointing summer sequels. Unlike those other films, this film had heart and it delivered a strong message that is relevant to us all today. However, lets just hope with sequels that it continues on as well as it has begun. Maybe Spielberg who acted as Executive Producer could take over the directors chair.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I was totally mistaken!!!,"A couple of weeks ago I was bragging about how great Transformers was going to be, but I was wrong. The movie was just a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger action movie. No offense to Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg but the movie was a not well put together movie. The acting was horrible, some of the characters were annoying, the action was sometimes impossible to see because of how much stuff was going on the shot and the sound effects were extremely and unnecessarily loud. Also the whole movie was basically a comedy that really wasn't funny. The only thing I can't complain about was that at least I understood the story, even though there were some holes and incomplete character plots. Another thing that bugs me is why did the military decide to go to LA to have the robots fight where there are millions of people. Maybe you can figure it out.Even though I read the reviews about Transformers being a bad acting movie, I went to go watch the movie just to see the action scenes, I knew that the movie was not going to be any good. I am surprised that Steven Spielberg would help produce a movie like this. And in my opinion the only two good movies that Michael Bay has directed has been The Rock and The Island. As for Shia LaBeouf this isn't his best movie. Also John Turturro and Jon Voight sadly did not give a good performance in the movie.The three reasons why I am giving the movie three stars is because first Megan Fox is really hot, second the visual effects were amazing, and third even though the action scenes were a mess I still found it to be amazing on how they finalized the visual effects all together. This movie just shows how teenagers like me, go to the movies to watch movie junk like Transformers and don't experience what good film-making is. If you plan to go see Transformers I don't blame you, I went to go see it too. But, in my opinion you should save your money and go see a better movie like Ratatouille, but make sure you go in the morning so that you don't have lowlife parents bringing their screaming one month old babies to the theater. I am ashame on how crappy Hollywood is becoming with their movies. As a person who looks forward into studying film-making this movie is not a good example of how the film-making business is influential.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
1 word ...WOW!,"As soon as i sore the poster for this movie i thought to myself 'well that looks like a pile of crap', but then i sore the advertisement on t.v and thought I HAVE TO SEE THAT!. So i went and sore it and it was AMAZING. One of the best films i have ever seen without a doubt. The computer graphics were so good that at some points in the film it actually looked like the transformers were real and really there.Also what made it even better was that the young SEXY actress Megan Fox starred in it.It was just such a great film i could watch it over and over again. Mr Bay has most certainly done a fantastic job on this one.Overall i would like to say I loved it! and this film is definitely a MUST SEE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wheels Spinning, But Not Going Anywhere.","A seemingly unending war rages on between robots who are literally able to transform into most anything you can imagine (primarily cars and planes). The heroic Autobots and evil Decepticons take their war from the fledgling planet of Cybertron right to the middle of Earth. Now the fate of the galaxy and all mankind is left in the hands of Autobot Optimus Prime and his robotic soldiers. ""Transformers"" came about in 1984 and made a splash in the United States with a popular toy line and cartoon series. While definitely nostalgic and effective to a point, the concept is somewhat limited and simple-minded. This is what happens with this mainstream box office dominator which has cleaned up financially, but critically it needs a lube job. A wide range of actors have less personality and heart than the special effects-laden robots which are more reminiscent to those corny 1950s Asian monster entities than to 21st Century cinematic live animation. The film is too long, it lacks substance, it has no tone, it is short on brains, and its pacing is a total train-wreck. Even the visual effects and sound are annoying, distractive, and migraine-inducing. Director Michael Bay continues to make films that please audiences who just want to see lots of explosions. However, he fails to show any growth when it comes to mandatory cinematic elements like screenplay, characterization, storytelling, and even rudimentary aspects of cinematography and editing. Chaotic, loud, and ultimately pointless, ""Transformers"" was better left in the obscurity of its Japanese animated time capsule of the 1980s. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better then most, but was missing something","The movie was better then I expected it to be. It showed why it's worth turning some cartoons into live action films. I thought it was a nice touch that they used the same voice for Optimus Prime, as I remember when I was a kid. I can't put my finger on it, but it was missing something? The fx were fantastic, and the pace was fast, but it was alittle thick on the jokes made by human reaction, to seeing the Transformers for the first time. It was like watching the reaction Godzilla would get, but one to many times. The relationship between the lead character and his car was alittle less caring then it should have been. The movie was however, a great way to set up a second film etc. I think Transformers will be a great franchise, now that the introductions to humanity are out of the way, and we can get to the actual stories. The battle scene between Prime, and Megatron didn't lack any action, but it did lack the emotion, there battles showed on the cartoon. All that said, it is worth a view. Maybe not waiting in line, but surly worth the 140 odd minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
jaw dropping action,"this is the best action movie of the year and in fact the best I've ever seen .so much action from start to finish and its funny too. its so entertaining and a sure fire hit! when the robots start fighting after a lot you think its over, but no they were just getting started for the ultimate grand finale. the robots crash through buildings and a lot of other stuff, and destroy pretty much all of New York. the girl that Shia Labeouf likes is so sexy, she too fine to be in school. If you like transformers or not you'll love this movie. If you a kid,adult,boy or girl it appeals to absolutely everyone. This film will have you talking and have felt like you went on a fast ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"not bad, but not good either","First things first, as even the title state, the movie is called Transformers, so by default the story is shallow. Now shallow is not that bad if its written good, but it is not the case. There are to many sidelines that are just thrown in the story and linked together without any apparent reason ( the blonde analyst chick with the Aussie accent and the black hacker would have been so much greater if they were just cut out of this movie, and there was just to much about parents - children relationship at the beginning, I mean masturbation a.k.a. happy hour? stepping on the grass, trash cans? come on......)Now, when you see Michael Bay as director on a movie poster, you pretty much know what to expect, and that is action at its finest. Given the fact that we have 2 giant robot factions fighting each other kind of hand to hand, Bay doesn't disappoints, and delivers some fine shot action. Basically, the robots are great and they fight accordingly.The actors are appropriate for this movie. Jon Voight brings some pedigree to the movie, but it shows that this role was accept to pay the rent rather than to claim critics. Shia LaBeouf ain't bad, but it could have been Justin Long in his place or any other young actor with a highscool kid face, it really doesn't matter. Megan Fox is a fox, plane and simple, she is hot. Besides the robots she is the only edge that this move has got. All the other actors are just annoying and mostly unnecessarily present, especially Anthony Anderson. No matter in what I see him, he is always an annoying loudmouth. Attitude and verbal diarrhea with a high volume. Fire him.In a nutshell, good action, great robots, one FINE girl. Who needs story?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mixed feelings,"I finally got to see this after years of following the creation of it from the initial rumors to the announcement of Bay as director and so on. I was a very big Transformers fan in the 80s, and I'd consider playing with the toys to be a big part of my childhood. They were the last major toys I played with before puberty kicked in, so they have lingered as my favorites from back then.My feelings about the movie are mixed. I'll start with the good (which is always shorter because it's less interesting).It was the best Michael Bay movie I've seen. Granted, I've pretty much disliked everything else I've seen from him and I haven't seen everything. Armageddon remains the worst big-budget movie I've ever seen. But Transformers was a step up for Bay. The special effects were awesome and believable, and it was very cool to see the Transformers brought to life on screen. It's funny, I can remember saying after seeing Jurassic Park way back when digital effects were coming into their own that maybe they could make a live action Transformers, and lo and behold, here it is. The movie is visually arresting, and there are a couple of strong performances from Shia LeBouf and John Turturro. There's some humor and a good sense of fun with it.Now the negatives.For one, the robots didn't feel as much like individual characters as they did on the old cartoon. Their faces didn't look as much like faces, which is part of it. But they also looked too similar. The originals all looked quite a bit different. In robot form, they retained more of the look of the vehicles and other items they became. In the cartoon, you could see emotion on their faces and hear it in their voices. In the movie they were more like true robots. There also was no real portrayal of the relationships between the transformers. There was a bit of differentiation when the Autobots were introduced, but it wasn't too much. The Decepticons still all pretty much seemed the same.There were some regular Michael Bayisms that I didn't like either. Heroes are too heroic and bad guys are too bad, especially for a PG-13 movie. Granted, that's how it was in the source material initially, but over time, the Transformers cartoon became more nuanced, with characters rethinking their positions and switching sides and issues of insanity in Decepticon leadership making some Decepticons question what they were doing. The show became more sophisticated as it went. Perhaps it is understandable that the sophistication level dropped, but I had hoped the PG-13 rating would mean more adult themes. No, just a few more curse words.Another Michael Bayism I dislike is the glorification of violence. Now, I don't mind violent movies, but I don't like it when movies put a nice sheen on violence. If you're going to show violence, you should show its results. If you are going to show robots shooting up streets and crashing through buildings, you need to show some bodies. The original cartoon had most of its action happening in very isolated areas. The movie had a huge fight sequence in a major city and robots flying through buildings where it was actually shown that there were people working inside. A lot of people have a problem with violence in films. I have a problem not with violence but with a dishonest portrayal of it that hides its negative results.I also thought there were some lazy stretches of believability. The government trying to cover up what happened in the end by burying the bodies at sea was stupid because obviously people would know, seeing as how a city got ripped apart and there had to have been reporters capturing it. Also, the military leadership was way too honest with the public, with the Secretary of Defense telling people on air that they had no idea what had attacked them in the desert and all that.Yet another Michael Bayism is to depict military and political officials as simplistic, honest men who are purely heroic. Now, I think the portrayal of the soldiers themselves was actually pretty good, but the Sec Def is much more of a political position and I thought the character was basically too honest and straightforward.I wasn't too bothered by the physical differences between the original versions and new versions of the vehicle forms of the Transformers. The change in Bumblebee's car form worked for the movie and the old versions were very 1980s anyway. How can you make a movie now where all the vehicles look like they're from the 1980s? However, I didn't like that they changed the basic nature of some of the characters. Bonecrusher and Devastator were two separate characters. In the original, Devastator was formed by combining five robots into one, and one of them was Bonecrusher. It is also a sin that Megatron turns into a plane and not some kind of big ol' gun. He didn't look nearly enough like the original Megatron to me.Okay, I guess I've put enough effort into reviewing what was essentially a silly summer popcorn movie. It's just that it was a big part of my childhood, so I had a lot to say.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As Bad as Films Get,"Optimus Prime says ""Ooops, My Bad"" during a 25 minute long (I timed it because I was so bored in the theatre) sitcom gag of hide-my-robot-pals from my parents.Furthermore the film really isn't about Robots transforming and fighting their rival tribe. It's about:1. A young kid trying to score with the class bimbo.2. Computer analysts stealing government files and trying to crack a code while playing Dance Dance Revolution, telling the police not to step on grandma's carpet or she will get very, very angry, eating donuts and all the jokes that go along with eating donuts.3. A wise-cracking Government inspector getting peed on and taking off his clothes.4. How annoying it is to have to talk to an Indian guy when you dial long-distance.Perhaps if I would have known it was a comedy, I would have known what to expect. The robots take a back seat to a bunch of wisecracks. I went in with low expectations and was physically sickened by how bad this film was.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great adaptation of the original cartoon series,"I was a big fan of the original in the 80s, I was that age group that the toys/cartoons targeted. When at first I heard about this, I rolled my eyes and though of how bad it could be.I was very wrong. This is a good film. The story is there, the graphics are great and the lineage of the Transformers is nice. There are a handful of funny moments too. It's nice to see that this isn't one of those films where all of the good parts are represented in the theatrical trailer. That seems to be the case so often now a days.For me, watching the Autobots transform from the cars/trucks etc into the characters we grew up with in the 80's was a great part of the film. You look up at them and go whoa! I remember that from when I was a kid! Good Job Michael Bay!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Big, loud and stupid","I tried to think something sensible to say about Transformers, but came into conclusion, that I really don't have anything else to say, but to say congratulations for the special effects team that worked with the movie.Michael Bay isn't a subtle director who makes important, world changing movies. He is a man, who helms big, loud, stupid, overly sentimental and far too serious movies and he does it with pride and he does it well. Transformers is the statement for his skill of taking an idea that could turn into a great piece of garbage and churn it into a pretty entertaining movie about extraterrestrial robots, teenagers and the possible annihilation of the human race. He hammers the movie together with a sledge hammer and despite he sometimes fails, like he did with the Island, Bay manages to deliver with the Transformers.So yeah, that's all I have to say about this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Killer Robots From Outer Space: a moronic action flick,"If you like watching things move around and explode, you'll absolutely love Tranformers. However if you also want a movie to have a basic storyline then maybe Tranformers is not for you.There is so incredibly little story or character development, even for a movie about killer robots from outer space. If they can afford all those CGI effects, surely they can afford better writers? What was with the whole backyard scene? It was completely pointless. Whatever happened to the power-struggle between Starscream and Megatron? I don't mind a few small plot holes, but why didn't the decepticons just buy the damn thing off of eBay and have it sent to them!? It makes the chases and the fighting all the more ridiculous when you think about that. And the all too obvious open door to a sequel was just laughable.Anyway, it's mainly an action movie and the first helicopter attack seemed promising, but after that it moves from one car chase or explosion to the next. There's no build-up or suspense, there's no dynamics, it just turns the volume to 10 for the rest of the movie. What also bugged me, was that most of the Transformers fighting scenes are obscured by bad camera angles. For example, during the highway scenes, it suddenly cuts to random bystanders, and the action is somewhere off in the distance. And the organic robot design make the fights even harder to follow. First there's a confusing transformation and then two huge piles of scrap metal fighting each other. It's hard to even distinguish an arm or a leg.The movie tries to offer some comic relief but the jokes are painfully unfunny. There's an obnoxious super hacker who lives with his grandma and plays videogames all day, a giant robot ""urinates"" on a government agent for no reason, masturbation jokes, fart jokes: all very tacky. I thought the whole Indian telephone operator scene was just awful.I could go on about the shameless product placement, the pro-military propaganda, the incredible overacting, the stereotyping, the clichés etc. but I won't. I can't believe there are so many positive reviews, this movie is horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stunned,"I'll admit that i as a child i never really watched transformers and being 21, it was on in the prime of my childhood. What this movie did was make me feel that something was missing from my childhood, that i regretted never watching it as a kid. The movie had everything, top acting, top comedy and action scenes you never thought could be made in this day and age. I highly recommend everyone to go watch this movie in the cinema as you will not appreciate it on a home TV otherwise.The transformers never looked out of place, they seemed to belong to the scenery in fact which is what a lot of modern day action epics seem to be flawed in.The comedy value in the movie was amazing as well, i haven't laughed so hard at times in actually comedy movies, and i never heard the audience laugh so loud either.As i mentioned before, i never saw the transformers as a child. If anyone mentioned that word to me all i could say to them is robots and optimus prime but i still understood the movie fully so absolutely anyone could watch and enjoy the marvel that is Transformers.Rarely do i buy dvds, but this is a sure one to get and if a get another opportunity to watch this movie in the cinema, i will happily do it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
an overall entertaining movie,"when you think about what to expect walking into a movie like transformers, its basically what you get. There's no fancy dialogue or complex story lines, its just a fun movie with lots of action. The battle scenes are very cool and well done, and every time you see a Transformer move and fight, its a sight to be had.There is mild humor throughout the movie that seems to fit right in at the right point. Not sloppily done. The special effects of course are great and very exciting, i'm not sure if it was released in i-max but it should be. Im sure kids will love this movie, and it will become an instant kid classic.So when your thinking about a good movie to go out and see with your 12 or 13 year old child, this movie is perfect.

"Movie for boys of all ages, candy for both the eyes and the hormones","I had no knowledge of the transformers before this beyond a few vague memories of toy cars that turn into robots. I hadn't even realised there were good robots and bad robots until I saw this.The movie starts off with an attack on a military base by an unknown robot thing that resembles a scorpion. The military are unsure whether anyone survived, which a few soldiers did. There is also an attack on the computer system, with the firewalls all being hacked within seconds. The military bring in a group of hackers to try to work out where a strange sound heard at the time originated from. Meanwhile Sam Witwicky has to write about an ancestor at school and tells the story of his grandfather, an explorer who lived the last years rambling about a monster in the ice and Sam is trying to flog a lot of his old belongings on EBay to buy a car. Sam's Dad takes him to buy a second hand car and he ends up with a beaten up yellow car he soon discovers can turn into a robot.To cut a long story short, one hacker works out where the signal comes from and Sam's car is joined by a group of Transformers who explain that their world was destroyed and new Transformers are made with ""The Cube"". Sam's grandfather found a frozen Megatron who was determined to create a new race of Transformers, the Decepticons. The small group, led by optimus Prime, are called Autobots and they have to stop Megatron from being released and finding the cube. Of course the military have Megatron in a big freezer, just waiting for the hacker Decepticons to defrost and let loose when they find out who Sam and where they can find their master.First, this movie looks great. The action scenes are spectacular with great effects and a great combination of people trying to destroy the Decepticons and the Autbots having their own battle with them. The plot, for me, was a bit bizarre but if you don't question it it's easy enough to follow. I don't know how much of this followed the original legend.As for the actors, it's funny how all the guys look geeky except the hunky soldier types and the girls, even the hacker girl, all look like they belong in a magazine. Hmmm, definitely a boy's movie this, even without all the fancy cars and robots.The movie was far funnier than I was expecting, although from what I know not everyone is a fan of the humour in it. I liked that the Autobots all had their own personality and that their leader was almost like a school teacher looking after a disruptive class for some of the time. The voice actors all did very well, with Optimus Prime especially sounding austere and frustrated at the correct times.All in all a good fun movie, but I won't be buying it. Definitely one for the kids with the big robots and the teenage boys with lots of hormone candy of both the female and machine varieties. I'd have no problems taking kids to see this although there is some mild swearing, but the nature of most of the action scenes are fine for kids, there's no blood, just bits of metal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As bad as you could do,"Wow... just wow. How can anyone say this was good? Far too much of this film was zoomed in so close that you couldn't even tell what was happening. In the fight scenes you couldn't tell Autobot from Decepticon. The movie focused FAR too much on the human side of things... it is after all supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The choice of music for each scene was possibly the worst I have ever witnessed. I think if a real director had made this movie it would have been much better. Terrible script, average acting, continuously disorienting screenplay, tragically bad music choices. The only redeeming features were the special effects and cinematography, and special effects can be taken for granted these days and should really only rate a mention when poor.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply the Best,"What is there to say about this movie? Simply stunning and one hell of an eye candy of a movie!Cant keep being critic to point of even saying this is bad movie because the truth is it isn't! Michael Bay with his crew managed to bring about something which most directors can't... AND thats deliver something which keeps to the old by sticking to the original formula which made it work in the 1st place with fresh new look.Anyone saying this movie isn't worth anything get LOST. By the way great TV show.... but back to seriousness at hand here.... Am glad Michael Bay has done this movie and hope for him to do more. I was one of them non believers and after watching the final trailer there was some hope in there that this movie was going to be worth watching. I watched, I loved! and reason being, kept the robots feeling like the cartoon an even including some old school lyrics by Optimus from old '84 movie. And Acting wasn't bad either so kept the movie epic, what else you wanted?This isn't 80s anymore and if you think everything can be done like films of old, think again! This movie shows an proves the technology we have now days for awesome special FX movies can go beyond still. And am glad there wasn't more over-the-top fights between robots AND more types of robots!! Why? Well, why throw EVERYTHING in the 1st movie? All i saying, Sequel ASAP!

"Is this film really, ""More than meets the eye""?","What can be said about the Transformers that hasn't been said already? What haven't they been turned into? Surely you can't mention Transformers without the various cartoon series that have been created since the show and its beginning in 1984, or the annoying spin-offs from it. You can't deny they haven't been made into action figures, and you cannot forget the video games that have seen light on the PS2 and other systems, and of course, the Original Cartoon Movie cannot be forgotten. It seems like by now, Transformers have been recognized in several different forms of media, and are household names to America.Looking at Michael Bay, whose resume includes such horrid films as the Bad Boys movies, Armageddon (we all really like it because of the soundtrack, admit it) and the 3+ Hour Pearl Harbor (Which is probably the longest three hours anyone has sat through), it's too hard to say whether the reputation of the Transformers could be made better or tarnished by Bay and his direction of a long running cartoon show.However, Bay pulls off a movie that definitely does not sit on my top favorite movies of 2007 (His ranks lowest, against 1. Pirates 3, 2. Harry Potter 5 and 3. Ratatouille) but still makes a movie that I enjoyed watching in the theater, but I doubt I'll want to see again.Here's a brief summary: Sam Witwicky (Played Fantastically by Shia LeBeouf) is a junior in High School who gets what looks like a automobile that has something about it, something that the Dealer states (""A driver don't pick the cars. Cars pick the driver."") and soon gains a vehicle that looks like a nice way to pick up chicks (like Megan Fox's character, Mikaela), but has something more to it. It's an Autobot named Bumblebee, one of several seen in the movie.At the same time, in Qatar (Brush up on your geography for this one), several men fighting for the war (Played by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) get attacked by strange machines in the desert. Suddenly, the war turns to be battle between man and machine, but where do they come from? Are one of our allies (or Enemies) trying to take us out with special technology unlike any other seen before? As the movie advanced, it felt like it was going nowhere a bit too fast. A strange transmission that sounds like garbled talking on a shorting out walkie-talkie is the main focus for the most part, until we advance a bit more, and finally see some action.I will give Michael Bay this credit: He knows how to pace, to a point. His development on all the characters are significant enough to have time to explain them all, but it's a 2 hour, 24 minute movie. There must be a lot of fighting, right? Strangely enough, fighting doesn't occur enough.When a lot of money is being put into making a movie of this caliber, you'd expect a lot of fighting, especially since Transformers seem like they would be awesome fighters, but the movie has at least a maximum of 25 minutes of fighting, while the rest of the film is mostly character development that drags itself out to the point where it's not even character development anymore, it's just trying to extend the movie out until its large finale, but then even the fighting at the end is not enough. I craved for more.The audience that was there spent a lot of the movie in the bathroom or snack bar until the fight scenes came on, otherwise, a lot were talking and became bored. I was getting a bit annoyed with a movie this talked about and this big had less action than previously imagined.One thing about this movie that I enjoyed was the fact there the cast is having fun (sort of), little jokes and sight gags were pretty good, and the audience got a laugh when it was implied for you to laugh.I will say Michael Bay has made an okay movie. It's flaws are that it's a bit too long, and spends a lot of its time trying to move the plot, but tiptoes to the end instead of making it in bounds and leaps, and takes a long time to deliver action instead of granting us our wish of constant combat.As for the positives, the acting is well done, the characters have personalities (At least LaBeouf's and Fox's characters do) as well as the Autobots, and the film has a good way of recognizing when it's trying to be funny, while keeping in context of the T.V. Show.I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good news everyone, they haven't screwed it up","Before you read the following review, I want you to be aware of something: I am a huge Transformers nerd. Not big enough to name myself after obscure Japanese Decepticons or anything, but still geeky enough to have amassed a sizable collection of merchandise and regularly cry myself to sleep muttering ""oh Megatron, nobody loves you but me."" Therefore it was with some trepidation that I approached the eagerly awaited live action movie, especially seeing as all the pre-release hype seemed to be focused on Megan Fox bending over a car bonnet. And that it was made by Michael Bay and the last time he made a film with ""tremendous respect for the source material,"" we got the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Thus it is with some relief that I can sit here and tell you that the best thing about Transformers is that isn't a complete disaster. In fact it's really very good and one of the strongest no-brain blockbusters to turn up in a summer that's been filled with them. However, it's not without its faults.Now given my little introduction above, you're probably thinking I'm going to spend the entire word limit complaining about the character designs but I'll try not to. This is an entirely new spin after all and moaning about how Ironhide doesn't look like Ironhide anymore isn't going to achieve anything, (did Frenzy really have to be an irritating gremlin with a comedy voice though?). However, what can't be denied is that the majority of the Transformers in this film have zero characterisation and consequently, in the huge mass of violence that closes the movie, it's sometimes difficult to tell who we are meant to be cheering for. In fact only Optimus Prime gets a decent depiction and even Bumblebee, for all his screen time, is robbed of significant development by being burdened with the irritating gimmick of talking through an in-car radio, effectively ruining any chance of a meaningful, ET-style friendship to develop between him and Sam (Shia Lebeouf).On the plus side though, Lebeouf is really good. In fact, he's probably the best thing about the entire film, high praise indeed considering he's been cast as the human foil for audiences to cling onto when all they really want is two hours of robots smacking the living daylights out of each other. As Sam, he is nerdish enough to convince you that he could slip under the school hottie's radar for five years but at the same time, possesses a charm and sense of humour to ensure he doesn't go walking around with a ""gee whizz, how cool"" demeanour whenever a car explodes.Furthermore, the Spielberg influence is rife and gives the film a welcome degree of comedy. Sam's attempt to hide five robots that are bigger than his house from his delightfully-odd parents is arguably, the highlight of the storyline. It gives the proceedings a very human element which is lacking in all the scenes where Sam doesn't appear - the attempts to humanise the soldiers in the generic military combat zone at the beginning for instance are horribly cheesy and serve only to let anyone who's seen more than five films know that they'll be dead within seconds.And then there's the action. Where would a Michael Bay film be without action? And Transformers delivers the goods but sadly, doesn't deliver them enough. Three scenes really stand out: the Decepticon helicopter Blackout's introductory rampage, Prime's highway duel with Bonecrusher and Starscream's mid-air scrap with the US air force. Each of these moments is a terrific jolt of adrenalin but by and large, the robot on robot combat is a let down. Credit that to Bay's love of wildly over the top camera movements and inability to stay still for a second, as Bumblebee's ruckus with Barricade, and Ironhide scrapping with Devastator become confusing spectacles where it isn't clear who is meant to be hitting who. Alongside this is the fact that for large portions of the film, the robots, especially the Decepticons, are conspicuously absent, to the extent where your mind starts to wander while waiting for the next fight.Aside from these few complaints however is the sense that they tried to make the scope a bit too grand. The majority of the story is told from Sam's point of view, but at time it veers off to show events from the perspective of the military and a team of code-breakers. This fractures the story development and in truth, the film would have been far better if they'd narrowed their focus a bit and concentrated solely on Sam.But like I said, the good news is that Bay, Spielberg et al haven't ruined the franchise. Indeed, despite the impression I might be giving, Transformers is a very enjoyable movie and I welcome the prospect of future sequels, its just that I was always going to be bit extra-critical of this film. There is an undeniable degree of childhood excitement to be had watching the first transformation sequence and seeing Optimus Prime act like Optimus Prime, while at the same time sounding like Optimus Prime is a pure nostalgic treat. When it comes to it, for all the plot holes and complaints I've picked up on, the only thing that's liable to ruin Transformers for anyone is the fact that the Decepticons are rarely on screen, especially Megatron and Starscream who only show up for about five minutes each. If you're not a geek, add another two stars to the score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Action, Humour.......and More Action","Transformers Finally a non-sequel!!! It's not that this year's sequels weren't good, but you have to admit that the vast number of franchises was getting stale. In comes Transformers with as much hype to fill in the entire world's theatres, and whilst this film is not for girls, it is one hell of a ride for fans of the original animated series and even to those who didn't know who the hell Meagatron was!In Qatar the American military forces, are attacked by a mysterious and unknown force, which leaves many dead with the sole exceptions of Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his team. Meanwhile, back in the ""normal"" world, luckless Sam gets his first car, which incidentally turns out to be an autobot with the name Bumblebee. Eager to impress high-school hottie Mikela, Sam offers her a ride, but when things start to go wrong and Sam is attacked by one of the Deceptions, Sam and Mikela must put aside their prejudices and work alongside the Autobots led by the legendary Optimus Prime in an epic battle against the Deceptions under the commands of the menacing Megatron.I wasn't expecting any superb acting turns from this movie, but I was surprised to find that the film sported many good performances. Shia LeBeouf is an excellent choice for the role of Sam WitWicky, giving a performance bustling with charisma and crackling with energy. He has been rightly tagged as Hollywood's next big thing! Megan Fox is a newcomer, but even though when she was on screen, her acting skills were the last thing I was thinking about. Still, her character is ruddy brilliant, and Michael Bay gad already used this technique with Scalett Johannsen on The Island. Josh Duhamel isn't bad either, even though his problems and inner conflict are hardly hinted at. Jon Voigt's character is unnecessary and is in my opinion miscast as his role should have gone to a younger, more menacing actor. But overall, this is a very good haul, with the young leads obviously standing out.The screenplay is decent, and the dialogue is classic Michael Bay. What bothers me is that when important topics are raised these are drained by an explosion or any other form of noisy distraction. Pity though! Also the film is unbelievably humorous, and whilst most of its humour is dark, the jokes centre on awkwardness and embarrassment instead of the usual slapstick humour. The film also goes around the usual boy meets girl fun, and this played quite well, with LeBeouf easily making us sympathize with him.The special effects are unprecedented, and this is because it is much more difficult to use special effects with robots which are huge and made up of a good many things, than with let's say Spiderman. The effects are put to good use, but they never take complete control. Megatron is obviously the film's tour-de-force and the Autobots are similarly good, even though the voice acting could've been far better. Still, their ridiculousness had me roaring with laughter! The final battle is epic, but it's a little to.busyto truly stand out. Mini battles happen within the big battle which causes confusion.Verdict If treated as a comedy, this film will go down in film history books, as an action movie, it is the mother of all, but as the best film of the year, it needs more drama to go down with the brilliant humour and action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cool !,"Last night, my friend and I went to cinema for this film. I read many good reviews on IMDb before going there but I went without any expectation about Transformer because I didn't want to be disappointed by this movie as I was disappointed by Spiderman 3. We took a sit at the very center . After a bunch of advertising the movie finally started. At the very first scenes I felt ""oh oh, really really not bad, it's not gonna suck"" and it really really didn't I sat tight on the chair and stared on the screen from the beginning to the end of the film. It was good, very good. I'm not gonna tell you about what I saw 'cause I want you guy to be curious as hell . Instead, I'm gonna say how good it is.1. The movie scrolls fast enough for you to catch what's going on and not to be bored. Scenes go after scenes and things go after things logically and in an smooth order so that you always can follow what's on the screen. In addition, stupid actions, stupid talks, stupid situations are what you're NOT gonna find while watching Transformer.2. Special effect, it is so stunning. This is what I like the most in this movie. Trust me, this movie will give you an opportunity to see a dozen of beautiful mighty and giant robots. But these huge pals are not merely mechanism, they have feeling and mind and even purposes , so that audience don't have to see fights between bunch of pure metal guys and more importantly this make the movie not to be a cartoon for children. And more about special effect, I really enjoyed the fights in the film, they were made so cool, however, the camera angels in fighting scene seem so close and you'll hardly see who fighting who on the screen.3. Lots of funny stuff. Obviously, most of action films must have something something funny and this rule is like a golden key. However, where and when to put hilarious situations in is not so easy, if the crew did it wrong, the movie would be ridiculous somehow. Fortunately, Transformers really makes sense about when and where and how to make you laugh. This is another aspect to make you enjoy the film.These cool things form a awesome entertaining film which is worth the ticket.Go see it if you don't want to miss a good time",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great movie,"I don't know why people have bashed this film in reviews when the preview of this movie came out. I read all the time where some poster claims to be a moviefest buff and knows somebody to get to see advanced press screenings before the press screenings and they down play a movie like this simply because it doesn't follow up to traditional standards. I'm glad I don't take these kind of people seriously and check things out for myself.To be honest, I never planned on seeing the movie because I for one grew out of the Hasbro camp long ago but by mere opportunity I seen this today with my son due to be late for another movie.I must say that that I am happy that I've gotten my money's worth because there wasn't a dull moment for me. I don't know who created this offering or why but they did a great job on this one.If you like sci-fi, a little teen drama and non-stop action then this is the movie for you. The CGI FX in this is awesome and that's saying a lot since I am not an avid fan of CGI. Plus the movie had it's funny parts. Go see this one folks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers,"This is again the strongest summer action sci-fi movie of the year , and I hope that Spielberg - Bay cooperation will continue as we need quality stuff that dreams are made of ! It is funny to see how important are certain things for young generation , as are the action Hasbro Transformers toys and figures . After seeing the movie , my younger brother immediately went to buy himself one of the toys ,soon the whole collection will be created , I am afraid ! In short , this is , thankfully , a film for boys , although the romance between two main characters is pretty believable , not to mention the music in the older Camarro with the sun in the background , mystical ! Again , the cheapest summer movie( believe it or not !) with incredible special effects, perhaps THE BEST EFFECTS EVER ( Oscar without competition ! ) , and the story that is a) not trying to find another artistic and deep - rooted traumas and meanings, thus making the whole business senseless and brainless b) is funny and simple and makes this what a summer flick is supposed to be : a brain relaxation and an eye candy ! Get behind the wheels of your GM vehicle and enjoy the ride !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The ultimate level of entertainment.  Flat out fun with no looking back.  Perhaps the greatest summer blockbuster of all time.,"That's a bold statement. The greatest summer blockbuster ever? No question. If you want to have fun at the movies, look no further. Transformers is a masterpiece in visual effects and its brilliant writing and direction. Michael Bay continues to show why he is one of the most bankable producers/directors in Hollywood with probably his best effort of his career. Transformers is one of my all time favorite movies, and the only movie that I would watch any day of the week. Whether it be the incredible action sequences, great jokes, the great and likable Shia LaBeouf, the gorgeous Megan Fox, the just flat out awesome Optimus Prime, or the downright evil Megatron, Transformers has something for every type of movie goer.Long ago, the dueling Autobots and Decepticons fought over the power source known as the Allspark, or simply, the cube. Now that the cube has found its way to Earth, the battling alien races have brought their struggle to our planet, and it appears that young lovable loser Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) holds the key to Earth's safety or destruction.First off, Transformers boasts what you could call spectacular special effects and action sequences. They are astonishingly real and well made. Nothing looks fake. The Transformers themselves are sometimes hard to distinguish because of the speed they are fighting at, but it's a non issue. I am ready to give Transformers the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. I've never been more stunned by visuals. Michael Bay really put a ton of effort into the film, and of course, his trademarks are present, such as the sun casting a bright light over the hero in the finale, but Bay has created a film that he can not only call his, but a film for everyone. This is why we go to the movies, to have experiences that leave us wowed, make us laugh, and stick with us for a long time. Michael Bay has guaranteed that this will happen.The cast is great. They do what they need to and don't take anything away from the movie, sometimes adding more. Shia LaBeouf has really blossomed into a bankable leading man. It's so great to see him really succeed, and seeing how likable and great he is in this movie, I can see why. Megan Fox, aside from being drop dead gorgeous, has her own moments where she and LaBeouf really play off each other well. I liked Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. Anthony Anderson was good, as was screen legend Jon Voight. I liked his character, who seemed really realistic. I didn't care for John Turturro, as he seemed really out of place, and he felt awkward in most scenes he was in. He tried to be funny in moments where it wasn't necessary.Ah, now the voice actors. All are cast great, especially the leading Autobot Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the especially vile Megatron (Hugo Weaving). Cullen has been the voice of Prime for years, and I wouldn't have it any other way. He gives a warm and kind voice that also does a great job of enforcing his power as the leader. Weaving has one of the best voices in show business, with this and V for Vendetta being the best examples. It's amazing how a man who was so kind and likable in V could come back with a voice full of menace and cruelty and downright scare the audience. Though he's animated, Megatron is one of the top bad guys of the 2000's.Transformers will never relent with the entertainment. It's got everything, including awkward teen romance parts, intense action, catchy dialog, a great soundtrack, and sometimes laugh out loud humor. I've never had this much fun at the movie theater and I really recommend that you catch it on DVD and watch it on the biggest TV with the best sound system you can. It's the best of the legendary 2007 summer. In a summer of sequels, the newbie, Transformers, stands clear above the rest. I love this movie and recommend it to everyone.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
horrible,"Let me start off with this. I loved Transformers as a kid and I love a fun, mindless action movie (like Crank or Die Hard) This is one of the most overrated films ever made. The special effects look pretty good, but the action is poor, the acting is awful, the story is bland, and the humor is irritating.OK, so the logic holes are Gigantic. For example, Bernie Mac plays a car salesman who Sam (Shia Labeouf) tries to buy a car from. One of the cars is bumblebee. Bumblebee (somehow) blows up the windows of every other car. Sam takes Bumblebee home and neither he or his father question what the hell just happened.Megan Fox is hot, but she's a terrible actress. John Tutorro is great, but he's really chewing up the scenery here. Josh Duhemal and Tyrese Gibson aren't given much to do. Shia Labeouf is so-so.But we don't care about that stuff right? I mean this is an action movie. Too bad that there are barely any robot fights in a film called transformers. For instance, in one scene Shia Labeouf and Megan fox are running away from a decepticon. Bumblebee starts fighting it, but instead of focusing on Bumblebee fighting, we focus on those stupid teenagers running. Screw That. I wanna see robots fight. This film is more about the humans than the transformers.When the robot fights do happen, it's pretty poorly filmed and none of the fights are terribly engaging.We don't even meet Megatron for like 90 minutes and we don't meet optimus for like an hour. Lame. I don't care about a couple of stupid teenagers and their car.And the whole plot revolves around Ebay? That's a real cool idea for an action movie. ugh.And the ""humor"" is awful. The only funny scene in the whole movie was the doughnut joke. Everything else was just stupid.If you truly are a Transformers fan, don't waste your time. This film sucks",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
TWO WORDS..Oh My Gawd...,"Yeah, I know it was three words. But much like this fantasmagorical movie, you will definitely get more than you bargained for or paid for.There is something for everyone in this flick and all members of the human race will see themselves in at least one of the numerous characters. For a near 3 hour movie, nothing drags, every scene movies forward to the next and keeps you on the edge of the seat. My cool barometer, my 15 y/o daughter thought it was a shorter movie than Pirates which is roughly the same length.When an autobot gets his legs amputated, and he still rocks onward, I am sure every kid in a wheelchair feels like he wants to go kick some decepticon a$$.A the end of this movie the entire theater erupted in an impromptu raucous applause, the likes of which I have never seen in near 30 years of movie going.While it is rumored Transformers cost a whopping 155 million dollars, they will easily make it all back and then some. If a Transforer toy come out after this I for one will buy the damn thing..yup, and I'm 46 years young to boot.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,All I have to say about this movie is I came out with an ear to ear grin on my face. I think it was a perfect adaptation of the original series. I don't think gogkiran-2 who gave it 4 stars has seen the original series anytime recently and how bad it really was. Was awesome when I was 6 but when I watched it again last month it was slightly painful. Third season very painful. I like in the movie how serious it was: the bad guys could aim and shoot and hit and when they got damaged it hurt. Cities could collapse under a fight from just two of them. Very much how it should be. Yes it was full of clichés and cheese but considering the source it still kicked butt! Awesome movie and an awesome time. Highly recommended.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid effort,"I grew up with the Transformers and find the whole ""diehard"" nitpicking a bit ridiculous. The original cartoon was meant to be a tie-in to sell more toys, nothing more nothing less. Given that fact, all this pseudo gravitas created by the rabid following is funny to watch and listen to. If you take your Transformers THAT serious, stay home because this movie strives for nothing more than what we got with the early 80's cartoons.Effects are spectacular, explosions and action are top notch. But then again, that is no surprise, this is a Michael Bay movie. People really need to get off the hate Bay band-wagon and just understand and know summer means getting the blazes away from the real world and stepping into a cooled theater and enjoying some fun. Bay knows how to do that in spades and gives it to us here.The story is weak, holes through and through, but so what. The film succeeds in giving us exactly what we want from a Transformer film: robot's in action! If you have created some sort of alternate reality world where Transformers is about something more, again, stay home. There is comedic moment sprinkled all through the action. That does remove a sense of danger from the film, but then again, this wasn't supposed to be a rated R fest.My only disappointment with the film is the score. Normally with a Bay production we get a great anthem of score music. There really isn't much in the way of that in the film. We get some coolly placed rock music, but the score never really reaches out and grabs you. I had hoped for a variation on the Transformer theme, but what we get is a by the numbers score.This is another solid effort from Bay. A good way to get out of the heat of the summer and enjoy some fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
when humor trumps even special effects,"The thing that strikes you the most while watching the movie ""Transformers"" is not how spectacular its special effects are or how ferociously its action sequences come across on screen, but rather how very FUNNY so much of the movie manages to be. After having sat stone-faced through many of the alleged ""comedies"" foisted upon us in recent months - ""Evan Almighty,"" ""License to Wed,"" even ""Shrek the Third,"" to name just a few - I'm pleased to announce that I laughed quite a bit throughout the course of ""Transformers"" - and I do mean good-sized belly-laughs, not mere titters or snickers. Prime credit for that obviously goes to screenwriters, Roberto Orci and Ales Kurtzman, but I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge Shia LaBeouf's contributions in this regard. In this his first certified blockbuster, LaBeouf finally achieves the superstardom he's been steadily heading towards the past several years.As everyone already knows, ""Transformers"" is based on a phenomenally successful line of Hasbro toys as well as the animated series derived therefrom. Transformers are giant robots from outer space who have the ability to metamorphose into the shape of virtually any everyday mechanical device - cars, cell phones, boom boxes etc. - they so desire. In the film, the transformers have just arrived on earth in search of a mysterious box that has the power to create an army of such robots that, given unbridled freedom, would be able to take over the world. Some of the transformers have evil intentions while others have an affinity for mankind and do their best to keep us out of the clutches of the bad guys. LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a brainy, perpetually tongue-tied (especially when he's trying to impress the unreachable girl of his dreams) social outcast whose father agrees to help him buy a rundown Camaro that, unbeknownst to either of them, is actually a good transformer in disguise just waiting for Sam to become his owner.It goes without saying that, on a strictly technical level, the transformers have made a stunning transition to the live action format. There are brief moments when they appear a trifle fake, but director Michael Bay keeps the action moving along at such a dizzying pace, that we rarely have time to notice that flaw. I'm not one who normally goes in for Bay's cuisinart style of movie-making - near-subliminal quick cuts mixed in with endless explosions and rafter-rattling sound effects - but I think it works quite well in this instance. He's also blessed in having LaBeouf as his lead actor, for it is LaBeouf's non-threatening All-American Boy looks and wide-eyed innocence that give the movie the emotional grounding it needs to be more than just the lumbering mechanical creation it could easily have become without him. In fact, whenever he isn't on screen, the movie does, indeed, threaten to devolve into just the standard popcorn action movie filled with jaw-dropping special effects but minus a heart or soul (the transformers themselves are never very interesting as characters and they are stuck mouthing sappy platitudes whenever they do get a chance to speak). But LaBeouf brings to the movie the human dimension it needs to keep our interest.Kevin Dunn and Julie White are thoroughly delightful as Sam's well-meaning but utterly befuddled parents, while Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson also score high on the laughter meter. For purposes of gravitas, movie veterans Jon Voight and John Turturro are also along for the ride.And quite a ride it turns out to be, I must say. ""Transformers"" has pretty much everything a modern-day blockbuster needs to be successful. But it is the rare good humor with which the movie plays its hand that is so completely unexpected - and so very much appreciated in this quarter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Holy bad movie, Batman!","This entire film was a flashy commercial, start to finish. The biggest buyer of ad space--the US Army. At least half the movie was a blatant recruitment video, demonstrating myriad military systems working in seamless unison for the millions of children and young adults in attendance. Balderdash. Mountain Dew, Chevy, Pontiac, Hummer, Ford, Panasonic, and GMC are just a few of the other big spenders that were pounded into the minds of the audience.The ""plot,"" if you can call it that, was simply laughable. I can't remember the last time I saw a more cookie-cutteresque, formulaic flick. The whole thing seemed like one big mad-lib. If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you can guess the next ten minutes of the film at any given point. Forget spoilers--whatever you think is about to happen, you're probably right. And talk about a blatant open door to a sequel, which we can probably expect just about this time next year, just in time to promote all the 2009 model year cars, as well as a stream of other crap that's too useless to be sold on its own merits. I'm sure the CG artists have already broken ground on it. First order of business--produce at least 300 45-second, multi-angle, overly-dramatized, ""chunk-chunk-chunk"" sound-effect filled transformation scenes. That'll put them somewhere around half the number in this one.Oh, and make sure you bring all the willful suspension of disbelief you can muster, because you WILL need it if you're to make it through to the end. You couldn't count on one hand the monumental and ridiculously improbable coincidences upon which the threadbare plot depends, even if that hand was holding a calculator. My favorite--someone hotwires a brand new vehicle by opening the door, reaching under the steering column, immediately grabbing two freely dangling and apparently stripped wires and sparking them together. Holy Dukes of Hazzard. Do the makers of this film really believe that America is peopled by such feeble-minded idiots?To squeeze in more action and save the poor viewers from having to think too much, every formula character in the book was pulled out. All the usual suspects were in attendance: the hardcore marine guy, the ""you can't handle the truth""-secret government agency guy (times two!), the hot computer chick, the dorky hero, the embarrassing, out-of-touch parents, the muscle-headed jock and the girl who dates him only to realize she's been dating bad boys for too long, and my personal favorite, the technically inclined but non-threatening black guy. And yes, Megan Fox is slap-your-granny hot, but it's ruined when every other scene she's in shows her with her chin up, mouth open wide, faint glimmer of sweat across her forehead in an obviously forced attempt at looking sexy.This movie isn't a total wash, though. For those of you whose only desire in a film is to see big robots smash stuff (da-hyuck), boy is this the ticket for you! The action IS pretty non-stop, but unfortunately a lot of it is played too fast to really see what's going on--I suspect the CGers did this on purpose to eliminate cost and speed production. There are some decent comedic moments, but most of the jokes fall flat and some are downright inappropriate for my 5 and 7 year old. There was just enough character development for the robots to make you realize that, if they were real people, they would be MTV veejays (one of them break dances for God's sake) and were likely created in committee (think Poochie the dog from The Simpsons). And another thing--their faces were just plain creepy.I had such high hopes for this film, but in the back of my mind I knew it would be turned into an ad bonanza with little to no true tie to the original story. I'm sad to say I was right on the money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easy 10/10 (long overdue),"I remember when this movie first came out. I was so blown away that when it was available outside of theaters, I watched it over and over. And over again. Repeatedly. You know how it goes, you say the lines while watching, because you've viewed it well over 7,253+ times.I'm an unapologetic diehard ""Bayformer."" The scope and magnitude of the fight scenes and explosions are a joy to behold and unparalleled in excellence. Every one, without exception, are awe inducing scenes of beauty and genius, thrilling my visual and auditory senses and giving me chills. It's a movie with excellent directing and delivery. Kinda weird for a girl to say that, huh?There are some movies that will always be my absolute all-time favorites, right up there with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. This is where I place Michael Bay's Transformers, alongside them, in a stratospheric category where other directors and writers can only dare to dream of reaching.Love love love the lore and the way it was adapted here.Acting spot on, bar none.Julie White (Judy) and Kevin Dunn (Ron) were absolutely perfect for their roles, and perfect with their lines, body language, all of it, no exceptions. No matter what Judy does wrong (and that's no small number), or how embarrassing she is, White keeps Judy unimpeachably adorable. The chemistry between White and Dunn as Sam's parents was flawless and seemingly effortless, a highlight, the proverbial icing on the cake, complementing each others' lines with ease. As the movies continued, I found myself being barely able to wait to see what kind of awkward situations they would get themselves into.John Turturro (Agent Simmons), though really REALLY annoying at first, goes on, though not too much less (perfectly) annoying, to be one of the heroes of the series. I became a huge fan of Turtorro because of his portrayal of Simmons.Josh Duhamel (Captain Lennox) and Tyrese Gibson (Sergeant Epps) were perfectly cast together, no-nonsense Lennox, and Gibson with the complementary perfectly delivered one-liner comedic relief. Loved these two in the movies.I'm not a Megan Fox fan at all, but I couldn't imagine anyone else as Mikaela after I watched the movie a few times. I think what got to me was how far she went to protect Bee.Last but not least, Shia LaBeouf. There is no other Sam. He was so hilariously extra in many of the scenes, but calm and calculating when he needed to be. This was done by LeBeouf, and not by the writing. He brought something to the table that no one else could have pulled off. Whatever he does or doesn't do in real life, love him or hate him, he's Sam Witwicky, and was truly beyond great at the role.Favorite line: ""I wish to stay with the boy."" Got me straight in the feels with a tear and a lump in my throat.And now I'm done with my review. I'm going to watch this movie for the 7,254th time. Despite all the naysayers, It's. Just. That.

More than meets the Bay standards...,"As anyone who knows me probably knows I am an avid and outspoken detractor of Michael Bay and all of his films. I've found them to be cheap exploitive and manipulative pieces of substandard film-making that appears to have garnered some attention due to his flashy style of directing. However, Transformers became one of the biggest movies of 2007 and, as such, I had to see the movie if only to have a merited opinion on the film. By the time the Autobots descended on Earth in the form of a meteor shower, one bit actor runs by the screen with a camera, yelling to it that it is ""a hundred times better than Armageddon,"" I sat in the theater and wondered to myself if the actor knew how many volumes of honesty he was just speaking.Transformers not only became the fun and exciting summer movie that I was waiting for all of 2007, but it proved to me that Michael Bay has it in him to make a movie that goes beyond exploitive and sociopathic tendencies, two underlying themes in all of his movies that I couldn't shake to the point where I couldn't enjoy them as passive fun. Here, the bitter angriness against the human race that is evident in all of his previous films has gone and we have a fun slice of juvenile entertainment that it seems that Bay has been waiting to make.For anyone who grew up watching Transformers every Saturday morning, the plot needs no explanation. Autobot transformers battle Decepticon transformers on earth in a bid to protect humanity. However, this Transformers focuses less on the robotic characters than in the American government, a small band of army soldiers and one hyper-testosteroned yet socially inept teenager and his overly hot love interest, all of which sport some very strong and obvious spray on tans.Sam Witwicky, played with youthful gusto by Shia LaBeouf, is given his first car, which happened to be a ""robot in disguise"" named Bumblebee, who was sent to protect Sam, who happens to be in possession of a map to find a key element for both sides of the transformers called the allspark. The autobots want to use the allspark to reignite their destroyed world while the decepticons want to use the device to create their own robotic army. Simple plot, not too hard to follow, but, hey, who needs to see existentialist character pieces in a movie about cars that become robots and fight each other? There are very cheesy moments and lines in the film, there are plot contrivances and there are some very over the top performances, but like I said earlier, this isn't a film that is meant to be scrutinized the way that a Scorcese or Bergman film was meant to be. So the best way to evaluate Transformers would be to judge the action and fun level. In both respects, the movie succeeds if only because it abandons the standard sociopathic Bay mentality and instead focuses on the entertainer that he has always strived to be. If I have a complaint with this film, it's that the camera needed to be pulled back more during some of the action sequences to get a better look at what was going on. Bay's style is very in your face, but there are points where I wanted to see more of the Transformer fights and get a chance to enjoy what I was watching.And before I finish the review here, I have to give credit to the amazing visual effects that this film was able to accomplish. So seamless, on both the big and the small screen, where the effects where interactive machines would all of the sudden transform into the gigantic robots that they were. The very first time a machine transforms into another machine, the effect is so seamless that the movie shows the capabilities that computer effects have come.Transformers is the fun summer film that hearkens back to a time when the blockbusters were entertaining and free spirited, much like Men in Black, Jurassic Park or The Mask. Not only that, but Michael Bay has also stood up to a very challenging task to me: making a movie that has actually made me excited to see his next film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Please, do not waste your money (or give it to Michael Bay)","Please, do not go see this movie.If you are a fan of the Transformers television show, or the original movie, you will be overwhelmingly disappointed.The title of this movie should have been ""Sam Witwicky"" (the main character) because that was what the movie was about. It was not about the Transformers at all.THE BAD:-The first problem is that this movie was about humans, not transformers. In fact you don't really meet any transformers until 45 minutes into the movie, and when you do, they don't talk. The movie is about an awkward teenager, not Transformers. There are only a handful of transformers in the movie. (4 autobots, and about 5 decepticons)-You don't get to know the transformers at all (autobots, or decepticons) They are introduced, by name only, and they give you a 10 second explanation of their individual jobs. They don't really have any lines, you don't get to know their personalities, and you don't see much of them in general. (I understand that there was a tremendous amount of cost and effort put into creating the actual transformers, and live action people are easier to shoot.....but come on. The movie is supposed to be about the Transformers.) -obnoxious product placement (Chevy, GMC, and Burger King just to name a few). These were shameless plugs that got annoying after a while.-The ""comic relief."" It's an action movie, stop trying to make the audience laugh with stupid dialogue, and slap-stickey nonsense. It's frustrating when the writers are clearly trying to appeal to the 10-15 year old PG audience....-Character development. At the end of the film, you'll know more about Sam's parents than you know about most of the main characters. They do not develop characters at all, and furthermore they had a few characters that served no purpose at all.-Complete lack of nostalgia. If you're expecting to see some things that remind you of growing up with the Transformers TV show, you will be disappointed. Aside from the voice of O.P. nothing is similar.THE GOOD:-Best CGI/live action integration yet. This movie finally pulls off seamless CGI. It was beautiful. Just wait kids, now that they know how to do CGI properly, George Lucas will probably re-make Star Wars again...) -They got the original guy to do the voice of Optimus Prime. Awesome.SUMMARY: If you're out to see a mediocre action movie laden with poorly written dialogue, and bad ""humor,"" then go for it.If you're looking for some connection to a fantastic show from your childhood, don't waste your time.If you want to see how CGI should look from now on, take the time, but be prepared for an altogether awful movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
boe_dye says... Baweep Granaweep Ninibong!,"Okay, that was kinda lame...Anywho, in my particular tradition of knowing that you already know what the movie is about I will spare you all yet another long and drawn out rehashing of what the movie was about and tell you all what I thought...Besides, that's what the plot/synopsis link is for...Moving on... I liked it... I liked a lot to tell you the truth.Many people knock Michael Bay. I really don't understand why. Before I even knew who Bay was, I have enjoyed his movies...See, when it comes to taking a cartoon and/or comic book and making it into a large scale movie there is a little thing that takes place called dramatic license. Way to many fan boys simply can't comprehend it, and usually whine about stupid things like ""Oh Megatron didn't look like Megatron"", or ""Soundwave didn't look like Soundwave"", or ""There was no All-Spark"", or ""Bumble-Bee wasn't a Camaro, and was a yellow bug instead"", and let's not forget ""it didn't even sound like Starscream"", or how about ""Devestator wasn't a tank, he was a Constructacon"".Yeah, well robots don't bend like the do in cartoons either...Some dramatic license can be bad, like the debacle that was Spider-Man III, but don't get me started on that one... At least not here...Either way, to answer all those gripes, Megatron would have looked absolutely ridiculous as a handgun/cannon. When was the last time you actually saw/owned a boom box? The all spark didn't replace energon, it was something entirely different, and you have to admit a Volkswagen bug, at least in this case, has no menacing bad @$$ qualities as say a Chevy Camaro...Although they did kinda over do the whole GMC plug...A whiny tenor voiced Starscream would have been annoying in five minutes, and as far as Devesator went, well if you are really so upset over that then there really isn't much that can be said that isn't painfully obvious...Okay, so how was the movie? The movie was good. It was of course action packed. Eye Candy GALORE! But then again for this type of movie, you don't really go for deep meaningful character development, or in depth philosophical enlightenment...That's like going to see Star Wars for the dialog. No one in their right mind would want to see Star Wars for the god-awful dialogue that Lucas somehow managed to cobble together. You go because you want to see epic Light Saber Battles. Same difference here.We want to see massive robots kicking the tar out of each other, making that cool ""eh ah oo"" sound that they make when they transform.At times the camera's were a little too in your face. A little too fast perhaps as well. At times it was somewhat hard to comprehend the action; you knew it was going on, but at the same time it looked jumbled and messy.Another critique I have, and this is going to sound odd, is the choice of voicing for Optimus Prime. I know, I know, using Peter Cullen because he was the original was like a dream of dampness to many, but at the same time Optimus sounded a bit old, and understandably so. I personally felt that Hugo Weaving who voiced Megatron would have sounded perfect for this Optimus Prime. But that's just me.Megatron, in this movie almost acted, sounded, and just a little bit even looked more like Galvatron then anything else... Which was kinda cool.Which in that case, what they could've done would have been to call up Leonard Nimoy (who still has a great voice, and sounds much as he did when he voiced Galvatron) and had him voice Megatron and have Hugo Weaving do Optimus. At least that way the bad guy would be gravely and hard while the good guy would be a bit more smoother... But again, nothing that would make me change my opinion of the film...In the end, it was a pretty cool movie with lot's of pretty colors, and well done cgi, (and maybe perhaps some left over Episode One sound effects). Had a simple to the point story, and left me with happy thoughts......doom doom dooooom the end...October 21, 2007*The DVD Review*So ""x"" amount of time has passed and the movie that was in theaters in now finally on film. i, having enjoyed this enough to actually buy it on DVD, decided that perhaps it would be an interesting thing to write about any other thoughts that may have come up in my second viewing of this film.Movies often times seem different the second time around.My general reaction is still pretty much the same. it's a pretty good flick. the gmc plugging was just as annoying, and the movies effects and action sequences were more then enough for me to forget about it.I made a comment above that i would like to retract however, and that was about optimus prime sounding a bit too old. in my second viewing of this film i found nothing that sounded dated whatsoever. peter Cullen was a good choice to rehash optimus. i still think that they could have easily gotten away with using Leonard nimoy as mega tron, but perhaps that will be something for the sequels...One last thing that i can say before i sign off, is that the choice of music was too distracting. battle for honor and humanity, by tomoyasu hotei (i think i spelled that right, but just in case the ""kill bill"" theme), and the linkin park end song are simply to popular to be used effectively for a movie. soundtracks ought to have original music for the movie, or at the very least music that isn't all that popular.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could it transform into a film that was much more than meets the eye?,"I don't hate blockbusters, but what I do hate is bad film making, especially ones that use flashy, state-of-the-art CGI to make up for a rubbish script. Transformers is a case of this, I think and that's just one of it's many flaws.Watching it again (in preparation for the sequel), my opinion has changed a lot from nearly two years ago when I was entertained by it. I had a feeling this was one of those disposable films that I'd see once and never touch it again, and I was right, cause it's bad, and here's why:Acting: Judging from what I saw, this wanted the robots to play second fiddle to what was mostly a human story. Shame the humans lack interest, cause all I saw wavered shockingly poor to mediocre acting and the most one-dimensional characterisation I've seen in a while, along with cheesy, cringe worthy dialogue.LaBeouf plays Sam, the main teen high-school boy in this, like deer caught in headlights. This constant panicky expression makes for a more weaker hero. Fox's character is our hero's crush, but she looks around 25 and dresses like a stripper. Her acting is very wooden and self-conscious, but since she's eye candy, she fulfils her purpose of being pretty to look at well, even if she looks nearly a decade older than her co-star. Duhamel and Gibson are bland as the two main soldiers - there's a particularly scene of unconvincing acting from Gibson in Qatar as Scorponok is tunnelling in the sand behind them. Turturro's manic and wacky performance is just unfunny and Voight on autopilot. Taylor ranges from mediocre to unbelievable and Anderson just plays a 'comic relief' stereotypical black man - a lot of the jokes fall flat and his character is annoying and unnecessary.Much of the only good, noteworthy acting comes from the voice-over acting for the robots. Cullen's gravely, authoritative tone, especially at the very end of the film gave me goosebumps and even made some of the worst and most clichéd lines sound genuine. Harnell's voice too is good.Cutting out the whole military sub-plots and the hackers would've concentrated the story on Sam and his family and the robots, which would've improved it slightly, but you're still left with that god-awful script.Plot: Yet another vital flaw - the plot is vague and undeveloped. The narrative is severely lacking and even the basics of it, about a Allspark cube are laughable, yet this is all presented quite seriously. Scenes to be taken seriously are quite unintentionally funny.So, it's 'plot', if it can be called that, is just a thin narrative that doesn't make much sense, as it hasn't been thoughtfully though from the start.I was bothered by the lack of a good villain in Megatron - we're only shown a small flashback of his apparent wickedness, but he doesn't come across as a strong enough, feared antagonist. It sure doesn't help that his little dialogue is as silly as they come: 'give me the cube!'.The origin of the robots could've been shown more in the opening. As a result of limiting what we know about the title characters themselves, there's no emotional investment in them much, and when one Autobot is killed, it doesn't have any impact. The same one-dimensional approach is used for the cardboard cutouts that are the humans.So, a superficial 'plot' and characters leave me cold. The particular scenes with sentimentality feel shoehorned in and the whole onanism part is so stupid and inappropriate. Add the silly romantic bits and it feels so contrived, I'm surprised that this script was green-lighted.Cinematography: Bay loves to pan the camera right to left, left to right, 360 degrees around someone, over used slow-mo, insert panning aerial shots and close ups that gradually come closer - very rarely does the camera stay still. Scenes lasting five to ten seconds mostly also have a quick cut editing technique throughout. Ironically enough, these film trailer-like scenes end up in an overlong film, with a self-indulgent tone, especially in big set pieces.The explosions and general action scenes are unwatchable and tiresome because of this approach. I hate watching a film shot in an ADD type way, especially when ineptly done. Yes, the CGI is photo-real and great, but those computer effects don't deserve a film as badly done as this.The main seven action scenes don't redeem the film and all share one thing in common - a lack of tension or suspense. That lack of restraint and diligence creates an air of impatience in me. The end climatic part ended on a very weak note.Overall: Only the CGI for the robots, really good voice acting for Prime and the lovable Bumblebee were it's few good points. Apart from that, the film is brainless, bloated, clichéd and is a tedious experience to endure. Even the humans are horribly written, the action sequences with the robots sound like pots clanging together (which is weird for such large and heavy cybernetic organisms) and are a chore to follow who's beating up who. Stupid panning shots, fast cut editing and bad, cheap jokes makes this one of the worst sci-fi action films I've seen, so far. There's no heart in it - just one long advert for cars, eBay and the Transformers toys. A film made primarily for lads mag reader, since it doesn't have anything to offer apart from visuals.There's nothing wrong with making a fun blockbuster, but at least get a good story , fully realised characters with normal non-panning pacing before you start principle photography. Kids making up stories while playing with their toys is more entertaining than all 2 hours 15 mins of this and probably more creative.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than I expected at least...,"This movie had more character development than I usually would expect from Hollywood flicks these days and for that my pleasure viewing it was heightened. Though this is to be expected since it's based on a series that has been around for a while. My only main gripes are that the pacing towards the end of the movie seemed to be much too fast compared to the beginning. The vehicles in the movie looked real nice. The CGI was done incredibly well. Character interaction generally seemed more authentic than I was hoping for so that was a plus.Overall, it's enjoyable and at least worth renting. I suggest if you have a free day with nothing else better to do, pick it up. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I loved this movie!!,"I caught this movie on the 4th of July. I will definitely be waiting anxiously for it to come out on DVD to add it to my collection. I was thoroughly impressed with this film. They did a wonderful job of keeping it true to the cartoon incarnation while still giving it the modern feel and making it enjoyable for more than just the generation of us who used to watch it when we were young. I was blown away that it seemed to be over so fast. It did not feel like 2½ hours. I almost hope they don't do a sequel because they will have a very difficult time making it better than this one was. There are very few movies that I have seen that were able to give me goosebumps as many times as this one did, not out of fear but out of awe.

entertaining,"I grew up watching Transformers on and off. I knew who the good and bad guys were, but I never got the whole plot of the cartoon series. To me, it was just a cartoon with vehicles that can turn into robots and forever fighting. It was mostly dreary (to me). After all, what would you expect out of a girl who was clearly more interested in watching Tom and Jerry?Watching this movie found me in a theatre full of children that got me puzzling if they even knew that there was a cartoon called Transformers. The plot of the movie was entertaining, funny and mostly flawless. However, I guess most of the humour was lost on children too young to even understand the dialogue.The graphics were lovely, the cars lovelier still. The movie actually got me interested in wanting to know what comes next and rooting for the characters. To sum it up, I was kept at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.If there is to be a sequel, I look forward to it, minus the children.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What the hell?,"I cannot understand how IMDb could give Transformers an 8.2 rating. Sorry, but this movie does not deserve that kind of credit. When I went to see the movie on July 4, I was not expecting to set eyes upon a freakish mess of bad acting, boring CGI, AND ridiculously laughable dialog. Transformers is a perfect example of what not to do while making a movie. I must say, Michael Bay has absolutely no artistic eye whatsoever, and it sickens me to think that a preschooler fan of Transformers could have just as well pieced this pile of crap together. Also, the voice acting of the Transformers was abysmal, and the dialog was cheesy. In some of the scenes, I just sat in my chair--staring at the screen in disbelief. This may have been one of the worst films I have ever viewed. Because the camera angles and filming is so jerky throughout the entire movie, not only was I confused, but I thought I would start experiencing photosensitive seizures! My advice: do not listen to any of the good reviews on this piece of sh*t. I you're gonna see it, wait till it comes out on DVD. Even then, you'll find it to be a waste of money and time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the biggest surprises of Summer 2007.,"Michael Bay. When you hear the name, the words ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" pop in your mind. Sure he has a bad reputation, but who could blame him? When he works, he's having fun, just like any other person would. So when he was announced that he was going to direct a live-action version of Transformers, the toy robot-cum-animated series, there was a serious debating issue over the internet.The critics couldn't be more wrong.Transformers is a huge crowd-pleaser. Undoubtedly Bay's best film to date. But this is due to his partnership with executive producer God... I mean Steven Spielberg, and manage to control a budget that is big but not as inflated as certain web-slingers and pirates we know. The special effects are amazing, the acting is good, the action scenes are spectacular, and plot holes are as abundant as craters on the Moon. Yet, this film turns out to satisfy almost everyone going in the theater: having a sh*tload of fun!!! When Sam Witwicky buys a new, or rather, old car, little does he know that he and everyone around him will be whisked away to a grand and epic adventure beyond anything imaginable. LaBeouf's acting in here is good, as he manages to show his funny side and heroic side. A I grew up with his show on Disney Channel, Even Stevens, from this film, I could tell Shia was on his way to the top. Among all the Disney Channel Graduates, he is the most successful of them all, and he will continue to be that way. After Indiana Jones IV, the name ""Shia LaBeouf"" will mean box-office gold.Supporting actors are good too. Megan Fox was cute as the hero's lover. Tyrese and Josh Duhamel were great as G.I. soldiers caught up in another war. It was nice to see Jon Voight taking a role that suits him UNLIKE Baby Geniuses 2. The only thing that bugged me a little was Rachael Taylor and Anthony Anderson's characters. I feel that their character's existence does not explain much of the plot.I was really please that the producers got original G1 voice actor Peter Cullen as the Autobots leader Optimus Prime. That was probably the best thing about the casting. Hugo Weaving was a good replacement for Frank Welker for the villain, Megatron. Thee Autobots are good, the Decepticons are evil. That's all you need to know.Overall, I believe Michael Bay has given us a true ""Summer Blockbuster"", one that will be remembered for a long time. It is supremely loyal to the original series, and then some. I recommend it with a big box of popcorn.8.15/10 Delton",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Clang! Clang! Clang! Went the Shape-Shifting Robots With a Helpful Dose of Comedy to Boot,"Director Michael Bay will never win any awards for subtlety with his industrial-strength, testosterone-heavy popcorn movies. His prevalent use of quick cuts and hand-held shots, compounded by car chases, explosions and other CGI-saturated effects, are all accounted for in this juvenile-oriented 2007 action picture, but I have to admit that there is a welcome sense of humor in the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci that manages to bring this one a cut above Bay's previous endeavors like The Island. Humor is a smart approach in tackling potentially unfamiliar terrain such as Hasbro's Transformers franchise, which had its heyday in the 1980's, before much of the film's audience was born. Yet, at the same time, there is a need to remain true to the spirit of the original premise without changing it in order to pacify baby boomers who would not accept anything less than the myth. In meeting both those objectives, the film meets expectations as an intermittently entertaining summer film.The convoluted story has to do with two warring factions of shape-changing robots - the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons - who both depend on a monolithic entity known as the Cube for sustaining their races. Just how it does it is beyond my comprehension, as do most of the plot details having to do with the Transformers and their planet Cybertron. What make marginally more sense is the main storyline around an awkward, huckstering teenager named Sam Witwicky, who is the descendant of an explorer whose glasses hold the key to the Cube. Sam wants a car badly and gets a beat-up Camaro which naturally turns out to be an Autobot. He also wants Mikaela, a girl who seems way out of his league until her mechanical skills and checkered past come to the fore. While this boy-meets-car-and-girl story is simmering, there are other subplots involving an army unit in the Middle East battling the Decepticons, a computer hacker who frustrates the Secretary of Defense with her complex yet undeniable deductive reasoning, and a group of X-Files-type agents, led by an overbearing zealot, who try to take Sam and Mikaela into custody.There doesn't seem to be great priority placed on resolving the various plot lines, except for the first one and only after twenty minutes of quick-action destruction held mostly in medium shots in an assumed attempt to exaggerate the parameters of the action. Oddly, the climax has more of a benumbing effect since it's difficult to tell the scope of the action with much of it feeling clunky and repetitive until the exhausting finish. Before that, many scenes come across as inexplicable, over-explained or just too drawn out to enjoy fully, for example, the comically clumsy Autobots hiding around Sam's parents' house. Emphasizing the derivative nature of Bay's approach here are snatches of film classics like The Terminator and especially King Kong used throughout, and the influence of executive producer Steven Spielberg can be felt in Sam's responsibility-driven storyline.Bay and the screenwriters deserve credit for humanizing the robots just enough to make them compelling to the viewer, though honestly not enough to empathize that much with their fates. It's not for lack of trying, as for example, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime, provides stentorian fervor and palpable dignity to the role. The human performances are in line with a comic-book-style franchise. Shia LaBeouf has the most screen time as Sam. The young actor makes Sam a likable reluctant hero, though he's fairly limited beyond his constant look of amazement. The real scene stealers are John Turturro as the unctuous agent, Anthony Anderson as a squealing hacker and recent Tony winner Julie White as Sam's overprotective mother. Barely registering is Josh Duhamel as the heroic head of the army unit and Megan Fox in form-fitting wear as Mikaela. All in all, it's pretty clear that the movie defies logic and relies heavily on sensory overload to sustain itself. The unexpected comedy elements are what make it better than at least what I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Action Movie I Have Ever Seen,"It is no doubt the best movie of year 2007.

The Optimus Prime in this movie was so cute that I am now considering that the figure of OP in 80's cartoon was a little countrified.

Discovering Japan,"The ""Transformers"" concept is of course Japanese, but the origin predates the animated television show that originally aired in the U. S. from 1984 to 1987. The idea actually goes back to the post WWII ""Godzilla"" series. The Japanese were able to turn the big green fellow into a franchise by producing a series of sequels with titles like: ""Godzilla vs ???"" (Mothra, Biallante, Cosmic Monster, King Ghidorah, Magalon, The Smog Monster, etc. etc.). Japanese producers had discovered a universal appeal in combat between a somewhat good monster/ alien and a clearly bad one. Arnold the Barbarian's ""Terminator"" sequels also picked up on this can't miss idea.Director Michael Bay has latched onto this idea as a way to arrest his career decline. Normally repeated disasters on the scale of ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon"" would result in banishment from Hollywood and a subsequent career making educational films in Des Moines. But somehow Bay was able to convince them to use him for this project. Apparently having crashed and burned (spectacularly) in many of his prior efforts, gave Bay a fair degree of perspective and he is able to have a lot of self-reflexive fun with ""Transformers""; a goofy film with a lot of stuff that blows up it neat ways and does not take itself nearly as seriously as the original series. In fact it should appeal to ""Godziilla"" fans who find this quasi-parody quality endearing.In place of Godzilla and Mothra et al the film features Computer Generated Transformer toys that contort and expand from something normal into robot monsters. The head monster, who speaks with the voice of Earthquake McGoon, is a bad boy named Megatron. He is the most fearsome of the evil Decepticons robots, who are at odds with the nice robots (Transformers). Both brands of robots fled the doomed planet Cybertron and came to Earth. There is a fairly explicit reason for their choosing Earth (called the Allspark) but for it is not important that casual viewers fully understand the details.Initially ""Transformers"" is a teen movie, with the familiar loser teen boy (Sam played by Shia LaBeouf) lusting after the hot girl (Mikaela-not the one on ""Star Search"" but Megan Fox who played snobby Carla in ""Confessions of Teenage Drama Queen"") who does not know that he exists. Fox has aged noticeably since ""Drama Queen"" and is fading uncomfortably fast, but she still looks good enough that scorching your eyeballs is a real possibility.In an attempt of improve Sam's social standing at school (and to advance the storyline), his Dad gets him a Camaro which turns out to be a Transformer named Bumblebee. Having a transforming car causes Mikaela to notice Sam at about the time the film itself transforms from teen movie to battling robot Sci-Fi.Enter the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) , the armed forces or at least Sgt. Lennox (John Duhamel) and Tech Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and a secret agent (Coen Brothers favorite John Turturro). Like the ""Godzilla"" franchise the best efforts of the military make little impression on the robot monsters.Bay builds up the suspense level as things move toward an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons that will decide the fate of the world. Unfortunately the wheels start to fall off the film at this point as it goes into the ""exercise in excess"" mode of stuff like ""Ultraviolet"" and King Kong"". The Industrial Light and Magic effects are not at fault as their digital creations are first class. There is plenty of attention to detail and the movements and battle sequences are individually excellent. The problem is that the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts. A situation that is only tolerable if you begin viewing things from the self-parody angle; which I think was actually Bay's intention all along.As Roger Ebbert notes: ""The mechanical battle goes on and on and on and on, with robots banging into each other and crashing into buildings, and buildings falling into the street, and the military firing, and jets sweeping overhead, and Megatron and the good hero, Optimus Prime, duking it out, and the soundtrack sawing away at thrilling music, and enough is enough.""It's really time for these CGI dominated movies to mature and start choreographing their scenes to be more than just eye candy. A logical fight strategy would be nice, something that makes sense and is not just random violence. The ""Transformers"" violence looks like it was lifted from old scripted bouts of ""Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling""; with the combatants often down but never out.The failure to incorporate logic distances the audience from the action and makes it impossible to build any real suspense. For this reason alone, the film would have benefited from some serious action scene trimming and a more logical assembly in the editing room. Computer animation has become far cheaper than actually staging live-action sequences but audiences are increasingly discounting these scenes-viewer thrills don't happen when viewers are wise enough to see it as animation. Current audiences are finding it increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief. The same thing occurred in the 1960's when audiences began recognizing the projected backgrounds used for scenes shot in the studio. This started a trend toward shooting films on location with only television shows still using the sound stages.But this excess is the film's only real fault and since it comes at the end most of the viewing experience is quite enjoyable.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenal.,"The movie was absolutely amazing. I've been a long time fan of Transformers and I have been waiting so long for a motion picture of the series to come out.At first I thought that the movie would be a disappointment. I mean, how can the transforming and detail of the fight scenes and autobots/decepticons be replicated? After watching it, I was completely blown away. The cinematography and effects were flawless. I really enjoyed the plot line and Labeouf/Fox were a great on - screen pair.I am eager to see that the next two movies have the Dinobots. I don't think any new characters that were never in the series should be added, thought. It would be better to keep all the original characters.The small bits of comedy and romance are great too. Not too much of everything. The action is was FANTASTIC. The detail in how the transformations from machine to robot was so cool.Overall, this movie was THE BEST that I have ever seen in my life. Definitely on my top ten.I choose to Protect rather than Destroy. I choose the Autobots rather than the Decepticons. I want Jazz to be repaired in the second movie...LOL.

If you expect a lot from ""Transformers"", all the more you'll be surprised. It's action from beginning to end. Sometimes, you may feel a little bit lost in all the fights, and don't even recognize the good guys from the bad ones, but don't lose your mind, it's just temporary, and the next moment - everything will be clear (in most cases). ""Transformers"" are definitely not a movie only for kids. It will catch you and hold you till you get a part of the plot. It's amazing finding yourself out keeping your fingers crossed. This movie will get you. Despite some blind parts is this movie a hit of this summer. Don't miss it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Someone stole your childhood memory and turned it into an army recruitment film sponsored by GM,"There are a number of good things about Transformers the movie. Good special effects, some funny dialog, and mostly good acting from the cast. Unfortunately there is so much product placement it nearly ruins what would otherwise be a decent summer blockbuster.The biggest violation of all is that they changed most of the autobots from the original forms. Why does this happen? Because the movie was sponsored by GM. So forget seeing Bumblebee as a VW, and forget Jazz being a Porsche. Now instead you have a new Camaro and Solstice respectively. A freakin Solstice! The product placement doesn't stop there either. Many scenes will have a giant billboards behind them, and sometimes someone will just blurt out a product name.That being said, there are some positives. The special effects for instance were quite good, although sometimes it's hard to tell what's happening. Most of the actors put in pretty good performances as well, with Shia LaBeouf being the stand out. Megan Fox is also pretty easy to look at, and she puts in a solid effort so no harm done there. John Voight on the other hand is border-line terrible as the secretary of defense, but he was probably just getting paid. He was WAY better in Zoolander.So if you are 14, have low expectations, are a big fat comic book nerd, or you just want to see cool robots with lots of stuff blowing up, then you'll find a lot to like in Transformers.Otherwise with so much blatant product placement it's hard movie to recommend.Lastly I need a final WTF! for the absence of Thundercracker and Skywarp. Oh well I'm sure they will be in the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Japanese idiocy American way,"I recently read a comment here on IMDb that said this movie is in no way meant for kids and that everyone should see it no matter how old they are. For example, another guy said: When I saw the trailer of the film I thought that Transformers was going to be another silly action movie without a story but I was wrong. Oh, God! He was wrong! And I was dumb enough to fall for this. IT IS A SILLY ACTION MOVIE WITHOUT A STORY! Let's make one thing clear. I have nothing against cartoons turn blockbusters. But this is something completely different. Apart from good FX that bore you to death after so many repetitions, this flick is a mindless showcase of bad script, horrible acting and stumping plot which glorifies US Army and supposedly gang-ho government keen on keeping top secrets for the benefit of the nation. From scene one you wish the main character dies a horrifying death and you imagine him ending up in Hostel 3, but unfortunately this is not a torture-porn or a slasher where you can hope someone would perform medieval on his a*s. This aggravating actor who, by the way, carbon copied his role in Disturbia, then finds himself a peer in a pretentious, ""popular"", vain high-school girl who keeps delivering lines of a four year old and at one point agrees to sit in his lap because he said he has the only seatbelt and safety comes first. And yet, she tells him he's a smooth talker!? Are American girls really that stupid or is it what Hollywood want them to be? Shia is one bad actor who repeats himself and have seen too many sitcoms as a kid, and his acting is made even worse by lame directing. You even find yourself embarrassed by his acting. The two then make a hero couple who start getting on your nerves and every moment you wish these two wannabe actors at least get squashed by a giant robot's foot and get it over with. Except the ticket price, there is absolutely nothing here that will keep you in your seat throughout this video/audio torture, for the CGI FX are pointless if your intelligence is being constantly insulted by this no-brainer. The small Decepticons mumble like Gremlins or spiders in Eight legged freaks, which is totally inappropriate sound effect for a robot, as it is for a spider. I don't know which car company sponsored this disaster, maybe all of them did, along with eBay and US Army, but I found that TV commercial with the same robot-to-car transformation much more entertaining and fulfilling. I know Jon Voight sank low lately, but John Turturro was one of my favorite character actors. I just hope this extremely high rating is not a result of a mass voting by dumbed-down adults who suffered an incurable brain damage, but by neglected kids poisoned and brainwashed by anime. This should be banned for people over 10 outside Japan.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I expected nonsense, but there's more to it than meets the eye,,,","Excuse the horrid joke above, I couldn't resist.I have never been a fan of Transformers, I never even had the toys as a kid, but I decided to see this on the basis of being a Linkin Park fan. I wanted to like it, but feared I wouldn't have the option. I was anticipating utter rubbish. I was expecting an ultra-predictable plot, annoying actors, glaring plot holes, cringe-worthy dialog and, of course, an abundance of mindless action. Only the last of these was present.True, as far as the storyline and script go, it's not exactly The Godfather, but it's not dumb enough to damage the fun. I know I may be overusing the ""pleastly surprised"" line, but I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBeouf. He managed to be a perfectly convincing nerd, and while he and the other characters are blatant stereotypes, one can identify with Sam throughout. The humor comes constantly and in decent quality.I haven't even mentioned the Transformers themselves. They do look very impressive, particularly when changing. The scenes of combat and destruction are downright kick-ass, notably when a roller-blading Decepticon smashes a bus in half. The overblown budget shows in every action sequence, and is matched only by the use of state-of-the art US military hardware.So, I recommend this movie without hesitation. Don't think of it as a movie for children, consider it entertainment for one's inner child.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am starting to like Michael Bay,"I watched Transformer yesterday (I am Swiss Italian and the movie opened here as world-premiere in Australia and Italy on Thursday, June 28th).The movie totally blew me away from the beginning to the end. There wasn't a moment where I felt bored (and hey, that's not easy for a 144' movie!). First of all I can easily say Transformers in one of the best movie of Michael Bay (among them I put The Rock, Bad Boys 2 and The Island).Not only action scenes are stunning but Bay also shows he can add first-rate humor to more quiet moments and dialogue sequences.You'll never look to a car or a truck the same way you did before after watching Transformers.Transformers will be a cult movie, that's for sure.My best scene? There is one moment in the movie which glorificate Cinema and made me feel exalted: toward the end, during the city battle, when one Autobot jumps in slow-motion over a screaming woman to avoid collision with some guided missiles: you can also hear great background music of Steve Jablonsky. That was awesome!!I am not a kid anymore but this movie really makes me feel happy and gratified. Ado",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unleash your inner nerd!,"Transformers is a walk down nostalgia lane for some of the 20-30 Generation who grew up when these toys exploded onto the market. Now, decades later, the series has come back again in real time.And it has been worth the wait.The plot basically revolves around a boy and a girl who buys a Camaro unbeknowst that it has in fact got the ability to turn into a robot. The robot, Bumblebee, protects them as the boy holds the key to finding the Allspark, a powerful energy source that the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, want. Unfortunately, there are others who want it too, namely the evil Decipticons, led by Megatron, who begin to pursue, wiping out lots of Earth's communication in order to prepare for a full-scale assault.The plot is not original by any means of the imagination, and parallels can be seen with a lot of other Michael Bay films, particularly in the build up. However the transformers are simply awesome. The effects are truly incredible and you really get caught up as you see the Autobots 'roll out', or the Decepticons lay waste to, well basically everything. The script also manages to fill in a good sense of humour which is sometimes a little hit-and-miss but all the same it's there.This is a truly cool movie, with some great lines and some awesome special effects that are perhaps the most stunning since Jurassic Park wowed us a decade ago. With two sequels to go, I just hope they can keep it up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Machine and Man,"I happened to watch this film on China's release date, but the mandarine dubbed version appears to be cheesy, most of time I could not distinguish the talking between Autorots and Decepticon...Fortunately they didn't talk too much! Plot is simple and easier to follow, anyhow special effects are really the CPU of this movie.Actually I'd rather to say it is largely a value-added product origin ed from its primary comics. It's a good idea to bring humen with these E.T. robots together, as a good complement to original ones.Another good thing is it is a zero-violence and zero-sex film for general audience, so that Chinese film bureau wouldn't censor any part of this film, so that we can watch this film in full-length, Viva La~I give it 7 out of 10, and it is largely due to its special effects, not plot though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Summer Blockbuster that gets it right.....,"Marvelous! Michael Bay and the entire special effects team - I am awed by Transformers. The CGI/special effects of this film are unsurpassed by a film of today. Kudos for a job well done! For starters, I have never watched the TV show, so I cannot compare the movie to what came before it. I just know a great movie when I see one, and this one is unequaled. The plot is respectable, the actors fit the parts, the film is fast paced, filled with action, and the humor is supreme.... I could go on and on, but if you want to be completely entertained, go to the theater now and see this film.There's only one thing not to love about this movie- the bad guys. LOL Who wants to love them anyway? We love to hate them, and this is exactly how you'll feel.Did I mention the special effects? Seriously, you will be blown away. I could have gone back into the theater and re-watched this film once again today just to see the special effects.I simply must own this on DVD.

"as far as empty-headed summer blockbusters go, this is the empty-headiest!","For some Michael Bay can do no wrong. For others, he's the anti-Christ in cinema today. I'm nowhere near the former, though maybe not exactly the latter either. He does what he does and his films make money (with the exception of the Island, ironically since that film is somewhat more watchable than most). So he's a safe bet for the studios to do what he does, which are big, noisy, shiny, and completely empty-headed popcorn action pictures where the special effects triumph overwhelmingly over any human presence. This has never been more relevant a criticism than in Transformers, even if it might not an abomination like Pearl Harbor, or like Armageddon where its awfulness dawns on the viewer after a first somehow impressive viewing.Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I wasn't a ""fan"" of the transformers by much when I was a kid (which, of course, is the best time to become a fan- they're cars that turn into fighting alien robots after all), and never watched the animated movie. So it wasn't a priority to seek out a film version directed by Michael Bay. After finally seeing the movie, it's a reasonable conclusion that it has either found its audience or never will. For those who might love a big, clunky, overlong and densely-plotted flick where the humans are given dumb-ass dialog in lieu of overpowering visual/special FX that moves at the speed of delirious light, it hits the nail on the head. For those who want, er, substance, look elsewhere. It's a film based upon a *toyline*, after all.So, saying that it *is* empty-headed and silly may almost be a plus for some. And, in a sense, for Bay this has now become his forte. And indeed, needless to say, when one turns off their logic centers of the cerebral cortex and tries the 'go-with-the-flow' nature of the action sequences, of those giant alien robots fighting ridiculously with other robots all over some cube, it almost is kind of fun. Almost. But as soon as one is stuck with the human beings, characters like Shia Labouf's character, it's a little torturous when it's clear that Bay can't direct actors (it's not that Labouf is even not talented, as evidenced in the latest Indiana Jones picture). And there are a lot of scenes with these silly humans, far more silly than those with the robots, who work on a guilty pleasure level of excitement even for a viewer as reluctant to appreciate the finer nature of the movie's appeal.Here's the bottom line, folks. It's a huge fantasy movie that has no real discernible plot, that often invokes ""the world wide web"" and ""ebay"" like they're sacred objects. It relies on dialog that any other filmmaker (well, maybe not Spielberg, who produced the movie) would find mostly laughable. It's cinematography is shiny, like an overpriced Christmas tree. It's got hot new young talents like Megan Fox, used mostly for eye candy. And Bay even tries to throw in ""real"" actors, like Jon Voight and, for a few cool moments, John Tuturro. And the work put into designing the robots by the VFX animators is commendable. Transformers, for me, isn't a total disaster, but a sign of the times, of marketing and packaging for a young and seemingly hungry crowd for loud, stupid action to lumber along at a frantic, uneven pace. In short, it's Michael Bay, as clear as alien-robot-transformer crystals.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best action movies this year.,"This year there have been many huge film releases, such as Pirates 3, Spiderman 3, Die Hard 4, and many others. But I believe this film has possibly the most bang you will get for your buck this year. I myself was not a fan of the cartoons, but this movie blew me away. Sure it is about as long as Spiderman 3, but there is far more action. The acting was pretty good and there were some funny moments in this movie. The story is pretty straightforward, and it doesn't stray from the plot. The visuals in Transformers were some of the best I have seen so far, and the cinematography was pretty capturing.

The Reason Movies are Dying,"OK, this is why the world is going no where in the way of cinema.I have been called a fan boy or an art film elitist, but no thats not the case at all. The producers of Transformers clearly just took the naming rights of a cherished childhood cartoon and neglected to do anything with it nostalgia wise, while somehow not being able to make a single new convincing story.Now when i first came into the theater i was expecting the Citizen Kane of giant robot movies, but there wasn't even any fan service, John Turturro makes what is sure to be a regrettable cameo for such a talented actor, I assume they where trying to add some credibility to a cast of what would otherwise be b-list actors. (Sans Bernie Mac whose cameo is negliable at best) The ad placement in this movie made me borderline ill, and the fact there was little to no fan service from a past series that had such a giant following and tons of material to choose from made me damn near dry heaveThis is the kind of movies that are the reasons good films are dying, from the sub par acting to the nonsensical shallow plot, to the cliché dialog the whole thing reeks of Micheal Bay, and mediocrity which any one who takes movie making as an art form opposed to a circus should know by now are synonyms when it comes to film making.I can only recommend this movie to drunken frat boys, and children that don't know any better, aside from that demographic STAY AWAY!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant.,"WARNING, SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN.Very much in the spirit of the original, and my observation is that the prime audience is people like myself who grew up on the Transformers. Almost everyone left the cinema with big grins on their faces (the only ones who didn't were the few ladies who had clearly been dragged by their significant other), I haven't seen such a contented cinema audience in such a long time.I was surprised at the amount of comedy in the film as well, but it was well done comedy that didn't detract from the overall experience. There was some excellent comedic timing so it all worked rather splendidly, and they knocked the comedy on the head at the mid point when things started to get serious.The CGI and action scenes are simply superb, second to none. The US armed forces in particular seem to have worked very hard with the cast and crew to make this a memorable film as well, I don't think I recall an action movie with such a large military involvement. That said there isn't an overuse of CG and it never comes across and being ladled on too thickly like a lot of recent films.The autobots are just delightful, they've been characterised wonderfully. There are a few snippets of dialogue that will make anyone who grew up on the Transformers have a nostalgic giggle of delight. Peter Cullen's voice acting really makes Prime stand head and shoulders above the rest, although Megatron is superbly voiced. Starscream is actually fairly menacing rather than being all whiny and nasal, one of the only critiques I can level is that some of the decepticons all seem a bit ""samey"", almost like Stormtrooper syndrome. When the action kicks off it's hard to tell who's who whereas the autobots are all bright and colourful so it's easy to tell.The movie ties up most of it's loose ends but sets the scene for the next film. My only major concern is that those who haven't really got an inkling about Transformers will miss a lot of the ""feeling"" of the film, but then I suppose you pay your money and take your chances.Incidentally there is a glimmer of a love story but it's all hinted at and never really gets pushed to center stage. Although the movie has to kick off by focusing on Sam the movie is all about the Transformers, they really do take center stage when the scene setting has all been done. No gripes from me to be honest. In fact the love story is quite often used as the butt of the jokes, which suits me fine. One of my main concerns was that there would be a major love story arc messing up the ass kickery.As a film I'd give it a definite 8.5-9 / 10. Because of the subject matter I'll plump for 10/10 because I'm hopelessly biased.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers redefines what a mega-budget blockbuster looks like.,"This film is the fight between two gangs of robotic creatures for the mysterious energy reserve called The Cube.The special effects are so amazing. Action happens so fast that it is almost impossible to keep up with everything that happens. The transformation of robots is so seamless and realistic. It is such an impressive job to have several robots transforming on a busy street, with the army shooting at them and people escaping in all directions. Apart from the visual feast, the story has a human touch as well, as shown by the emotions of robots. It has a gripping story, and it unfolds little by little at the right pace. This film simply redefines what a mega-budget blockbuster looks like.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More than meets the eyeTransformers,"Michael Bay is by no means a director for whom I anticipate each movie of his. The man doesn't do subtlety and he doesn't do intelligent storytelling either. However, you cannot say he doesn't have both artistic vision and deft skill at shooting a film. Sure the guy likes to blow things up, but being able to consistently make work with the amount of preparation and choreography that is necessary, the guy needs some credit. When the idea of a live action Transformers movie was being bandied about with Steven Spielberg's name attached, I will admit I was intrigued while also perplexed by the directing choice. It was only when Spielberg went to the producing side and brought Bay on to helm the action that I finally started to get excited. I knew absolutely nothing about the mythology besides remembering that the toys were cool, but something about Bay, whom I will admit to not being the biggest fan of, just seemed the right fit. After finally experiencing the phenomenon, I will say that I don't think anyone could have done it better, even if the film itself could have been elevated a tad higher.Truthfully, no one is going to see this movie with the hopes of watching a wonderfully written script and emotional progression leading to a top-notch conclusion that both satisfies and ignites conversation. Come on, this is a story about aliens coming to Earth for their ""lifespark"" in order to take over the universe. You've got the Decepticons led by Megatron looking to destroy and you have Optimus Prime's Autobots attempting to thwart their attempts. This is all about the effects and the carnage with the slight story playing second fiddle only to allow for more explosions. On this level, the film is very successful and a great time at the theatre. You can't ask for better special effects or fight scenes. The ""transforming"" is just awesome to behold and never gets tired as the film goes on, the integration of robots with humans is quite flawless, and the animation bringing the two worlds together is pop art at its best.The real stars here are the Transformers themselves and you really can't fault anything about them. With that said, this movie doesn't happen without its multitude of humans to play off of. For the most part they do an admirable job in keeping the audience's interest enough to not mind waiting until the next big effects sequence happens. Shia LaBeouf uses his sarcastic, nice guy persona to good use like always. I believe he just plays himself in most things, but even if he does, it works. Surprisingly I was impressed by Josh Duhamel who I really look upon as not an actor, but his small role is effectively played, as well as his army compatriot portrayed by the underrated Tyrese Gibson. Heck even Megan Fox manages to be a little more than just eye candy and Jon Voight entertains once you get past the horrid Southern accent.Where the film fails for me is in the campy overtones and corny jokes sprinkled in everywhere. I understand the fight scenes are so big and serious that Bay and company felt they needed some levity to counteract them, but really now. Some of these jokes are so bad and some of these characters are so one-dimensionally hammy that I was shaking my head hoping they would be crushed during the fights. I love both Anthony Anderson and John Turturro, but here they are utterly terrible. The facial reactions are so broad you'd think they are doing silent film and the words and actions of their characters are literally cringe-worthy. People have told me that the camp was prevalent in the original cartoons, so I will cut it some slack. I just think it was so heavy-handed and against the rest of the film that it stuck out like a sore thumb. The quips from LaBeouf worked as did the ones from Amaury Nolasco playing off the army ""heavys"" he is with. Bay needs to stick to explosions and realize that he doesn't have the chops to try and make a comedy as well. His pacing in some ""funny"" scenes is unforgivable. When the Autobots are destroying LaBeouf's yard, it was laughable the first five minutes. By minute twenty-five you just start yawning.Despite this shortcoming, though, I will say that Transformers is a great experience. You will be blown away by the special effects and computer animation. There is no way you can't be. The live action integration is effective and even the story manages to root itself in enough reality to be somewhat plausible working in a world where alien invaders have come to Earth. A popcorn summer flick through and through, you won't go wrong checking this one out for either a good time or to hop on the nostalgia train of that amazing decade of the 80's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great visuals and great story altogether,"Transformers is simply amazing. It is entertaining, fun, and the special effects are mind-blowing, even for this age when people take them for granted in every movie.Of course, all the critics would find many reasons why this film would be bad. They always do that. Regardless, people like it, and that is the main thing. Unlike some other animation/comics-based films, Transformers actually leave the old shell behind and focuses more on making a good entertainment rather than satisfying the die-hard fan's desires for boxy, classic characters. The pacing and editing is also unusual for this kind of movies, resulting in a very realistic environment.Shia LaBoeuf is simply great as the main character, and stands out the most, whilst Megan Fox, playing the role of protagonist's dream girl, is only trying to look hot instead of acting, sometimes making me wonder if anybody would notice the difference if a poster would be put in her place with voice-over. Her lines are pathetic, but a good (or any) actor talent should have dealt with that. She just doesn't have it.Overall, a great entertainment. I was very satisfied. This wouldn't have worked without Michael Bay, which made the movie into something more than one would expect from just hearing the name. 9.5/10==================================================================== ==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch 08/07/17' of revisiting this first Transformers after watching Age of Extinction, this film stacks up and looks a lot better in comparison. Overall, this film isn't technical on a story and plot scale but it does entertain, and the run time doesn't feel as overly long since it is an enjoyment. Rated a 9 in comparison to the other Transformers film as one feels this is the clear cut best film of the franchise. It is a shame how far the franchise has came since this film 10 years ago. Where as now that the Transformers franchise has had 5 films, many people today are revisiting this film and tending to like it more due to nostalgia and the current state of the series with Mark Wahlberg. Where as back when this was released, it received a lot of backlash from critics and some fans but now it is considered 'great/enjoyable' and people are missing Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers....is at last redeemed,"After the ultimate failure with the dub of the so called ""Unicron Trilogy"" (Armada, Energon & Cybertron) it looked like that Transformers was going downhill completely. But...Our darkest hour had come to light ^_^ I heard at around late 2003 that there were plans to make a live action movie of the Transformers, at first it was considered a rumour around some time in 2004 but thankfully...It happened.After waiting for several few years of waiting for a Movie of TF's to be made, watching trailers and TV spots and waiting and waiting for the movie to hit the big screen. Finally in 2007, the movie came! I was just speechless at what I saw...it was a freakin masterpiece and brought back the true spirit of the Transformers into this epic movie! Also, with much pleading from the fans, Peter Cullen (The voice of Generation one Optimus Prime) came back to play the role of Optimus prime which saved this movie from completely going down the toilet.Still, there were some problems that die-hard TF fans had problems coping with. The designs were kinda more alien and some people hated them, mainly Megatron's design...Never the less, the film pretty much got people loving and hating it.Myself I loved it! Wonderful acting from both Machine and human (Even though the humans pretty much dominated the roles of the TFs in this movie) Dare I say it, Thank you Micheal Bay for making all this possible, Perhaps you don't suck being a director after all.Bottom line...Great, Fantastic, Wonderful Movie! a real treat for Transformers fans and even on those who are getting started on Transformers!

Very decent movie however...,"I am a big Transformers fan and have been itching to see this movie for some time. I'm giving this a 7 because, like most fans, have expected the greatest movie ever and I guess it didn't completely get there. It was a very decent movie however I was just hoping it would have included more of a serious angle. A lot of the humorous scenes could have been removed as I didn't want it to turn into a fun teen flick. More character building for Megatron and StarScream would have also been ideal but I realized the movie would have been way too long if they added to much extra. Anyway, again, I think it was a decent movie but hope the next one has more plotting and scheming by the decepticons. Effects were quite cool.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
BIG and MINDLESS- like a demented rhinoceros,"There seems to be only two ways to go with 'Transformers'- either you hate the film, or you love it. I happen to hate it. With a vengeance. I suppose it's because the film COULD have been so much more. We have a decent, blockbuster idea- giant robots bent on destroying the world- and we also have... there is also... huh. That's all. But anyway, if all the other things were better, like the clunky screenplay, the mindless direction, and the never-more-annoying Shia, this COULD have gone somewhere.The biggest problem I have with the film is that it has no brain. It is just one big explosion/sound effect/giant ILM robot after the next. I like big action sequences as much as the next person, but not all the way through a 144 minute film. The actual 'Transformers' are quite hard to tell apart. Director Michael Bay obviously thought that all the visual effects would distract us from what the screenwriter hoped we would think is a plot. (Ooo! Shiny!)The humor relies heavily on cheap jokes. The first is when Sam gets his pants pulled off of him by a robot. Anticipated audience reaction: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!! LOOK!!! BOXERS! Another scene is when the kid is being chased by his car and takes off down the street on his mom's bike, which is pink. Anticipated audience reaction: He's a guy, and- get this- he's riding on a PINK BIKE!!! Oh, the HILARITY! My sides are splitting! Oh, STOP!!! PLEASE!! NO MORE!!!!There are also quite a few crude jokes in this film that just don't seem to fit. One of the transformers pees on a human. Note to whoever came up with that: Having a transformer pee on a human does not heighten our level of respect or fear of said transformer.All in all, this is a film with minimal story, head-pounding action sequences and stupid jokes. If you REALLY want to see this film, I recommend watching it late at night with the sound turned right down. Don't try and follow the story because there isn't one. Just sit back and play with your iPhone until the effects/explosions come on.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brnging in both old and new fans. This Transformer movie is a winner,"After Transformers was announced for the big screen, the Transformers fan base became a buzz about what it would be like. Would it trounce their childhoods like so many other movies have? Or would it be a carbon copy of the original series right down to the story and Boxformer design? Well, I am happy to announce that it was neither of those. Michael Bay has pulled off something truly special in this new film; he managed to imagine Transformers for a new generation while maintaining many of the elements that hardcore fans will eat up. Make no mistake about this, this is not your old G1 Transformers, but at the same time, it manages to pay homage to it in many ways that will make you smile.A burning question in your mind is how is the CGI? To put it as clearly as possible, they are gorgeous. Taking into account that Transformers, when compared to other action focused blockbusters such as Spider-man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean, it had roughly half the budget, which makes Michael Bay's use of the CGI even more stunning. The CGI makes the Transformers come to life in this movie, complete with moving parts made even more amazing by the almost seamless interaction between themselves and humans. At times, you can really believe that the Transformers are really interacting with human beings. Perhaps one of the most stunning features of the CGI is the believable transformation sequences, which gets rid of the goofy inconsistency from the original film in which the Transformers could change into something that is drastically smaller than their robot forms. Now you can almost see how the Transformers change into a vehicle and back to their robot form piece by piece. The only unfortunate part of the visuals is that at times it appears that budget constraints were hidden through shaky and limited camera views of the Transformers. Luckily, for the most part, you don't notice this, and at times it even creates an exciting scene.What would these Transformers be without actors, including a competent voice cast? To put it clearly, it would be one drab movie. Thankfully, Transformers manages to have a great cast of both human actors and a brilliant voice cast. The main character, Sam (played by Shia Labeouf), is a surprisingly interesting character that we actually have fun getting to know. Labeouf really adds to the magic of this movie by his interaction, not only with other human characters but also with the Transformers that he interacts with in a believable and engaging way.Onto the Autobots and Decepticons. All I can say about them is that I was very impressed, but yet disappointed at the same time. Peter Cullen does an amazing job as Optimus, and the emotion you get from his voice work is top notch and I cannot imagine anyone doing it any better. The other Autobots had great voice castings, but sadly, they were underutilized and did not say much (though when they did it was usually good!). On the Decepticon side, Megatron and Frenzy did most of the speaking (Frenzy spoke in another language), with little dialog coming from everyone else. For those that were worried about Megatron's voice, don't be, because the voice fits perfectly with his new, almost frightening look and it plays well off of Peter Cullen. It is just too bad that he did not have more lines.Enough with the behind the scenes things like CGI and talent, what was the movie like? This movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end, and I can almost guarantee that there will be a moment where you will go ""Whoa"" (hopefully in a more dramatic voice than Neo in the Matrix). Michael Bay has crafted some of the most spectacular action scenes of all time, and shows that he has the artistic talent it takes when it comes to action, with some action sequences never before seen on the big screen. In fact, there is so much going on that you will miss some of it and you will probably have to go see the movie again. The robot battles are epic for the most part (despite a disappointing Megatron vs. Optimus final battle), and your adrenaline will be pumping, to say the least. To help provide some much needed change of pace, the movie has its share of humor, some of which is low brow, but at the same time it provides a fun laugh. What makes the movie so good is that it never takes itself too seriously, yet at the same time it manages to suck you into things with the visuals.This movie is one of the best action movies around and it is truly a great movie within the genre. This is due to a combination of characters, expertly shot action sequences, CGI, humorous dialog, and a roller-coaster ride when it comes to emotions. Hardcore fans of Transformers will find enough familiarities with the movie that they should appreciate it, while new fans will find an experience like no other one out there. This is a cartoon to movie adaptation done right, and Michael Bay should be applauded for accomplishing this. Transformers was not easy to adapt without getting into the realm of B movie territory, or on the flip side, making it into something that definitely is not Transformers. He managed to find a fine balance between these two sides of the fence and created a thrill ride that sucks the audience in and won't let go. I have no doubt the cheers I heard at the end of this film is not limited to my area. But that is true that for most who see this movie and are looking for a movie that is well made and above all else, fun. So make plans to see this film and ROLL OUT to your local movie theater right away!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
very excellent movie,"Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky was excellent. Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime was brilliant. Mark Ryan as the voice of Bumblebee was cool. Anthony Anderson as Glen Whitmann was Hilarius. Michal Bay did excellent of directing this film. Whats funny that there was a robot in the movie peeing on a man. Whats not very nice that the officers take Sam Witwicky and her girl friend Mikaela Banes. Whats stupid when some woman sitting on a chair was holding her middle finger up. This story is about hero robots there name where Optimis Prime, Autobot jazz, Starscream, and more those where called Transformers. Go see this movie it is excellent even the family will like this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Bay is anti-American,"First he turns one of the worst atrocities in American history, into a love story. And an all out puss-fest.Michael Bay, why must you destroy the story of Transformers? I give you props for the amazing CGI. But your major flaw was changing the look and the storyline. The Transformers are way too detailed, and have way too many parts to actually distinguish which Robot is which (Decepticons). The battles are amazing, but it's extremely hard to tell who exactly is doing what to whom.The other flaw, is the weak-ass-ed storyline. The cartoon had the humans as mainly insignificant creatures. Caught between the waring factions. The majority of the film is based around Sam Witwicky. I understand the need for this, but give me a break Bay. Can't you put your ego and talentless mind aside for one minute, and just make an all out slug-fest? This should have been a CGI infested movie of WAR between two robot armies.There were plot holes galore as well. The product placement was insane. Almost to the point of annoyance. An XBOX 360 comes to life? A mountain dew vending machine? A Cadillac comes to life and attacks a girls head? Where did these things go to? Why did the cube turn them, and essentially make them evil?I'm in awe, that someone would find this script to have been green-lit. One can only hope Spielberg isn't losing his touch, and finds something as mediocre to use for the next Indiana Jones film.If only I could remember more....I was so dumbed down by the experience, aside from the general eye candy that I can barely remember who I am. Christopher Nolan has more talent in his pubic hair.Thanks Michael Bay. You've turned one of my favorite shows from the 80's into another Michael Bay, Nancy boy film...Way to get the story wrong.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""I'll Drive! You Shoot!!""","Transformers is brought by the director Michael Bay. He is well known for Bad Boys, The Rock This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes facedly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative sideward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this.Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing. In my opinion, I was still entertained through all the years and gave chances for the sequels to be superior enough. As fans have said, 'Michael Bay, you still suck but we still love you.'Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies ever made!!!,"Ever since the 1998 blockbuster Armageddon and the 2001 blockbuster Pearl Harbor comes the movie that gives so much damage and destruction between the Autobots and the Decepticons.The movie stars Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox, Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus Prime), Hugo Weaving (voice of Megatron) Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Anderson, Josh Duhamel, Rachel Taylor, etc.The plot is so hard to explain, but I will say this is the best movie I've seen in the summer.The fights are always awesome, they were never boring, the models of the robots looked great, and everything in the movie are excellent. The final battle where they take place in the city kept me on the edge of my seat for awesomeness throughout the whole movie!!!I also like *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which it was a box office success, and considered the best sequel ever, but however, nominated and won by the those stupid, idiotic, brain dead people of the Raspberry Awards (opposite version of the Academy Awards), but it was very sad to see Transformers 2 win Worst Picture. I cried a bit when that happened. But as a movie, its a must see, but as for the people of the Golden Raspberry Awards, YOU SUCK!!! Everyone as an opinion, but those Raspberry Award people just blew it completely. I hate you.*(Don't trust Wikipedia on the negative reception for that movie, It will ruin it)After that serious rant I made, this movie and the sequel are masterpieces.

Now Showing... Off,"This is what a fun, entertaining, over-the-top, two hours (2:24) at the movies should be like. Bombastic? Yes. Cheesy? Of course. This movie is based on a cartoon and a bunch of toys - it's FUN. Shia La Beouf is great. The rest of the cast is very good. Who cares about the goofs (they are always fun to detect anyways). The soundtrack is powerful, and the rest of the audio is superb. The humor is lighthearted, and yet the battle scenes are wicked. Every time the robots transform I could hear gasps from the audience. The sound they make during their transforming has elements from the cartoon, just like the transporters in the Star Trek movies resembled the TV Series. Very cool. See it. Enjoy it. Laugh and cheer with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers: A Retrospective,"The beginning of a long-derided franchise, which only in the age of non-stop cookie cutter Marvel films is beginning to look like a unique auteurist vision. Bay's Transformers is a ridiculous film, stupid and sometimes meandering, yet it also has more impressive visual effects and sound design than nearly all the blockbusters released today and action scenes as only Bay could make them, with the climax especially so over the top it eventually just wears you down. This is not the kind of movie that you want to watch all in one sitting. (None of the Transformers movies are; they're a bit like Zack Snyder films in this regard).The plot concerns Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky, a teenager who, after buying his first car, finds out that it is capable of transforming into a giant alien robot to 'guard' him from the evil Decepticons. The reasons why he needs to be guarded are ridiculous, but at least they get the plot moving. Which unfolds at a loopy pace, padded out by tentative, quasi-parody Spielbergian stuff (at one point LaBeouf is riding a little girly bike through the streets, yelling that his possessed car is trying to kill him...are Bay and Spielberg making fun of the iconic bike-riding scenes from 80s movies like ET?). There is a lot of comedy in the first half of the film, some of which works particularly when Shia LaBeouf's character is involved. What doesn't work are the myriad of Roland Emmerich-esque subplots thrown in to pad out the runtime. We have researchers, hackers, government men, scenes set in the Middle East, all of which have minimal impact on the story. The humor in these scenes falls flat most of the time, except for when they show the Secretary of Defense running the country while the President of the USA does nothing-this originally would play well as a swipe at George Bush but in the age of Joe Biden it seems ever more pertinent. (Speaking of Bush, there is a way the film could be vaguely read as a Bush/War on Terror allegory, with the Autobots standing in for the USA and the humans as the Middle Easterners. For once I wish the writers would have elaborated on certain political parallels).Finally after around an hour the true stars of the film appear: all the Transformers. The effects used to bring them to life are among the best Hollywood has done, maybe even on par with Davy Jones from the POTC series. But what Bay does next is somewhat baffling. The plot requires the Transformers to get a pair of glasses (?) from Witwicky, so they travel to his home and initiate a slapstick sequence: trying to stay hidden and not destroy everything. Wow. Giant robot heroes from outer space and in their first scenes Bay presents them as a bunch of oversized cybernetic Jerry Lewises.Some words must also be said for the way Witwicky's parents are depicted. These two are so aggressively stupid, so absolutely devoid of anything resembling human intelligence that they come close to derailing the entire movie. I loathed every second they appeared on the screen. It's just Bay's usual tawdry, off-kilter 'humor', but they're so misguided that it's a mystery why Spielberg or even the hack writers didn't get him to tone the idiocy down. Heck, they even dialed it up for the sequel.Overall it's certainly a strange film but nonetheless worth a watch despite itself. There's a kinetic force that Bay brings to his films, even when he sacrifices continuity on the altar of style. Looking back, it certainly predicates the CGI gloop that Hollywood keeps force feeding us now, but has far more personality and is refreshingly free of turgid franchise teasing. It would only be several sequels later when he would be reduced to Marvel movie levels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie about teens ... and for teens ...,"I'm a big sci-fi movie fan, so this was a must-see movie. However, the cartoon-like effects and ""everybody is a teenager"" cast was a little too much for me. This was an excellent idea for a movie, but ended up being more like a 2.5 hour Saturday morning cartoon.The movie has a fantastic storyline. It's basically about alien robots that are at war with each other and are simultaneously searching for a lost artifact of their civilization. How cool is that? Unfortunately, it wasn't executed very well.Aside from minor plot-hole issues and endless brand-name product placement (more than I've ever seen in any movie), there were two main problems.First, all the critical roles are teenagers. Literally. I'm not just talking about the actors, but rather the literal ages of the characters in the movie. The top code-crackers at the Dept. of Defense are teenagers ... the critical characters calling the shots for all of mankind are teenagers ... the Transformers all prefer to communicate with teenagers. You get the picture. Sorry - it's just a little too crazy.Secondly, the effects were not very good. Much of the time, the Transformer scenes looked like cartoons. I would have gladly settled for fewer, but more realistic, special effects. I was willing to let it go in the beginning, but then the cartoon effects became so common-place that it became really annoying.If you're in the teenage demographic and a very forgiving sci-fi fan, you may really like this movie. For everyone else, this may end up being a let-down. Keep your expectations minimal.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformer...More Than Meets the Eye,I don't see how they could've done any better than what they did. The movie was absolutely incredible. All the original elements were there and of course some new ones they had to incorporate. Definitely a must see. Lots of great moments and funny lines. The actors did a wonderful job except for Megan Fox...she just seemed like she was there taking up space and to look good which of course she did. Although she did redeem herself a bit in one sequence w/ Bumble Bee...I was very happy to see that. I know all the males in the room were oogling her. The special effects were wonderful...and as always I.L.M. exceeded themselves yet again.

An Average movie with above average effects,"This is my review on transformers a modern take on an old animated show. It stars Shia Labouef and Megan Fox and was directed Michael Bay.This movie is about a boy named sam (Shia) who is kind of a nerd some what of an outcast. Who has a crush on a girl (Fox) and then one day his dad buys him a car and it turns out to be much more then that.I found this movie to be alright, Shia did a solid acting job but as for Fox everyone knows she cant act and this movie was no exception though she did look good which is why she was there. I found this movie to be a bit long for its plot. I found it dragged out when it could have ended much quicker.Overall I think this movie is worth watching but don't expect too much. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horrible Movie - not worth your time,"Whenever I hear about a movie getting so much hype and attention, I have a feeling it is going to be bad.

With that said, since we are Netflix members I decided to go ahead and add it to my list. It just came in and we made the mistake of actually watching it. My husband got up halfway through the movie and did not return. I decided to stick it out, hoping it might get better. But congratulations American citizens, you did not let me down! I can continue feeling as I do about you.The only thing I am going to ask about this over-the-top unbelievable plot line is: If Shia's grandfather went to the Arctic Circle and died, how in the world could he have passed on his ""secret map glasses""?

I was especially impressed with the special effects. It really seemed like there were robots acting alongside the actors and actresses.

"""Independence Day"" meets ""Terminator"".","""Independence Day"" meets ""Terminator"".Seriously Director Michael Bay delivers a high-caliber, catastrophic action movie of man and machine. Like most action movies attempting to cover so much ground, there are issues the dialogue can be aloof, character development is minimal, and the world of suspended disbelief eventually begins to unravel. But with so much stellar action, this is entirely forgivable. Plus a cast of welcome familiars lead by rising star Shia ""Even Stevens"" LaBeouf and supported by Jon ""Midnight Cowboy"" Voight, Bernie ""Mr. 3000"" Mac, and John ""Don't F*ck with the Jesus"" Turturro.www.manwithavan.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Michael Bay Strikes Again,"I admit, the prospect of a Transformers film filled me with ecstasy. I'm too young to have seen the G1 cartoon but I grew up on G2, Beast Wars, and any other version I could get my grubby hands on. When I heard they were making a live film and that Spielberg was involved, I was over the moon. Then I found out that Spielberg was produced and the film would be directed by Michael Bay. Oh what a sad day. Bay is a master of special effects, but he can't make a stimulating and engaging film to save his life.The plot of the film is (as I expected), thin. However, Bay does what he always does and stretches the plot as far as he can, thus making every flaw infinitely more obvious. This film could have survived with no plot at all, but instead he milks the bizarre story for way more than its worth.Another problem: too many humans. I wanted to see a movie with robots beating the bolts off one another. I got some of that, but Bay allows the military and even average schmucks to square off with these mechanical titans. Shia LeBoeuf earns my eternal respect and admiration for pushing the part of Sam far beyond its limits, but in a good way. He's charming, funny, engaging; he must have shown up on the wrong set and decided to stay. Megan Fox is hot, but she only serves to set up more laughs from Shia. These should have been the only two noteworthy humans in the film, but no. We've got two hackers, the Secretary of Defense, a small band of soldiers, and even a government agency. In a film devoted to robots, the robots only appear on screen about 20 percent of the time. As with all Bay films, it tries to convey depth with a thin romantic subplot. Cheesy romance does not equal depth. Character development and analysis equals depth. Robots have no depth (even sentient ones), so just get to the fighting.When Bay deigns to let us see the Transformers, he only looks at the Autobots. In the entire film we are allowed one snippet of Decepticon dialog where Megatron tells off Starscream. The rivalry between those two is hands down the richest and deepest part of the cartoon. How could you not go further with that? Axe the longing stares that Shia gives to Fox and you've freed up enough time to study the only intriguing subplot in the Transformers universe. But no, we instead look at the Autobots, who repeat over and over that humans must be protected. I appreciate it fellas, but I can't root for you if I can't see how evil the other guys are.There are some funny lines here (notably involving Sam's parents), and the action is just what you'd expect from a Michael Bay film: loud, explosive, and awesome. However, this film would have been a modern action masterpiece if Spielberg had directed and Bay had produced. Steven would have given the explosions purpose. He would have looked at the bad guys. Bay could still put fire and bullets all over the place, but he couldn't bore us with yet another pointless romance. It's worth seeing and if you have an HD player, it was made for this film, but it's a vacant film that could have and should have been much more entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finnally!!! A Great Summer Movie For 2007!!! *Whew!*,"I just got back from watching this awesome movie for the second time! I cannot put into words how much this movie blew me away!

This movie is even better than the trailer makes it out to be!I know there are a small minority of people who are bashing this film for being cheesy and having lame dialogue, but give me a break! Its a summer action flick! Almost every summer blockbuster is like that. The summer movies are the ones that we shut off our brains and get blown away by the special effects and hardcore action. Michael Bay has never really been one for sophisticated dialogue (but it doesn't matter!) and as far as the cheese factor goes... IT WAS MADE FROM A SERIES OF CHILDREN'S TOYS!!! What did you expect!? These movies aren't about academy awards! Transformers is straight up entertaining. Which is what summer blockbusters are all about. It has great action throughout and offers plenty of laughs. Thankfully, it doesn't take itself too seriously, the people who made Transformers knew it was a cheesy idea and they had fun with it.

Hyped up.,"This movie was a decent adaptation of the popular Transformers series. Now this movie certainly was strong in the effects department but the actors looked like they were struggling at times. Despite all this, they still had a strong plot overall, along with an all star cast. The movie starts off with a young Shia LeBeaouf as Sam, his goal at this point is to get an A in every class to get his first car and ultimately make it in society. Along with Megan Fox as his soon to be girlfriend. The story starts off somewhat slow, the car he buys from the dealership just happens to be Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. The story continues further as Sam eventually finds out the truth about his car and the Autobots vs Decepticons. The plot holds tight to the original series overall. The different Autobots are all forming to defeat the Decepticons and take down Megatron. I would have liked to see Hotshot instead of Bumblebee but thats my opinion. The creators really made a great interpretation and adaptation of Transformers. I had a few problems with this movie however. Number One would have to be the weight of these giant machines. Throughout the movie they seem to movie so gracefully, like their weightless. Sure one could argue that there rocket propulsion to make them seem weightless, but still it bothered me a bit which cost this movie a few points. The other problem I had was the size of the machines. In the series they were not at that large except for Optimus Prime and Megatron, their size held their significance. However in this movie they were quite large. But despite all of this it was still a decent action flick and I strongly recommend it for all the fans because its just Transformers at their best. Enormous, loud, and entertaining. If your not a fan I still recommend it. Its a great action flick that wont disappoint with its great special effects. So I give this a 70% because it appeals to the fans and pulls in some new ones as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Scrap Metal,"Optimus Prime: Sorry, my bad.No, it is I who is sorry, Optimus Prime, for I do not accept your apology. You can hardly be held accountable for the two-hour plus mess that is TRANSFORMERS, 2007's tent pole original blockbuster, but my anger needs to be directed somewhere. Seeing as how director Michael Bay is not standing here in front of me, you my fictional friend will have to do. It could have all been so simple. You had a pretty solid cartoon back in the 80's. The Autobots and Decepticons had their crews in check and their goals set. Both teams found themselves here on Earth. The Decepticons were bent on bleeding the world of its energy to bring back to your home planet somewhere so that they could rule while you were here to stop them and protect us simple humans at the same time. They would plot and you would plan and battles would go on with very little involvement on the part of the human race. Why then, in your live action feature film debut, do we see no trace of you but instead a few unpopular Decepticons and a ton of one-liner jokester humans for the first half of this film? Could your agent not negotiate you some more screen time?The Transformers from the cartoon series had personality, ranging from a corny sense of humour to loyalty to caring. The movie machines, well, they have names and that's about it. Gone are the neurosis and power struggles, replaced by supposed strength and stature. Standing and looking pretty for our enjoyment only takes us so far. Without squabbling between Megatron and Starscream to scoff at, we're left to seek out personality from the human faction of this ensemble. Unfortunately, like any ""good"" action movie, actual colour in a character or a performance is entirely optional. Army boys anxiously await their return to their loved ones at home; high school jocks mock the dorks to look good for their girls; and those same girls can twist their hips just right to catch the setting sun against their bare stomachs. With such reusable filler characters, no actor actually has to try to craft depth into the fold. Luckily, the ""IT"" boy himself, Shia LaBeouf, is young enough and hungry enough to not forsake his own talents to the point of banality. As Sam Witwicki, TRANSFORMERS' central human character, LaBeouf is charming, shy and earnest. His performance shines like the brightest piece in a sea of scrap metal and solidifies his face as one that will be seen for many years to come.Why do I find myself going on and on about people in a review for a movie about machines? Perhaps this is because TRANSFORMERS treats the Transformers like an afterthought most of the time. Granted, they are very elaborate and exquisite constructions but how can they be seen as anything but secondary when some of the most popular Transformers don't make an appearance until the last third of the film? And as beautiful as the talented folks at Industrial Light and Magic made these reincarnations, they are a bit too complex for their own good. Watching all the metal pieces swerve in and around while the machines transform made me think of the toys I had as a boy. If they were ever that complicated to transform, I doubt I would have played with them for as long as I did. The abundance of detail gets even messier when the Transformers start to rumble with each other. Through what he believes to be fancy camera work, Bay over uses close-up's and quick editing to turn his machines into metal monstrosities that are at times near impossible to distinguish from one another. You can't tell who's who until the metallic mess breaks apart and one machine stands while another has fallen. There's an awful lot of fighting but it's also a lot of not being able to tell who's winning.It is pointed out to me time and time again that big budget action movies require a good chunk of our brains to be shut off in order to be enjoyed. Are we not tired yet of filmmakers giving us the bare minimum and the same old conventions while expecting us to fall over ourselves at the sight of awesome movie magic? TRANSFORMERS is not horrible because it is a special effects driven action film. It is horrible because it took the enormous potential to be a cheeky, geeky visual wonder and diminished that by dumbing it down to a mess of gunfire, product placement and hollowed-out, clunky machines. While it can be fun to relax our minds and enjoy the good times, it is not acceptable to dangle a shiny piece of metal before our eyes to distract us from seeing that that's all you got.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent film. especially if you grew up with Transformers in the 80's!,"The characters have the same names as the original cartoon from the 80's but some look different in both robot and vehicle form. this, however, shouldn't spoil the film for 80's Trannsformers fans. I suppose they have updated some of the vehicles to be more modern, after all this film is being paired with massive marketing and merchandising schemes which will be aimed at today's young kids and teens. The film itself was excellent. The opening sequence is a blinder and there is somewhat of a wait to see Prime, which in my opinion is the main Transformer. The special effects are slick and very impressive. The transformers transforming are great to watch ( just like the Citroen ads)but I do think they should have included the transforming noise from the original cartoon! Prime sounds like the original, which is good, and they have kept some of the original phrases, like, ""Autobots move out!""... although I was a bit disappointed not to hear, ""Autobots Transform!"". The storyline is pretty good. It is kept simple and easy to follow which is good as the film isn't one that is supposed to provoke much thought, but to be action packed and entertaining - which it definitely is. They have included a certain element of humour, which surprisingly goes down very well as the timing is spot on. If you grew up with the cartoon I think you will really enjoy this adaptation, even though it slightly strays from the original characters, and I think todays kids will love this too. I would definitely recommend it. This will undoubtedly be my favourite film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Don't ever frame scenes like stating an Indian for irresponsibility activity in the film as well as in real. As because Chinese, Japanese, Europe's's may be wealthy in all resources in mechanical, electronics and etc.......................... but we Indians has the only valuable human resource BRIAN.. so mind Ur creativity sorry 2 say not a rationalist but sathish",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Flawed but excellent nonetheless..........,"I so badly wanted to give this film a ten. How could a story about huge transforming robots fighting be anything but cool. I know that sounds geeky but it's true.Well the answer is that the transformers are, as expected, bit parts to the humans. Of course the human side needs to be told, it is easier to relate to humans than robots after all. Unfortunately there is little characterisation of either Autobots or Decepticons. Minor side plots for unimportant characters take up more time than the 'bots which in my mind weakened the story. On the plot side of things, the story is pretty weak and contrived but I wasn't expecting anything special.Most summer blockbusters feel the need to cover all bases, action, love story etc. and Transformers falls into the same trap of adding poor childish and inappropriate humour. Making comedy characters out of Jazz and even Optimus at times doesn't work and had me shaking my head in disbelief.Now you may be wondering why I scored this film eight out of ten as I keep slating it. The answer is simple, the subject matter is so good that it would have been hard to mess up. The grin that appears every time a 'bot transforms stays for ages. Every fight scene looks great if a little bit shaky. I'm not one to be wowed by fancy cgi and explosions but Bay has done well this time. There is a sense of size, bulk and power behind each Transformer that helps you feel every blow.In spite of all the negative comments, I really enjoyed the film and I recommend it to every one. If you see it, see it in the cinema.Now all we can hope is that the sequel concentrates on the title characters a bit more. After all that is what we all want to see the film for isn't it?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Awesome movie, I would go back and see it again and will purchase the movie when it come out on DVD","The graphics was awesome, I love the setting and the entire story as a whole. It was a mix of endless humor, laughs, action, drama, and an excellent story all wrapped up in one.. I did not fall asleep in the cinema this time for a change. It was everything I expected in a movie. The movie is rather sentimental for me because it was my sons favorite cartoon. One of my sons has pass away a few years ago and the movie brought back fond memories of him. The only thing missing was the original theme song ""Transformers"", which I thought would have played a the end of the movie during the credits. I will go back and see it again because the first time I cried through out the entire movie in remembrance of my beloved son Ansil. I wish he was here to see it. Great movie, great entertainment.

"Not the most involving movie, but highly enjoyable nonetheless.","I got to see Transformers....not to be confused with Transformers: The Movie, the 1986 animated film that leaves a couple of continuity mistakes with this recent flick (as does the original show and comics). headed by Michael Bay as director and Steven Spielberg as exec. producer, this recent summer blockbuster is a modern day ""rebuilding"", if you will, of the 80's cartoon many of my generation loved as a child (and still do today, in some cases). some changes have been made to bring this concept in the real world, yet the general love for the Transformers remains intact. even if the intentions were higher than the result.Transformers' storyline follows around a teenage boy (Shia LaBeouf) leading a normal teenage lifestyle while trying to woo the girl of his dreams (Megan Fox), or, more likely, his fantasies. his dad buys him a car from a used car dealer (a small cameo by Bernie Mac). the car he ends up getting turns out to be a giant robot, which engages in a battle with another robot. eventually, more robots land on Earth and meet up with the boy to find a pair of glasses that may hold the key to the planet's future. the leader, Optimus Prime (brought to life once again by Peter Cullen) explains that there are two races of robotic beings: the benevolent, heroic Autobots and the evil, destructive Decepticons. Prime explains that the source of all their power comes from a cube called the AllSpark, and that the Decepticons plan to use it to conquer everything. meanwhile, the Decepticons have already crept into disguise amongst the human world and are seeking to release their tyrannical leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving, of V For Vendetta, The Matrix, and The Lord Of The Rings).and so and so forth continues into some of the most eye-popping CGI action scenes we've seen to date. seriously, the special digital effects for Spider-Man 3, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End, and Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer combined don't even hold a candle to the sheer amazing attention to detail put forth in Transformers. I still revel in the fact that we've brought cinematic technology into reality as far as we probably can since seeing this movie so many days ago. i'd always wondered what real-life version of my favorite cartoons would look like, but i'd never have believed that it was going to be like this. the characters are also as interesting to watch as the CGI that brings them to life. the Autobots (namely Optimus Prime and Ironhide) have some really great characterization, and the Decepticons (or rather, Megatron and StarScream) act just as one would imagine them. one by one, the action scenes blast you out of the seat. there's also some really good humor here, as well as some fine voice acting. and trust me, it could have been bad. don't complain about Frank Welker not doing a voice-over. what might be most appealing to some fans is the dialog that parallels the mood and memorable moments of the original cartoons and movie. overall, the best features about this film are the CGI wonders and the tiny details they put into the film. what's really excellent though, is the film's instrumental score. i'm not sure who wrote or composed it, but it's nigh perfect in compliance with the movie's atmosphere.but, like every other movie, it has it's bad points. where Transformers really suffers is strangely enough in it's concept execution. now, i'm not saying that this wasn't a good movie. I think it's a great movie. it's just that this is a realistic version of a 1980's cartoon about cars and jets and other machines that turned into giant robots with laser pistols. it's not exactly the kind of flick you'd think was a surefire thing. because of this, everyone is going to go into this movie - hardcore fans, casual fans, newcomers, nostalgics, people who couldn't give a sh*t about anything Transformers-related before this movie - with something different in their minds. not necessarily expectations, but more of what they want this movie to be. in turn, this mind frame is going to cause of a lot of disappointment for a lot of people, in various ways. for me, Transformers was a little too ""open"". it leaves lots and lots of space for the already-in-production two sequels, but I don't think that that's such a good thing. sure, it means more robotic butt-kickery, but do we really need another good-movie-turned-franchise to wear down into the ground until there's nothing left? weren't Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and Jurassic Park enough? another bad point about Transformers is the human acting. sometimes it's very good, sometimes it's too cheesy for it's own good. sometimes we get some good characterization, sometimes we get a throwaway character with no substance or value to the film (i'm thinking directly of the pointless jab at George W. Bush and Jon Voight's all-commanding Secretary of Defense). overall, the acting is inconsistent. Shia's very good, and fun to watch, but Fox provides nothing more than a tantalizing body to drool over. there are some minor annoyances of mine, but I won't go into them since they'll probably be mine alone and don't really take away from the film. except for the fact that the movie ends with Shia making out with Megan on top of Bumblebee, who's pretty much his best friend by the end of the movie. way to let your pal in on the action, there, kid. cue Prime's excellent ending speech.basically, Transformers is a fun ride, well-worth the admission price (or possibly even two or three) and by far one of the best films of the summer. a welcome change from all the lackluster disappointments of other summer blockbusters this year, and without a doubt one of Michael Bay's best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Excellent, from start to finish, yet there was some let downs...","From the moment i saw the teaser trailers, and noticed Micheal Bay (Pearl Harbour & The Island director), I was going to see this movie indefinitely. Plus, executive produced by Stephen Spielberg which influenced me more. I was anticipating this would be a real blockbuster.I questioned myself whether it might be quite a let down, due to over excessive amounts of money put into it. But was i sure wrong! From start to finish i was entertained! Terrific acting from Shia LaBeouf who has been doing great with his career (Disturbia is his next summer blockbuster) and also the wonderful Megan Fox, who, in which many gentleman will agree, is a girl you would drop everything to look at her.The special effects were excellent, the best I've seen yet, especially the transformation of the robots (which are the main point about the transformers franchise). The only let down, is that there isn't much emphasis on the characters. Sure, it does start off as a steady drama and does show the life of Sam Witwicky, which escalates when he meets hot chick Mikaela Banes who is most obviously infatuated by her. But yes the balance of personality of the characters and the action is just too bias. Near to the end you kind of think, ""what's going on?"" you get a bit confused with all the quick action, you're just overfed with action, and sometimes does get rather annoying. There are some quirky, witty and humorous moments in the film which gives it a more happier tone to the movie.All in all this is one great film, and i recommend it to all! Well done Spielberg and Bay!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A frankly dull and terrible movie.. aimed at 6 year olds,"How did this movie end up so bad? In theory its a movie that couldn't fail.. yet somehow they manage to make it not just dumb (which can be fine in an action flick) but incredibly BORING as well.It bears an uncanny resemblance to Herbie: Fully Loaded in terms of its casting, the sophistication of it's plot, and the style of movie making. Its basically a lightweight teen comedy.. which happens to have a few big robots that show up occasionally to do clownish comedy.The lead character is reasonably funny, in a lightweight kinda way. Its just that the jokes go on.. and on... and on... after about 20 minutes you are severely hoping he'll get annihilated by the decepticons.Unfortunately for the audience.. the decepticons don't really even show up for about 90 minutes.. apart from a crazy, comedy, mini decepticon which acts kinda like a hyperactive jar jar binks.Even more criminally, the Autobots aren't in the movie much either. Probably their largest amount of screen time is an ENDLESS comedy skit where they bumble around the back garden, treading on fountains, getting peed on by dogs and trying to hide from the kid's parents. (who are also kinda funny.. but seem to think they are in an American Pie movie).The special effects are pretty sweet, but not quite as amazing as they are made out to be. The integration with the real world is usually pretty good. But the little jar-jar robot looks like some reject SFX from 5 years ago.The action sequences are huge... with lots of explosions and destruction. But they aren't very coherent. Part of the problem is the new designs for the robots.. when they are in motion they look like an indistinct pile of garbage. Trying to see what is actually going on when two indistinct shapes are flipping around and fighting in amongst all the explosions, and with all the bad editing, is pretty hard.Which must be why they mostly ignore the autobots and concentrate on showing us the US army shooting at stuff, and running in slow motion. (its a great advert for the army... plus yahoo, pontiac, and all the other blatant product placement).The action sequences just don't measure up in terms of excitement, pacing and coherence to recent movies like Die Hard 4.0.The film gets 4 points for Optimus Prime. He still rocks. His voice is cool. He's not actually in the movie much.. but when he is he usually rocks. Unfortunately it then loses 2 for making him say ""my bad"".Also.. what happened to the cute blonde hacker, and her comedy sidekick (yet another one)??? They just disappeared from the story.I'm not exactly sure what happened to Michael Bay.. he made one of the best action movies ever in The Rock.. and every subsequent film has been worse. This one actually makes Armageddon look like a good movie. OK popcorn flick.. but as is, its pretty terrible. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining to the very end,"I never did like watching Transformers as a little kid, but back then everybody knew what Transformers is. I wasn't particularly looking forward to this movie, nor was I blown away by its trailers. I was thinking that this is just another CGI movie with cheesy plots and lots of fighting. Boy was I wrong. It is the best movie I've watched so far for this year! The movie started off slowly, with lots of curious humans wondering what the heck was invading earth. Later, we all will learn what the Autobots and Decepticons are, and what their mission is. It wasn't all thrown at you in one go, but the plot was slowly revealed to you, making it an enjoyable watch, as far as plot goes.There are funny times, when you laugh out loud. But it wasn't too cheesy. And there are times when you want to cry out for your favourite robot. The cast was excellent, making you believe in them and want to sit with them throughout the movie.Overall, an excellent storyline, extremely good CGI, some nice action scenes (even for the girls), with cute casts to go along.

Transformers.... by Michael Bay...,"For starters... I am a ""Transformers G1"" fan and I love those good old 80s TV series. Because I think they were great! So expect a ranting that is kinda mix of Christian Bale and Lewis Black.Now! Let's start with the people who came up with the retarded idea for this film and those guys are Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and John Rogers. They are the ""writers""... who ruined our childhood by their idea and thanks to Bay this idea was produced on big screen. The producers of this film said that they are a G1 fans and they wanted to make the same film. Well... they lied. The idea was to give us robots who don't talk at all... Have they even seen a G1 cartoon? Than Orci and Kurtzman come up with the idea that robots should talk, but they're will not be the focus of the film... And that's ladies and gentlemen... the Hollywood. They should rename it - No-idea-wood. So, take the original idea, turn it to a dump and hand it to Michael Bay.Which leads us to Bay himself. This guy is unbelievable. Who just keep making expensive films that looks like giant commercials. His camera angles, plot holes... incredible! How come that this guy exist in the world of cinema? Explosions? Son of a... OK, we expect explosions in Transformers film, so... good for Bay. But, not good for us. Bay is really an expert to irritate audiences and ruin his own films. I guess what? He did ruined our childhoods. The G1 cartoons are cool even today. They were the best! Now, Bay's directing of the film... nothing but dumb plot holes, for one moment, it is a middle of the day, the next second - night. Who turned off the lights?! Shallow, irritating (human) characters, they seemed lost in the film. I mean, look at the actors, they looked so uninterested so... without emotions. I am not saying that most of them were bad actors, but they really looked kinda... ""Oh, we are here, we are payed"". I think that the only good thing is music score by Steve Jablonsky. And there are few more. We'll be back later on that...Actors: Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky (the name Sam... was it that hard to give him a real name - 'Spike'! His name is Spike!). Shia is not bad actor, but he seemed pretty irritating on some occasions, he is more like to be a future comedian in sweet, romantic comedies, or action comedies. Megan Fox as Mikaela. Megan was there just to look hot and sexy, for that's all she is... hot and sexy. To attract moviegoers that find leading actress pretty. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson... nothing special in their performances. Rachel Taylor, well she is not bad as an actress, but... she was here for cuteness too. Anthony Anderson was here for comic relief, but no luck, he was loud and irritating. Jon Voight and John Tururro? Two greatest actors in the film, they did this for the money. When you see Turturro as a g-man, you know that it's not gonna be serious. His character was designed as another comic relief, but... no luck. Kevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky, he was good (but they didn't address him to his G1 nickname 'Sparkplug', and he is not an engineer...) Julie White as Judy Witwicky, she was awesome! (but alas... Spike didn't have a mother in G1). We also had Bernie Mac in some of his last film roles...Now, the robots. As Bay stated ""he didn't want to make a stupid robot film"" and ""he didn't want for robots to look like some funny boxes from the cartoon"". If you don't want to make a stupid film about robots... don't do it at all! Let's start with the design of the robots. Well, I can't argue with that, the design is good, it's very rational in many ways, rather to look like ""boxes"", but if you ask me, you could put ""box robots"" in the film, but the movie crew who works on design, on concept idea, they were to lazy to even try and test how would it look. But, the robots didn't look that bad. The wrong thing about them is their character. In G1, the robots were important, they were the focus. But, here, robots comes second. The autobots are heroic and decepticons are evil and that's it. They don't talk much, they didn't really give some stronger personality, instead, they are retards. Bumblebee for example, he is mute and he could communicate through the sounds and radio and that's a sacrilege! Bumblebee is one of the most famous autobots, if not even more famous than Optimus himself. Megatron for example is just evil and that's it. He wasn't that long on screen, he came out of nowhere and that's it ""I'm evil and I am megatron!"". Optimus was OK, just like we expected, so Peter Cullen (the voice of Optimus who did the voice in G1 cartoon), he was Optimus again and he was good. Hugo Weaving voiced Megatron. Hugo is a brilliant actor, but he was given to little to make something out of it. Decepticons are speaking in cybertronian language... what a waste of time and idea. Keep talking in English! Why don't autobots talk in their own language? Because it makes decepticons more menacing. Face it, robots look good outside, but inside - retards. The only transformer that I like is Bonecrusher, he looked cool and he had a cool, evil personality, alas... he was there very short. And that's your film... ruined forever with this piece of crap. Bay also did a sequel, because no one touches his ""baby"", well maybe it's your baby, but it's not your original idea. I give it 6 out of 10 because it is entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining (but flawed) action fluff,"""Transformers"" is a lot of fun. Despite the negative reception the future installments of the franchise would receive, this Michael Bay effort is at least entertaining. Action scenes are plentiful and satisfying and the CGI has aged quite well for the most part. Unfortunately, the human characters are either very annoying or stock cliché. Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky is always nervous, always sweating, always making excuses for himself. Megan Fox is there as the eye candy love interest and of course we have your typical military types, comedy relief types, and government agent types. Despite the long run time, the film doesn't feel like it buckles under its own weight. Too bad the Transformers don't show up until an hour in.

Transformers,"My wife and I walked out after 40 minutes. This was a huge disappointment to me. When I first heard they had made a movie our of a bad 20 year old cartoon (and toy) I dismissed it but when i saw the ratings on IMDb for my demo(Males over 45 rated 7.3) I figured this would be a Pirates of the Caribean pleasant surprise. it wasn't. And here's the thing: I like almost any movie with Sci Fi, Robots, or military action and this had all three. Yet it was offensively boring. Am i completely out of touch or have the super reliable IMDb ratings lost their way? there have been plenty of times when I liked a movie a lot more or a lot less than my peers, but never a case where I give a movie a 1 then got a 7.3 from everyone else.The transformers CGI was cartoonish. The comedy was silly and not funny. The plot was non-existent. Maybe it got better after the 40 minutes i saw (there were 100 minutes to go) but I can't imagine it would've saved my opinion. I'm not a movie snob. I loved comedies like spaceballs, Austin powers, and Waynes world. I ate up Sci Fi like I Robot, Solyaris, blade runner, etc. All of these had a plot or well written comedy. what am I missing here? One or two other films this year were much worse (in my opinion) than their ratings.

A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that!

(it should be noted here that I bought tickets to the film Live Free or Die Hard which was a totally awesome movie I saw already and then walked into Transformers) There is no way it could be good. It's Michael Bay. He only makes crappy mainstream formula movies.*sigh* Transformers is actually a good movie. I liked it. Not only did I like it, I really liked it. I'm the kind of person who admits when he's wrong and I was wrong in this instance. Michael Bay's style was actually perfect for this movie. It definitely brought out the big kid in me. If you were a fan of Transformers you just can't help but get all excited and get into the movie. Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee, Rachet, Starscream, Megatron, they're all here and it was fun to watch. Just plain fun.Now don't get me wrong, there was some stupid stuff in the movie. Some scenes were meant to be nothing but funny and they were trying too hard. And some things just don't make any sense. But Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are the keys to the whole movie. They win you over, they make you care, and they carry the movie through some of the absurd parts.Is Michael Bay a good director? I still say no. I hate his work actually. One good movie out of the dozens of others he's made doesn't make you a good director. But Transformers was a good movie and I really liked it. I can't believe I'm saying it, but it's true. In the hands of a better director this movie would have been great, but instead it's good. And it did win me over in the end.

Transformers fans and lovers of popcorn action rejoice!,"Transformer fans rejoice! Lovers of awesome action packed spectacle rejoice! Michael Bay has delivered us one hell of a cinematic roller coaster ride. This Transfan just had the pleasure of seeing a sneak preview of the new film that starts everywhere on July 3 (although there are some early showings on July 2 at 8PM and midnight) and I walked out of the movie theater with a great big smile on my face.Even the fact that it was pouring down rain and my car was a football field away from the entrance to the movie theater couldn't dampen my parade after this movie. This film delivers the goods on all accounts and delivers them in a big way! The action is fantastic, the special effects are perfect, and surprisingly enough (in such an action special effects driven feature) the actors all turn in great performances that add that extra special touch to the film. Also, the humor works very well and is satisfying and natural instead of silly and forced. Transformer fans will be pleased and yet people who don't have a clue who Optimus Prime or Megatron are will enjoy this ride, too judging by the enthusiastic reaction of my friend who knew nothing going into the film other than that it was a movie that featured giant transforming robots.About the only small complaint that I can offer is that they did such a great job with setting up the story and bringing the Transformers into the picture that they wind up having too little time in the epic finale to develop any of the Decepticon characters to the degree that lovers of the comic and show will remember. However, I'm sure that this will be rectified in the sequel that is hinted at by the movie's final minutes.Go see this movie as soon as you can on the big screen!

Surprise! It's an OK-movie,"When I went to see Transformers I was expecting the worst.Another film based on a cartoon series! And it was for the kids, so the Transformers have been all good, and the evil Decepticons were simply evil. And Michael Bay as a director, most of his movies are pretty bad to my mind (Armageddon, Pear Harbor, Bad Boys, The Island). Perfect ingredients for another cinema-disaster.But I liked the Transformer-cartoons, so I had to watch.What a surprise. The main theme is not really about the robots, but about a teenager and his (of course) problems with first love. This theme is told with a lot of humor and irony, making it bearable and in fact entertaining.The robots add to the fun and deliver the action, otherwise no one would watch the film.

By far the best of 2007,"I'm a Projectionist from new Zealand i just got to see the movie on the mega screen with three hundred and ninety nine others and all i can say is when the credits started to roll most of the crowd applauded and cheered i've worked at the movies two years and have never seen that. the movie itself (keeping in mind i am not a big transformers fan, and i see a few movies a week so I'm kind of jaded) was just BRILLIANT, bay keeps things moving at a blistering pace, slowly revealing the auto bots and decepticons peace by piece ensuring each set piece out does the last. the action and special effects are mind blowing for a movie with this budget (this is what spider-man 3's colossal budget should have delivered) and will honestly leave you breathless. really all i can find wrong with it was some of the humour was slightly young for me (i'm 18) but i could hear most of the audience laughing.

Transformers (2007) - I Bought a Car That Turned Out to Be an Alien Robot! Who Knew?,"Michael Bay brings the classic Hasbro toy collection ""Transformers"" to the big screen. The only plot this movie contains is just a bunch of walking and talking robots, battling and fighting, and the only necessary plot is action, duh! ""Transformers"" is a movie that is expressed in both positive and negative reactions. Negative thoughts - Michael Bay brought too much for this movie, turning him into a terrible director. The action was too much for me, the cinematography is too fast, the editing is annoying, and the script is stupid and unrealistic. Positive thoughts - Shia LaBeouf, although he acts like a jerk throughout, he still makes a pretty good performance. Megan Fox did alright in her performance in this movie, but she and LaBeouf don't really show a lot of chemistry between them. The sound is dazzling, the visual effects are astounding, some moments were funny, some members of the cast I liked, and the Optimus Prime character was powerful and enjoying. Now, I'm not saying that ""Transformers"" is either the greatest or the worst movie ever made. It's an alright movie with too much action and way less story, but it sometimes manages to thrill you, even though it's mostly annoying. Besides that, it's a movie that is perfect summer entertainment for your kids, and I thought it was pleasant, in a both enjoying and annoying way.

Funny only for Americans!,"I don't understand and it's impossible for me to understand why this movie is being so much well rated by people. This is a crap that only Michael Bay is possible to offer. It's a movie only for Americans taste and it's funny only for that audience because the movie is full of those ""american jokes"", jokes that 95% of rest of world population would not even move a facial muscle for it.Michael Bay is well known for horrible blockbusters like The Rock, Armageddon and one of the worst flops of history: Pearl Harbor. I kinda liked The Island, but I totally hated Transformers.It's sad being sit by almost 2 hours and 30 minutes of horrible acting (exception of Shia, he's a very nice boy), terrible script, awful plot and those wannabe-funny robots.Those robots are a shame. The robots on the animated series were fun because, you know, it was ANIMATED. Now, there's no reason for those robots that came from a totally different world to have hip hop manners, feel pain, have fighting techniques or just scream during a hunt: I CAN SMELL YOU. Where in the world those robots would do that? Oh, I know... Hollywood.That movie is for kids only. If adults like it, it will be just for the visual effects and for some remembering of their childhood and not for being a very interesting or funny movie.I'm completely disappointed.

"great movie for the summer heat, but felt a tiny bit lacking","first of all, the michael bay's editing has taken a huge amount of flak over the frenetic feel of the action sequences. I would like to point out that the movie was from a human perspective, we see the battles as a bystander would, does it make for as cool a film? Not really, but the objective served it's purpose, it was a decision that added cohesion to the film. All in all it was a great movie that deserves kudos for a conversion that pleases both fans and non-fans alike. My only complaint is that the movie occasionally didn't know whether it should take it's source material seriously or just have fun with it, which is a common problem in many newer comic-book/cartoon based films (especially FF4 and spider-man 3). The film is well done, if you have a gripe, tell me, what would have made it better, cause I see no way bay should have done any differently.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Extremely Perverted and Inappropriate!,"The movie is full of sexual dialogue from the main character who is underage. There is also a middle-aged man (about 40) who makes an inappropriate sexual comment towards an underage child, calling her hot while looking at her up and down. It is sick. The producers adds in the most unhinged, perverted dialogue I have ever seen. The main characters are in high school, they do not talk like that. Stop sexualizing underage children and normalizing it. It is disgusting and abhorrent. The way high schoolers and underage kids are portrayed in this movie is disturbing.

"Oh, no, man. Freddy Krueger have four blades, man. That's only three. That's Wolverine!","In 2007 Michael Bay delivered us the very first live action Transformers film. Seven years later we are about to see part four of his franchise. Within the next eleven days, before the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction, I am going to review the first three films that Michael Bay directed. So here we go with the very first film, Transformers.Re-watching this film after having not seen it for about three years, I found myself mostly uninterested in the film. Sure the action is amazing, great use of the CG by Michael Bay, but there really isn't anything great about the film. Certainly not perfect in any department as well. However if you look up the movie term, Summer Blockbuster, I'm sure you will find pictures of Michael Bay films, more so Transformers. The story is light and paper thin. No one set out a goal to win Oscars when they made this film. They wanted a high octane action film for summer movie fans, and frankly in that regard, they succeeded at a high level. The acting is mostly just awful. Shia LaBeouf is simply annoying, can't like his character at all. The only actors who are enjoyable and do a great job are Jon Voight and John Turturro. Anthony Anderson had me cracking up in the few scenes he had in the film as well. While we are on humor here, I must say, the humor factor is over the top. Not as over the top as the sequel though.Michael Bay, the director of this film, is known for those big epic summer blockbusters, he has been making them for many years now, and with no signs of slowing down. While he never really gave us great stories with complex characters, he does give us amazing action scenes, that we will remember for awhile. Since it was so long in between my last viewing of this film, I was kind of shocked looking back at how many big gaps fill in between the great action scenes. There is a lot of worthless banter back and fourth, and more stupid humor, that really drags this film down. The acting in this film as I mentioned above is overall just bad, minus a couple examples. Michel Bay isn't really known for getting great performances out of his stars, and this film continues that trend. He just likes to blow stuff up, and in the end, he does it very well.Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman wrote this film, as well as the sequel, and I won't put it lightly, these guys are a laughing stock of their profession. This might be one of the few times you don't want to punch the writers in the head. Watch the sequel to this film, and you will change your attitude. While this story is simple minded it is effective for the start of the franchise. While I do not like these writers at all, I must admit they didn't mangle this film here I am talking about. They weren't perfect either. The characters are very wooden and not really developed at all. I don't really take all of this out on them because of the type of film it is, but it wasn't a great overall effect.Overall the start of this franchise isn't going to be making any top ten lists of mine, unless of course I make a list of mindless summer blockbusters. The action in this film is amazing, and while there are a lot of boring parts in between, when it goes back to the action, you just keep loving it. Remember, as I said above, this is a pure popcorn summer blockbuster film. If you lay back and remember that key fact, I see no reason why you cannot enjoy this film for what it really is.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Pure entertainment, but don't look too deep.","To the people who are saying this is the best movie they've ever seen: You need to see more movies. Seriously.And to the people who are saying this is the worst movie they've ever seen: Again, you need to see more movies, because if you've never come across anything worse than this, you clearly don't watch very many.The story in general is pretty cheesy and very clichéd - the hot girl who goes out with the superficial hunk but then dumps him for the nerdy hero because there's ""more to her than meets the eye"", the evil secret agent chaps, determined to stick to the rule-book, the die-hard soldiers with the ""be brave! you're a soldier now kid!"" speech... all that. But don't lay into how silly that story is if you're going to defend the story of the transformers, which is, let's face it, pretty stupid to begin with. ""Our world was created by a powerful artifact, then destroyed by the evil robots who want to use it's power for evil, so we threw it into space to stop them, now we've come here to stop them again because we're the awesome good robots, defenders of mankind""... oh please.At this point, you might be thinking I hated the movie, but you'd be wrong - it was awesome entertainment. The transformers are great, the action scenes are great, the music is great, Megan Fox is a fox (ahahaha like that pun hasn't been done a million times already), the nerdy-bloke-wins-fair-lady's-heart story is feel-good fun, there's plenty of laughs.

Nice Work Michael Bay,"I saw this movie opening weekend and at the time was mildly anticipating it. I knew Michael Bay from Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and Bad Boys so I knew what to expect; I knew Bay's style. But, I gotta say, he outdid himself this time. He put on a min blowing show full of explosive, fast paced action, eye candy, and unbeatable effects work. This is an Empire State building of movie making madness.Now, this could have been utterly ruined with the one-liners and over reliance on baseless action sequences. But there was a nice overall rhythm and flow. It slowed down enough at parts just to give me a breather and then threw me right back on the roller coaster. Each robot had distinct personalties, there were extravagant locations. Bay could have made this a corny kids movie but it worked for me big time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Aside from some pacing issues in the middle of the film, I actually found it quite enjoyable. So much so, I actually want to see it again. I was even delightfully surprised that they managed to have to robots talk and communicate without making the film completely absurd.Overall, It was a fantastic film, and as long as they can maintain this quality, I look forward to a sequel.Now I can worry about G.I.

How many cliché lines can Bay fill a movie with, that might be the Bay's true goal. Maybe one of his future movies will have actual actor dialog to replace the 30 second TV commercial dialog that just inundates this entire movie. Why did Michael Bay insist on putting lips on Prime even though he rarely spoke it seemed like none of the Transformers rarely spoke. Bay have you heard of character development.

Long-awaited but disappointing live action Transformers adventure,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGeeky Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his parents and has an impossible crush on a pretty girl at his school named Mikaela (Megan Fox.) But it's not all bad as his father is treating him to his first ever car- unfortunately it's a seemingly junky old Volkswagon. But unbeknownst to Sam, it's just one of the Autobots- good 'transformers', lead by Optimus Prime, that have landed on earth for a showdown with the bad 'transformers'- the decepticons, lead by the evil Megatron, for a showdown that has been brewing for centuries.As soon as I saw those Citroen car adverts with the car that transforms into a dancing robot, I sat there and thought 'if they can do that for an advert, they could surely make a live action movie of the Transformers', most likely my favourite boyhood kids show. Sure, many people cynically shrugged it off as a cheap marketing gimmick to sell toys, but I loved watching the TV shows and collecting the clever toys that transformed into robots from fire engines, cars, tanks, and many other things. And now many years later it's finally here...Unfortunately it's a very flawed film with more going against it than going for it. It gets better towards the end (getting a trend for Summer blockbusters???) but for the first half we have to endure a clunky script, with banal dialogue and a flimsy story that gives hardly any explanation for who's doing what to whom. If Michael Bay's going to make a habit of making these big films that stretch well over two hours (i.e. this, Bad Boys II) then he needs to at least give the script and the plot a bit more zest and vitality than this.You have to wait a while for them, but when the Autobots do arrive on the scene, they're quite a sight to behold. Optimus Prime is very impressive, colourful and transforms marvellously. They also do Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee and another one. They surpassed themselves there, as it must have taken a lot of hard work just to bring Optimus to life so brilliantly. The Decepticons are less impressive, though. They're all very grey and all look rather samey. There's not much depth in the Autobots, either, but they're especially lifeless. I mean, Starscream was such a major part of the TV show, and it was always a big part of the story watching the power struggle between him and Megatron for leadership of the Decepticons. Here he's just an insignificant support character who stands there and lets Megatron berate him (""...you disappoint me as always Starscream!!!"") which the TV Starscream would never have took.The writers have put a lot of emphasis on humour, too. Not a bad thing, of course, but it does get in the way of the story a little sometimes. It's mostly to do with crude sexual inneuendo as well. The 12A certificate wasn't all down to the violence!It could have been worse, I suppose, but for a large part of it, this just felt like a rather soulless and careless long awaited live action version of a show I used to really love. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

From the songs the car picks to play with Sam and Mikaela, to the sector 7 agent, and Anthony Anderson. To many funny scenes to name. Humor plus action makes for great film, especially if it has a long running time. This movie used the same formula that made Spiderman so great.I liked the lead actors in this. In a action movie, you usually don't really care for them, but Shia and Megan work great in this. It's been a while since I've seen a 2 plus hour movie that didn't seem like it was way too long.

Fun Action Flick,"Transformers (2007)*** (out of 4)Bay's action blockbuster pretty much delivers everything you'd expect from this type of film. A teen (Shia LaBeouf) doesn't realize that he's actually got a connection to a couple alien races who are about to come to Earth and do battle. The good guy Autobots need the help of the teen so that they can locate a certain device that will allow them to defeat their rivals the Decepticons. I personally can't understand all the heat that Bay takes because the man isn't trying to deliver CITIZEN KANE type films but instead he wants to make popcorn movies that are loud and feature plenty of explosions and I really can't think of anyone who does it better. I've hated some of his films but on the whole I've enjoyed many and that includes this film, which is about as silly as you can get but who cares? The main reason to watch a film like this is for the action scenes and Bay certainly knows how to deliver. Right from the start we're introduced to some loud explosions and they never really let up through the 142-minute running time. The special effects are mighty impressive with the robots constantly changing form and I must say that they really looked great. The most impressive thing is that they're able to take this CGI creations and make them look real. I'm not really a fan of CGI because I feel it often times looks so fake that it takes you away from the real stuff on the screen but that never happens here as Bay knows how to mix the fake CGI with the real actors and action. One of the most impressive scenes is at the end when the robots, the Army, various government agents and of course our hero teen are all battling in the streets from the ground to the top of the sky-scrappers and this entire sequence just contains one thrill after another. The earlier action scenes are all impressive as well including one bit where LaBeouf and his love interest (Megan Fox) find themselves being chased through the streets not knowing what they've got themselves involved in. LaBeouf is always hit and miss with me but I think he served this character well as he had no problems playing the ""dork"" early on and he was also quite believable as the action hero. Fox certainly can't act but she's not here to win an Oscar. She's here to look hot and she does that just fine. The supporting cast has a lot of familiar faces including Bernie Mac, Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. I think the movie could have been better had Bay gotten rid of some of the supporting characters and I'd say the entire bit with the platoon could have been left on the editing room floor. I also think some of the rather obnoxious comedy could have been left out including the bits with the parents who are constantly embarrassing their son. Outside of those things, TRANSFORMERS is a pretty impressive action flick that knows it's an action flick and it doesn't try to be anything else. There's plenty of buildings that explode and get ripped apart and it's this type of action that fans want and Bay delivers more than enough for one film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers,"Seeing the previews I wasn't sure I would like the film beyond the effects. The effects looked amazing, and they truly were. However the film was actually a lot of fun. No wonder Michael Bay did Victoria Secret commercials, the man knows what is hot. The cars, the chick, the shots, the music, all very hot.The first half of the movie is actually really good. It's got great comedy, great acting, great music, and great mix of stories. It's paced well, shot well and contagious. The second half left a bit to be desired. The dialogue between Optimus and Sam was a bit lame and too filled with positive messages for kids, as was the dialogue between Optimus and Megatron. They could have gotten the same message across in less cheese. In addition, the fight sequences between the robots were not nearly as cool as everyone wants them to be. While the effects are good and life-like, the coverage of the fights left a lot to be desired. Not only was it hard to see the actual fight, the fighting wasn't even that cool. You know you're not alone in this when in the beginning the whole audience is cheering, and by the end you hear the odd ""whoo"" and that's it. With that said, we all clapped at the end because it really was a cool film with great characters that you want to watch.

Guess the saga isn't for me (any more),"I suppose in order to review the live action film of the 1980s cartoon/toys 'Transformers' (2007) I have to confess that I spent much of the eighties playing with the robots and generally gobbling up everything with an Autobot logo on it. If someone had released this film back then I would probably give it the highest rating possible. Sadly, I'm way too old, jaded and wrapped in the nostalgia of the Saturday morning cartoon I knew and loved.If you don't know anything about the series (and I can't believe anyone could NOT know who Optimus Prime and Megatron are, but that's just me!), it - loosely - follows various narratives made popular in cartoon, comic and then computer-generated TV series and then blends them all together. But that's okay. They get the basics right - a group of good robots (who can change their appearance into Earth-based vehicles) arrive on our planet, but are quickly drawn back into their endless war with their evil counterparts, the Decepticons.I never saw this film in the cinema and I'm glad. This is down to my unique way of watching my DVD copy. I will explain. The film is well over two hours long and, for the first hour, you basically don't actually see one of the titular robots. Instead, we're treated to a teen-love story which utilises every cliche in the genre. A nerd (Shia LaBeouf) falls for the hot chick (Megan Fox) and has to impress her despite the best efforts of the jock (who I don't know the name of). In short... I don't give a damn about any of these characters. Controversially, I watch a film called 'Transformers' to see Transformers. Therefore, viewing this film on DVD allows me to skip every scene which centres on the annoying and pointless flesh-bags.Now, you may be expecting me to start saying how by ignoring the humans and concentrating on the robots make the film better. And it does. Sort of. Again, I'm trying to watch the film through the eyes of kids today and I can see them loving the robots in the exact same way as I did with those in the cartoons. For me, who's love of the franchise comes from the eighties (we call this 'G1' i.e. 'Generation 1') I wanted to see the robots look how I remember them. The Autobot leader 'Optimus Prime' is awesome. Fortunately the producers listened to fans and employed voice actor Peter Cullen to give him his personality - and it's by far the best part of the film. Even I could tell who Optimus Prime was because he basically looked how I remembered him. Sadly, the others didn't. A couple of Decepticons were okay (Starscream), but even Megatron was completely underused (he's the film's antagonist and yet only came into the story in the final act).If I was given a free reign to make a Transformers movie, yes I'd base it on the eighties look, feel and story. Sadly, Michael Bay had other ideas and the robots are hard to tell apart (Optimus Prime and Bunblebee excluded) when they're standing still. When they fight, whatever epic battle scene that should be before us is akin to smashing two grey jagged lumps of metal together repeatedly while Megan Fox poses provocatively.Basically, kids who have no prior knowledge of the franchise will probably love this. For 'oldies' like me, I just watch it for Optimus Prime - who is by far the true star. I just wish he was in it more. I've never felt so ashamed to be human!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the better remakes.,"Being 35 years old, I spent many of hours with my eyes planted on the cartoon series. Before going to see this movie I was VERY worried that this was going to be another blown opportunity at making a movie based on one of my childhood shows, of which there are many horrible examples! I'm not easy to please.First of all, one must realize that there will ALWAYS be some discrepancies between the old shows and a new movie. Also we must remember that no one is going to make a movie unless there is a chance at making money. You just cannot judge a movie if you're determined to nitpick before you view it. A lot of the negativity is coming from people that expect perfection and go into a movie looking for reasons to be dissatisfied.People have complained about everything from the high velocity twisting when transforming to the paint jobs. I mean c'mon, get over it! It's a modern interpretation of the old show, ITS NOT THE CARTOON SERIES.Overall I thought the movie was great. It was packed with high action graphics and humor. The first battle scene was awesome! The cameras were set a bit too close on some scenes, either to put the images more in your face or to hide imperfections. The characters (robot) personalities were not entirely true to the old show but extremely close. The heroic and self sacrificing nature of autobots was left intact as well as the dark nature of the decepticons. A few of them got wasted but remember this is Transformers, anyone can come back, and the movie definitely left room for the future.I left feeling extremely pleased with the movie. To see it in this modern form was a real pleasure. I can confidently say that Hollywood managed to avoid crushing another one of my childhood joys. It is one of the best movie remakes I've seen and I'm glad they did it. I look forward to taking my kids to see it so they can share in the same story that I loved as a kid.Go see it!

"Pretty girls, not much else","This is written from the point of view of someone who was never interested in Transformers, and watched the movie because it had a high rating on IMDb.If you don't like comic books, you will hate this movie. Sure, there are pretty girls, but they are acting as if robots are humans. The acting in this movie is a huge letdown. It's as if Disney has made one single movie that combines the terrible features of all of their movies, added robots, and released it.If you enjoy comic books, Transformers type stuff, you may be interested to see how it is depicted in a film once more, but don't get too excited.If you liked The Matrix, this movie may not be for you, the robots look just like robots, yet the movie asks you to look at them as humans, and this is what bugs me. They have cheesy deep voices, and this film is full of over-used robot humor.After seeing this film, I almost feel like everyone in the movie was a robot, they all acted as if they had no emotions whatsoever, and no touch with humanity. Even the main character is so see-through that it makes the whole film feel like a joke to me.Towards the end there are so many inconsistencies that it would take a lot of alcohol not to notice them. Just an example (NOT A SPOILER): A main character states something to the effect of ""if those were our planes they wouldn't fly lower than the buildings"". 5 minutes later, their planes are flying just a couple hundred feet over the ground in a big city.It's things like this that could easily be fixed, but absolutely ruin the movie for all of us. It's almost as if the director never actually watched the movie all the way through, or didn't care enough to fix any of the problems.Sorry Transformers fans, I respect your passion, but this movie was still terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If you're ever wondering how to identify a Michael Bay movie just watch for people entering or exiting military aircraft in slow motion with way-too-dramatic music piped in.I'm pretty sure this will hold the title of worst adaptation of an 80's cartoon ever made....until John Woo's ""The Snorks"" comes out.

Hmmm...,"Loved the movie. Great visual effects, but some scenes are too close. fight scenes between transformers too close to see it, and you get lost on who is who, or who gets hit.If you want to make a statement that they are big, but zoom out to recognize a fight, at least make some cars nearby for people to compare.Also I want to put this in FAQ's but too cheap to pay for membership. *spoiler*When they have a test of the AllSpark's power with the nokia... Whouldn't the machine that gets touched with the power of the AllSpark that relays the energy to the nokia get turned into a transformer also???*end spoiler*",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers! Play dumb!,"First off I would like to say that I'm glad to see Transformers live action feature and that I'm thrilled by all the cgi and the realism it portrayed but... I kinda expected it to be more serious and with depth. Autobots turnout to be like over-sized kids who play all the time, while Desepticons were to scary (maybe that's the good point). Other thing is that there were to many characters that play important roles but haven't been developed enough and yet to many scenes that were just a cgi show offs. Megatron turned out to be twice the size of Optimus, and Bumblebee is a Camaro? O.K. I understand that Volkswagen didn't gave their permission to use Beattle, but hey, why are Autobots modeled after American cars only? Another cheap patriotism trick, or good marketing. I hope that we will see some more serious plot lines and less ""kids play"" in the sequel that will surely follow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformer fun for everyone,"As a kid, I was obsessed with the first 3 Transformers films and used to watch them once every month. Most of my childhood favorites didn't hold up upon re-watch so let's find out if the Transformers suffers the same faithStory- 4/10The story is the weakest part of this film for many reasons. Any scene besides the action sequences was just boring and not very interesting and offered nothing special. The writing fails to make the twists or the dramatic moments reasonable. In my opinion, there was no good reason for the police to arrest Sam and many scenes didn't make sense to me which proves that the writing is on the weaker side of things. However, the story does pick up from the 3rd act and becomes interesting. Still doesn't change the fact that it was predictable though,Cinematography- 8/10For the first 80 minutes. There was no particularly exciting scene which almost made me turn the TV off. It does become intense and cinematic when the Transformers show up and the 3rd act climax was pretty well done. But because the soundtrack wasn't great, it made it slightly less exciting.Characters- 6/10Our main 2 protagonists, Sam, and Mikaela were just ok. They weren't terrible but also not fun to be around and I didn't feel the connection between Sam and Bumblebee. The Transformers didn't have much screen time but they had their quirks that made them stand out. Megatron was just an ok villain. He wasn't intimidating nor was he a terrible villain.Tones/Themes- 6/10The film's central message revolves around sacrifice, and taking risks. I couldn't pick up on the central message until Optimus Prime said it himself. The tone was the same as your average 2000's action film so yeahEnjoyability- 7.5/10Without spoiling anything, I will just bluntly say that the first half is boring, and the second half is fun. Because most of the best moments happen after the Transformers are introduced. The action in the 3rd act climax was handled pretty well. But the entire film as a whole still didn't have any funny or deep momentsOverall: 6.9/10If the writing was a little better, I would have been praising the feature. It was pretty close to being a solid, great film. If you're a fan of the Transformers and haven't checked out the feature yet, then go ahead. So does it still hold up? Maybe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Apart from waiting for the chick to show up there wasn't anything deserving your attention,"That's right. The chick was gorgeous, and she (and of course the director) showed her assets quite well. Look, I am not a womanizer but when this is deliberately shown I of course cannot stop noticing it. In a nutshell this movie was written by teenagers for teenagers.Silly, nonsense talk, mom and dad trying hard to look stupid on screen,over-trusting secretary of state who gives the power to the teenagers, secret robots buried under the Hoover dam (because of the thousands of tons of concrete as explained), the over-powerful US tactical aviation able to destroy the alien robots, etc, etc.Well, probably I am grown up (30) and can't and won't see such movies.

My favorite movie of the summer and that says a lot,"What is easily the best non sequel movie of the summer. Transformers is the most action packed, fun thrill ride of a movie I have seen in many years. I saw an 11:40 pm screening of this movie at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, with a sold out crowd.This movie is better than I could have ever imagined. I have always enjoyed Bay's flair for flash and trash, this guy should have directed Miami Vice. He knows cars, and car chases better than anyone today. and this movie is no different. Action scenes so packed you have to see it again just to grasp it all. Great pacing between a national security storyline and a boy and his car, woven perfectly together.The movie is fun, over the top and funny in all the right places. Megan Fox is the resident hot chick and the entire movie plays to the inner teenager in all of us. My only regret is my 2 year old son is not old enough to view this with me.The first movie I'll be seeing a second time in the theater!best movies thus far:Transformers Die Hard 4 Knocked Up Pirates 3 Spidy 3",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Transformers didn't live up to the hype i've heard,"For the last week all I've heard is that I should ""GO SEE TRANSFORMERS!!!"" from by friends and from people on TV etc. I really didn't think that it lived up to the hype.The special effects were incredible, and that asset alone is why I gave this movie a 7.I usually don't mind unrealistic movies like aliens, robots, or superhero type films. I can accept the fact that these things can do super human type things or unrealistic type things. But when humans start doing stunts that just aren't realistic at all, I just start to lose a bit of my interest. Some of the lines and scenes just seemed completely awkward or un-needed. The script could have been a little cleaner and a few scenes could have been left out (i.e. tooth-fairy) The movie is pretty long too, or at least it seemed like it. I love going to the movies and sitting down for a long time and soaking up the excitement, but in this case I thought it might have dragged on a little too far. This really didn't have too much of an effect on my rating, but I thought I'd throw it in.I'm glad I saw this movie (more like got forced to from all the hype). The special effects are pretty sweet and the plot isn't too bad. I wouldn't pay to see it again like some other movies I've seen recently.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Trash- you probably won't believe me but this is pretty pictures and nothing else,"What can I say? Okay me me rephrase that, what can I say nice? The actors aren't bad. The CGI looks okay...in the trailer.Soulless unfunny big screen live action disaster based on the cartoon series. Michael Bay rapes the American public once again.This is awful.How bad? My dad fell asleep and I kept moaning this is awful this is awful.I think one reviewer claimed something about this being a sign of the Apocalypse. I believe him. This is proof that most people want form over content and bread and circus' over anything meaningful.The plot is something like the Decepticons trying to find a cosmic cube or spark or something so they can rule the world. The Autobots- who mostly don't show up until an hour in are also trying to find it but to protect man kind. I don't know, I don't care.Don't get me wrong this is well made trash. It looks good, even if the CGI is never fully integrated into the film. Yet again we have these cool looking effects that seem unconnected with the people. Why are effects getting worse and worse? 200 million dollars and you can tell that the transformers are not with the people.The problems mostly lie in the script. First off the movie is wildly silly, even the parts that are not suppose to be ""funny"". What can I say its so over the top as to be laughable. The comedy is dumb in a TV sitcom sort of way.Then again this is coming from a TV cartoon so it makes perfect sense. Worse a good many of the actors mug and play their roles for laughs for much of the early parts of the film so that when it comes time to be serious you don't believe them. There is no tension because you don't believe there is any real danger...or anything that is connected to reality. I never once believed this was real-or possible. No one acted nor did the plot spin out in anything other than the sort of reality found on second rate TV shows or movies.I think the choices to play to the fans and keep things close to the TV show-using some of the voices hurt the believability of much of the film. Sure the scorpion thing looks cool and a few others seem plausible, but Optimus Prime just looks really stupid when placed in the real world.and yet its well made. On some technical level this is a ""good"" movie. Not good enough to recommend it...but good on some scale of proficiency.I'm at a loss for words-really.What a waste this is. Its just an incredibly stupid movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Humanity not Lost in Transformers,"As a non-Transformer fan...a non-viewer of the cartoons, a non-reader of the comics, and a non-collector of the toys...I wasn't planning to see the movie until recently. The stylish trailer shots of giant robots in battle got me interested. I also had an inkling that Michael Bay would give this one his all, because after The Island he would know his career couldn't afford another flop. And after seeing Pirates 3 and Spidey 3 not live up to expectations, I figured the law of averages was in favor of Transformers being the best sci-fi action epic of the year.I was not disappointed. In fact I was pleasantly surprised at how successful the movie was with its human characters and how much humor it found at all levels of its story. It is so, so difficult for a sci-fi film like this to pull off real genuine, gut-busting humor without descending into camp or disrespect. Part of that is because the filmmakers have to be really brave to try for laughs when they're already afraid the audience will laugh at unconvincing effects or unbelievable story lines. This movie goes on a short list with Superman, Ghostbusters, and Men in Black as one of the funniest sci-fi action films ever made. Shia LaBeouf in both comedic and dramatic scenes was a wonderful asset here. My faith in Spielberg having made the right choice casting him in Indy 4 was given real credence here.If the movie had one major weakness it was that the villains don't get the development the humans and heroes do. Aside from Scorponok's awesome desert battle and perhaps a bit too much of the little Gremlin-bot's antics we don't get to see the villains display much personality. I think Megatron had less screen time than the Gremlin-bot. That weakens the drama of the final battle because it seems like the Autobots are just fighting mindless machines, ones that we don't quite understand the full capabilities and motivations of. I think we needed more scenes of the Decepticons planning and plotting together to parallel the scenes of the Autobots meeting and introducing each other. And we needed at least one scene where Megatron demonstrates a seriously bad-ass show of force BEFORE he starts fighting the good guys, a la Magneto's bridge attack in X3 or just about everything General Zod does in Superman 2 before the Metropolis battle. Speaking of missed opportunities, I'm not sure why you take us to a major national landmark in a movie like this unless you intend to blow it up.Other than the whole enterprise sort of unraveling in a final battle that is more dramatically and visually choppy than anything that came before it, this movie was full of pure entertainment. I loved the Herbie-esquire chemistry between Bumblebee and the kids. I had fun with the Christine-esquire suspense when the cars began showing their threatening side and all of the zippy car chases that followed. I enjoyed Optimus Prime's heroic Jor-el-esquire speeches about the good in humanity. I thought Voight as the Rumsfeld character and Turturro as the shadow government guy added solid acting presence and weight to the movie. I liked the human comedy of Shia's romantic and family problems, the geeky in-joke computer references, and the giant robot-slapstick comedy, which I still think was perhaps the movie's most impressive and unlikely achievement. And I thought the transformation effects had all the necessary cool factor. One bad moment, I didn't like the explanation for the origin of earth's technology. That was unnecessary plot overkill and too Terminator-esquire. And Bernie Mac's cameo only served to illustrate how much better the movie's subtler and more unexpected attempts at comedy were.I think this movie will deservedly earn its place as the #1 box-office smash of the year, besting Spider-Man 3's $335 million gross. It may also have earned a special place in cinema history for crediting both a ""Product Placement Coordinator"" and a ""Military Adviser,"" in that order. Now I look forward to a sequel where I hope the robots, especially the villains, earn more screen time, dialogue, and character development. I think we're ready for that now that we humans have made a successful transition into the robot world by virtue of this introductory movie. For now, I'll be eyeing up those Transformers movie toys a lot closer while contemplating the potential of a post-Christmas clearance sale...and I'll keep watching the skis, uh, skies, uh, highways....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fun for the action film crowd, may be disappointing for the bot fans","I had some interest in hearing that there was going to be a live Transformers film and I wanted to sit down and watch it. I heard Peter Cullen would return as Optimus Prime but after watching the film I felt that was the only redeeming factor. That and the special effects. What went wrong? Michael Bay put in a bunch of corny jokes and went overboard on the special effects. There was little story and I'm not sure the sequels were needed. But this was decent for last decade and while it changed a lot it had its moments. If you're a TF fan and liked the original cartoon, stick with that. If you like Michael Bay, try it. If you want something true to the original, steer clear. A lot has changed in the past decades.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots,"Transformers (2007) ***Perhaps its the kid in me. Perhaps its the kid I was; back when I adored the Transformers cartoons and toys. Whatever it is, its not because Michael Bay knows how to craft beautiful art. It might be though because Michael Bay finally kicked the paint can with enough force and accuracy that when it hit the canvas it made some pretty neat patterns.Yes, Transformers has faults and plot holes that an Autobot could fall through. Yes its over stuffed and overblown. Yes its far too long and filled with more product placements than you see during the super bowl. Yes 90% of the dialogue is cheesy and no Michael Bay still cannot direct humans to save his own life. But I'll admit, when I was enjoying Transformers, I enjoyed the hell out of it.Michael Bay, who has arguably directed some of the most awful movies in the world (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and my choice for the worst (Bad Boys II), has finally done something right. Its too bad that he realized it at some point and kept running a few miles past the finish line with it. The movie starts out with some traditionally cheesy moments and gung ho join the army because we're awesome junk. No big surprise, Bay stuffs in the greatness of the US Army wherever he can. However he does poke some fun at Bush and the US Government's lies. Too bad its regarding Aliens and nothing actually significant. But even the staunch member of the opposition that I am, I was able to ignore it most of the time. When there is humans on screen, when they work its because of one reason only, Shia LaBeouf (Well John Turturro has his moments). He is showing himself to be a great actor, even in the middle of otherwise mediocrity.The movie works because of the Transformers and LaBeouf, and the completely over the top and silly action sequences of which there are many. The CGI is great, but Bay who seemingly realized this flaunts it to the point of exhaustion and tedium. And because of that, Transformers just about overstays its welcome. So much time is put into the final fight, that it feels like they were unsure where to go from there and how to actually end the fight itself, which seems to come quickly considering how long the fight lasts.But for all its faults, Transformers is far and away Bay's best movie. Though if there is a sequel i would much rather see someone else direct. If you go into this with low expectations and in the mood to see popcorn movies at there most buttery, then I think you'll feel you didn't waste your money... well that kid inside you will feel that way.3/4",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
more than meets the eye,"Again a great movie I missed till it came to DVD. Sigh. Tranformers, re-imagined by director Michael Bay, is loud, funny and fast. Its a perfect popcorn movie and a real feast for the eyes. And no, I don't just mean Megan Fox. The effects in the movie are some of the best I've ever seen, truly good and utterly convincing. Of course the characters reactions aren't always so real, but hey its a summer movie.For anyone unfamiliar with the toys from Hasbro or the ludicrously popular cartoon from the 80's, this is probably confusing. Hence Optimus Prime delivers the prologue himself. Very cool, even cooler its still Peter Cullen doing the voice. Kudos to the film's makers for that. I did miss Starscream and Megatron but I think those performers might be dead. Hugo Weaving did a nice job as Megatron.Shia Lebouef, awful name but nice kid, does well as Sam, he really carries the film at times. Megan Fox is the love interest here and I take umbrage with any complaints about her acting, you try acting in a piece like this! She was smoking hot and very convincing to me. So there. To those who said there was no plot or development, did you actually watch this movie? C'mon, Mikhala is pretty shallow till she meets Sam and she proves her mettle by hanging with him in this crazy situation. Remember the line, ""get in the car""? She did, remember that.Optimus looks great and the Bumblebee Camaro is awesome. I love the in-jokes, especially the one about ""Armageddon"" this movie had me laughing and cheering, just like a popcorn movie should! My only complaint was I thought the final battle was slightly off, not bad, just should have been bigger, less stupid extras and more demolition. Other than that it was great. Oh, one other complaint, other than the great old songs used by Bumblebee in the beginning of the film, lousy music score, oh well. Still a great flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I'd Rather Pay To See Spider - Man Three Again..And That Is Saying Something!,"This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Comparable only too the Thin Red Line -- and Wind Talkers. The script/plot is non-existent, and the way Shia LaBeouf acts on screen is a cookie cut of his time as Louis Stevens. Aside from a few visually entertaining moments the movie was a complete waste of time. A lot of the transitions in setting leave you wondering ""why are they here?"" ""Who is that girl, and why is she British working in the NSA?"" ""Why are the Autobots on Mars at one point?"" I could gripe about this movie for a few paragraphs ,but I am more or less witting this in hopes of deterring one person from wasting their money in as few words as possible. If you fit in the category of middle America that enjoys seeing barrels and building explode; I highly recommend this film to you!

An incredible visual display but it could have been much better,"Growing up on the ""Transformers"" I knew I would see this movie and I pretty much got what I thought I would get. The thing about a movie directed by Michael Bay is you know what your going to get just like you know what your going to get when you see a movie directed by Martin Scorsese or Tarantino. First off, even though I am not a huge fan of big Summer blockbusters and movies loaded with CGI, I must admit that this movie has some of the most awe inspiring action sequences I have ever seen on film. I must hand it to Michael Bay for being a master of the visual but god is his storytelling really bad. I just could care less if the characters in all of his movies died. The writing is so corny with all the usual lame one liners and cameos by the usual suspects like Bernie Mac. Even with all the flaws I looked the other way because the robots looked so great. My main problem with the film was that they could have made it so much more authentic to the cartoon. Basically taking the best elements of each. For example, in the original show the transformers get most of the dialogue. In the movie the Decepticons barely talk to each other at all. What the hell is that ? Starscream and Megatron don't even resemble the original characters at all but I must admit Optimus Prime is very cool except for him having lips. They even got the original voice which was a nice touch. I am actually hoping for a sequel because I am hoping they will fix some of the problems that kept this from being one of my favorite action movies ever. To capture the true flavor of the original the movie must be a little darker at least for me. It's about a civil war for god sakes ! Of course I know that Hollywood will always compromise quality for money. I know they have to sell toys and market to kids and adults. Overall, I got what I expected and the action scenes made up for the lame dialogue and story. I finally found a Michael Bay movie that I can watch. It's a miracle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Poorly imagined Sci-fi,"If you keep brain this movie is not worth watching. I am a big fan of movies like Terminator 2, and Matrix series and Star Wars. But this one is meaningless crap. Just a lot of visual and computer graphics added meticulously. But this movie is meant for only children below the age of 10. The beginning is awful that there was a cube which contained all the powers of the universe. And bad robots escaping from the far galaxy. And how hundreds of years ago the code was entered into the mountaineers grandfather specs. These are all very childish these stories are not going to impress any one any more, as there was time for Spider man and Superman.

My Review of The First Transformers,"The Transformers is good visually, but when it comes to the story, it seems a little iffy. At times, I just can't follow along with the story. At times it seems like it's hard to know what's happening or what's supposed to happen. I feel like there is somewhat of a story but not entirely. The story seems more midtier and the movie seems better when it comes to visuals. They did a good job at portraying the transformers in live action. With the Transformers being able to transform between a vehicle and a humanoid creature, it seems it would be weird if it's adapted into live action. I find they did a good job at adapting into live action without looking too weird.Back to the plot related details, I feel it does a not so good job at developing characters. It doesn't seem to really develop the characters much. At times it seems characters are there to just be there.Overall, I find it alright visually and needs to be developed more in the story department.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Waiting 20+ years For This Movie..,"I went to see Transformers today.. a little fearful. I had been hearing bad things from critics about the movie. Keep in mind.. Transformers were my bread and butter when I was a kid. Ever since they first came on the scene in the early 80's, I've followed them through their various incarnations. And some of them were just gawdawful. And now it's 2007, 20+ years since the very first series. I loved it. ~There is action from the very first, when Blackout lands in the military base, and you know something bad is coming. And he dishes it out. ~I was afraid that the way Bumblebee communicated would be cheesy.. but it was actually very cute. I liked it. ~You could feel Megatron's contempt for the humans, even uttering 'fleshling' once. Love it. ~The little comedic opportunities by the Autobots weren't awkward either, most were genuinely funny. The different personalities of each Autobot stood out. ~Megan Fox is so hot. ~I didn't like the fact there was one death.. I'll say no more to prevent spoilers. ~Shia was REALLY great in this. He was the quintessential awkward kid who wants to try and get the attention of the local hot babe. In this he's such a great performer, very convincing. And the way he and Bumblebee bonded during the movie was really very touching. When Bumblebee was being captured by Sector 7, very cool. ~Megan Fox is so hot. ~I really need to make comment on Optimus Prime. A lot of people complained about his overall looks (ZOMG WHY DOES HE HAVE The FLAMEZ?!). I happen to like the way he looks, the way they all look now in this redesign. But more than that.. 20 years later, Optimus Prime is STILL the man. He just is. He is the true heroic archetype to me. When Ironhide asks why they need to protect humans (he doesn't see them as worth it at first), Prime speaks with a real wisdom. Over and over he demonstrates just why he's the leader.If you're a fan at all of the Transformers, in any of it's incarnations, I really recommend this movie. Literally everyone I've spoken to who has seen it (9 people and counting) said they love it, and most have seen it at least twice. If you're a fan of big (in scale and cost) movies, then this could be very pleasing for you. It's an unconventional alien invasion movie. Think Independence Day (the non-suckass parts), mixed with some great car chases, the scale of Jurassic Park, and add a little dash of E.T., and you have a summer blockbuster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Transformers Director's Cut,I thought the film was great action flick it was something I have been waiting for all summer.It gave a good setup for Autobot city to be built in the next movie and for Megatron to return and build his underwater base. It also opens up possibilities of the dinobots being built in the next film along with devastator.The movie had a good running time of 2 hours and 24 minutes but I keep wondering if their is a lot more that was cut from this film that would of really flush out character and story development.Does anyone know how long the original cut of this film ran and what was cut out?,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Can't Quite Transform Into A Solid Movie,"7 July 2007. Overall, this movie is a bit of puzzle, and the lack of clear consistent directing is evident from what appears to be a script that seems to have been written by several different writers with different ideas as to what this movie should have been about. While most of the production values and cinematic photographic and sound effects are powerful and compelling, they can't make up for the apparent collapse of the movie midway in where what appeared to a be a fairly serious Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" (instead of living beings turning into monsters we have here things turning into monsters - almost as scary), the movie transforms partway into a more dumbed down version of juvenile lightness and then back to seriousness. There are the obvious emotional buttons pushed where a little girl is faced with a big bad monster, we have a little monster that is both cute and wicked like a ""Gremlin."" There are several logical gaps and unbelievable lapses in reasonable belief that distract from the movie. In total, this movie could have been a lot better, one of the best of the year (quite notable for this genre), but instead we are held to a collage of different subplots and sometimes add up to confusion and a dizzying array of special effects that take away from the solid underlying theme of the movie.

This film is a true gem that is sometimes neglected owing to its numerous sequels.,"Unlike the following several, this one has legendary humor. Along with the 1986 film, this is an outstanding masterpiece. Unlike some of the subsequent films, this one features some well-written human characters that are both interesting and entertaining. The photography is superb and the film appears to be really stylish. The narrative revolves on a teenage boy and his car works surprisingly well and feels like many of the more classic Steven Spielberg films such as Jurassic Park or E. T. The dialogue is really good and Glen is very relatable. I think that the way they portray the Decepticons in this movie as absolute hulking unstoppable beasts that you need to work together to defeat was really cool. The designs for the transformers are menacing and aesthetically pleasing. All in all there's a lot more than meets the eye to this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Air Forece motivator,"This movie was very interesting to watch. It prompts you that Air Force is a great career if you so choose to join it.

You realize that the power of technology made by the human race can also be used by the outside worlds and the cube as such. President Hoover had constructed a dam to hide Megatron and the cube which was classified above top secret and to come up with such an idea, shows us the idealistic thinking of a human mind. I am talking about the author of Transformers. 'Transformers' a comic book, and transformed into a high graphic movie shows us the vast scope of animation in the present world. So now we are talking about two careers. This movie can motivate to either join the armed forces or to become an animator which are so darn cool. Coming to the actors. Although Megan Fox looks stunning because of her artificial face, her acting doesn't seem to meet the movie's expectations. On the other hand, the other roles are just brilliant. Octupus Prime teaches you leadership and humility. I usually watch movies above 8 rating on IMDb but this movie was an exception because of the fact that its COOL.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the most incredible summer movie EVER,"I first saw the title listed under Shia LaBeouf's name on this site about a year ago. All I knew about the Transformers was that they had thoroughly awesome team symbols and they turned into vehicles and that I was very inept at switching back and forth between the vehicle and the robot in the toys (I broke them and I still do.). That was about it. I only knew those because my brother got one or two about every Christmas. So I saw this movie under Shia Labeouf's movie listings in ""Pre-Production"", and thought ""Oh man...I sense a bad one. It's probably gonna be animated."" Then I forgot all about it.A few months later, sitting in a movie theater (I think it was POTC 3...I can't remember, the preview was better than the movie if I forgot about it already.). Anyhoo, I think it was the scene with Scorponok and seeing Optimus that really sold me with ""OK...this looks cool!"" It also looked like there would be plenty of car chases & explosions, and there didn't look like there would be much kissing (which I was INSANELY happy about...I HATE long kiss scenes & sappy stuff...I admit I'm a girl, but action has more in it for me.)I took my 7-year-old cousin to see it with me, and I never sit up front or in the median between the front and back sections (far-sighted) but i made an exception cuz this movie was so damn awesome. It was the MOST INCREDIBLE MOVIE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!! Scorponok is THE EXTREME BADASS ROBOT!!!My siblings watched the Kid's Choice Awards on Nickelodeon last night, and I believe that the children and/or teens of America are idiots. Transformers lost to Alvin & the Chipmunks...HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!?!I'd give this movie WAAAAAY more than a 10, more like a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 because this was perfectly cast, incredibly acted, and the SFX were INCREDIBLE! Go see this movie!!! NOW!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The humor is essential for us to embark on such a fanciful story and the end result could not be better, having been one of the best adventures of last years","Known for directing some of the greatest classics such as The Bad Boys (1995), A Rocha (1996), Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001) and A Ilha (2005), Michael Bay started here the franchise from which he would sediment once and for all name as one of the great directors of action cinema bringing the fictional alien robots from a popular Hasbro franchise, capable of transforming their bodies into innocuous objects like vehicles, to the cinema screens and still counting on the production of Dreamworks by Steven Spielberg. Director Michael Bay, in charge of the direction, was another who did not believe in the potential of the project, but was convinced by Spielberg's vision. This is not a robot film, it is a film of a young man and his first car - inadvertently involved in the middle of a space invasion.For years the Autobots and the Decepticons, two robotic alien races, fought in Cybertron, their home planet. This war caused the planet to be destroyed, resulting in the robots spreading throughout the universe. Megatron (Hugo Weaving), the leader of the Decepticons, comes to Earth in search of Allspark, a Cybertron cube that allows any electronic device to be transformed into a robot with its own intelligence. Megatron finds Allspark, but is frozen in the Arctic. Decades later, other Decepticons arrive on Earth, in an attempt to find Allspark. Its emergence soon alerts the main countries, in particular the United States, which has an attacked military base in Qatar. While Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) tries to find out what's going on, gathering all possible strength and information, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has simpler concerns: getting a good grade in school, which will guarantee him Your first car. But what he did not expect was that the chosen vehicle, an old Camaro, had a life of its own.But anyone who thinks ""Transformers"" is just nonstop action is wrong. The great merit in the script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman is to perfectly blend the comedy in the midst of the action and a main cast that is the soul of the film. It is not easy to act in front of a green screen that will be replaced later by robots ten meters high in practically all the action scenes of the film, but the cast does very well, especially Shia LaBeouf, who plays the main character, Sam Witwicky . The actor ""reacts"" to nothing like nobody before him. The young man screams, feels fear, feels sympathy, runs and interacts with the absent robots with total surrender. Were it not for him, the film would lose half its strength. Not only in the scenes with the robots, but also when interacting with his parents, with Mikaela and even with the military, the actor is the great highlight of the production in his lines and reactions of enormous naturalness.Despite some cinematographic habits worthy of a wedding photo album - can anyone take one more backlit kiss, sunset in the background, in life? - Bay hates blue screens so fashionable in Hollywood. And he hates studio settings even more. His business is to go out on the street with his team, blow up real things - and this predilection for realistic pyrotechnics is a decisive element in the success of ""Transformers"". The beating and chase scenes are extremely exciting, with the right camera in hand - war movie style - and interspersed with absolutely hilarious moments.The comic part is present at all times. The action and comedic moments go hand in hand and support the entire script. The scene of the robots hiding in the garden, while Sam's parents discuss what he was doing locked in the room, is pure Spielberg. And the scene only improves with the knowledge that all the dialogues there were improvised by the trio of actors. We also have the hilarious Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents in several scenes, which in addition to the already commented scene in the bedroom, we have the garden scene in the house, the car purchase scene and even in a post-credit scene with double. To top it off, we still have Bernie Mac, as car salesman Bobby Bolivia and Anthony Anderson, as a super-hacker, putting on a show - the impression (probably correct) is that all the scenes in which he appears are improvised. There is even a hilarious reference to ""Armageddon"" - also directed by Bay - when the Autobots start arriving on Earth.
Another source of laughter is the United States government itself, something very curious, considering that the production had immense support from the country's Armed Forces. George W. Bush and his administration have once again become a joke on more than one occasion - and even lead to acid criticism when the United States mobilizes against North Korea and China before even knowing whether the attack came from them or otherwise. source. But the military should not be too concerned, after all, soldiers receive that glamor that only Michael Bay can give - slow motion cameras, silhouettes carrying weapons in the distance, emotional acts of courage, etc. Everything that works undeniably like military propaganda. Among the most hilarious are those in which the military is being attacked by a Decepticon in the middle of the desert in a real war climate while Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) try to contact the Pentagon and are delayed by bureaucracy by, apparently Indian, in a call center unrelated to the emergency situation that happened on the other end of the line. Even Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) takes part in some comedy scenes amid suspicions of an attack by some other American enemy and John Turturro (Agent Simmons), responsible for the government's top secret Sector 7, surprising other good guys moments.But who cares about the military, when we have Optimus Prime and Megatron pulling the screws on the big screen? The robots are absolutely sensational, winning thousands of moving parts at the hands of George Lucas' ILM team. As a result, some fans wrinkled their noses, complaining that they look little like their lively counterparts. Nonsense. The result borders on the shocking, with robots changing shape in mid-flight to attack opponents, or even semi-transformed, razing a motorway in mind-boggling pursuits. The level of realism of the robots is practically perfect. We can feel the weight and size of their ""bodies"" when they walk or when they are in combat helped by the fantastic editing and mixing of sounds indicated to Oscar for the work. As if it were not enough to feel the clash of robots as if we were in the middle of battle, the metallic and electronic sounds in communion with the actions of the robots are magnificent.In addition to all this, we have the electrifying soundtrack of Steve Jablonsky (The Island, The Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning) that knows how to increase, decrease, leaving only the sounds of the fighting machines, becoming more urgent or epic depending on the situation. The musical soundtrack including ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park, ""Before It's Too Late"" by Goo Goo Dolls, ""Doomsday Clock"" by Smashing Pumpkins among others make up the vibrant soundtrack, especially when they were the medium of communication of Bumblebee with humans.While credible characters are hard to come by in ""Transformers"", the effects are staggering and the action is thrilling. And for fans, the writers have reserved numerous surprises, such as classic phrases and hidden clues. Overall, Michael Bay never seems to have had as much fun this time. Unlike other projects where humor is present on a much smaller scale, here the element is essential for us to embark on such a fanciful story and the end result could not be better, having been one of the best adventures of its launch year. Of course, the ending is open, setting the stage for future continuations of one of the most profitable and fun franchises in recent years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too many rose-tinted spectacles here,"When I heard that a live action adaptation of Transformers was being made I was beside myself. And as the release date drew nearer i couldn't wait. I was much the same about Alien v Predator, and likewise I knew that both films were likely to be utter pap but at the same time, lots of fun. I mean let's be honest, Transformers was never going to be the Citizen Kane of the 2007 summer blockbusters but it failed in so many ways I left the cinema feeling disappointed.Bad points:* Bad characters - what was the point of the Australian 'analyst' and her hacker friend? She was clearly just some eye-candy and he was ham-fisted unfunny comic relief. * Bad editing - too many pointless set pieces. What was the point of the interrogation of the Aussie woman and the hacker? None except for a unfunny comedic set piece. * The best comic book adaptation ones have been the ones which focused on the darker side to the main characters (ie Batman Begins, Spiderman). Obviously with the Autobots (esp Optimus) being such goody two-shoes this wasn't going to be an option. However making so many of the characters out to be comic side-shows took away so much of the gravitas that the characters had from the comics. Megatron was a bad dude not as much because he looked bad, but because he was utterly ruthless, not just with his victims but with his own followers. and we didn't really get a sense of this in the film. * Little dramatic weight - the sequence where Bumblebee is captured drew no empathy from the audience as we simply hadn't got to care about the character that much at that point. * John Turturo - why was such a great actor given such a pansy ass role? * Action sequences - too confusing. When there were hand-to-hand combat fights it was hard to tell who was who, is that a Decepticon or an Autobot? Too hard to tell! * Bumblebee was a VW Beetle!!!Good points:* errmmm... the CGI was impressiveSeriously that is the best i can really say about it. The most I can give Transformers realistically is 6/10, and it pains me to do so.

It does not try to advance as sci-fi movie, it is more spectacle of high technological graphics.Maybe you won't find it as epical as LoTR, but there was nothing more technological before!About Michael Bay: Blockbusters are his forte, he deserves it ;)The film won't disappoint anyone who values drive and action in movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty fun ride,"The pace of this movie is ambitious. So much happens. Sometimes it sounds a little simple, even a little lame in a few spots, but never for very long. The jokes range from decent to pretty damn funny. Shia is great, even Megan is doing a solid job. John My Neighbor Totoro is hilarious as hell. And the action is only mildly annoying when it goes too far, which is more than I can say for the 30 sequel movies we got after this. Often the action is pretty cool and creative. Especially in the scenes where the Autobots, who have sworn not to harm humans, must find ways to either incapacitate or hide from government agents in pursuit of them. Bay's obsession with the military seems appropriate enough for the subject matter, I suppose. I mean, it's Transformers. It's not THAT great, duh.

By all means a really great film.....,"Firstly, I'm no Transformers fan. I have absolutely no idea what the Transformers universe was based on or what the cartoons were about. I cannot, therefore, relate this movie to the cartoons.I have, however, heard of Transformers when I was a kid from commercials and watching some cartoons here and there. When I heard about the coming of this film, I honestly thought it would be sort of corny.......BOY was I WRONG! This film brought back the sensation of ""Damn those humans have nnnoooo idea what they're dealing with!!"" just as it was brought in with the ""Aliens"" movie. The CGI was astoundingly realistic. I don't think I've ever seen graphics so convincing since ""The Matrix"". The transformations the Transformers undertook was incredible. They seamlessly transform from vehicles to their full forms. And during combat, these transformations brought the bullet-time moments as was in ""The Matrix"". For those familiar with ""Armageddon"", they'll feel the same feelings when watching this film.....The only thing I really didn't like with this film is that the BIG brawl between the Autobots and the Decepticons took place in a city.....which gives a really uncomfortable claustrophobic feel considering these Transformers are large and need some room. Had the setting been more larger, I'm sure the audience would've appreciated the fights more. However, this downside is replaced with lots of damage and explosions that appeal to the eye.Other than that, ""Transformers"" is a terrific film. Its the kind of film that I could watch more than once.

I am sure it will appeal as well to teenagers. i was waiting for the Auto-bots to unite and form a big robot! but didn't happen!!! great special effects...but thats is worthless if the story is crap. my brain was sleep for the whole thing!

Excellent Movie,"I must say that I was totally surprised at how amazing this movie was. I am an old Transformers fan from my childhood and I kind of knew I was going to love it unless it really blew. However, I went with five other people who had varying degrees of Transformers knowledge (my buddy's girlfriend never heard of them) and all of us thought it was an excellent movie. It seemed like there was just enough romance, comedy and drama to satisfy all moviegoers. But the actions sequences were really the amazing stuff. I would highly recommend seeing this movie. Also, as an old school fan, I was not mad at how they portrayed the transformers or other characters, nor did I nitpick about plots not synching up.

Transformers: Michael Bay Brings the Boom and the Bolts,"Forget Roswell and little green men-here, aliens turn into Camaros and Peterbilt trucks. Michael Bay crashes onto the scene with Transformers, and it's an all-out sensory assault, like Fast & Furious fused with Star Wars. Autobots and Decepticons battle it out on Earth in a galactic brawl, and honestly, watching Optimus Prime take down a Decepticon is better than any Fourth of July fireworks display.Shia LaBeouf is the everyman teen caught in the chaos, somehow managing to date Megan Fox while screaming his way through robot battles. He's relatable, funny, and surprisingly endearing for someone just trying to cruise around in his beat-up car. Meanwhile, Megan Fox-let's be real-is there to remind us that Michael Bay has his priorities straight: explosions, mechanics, and, yes, aesthetics.Michael Bay is like a 12-year-old with an unlimited budget. Explosions? Check. Car chases? Check. An opening sequence that pins you to your seat? Double check. The guy knows how to deliver high-octane spectacle, and while he sometimes overdoes it, you can't deny his knack for pacing and bombast. It's big, loud, and unapologetically thrilling.The robot battles are the crown jewel. These aren't just machines throwing punches-they're leveling skyscrapers and turning city streets into war zones. Bumblebee's fights are more intense than any boxing match, and Optimus Prime? The dude oozes charisma, with speeches that could inspire a legion.Let's not kid ourselves-the plot is as thin as a sticky note: good guys, bad guys, a relic to protect, and an explosive finale. But does it matter? Not at all. You're here for the spectacle, and Transformers delivers in spades.Transformers is the cinematic equivalent of high-octane fuel and forged steel. Michael Bay knows how to overload your senses, and while the clichés are plentiful, you can't help but enjoy the ride. It's loud, it's brash, and it's ridiculously fun-a film that barrels ahead like a semi-truck at full throttle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An abomination.,"Who'da thunk? Michael Bay has created a film that bores, insults your intelligence, hurts your eardrums and gives you a headache... and all it asks for in return is three hours of your time! I'd be less angry if it was a simple Point A to Point B action movie, because it obviously never tries to be anything more than mindless high budget crap for the lowest common denominator. But it's not a simple Point A to Point B action movie, rather a schizophrenic mess whose main plot is only revealed after two hours of hilarious I'm-an-awkward-teen comedy and introductions of 1-dimensional side characters with annoying accents.You gotta respect that Bay fellow. He's managed to build a lucrative, long-lasting career in the movie biz despite having no directing talent whatsoever. People say his films are just for fun, yet I've never seen a movie of his which didn't give me epileptic seizures, make my blood boil and bore me with a 2 hour plus running time. I simply can't enjoy this man's creations no matter how I approach them.Don't let the title fool you; this has nothing to do with cool robots. In fact this film has nothing to do with anything. It's just another meaningless collection of stylized shots of sunsets, gunfire and tumbling cars set to swelling patriotic music for Bay to masturbate over. I feel bad for John Turturro, who's probably still trying to cleanse his body from the filth of this script.""Transformers"" is not intended for intelligent life from any planet.

Exactly what you'd expect a big screen version of Transformers to be.,"I have great news: even Michael Bay couldn't run a movie about giant robots fighting each other. Though he did give it his best effort in Transformers 2.Transformers is a fun blend of action and humor. The action never fails to impress. Some of the most beloved Transformers were lovingly created on-screen for this movie, and it's just fun to see them changing forms and actually doing the cool stuff that countless boys all over the world once had them doing in their imaginations. The explosions, special effects, and computer-generated robots are all a joy to behold.The humor only occasionally strays into territory that's too childish for even the kids that are a large part of the targeted audience. Most of the time, there are genuine laughs to be had to break up the long action set pieces. Shia Lebouf is a funny and likable protagonist, and pairing him with Megan Fox resulted in a pair of reasonably good central characters. This movie isn't really about the human characters, anyway. It's about the robots. And if you're a fan of Transformers, action, CGI wizardry, or all three, you're probably going to be as pleased with this as I was.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Haven't seen a better Transformers movie yet, but not happy about the TF-side story.","If you're a general fan of PG-13 sci-fi thrillers, this movie is very entertaining thanks to its visuals and non-stop action. Another positive side of this movie is the humor abundance.If you're a fan of the animated series (G1/G2) though, you'll notice some alterations compared to the original concepts. They might be awkward and unpleasant to the classic series fans like me. Here are some of the movie's details I couldn't agree with.First, there is the all spark cube that gives life to technology. I'm OK with the life giving part, but to technology? Any kind? That's ridiculous. Next, the cube was lost in the universe, and it had to fall down EXACTLY on Earth, as if there could be no other planets out there in the whole universe. Megatron rushed to find it but crash landed in the polar region of Earth. (Ummm, no spacecraft for Megatron was available at that time? Hello, it's Cybertron technology; they're supposedly advanced.) And he froze in the ice, of course, like a human without a fur coat. Then an attack on the army is stricken by a military chopper shaped decepticon, who happens to be piloted by a holographic image of a man with a mustache. I think the same holo-pilot with a mustache sits in the police car decepticon later on. Why was such holographic imagery ultimately needed? Especially, with a mustache. For protection against humans? Autobots soon arrive on Earth, again just like Megatron, without an apparent spacecraft, but as if meteorites instead. Their method of acquiring an ""alternate shape mode"" is rather magical than scientifically possible by any complex and rationally explainable theory. By scanning a nearby vehicle, their new shape is instantly changed. It's weird, but in cartoons, Megatron had to manually reshape his sports car team in order to turn them into transformable robots. The same goes with Alpha Trion fixing Orion Pax and Ariel, and not waving some magical Harry Potter stick over them to heal them. But here, in the movie, it's done so effortlessly. I never thought that Megatron would accept to be nearly indistinguishable from his ""buddy"" Starscream, but he was decided to be another jet instead of his ultimate weapon shape. And finally, back to the all spark. Its ability to give life to any kind of technology is probably the most idiotic idea a writer could come up with for this movie. The cube first turned a mobile phone into a psychotic weeny bot with on-board micro weaponry, then later it accidentally sparked a phone booth into another transformer with a readily loaded arsenal. It might as well transform a microwave oven into a robot that pops corn, or worse - a toilet seat that shoots you know what.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Cartoon on the big screen,"Firstly, I'd like to tell u that I'm Russian so it's difficult to me to write my thoughts in English, but I'll try. When I saw the poster of ""Transformers"" I thought:""Wow! The most favourite cartoon of my childhood is on the big screen! Nostalgia!"" I must tell u that this American cartoon couldn't been shown in USSR in 80s, so firstly it was showed in 1994, when I was 4. So this interesting colorful cartoon became very popular in Russia and I was its fun too, as many Russian children. I had every series of the cartoon, I had some toy transformers and posters of them. But I didn't know then that this cartoon would ""transform"" into full-fledged movie. Now my dream is reality. Michael Bay is very talented director so I expected something very big. Unfortunately it hasn't followed my through. Good things in the movie are firstly sound effects and video effects. They are perfect, I can't say more. The humor. I laughed during this film more than during many good comedies. Crazy small Nokia-robot is simply super. The humor makes more attractive fights and battles. Another good thing is actors especially Megan Fox. This girl is very beautiful, even only this force u to watch this movie again and again. Shia is, in my humble opinion, too simple and weak for the main role. These are all good things. But there are many bad things. For example, the script. Two crazy groups of aliens firstly are searching for the old glasses then for the strange cube. What a blather for high-quality film. It's funny but not interesting! And nearly during the half of the movie many pieces of metal are fighting and fighting and Great American Army cannot do anything! Robots have made well but they haven't their own tempers like it was in the cartoon. They are like godzillas or stupid king-kongs but not the living race. Also the movie advertise too much for example Nokia or GMC. So, my opinion is that is not a bad film, Michael Bay cannot do bad films, but I wanted more and I think old cartoon is better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Simply incredible,"I loved G1 when it was on the air, and had all the toys. I was afraid that Michael Bay would screw this up, but (aside from a shaky camera) it was incredible. Granted I spent more time focusing on Optimus Prime and the other Autobots and Decepticons than the humans, but that's the whole point of the movie, right? It's Transformers, not fleshy bags of mostly water.The theater cheered when Prime appeared, and for the other Autobots as well. Megatron was menacing. Barricade was an awesome character, and played well off of Bumblebee. It's not Schindler's List, but it was never meant to be. Go to this movie with the intent of enjoying yourself, and you won't be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Plants or fans or both?,"I just can't understand how this movie can get 8,4 (this is the score it has after more than 10,000 votes; I guess it will get lower later). Of course the movie has been released only some days ago; there must be studio guys who want to sell their product. But I guess there are also fans who enjoyed this movie very much. Good for them. I don't say I hated it but I really can't understand the hype.This movie consists of three types of scenes:Teen movie - these parts do work (even if the girl is too hot for being believable); nothing special but okay (while the humor is really not that great). 6/10spectacular non-action sequences - they are the best part, maybe 10/10. The robots look really great, the effects are superb, the story is alright (yes you have to suspend belief to enjoy seeing the size differences when transforming - not only the transformers but the cube as well - but if you can't suspend your belief when watching a movie about giant robots you are helpless). These scenes really show Spielberg is the producer.action sequences - they are totally Michael Bay. But not his finest (like The Rock) but his most maniac. Yes, the movie is fast, spectacular and loud, but these scenes are simply too much; in the end these even started to bore me as hell. If Bay was able limit himself and not include endless boring sequences of loud, mindless and superfluous destruction, that would have helped the movie very much; these sequences are 4/10 for me.(sorry; I am not a Bay-hater - even if Pearl Harbor was terrible - but it is strange to find the action scenes to be the weakest part of a Bay action movie.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I'm not even a Transformers fan and I loved it!,"Transformers was definitely one of the big summer blockbusters of 2007, but I never bothered seeing it in the movie theater because I never watched the cartoon when I was a kid. I was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles girl; so basically since I never watched Transformers or played with the toys I figured I would never understand the movie, so why bother? But my friend and her boyfriend saw it opening night, and she's the same as me where she never watched the cartoon, but she said that this was a great film. So I figured I would just wait until the rental just so I can say I wasn't part of the hype that was this summer of the Transformers. So I watched Transformers last night and I have to say that I am amazed, I really did like the movie. It was filled with exciting action sequences, cool dialog, and amazing effects. The story also worked very well and the actors seemed to enjoy doing the movie.Sam is a teenage boy who is just looking forward to getting his very first car, his dad helps him get a used car that looks pretty busted up and not very special. But that proves to be a wrong theory, one night Sam thinks his car is being stolen when it is driving off. He chases after it and finds out that the car is an alien robot from outer space. He then finds more of these ""Autobots"" who are at war with the ""Decepticons"" and are after a box that will give them unlimited power and could possibly destroy Earth. So the Autobots are there to help Sam and his friends to save the world before the Decepticons can destroy it.Transformers is a great action movie, it occasionally has it's little flaws here and there, I mean when you really think about it, this is just one of those kick butt action movies. But it is a very well done film and I was really impressed on how great job the crew put this movie together. To be honest I now wish that I saw this in the theater because it must have been more exciting to see on the big screen. I would recommend it though, but watch it on a large screen television if you get the chance, I think you'll get the better effect, because that's the only way to watch an action movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
awesome film,"Transformers is a awesome film. People who say its rubbish are ignorant and petty. The graphics are mind blowing. They have changed a few things but it doesn't matter because there is no point in always sticking to the old school cartoon. Also in the film they have given us humans a bigger part to play in the war between the transformers, this worked well because it first i believed it would be boring but we humans kicked ass!! Credit has to go to Steven Spielberg and Micheal Bay for making this film, the attention to detail is extraordinary Optimus Prime looks unbelievable. Though i would admit bumblebee is my favourite autobot hes so funny. 10/10 a must see!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi Movie Based on a Series,"While it's true that the franchise does get progressively worse with their sequel, but it all just started with one harmless film. Transformers is just an example turning a series into a your cheesy sci-fi film. On one hand, this is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously for an action movie with stale jokes, unnecessary special effects and weak human characters. But on the other hand, it movie can be fun with a decent story, some of the good action, and great designs on Autobots and Decepticons. Normally as a movie based on a series, I would say you must think of what you are watching as a live action movie based on Transformers. But I can mostly recommend this for the most die hard fans of the franchise. Those that are actually familiar of either the toys or the shows, those are the ones that will have a blast with this. Honestly, it would pretty much be better off of this is a stand alone film and the sequels never existed. I'm not saying rebooting it is a terrible idea. In fact, Transformers has done it with Bumblebee and that actually turned out to be a good movie. It's just one of those franchises where the more movies are made, they made it worse for the reputation of Transformers. I just want to state that with Michael Bay not directing Bumblebee and the upcoming one, Rise of the Beast, we might see the franchise get to the right path of making good movies. Yes this is directed by Michael Bay too, but I would consider the most tolerable of the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
MOre than meets the eye (fo real),"Every single thing (except for one) about this movie.. was fantastic. From amazing action to stunning visuals, to ear splitting great sound, Trnasformers was the only summer blockbuster to live up to its hype. When you have movies like SP3 or Pirates that simply did not fully cut the deal, Transformers does. The only problem with this movie is the humor (in some parts). Some of the humor is great, but when there is a serious, basa**, action sequence and you have the robots shoutin out jokes, it makes the serious scenes seem a bit like a joke. Anyways, I have always been a big fan of Transformers, and i must say that this stuck to the cartoon storyline very well and opened up the possibility of future sequels. The voices of the robots were amazing and the sounds used were as well. Seriously, the sound could make the movie in its own. I recommend seeing this more than once for pure entertainment because it does not led up the whole way!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"There was a lot of build up for this move, but I believed it to be warranted. As not only Micahel Bay was the one directing, but the great Steven Spielberg was involved as well. While standing in line to see it, I told myself, ""There is no way this could be bad."".Walking out of the movie theater, I thought about what I had said while walking in, and wondered just how they had screwed this up. After all, the action scenes were great, and the special effects were top notch. There was nary a dull moment throughout the entire film. The acting was good for the most part. They were talking to robots.. that has to be hard to make it look good.However, as great as the Transformers looked, and how much I loved them as a kid. They had just seemed to have too many unbelievable flaws. These guys are supposed to be super intelligent, uber evolved machines, yet they came off as adolescent teenagers. Their dialog was painful making me cringe at times, and left me wondering if a 10 year was playing the part of Optimus Prime. I would go into the details, but I'd rather not give away spoilers for those who have not yet seen it. It's unfortunate they didn't make a better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Story is very flat and I've a feeling that the authors are trying to imply the ""american way of life"". If you are looking for a cheap senseless entertainment or you have too much time, the movie is for you. You will get very big amount of special effects with very poor acting and bad movie sound.

"...good, but not too good!!!","...ok, where were we...the purpose of the movie was to ENTERTAIN the masses; well done, Spielberg did it, no doubt, but as every SF and action movie this days, ""Transformers"" has stupid, but correctable mistakes and errors...for example: why would the secretary of defense(Voight) send the endangered ""package""(the Cube) to the city where alive people live, when they know that the Decepticons are after it and they know what they can do; to sacrifice the people?...second: the scene where Mikaela drives Bumblbee through the city was really stupid and unimportant, I mean, find me a girl that would do such a stupid thing!...third: how is it possible that a 1.78 meters tall man, managed to put the Cube into the chest of a killing machine 20 meters tall?...there is a lots of things that I didn't like in the movie, but I am still too euphoric and under the influence of the special effects... ...ahhh, f... it, I'm going tomorrow to the cinema to watch it again...

"Good action, transformations need to look more practical.","Well, definitely not ""aweful"" as few have added before. The problem's that the comic relief actually disrupts the harmony of all the serious ""human"" message that the movie has to offer. But we must also consider the movie was rated 12 in most of the countries, so obviously it was made keeping young viewers in mind.Autobots exhibiting ""human"" emotions like anger and the fact that ""pride"", ""status"", ""authority"" have a similar meaning to them as us, gives them a human edge and an opportunity to interact and assimilate with mankind.Their transformation could've been made better. For example a 10 wheeled truck is not an apt tactical state for a battle.Good captivating action, but a little seriousness could have been added.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Love and hate relationship.,"Transformers, whether you love it or hate, is a somewhat decent film but could've been a lot better had the direction and writing been a little more fleshed out and coherent. True there are some great action scenes but they all (once again) suffer from that tried and tested ""MTV style"" editing that makes it so hard to appreciate the action. I can name many sci-fi action films that have much better action scenes than Transformers but I'm not going to as I felt I should keep this review short and sweet as others have pointed out the many flaws in this film; some of which I will list here. Having just seen the second film a week ago, I'm just gonna say this one was much better than the second one, why? Well, I just feel that this one has a much better focus on the story,not that there's really is a story to begin with, but it just jived with me for some unknown reason. I don't know, but I just feel this one is much better. On that note, Transformers is not as bad as the second one but Revenge of the Fallen was the pits as far as I'm concerned. If you seen the first film and are eager to see the second, then go ahead but I rather see Transformers again (on DVD) then revisit ROTF. Not good or bad, just ""okay"".Final note: I hope they replace Michael Bay with the third film and get the writers from the ""Beast Wars"" series. MUCH better than Orci and Kurtzman 100%.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
brilliant CGI and action let down by an uneven script,"Transformers, based on the toys of the same name, has a very simple plot. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime square off with the Decepticons led by Megatron. Both are searching for something called the Cube. Their search and war brings them to earth, causing massive destruction. Earth's hope lies in a teen called Sam Witwicky, whose great-grandfather found something buried years earlier.....Directed by Micheal Bay, this has everything you expect from one of his movies: camera's continually on the move, quick-fire editing, and LOUD action sequences. Probably the most surprising thing about it though is that apart from a couple of performances, it's very well acted. The cast, led by Shia LeBouf as Sam are pretty good. The only one who lets the acting side down is John Turturro, as a member of a secret operation known as Sector Seven. But Turturro's performance may be as a result of the script, which has an uneven tone through-out.Let me explain. The movie opens with an attack on a US base in Quatar. It's a well shot and impressive opening, with Bay showing you the CGI transformers in action right from the start. The attack itself is brutal and kills just about everyone. Things calm down for awhile after that as various characters are introduced as the plot evolves. However at times during these moments there is some humour that is at odds with the intensity of the action. Don't get me wrong. Humour in an action movie is always a good thing, but here it's the wrong type of humour. The sequence at Sam's house as he searches for an item that the Autobots need, while they wait outside is the case in point. This is more slapstick humour than, say the humour of a movie like The Rock (another Bay movie), where the dialogue was funny . This brings me back to Turturro. His performance as the agent of Sector Seven tries to be comedic, but it feels like it should be in another movie. A Men In Black approach to Sector Seven would have been better, and funnier than what we get here.The action when it explodes on screen is spectacular. Be it the opening sequence at the airbase in Quatar, to the final battles in the city they are all very impressive, as is the visual CGI by Industrial Light and Magic. The way the human actors blend in with the CGI is stunning, putting them right in the middle of the transformer battles raging round them.The faults with the movie, which as I said lie with the script, are not fatal. For it's running time it's enjoyable, never dull and like all Micheal Bay movies looks stunning, even during the scenes of destruction! The ending leaves the way open for potential sequels. If they can get the tone of the script right, they could have a brilliant follow-up to what is a good summer blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent movie,"For the most part this movie delivers but on the other hand could've been done so much better. Transformers 2007 is easily the best film of the 5 films but Michael Bay as director I didn't like so much. All of the lore and history from the comics is not explained and most of the Decepticons get little to no screen time or backstory. If only Michael bay cared even half as much about the Transformers lore as his fans do. It could have been such a mature, interesting exploration of aliens deserted on a foreign planet, the last species of their kind, but terrifying in their power.

When you calm down from the high you come to realise that in the end ""it is just an action movie"". But a very good action movie none the less.Fans of the toy-line and cartoons series should be proud. Michael Bay has brought us a formidable adaption with the best CGI money can buy and crunched out a story that isn't too corny for the average viewer and which also combines great action and special effects with tons of silly humour which prevents the film, in all its massiveness, from becoming horrifically dull.The film also has a well executed human-story, but by the end of it you kinda realise that this stuff was really intended for the kids.

More than Meets the Eye,"Transformers 6 out of 10 There was a time in my life where a certain toy was my most prized possession. That toy was Optimus Prime. Aside from G.I. Joe's, Transformer's were my favorite. I would set for hours playing puppeteer to one after another autobot/decepticon battle. So, much like the hundreds of thousands of TM fan boys out there I waited to see the live action version with much anticipation. The only thing I wasn't sure about is Mr. Michael Bay being involved. After unleashing such warmed over mediocrity over the past ten years (Armageddon, Bad Boys II, etc), I had my reservations about how he would bring TM to the big screen, but surprisingly he got a lot right. Not everything though.The film starts out with an Optimius Prime voice-over setting up the struggle between good and evil then takes us straight into the life of Sam (Shia LeBeouf). Sam is just your average teen, trying to buy a new car to impress the girl. But, when his father buys him a vintage yellow Camaro, Sam doesn't realize that it is a robot in disguise. The Camaro ends up being the autobot, Bumblebee. (Bumblebee was originally a VW bug as a toy, but in an effort to totally be a whore to general motors and to make Billy Woodring enjoy this movie he was turned into the newest model Camaro) There's a great sequence when Bumblebee drives away in the middle of the night and Sam gives chase, thinking his car is being stolen, and then discovers his Camaro turning into a thirty foot tall robot. From there all the pieces start to fall perfectly in place. The rest of the Autobots are introduced. Jazz (voiced by none other than Eddie Winslow from Family Matters), Ratchet, Ironhide, and yesOptimus Prime! Optimus explains the battle between good and evil again to Sam and reveals to him that the key to saving earth lies in Sam's great grandfather's eye glasses that Sam is currently trying to pawn on eBay. (Yeah I knowjust go with it.) At this point Bay has done almost everything right. The acting is pretty much what you expect from a summer blockbuster, except for LeBeouf. Shia LeBeouf is subtly becoming the next big thing in Hollywood and I think he will have a bright future as the leading everyman. He does the best that he can with the script and turns out a great lead performance I could have done without Tyrese and Josh Duhamel's characters. I mean come on , do we really need to see Duhamel jumping off a speeding motorcycle and then sliding on his back on the street fifty feet all while double fisting machine guns at a Decepticon? Come on Bay, not everything has to be that over the top! The FX and the overall look of the film are great. The Transformers look really awesome and the CGI blend in with the real background almost flawlessly. The main problem I had with TM is the running time. There is no reason the running time needed to be two hours and thirty five minutes. My nostalgia started to sputter out around one hour and forty five minutes and I think they could have saved some face by cutting the last thirty minutes of CGI battles. Bringing back Peter Cullen to reprise the voice of Optimus was a nice touch, but I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to hear ""You got the touch"" at the closing credits. That song was from the 1986 animated feature and the song was later hilariously recreated by Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly in Boogie Nights. I guess that's the difference between Michael Bay and me. I would have chosen ""You got the touch"" for the closing, Michael chose Linkin Park. This is definitely an improvement on Bay's recent work though. I'm not saying its Armageddon bad and I'm not saying its Bad Boys good. I think it is somewhere right in between.So, my suggestion to you is that if you are a Transformer fan boy like me, find the biggest screen in your town and go see it with 500 other people. The robot battles will keep you entertained for two hours. If you're not a fan and you don't know even know what a decepticon is, then I hear A Mighty Heart is pretty good.JB",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Giant Robots Fighting,"Transformers was a decent movie if you don't think. When I say that it goes beyond just the notion that giant talking robots aren't real. We all know that, and that's not what I'm saying. This movie is meant to be enjoyed the way a roller coaster is meant to be enjoyed. You just strap yourself in and go for the ride. There's a lot of action, poorly written dialogue, and dazzling special effects. The acting is only on par with the direction. Michael Bay may know how to blow things up in amazing ways, but he lacks the ability to really get a reaction out of an actor. But, once again, this film is not meant to showcase anyone' true acting grit. It's meant to be a fun ride that everyone can easily enjoy.

"Although it can't match the original TV show, it's still awesome.","The original TV show was back in the 80s. This came out in 2007. It was unexpected that they would make a live-action movie (and then go on to make two sequels). I saw this before I watched the original show - I was 12 when I saw this movie. But although they aren't equals, this movie is really good! It should've won an academy award just because, to the adults, it brought back the 80s. Still, what made this movie not be a ripoff was that it had an entirely different plot than the show did (no Energon, all about the Allspark). It was directed in a well- executed manner. Acting was okay. Fight scenes were...intense. The plot was fine. So overall, why 7 stars? Because I didn't know squat about Transformers before I saw this. Now, I have a huge collection of the figures. It started a new obsession for me. That's how much I liked it. It's a good movie.

Better Than I Expected,"I was invited to this movie by my friend, and I has no intention of going to Transformers, hating the cartoon. I decided to except his offer to be kind, and expected a totally stupid movie like the TV show. I was stunned. It felt as if Micheal Bay totally changed the storyline, with the All-Spark added instead of pointless battles for the galaxy. Not only did Micheal make the storyline more decent, he also made a lot of characters that were actually quite likable, or appreciable.The storyline like I mentioned, was actually made so that the battles had purposes instead of random fighting. However, the movie would constantly remind the audience that the All-Spark was the main focus by having Decepticons constantly demand for the All-Spark for world domination. When there aren't any demands though, you completely forget what everyone's fighting for. This isn't a large problem though, you'll still find yourself enjoying the movie thoroughly.The action was great and not shallow or stupid as I imagined. I was completely blown away by the special effects and sound effects. You would be able to see every piece of the cars transforming to take the shape of a giant robot. What's more impressive is that the giant robots collide and throw fists at each other. Not one part of the movie looks fake.The acting was good for the most part with the flawless performance of Shia Labouef. Megan Fox however - was not the greatest actress you could ever find. Dialogue also could have been a little better. Otherwise, these things aren't usually noticeable.Transformers was overall good, it wasn't spectacular, but it was enjoyable to watch.

Not much more than meets the eye,"Standing in a crowded line waiting to watch Transformers yesterday, I had come prepared to see what Micheal Bay had transformed my childhood favorites into (pardon, the pun) Now as an adult I know that as a kid I also liked to eat candy that looked like worms. So looking back I know very well that the series looked much cooler then trying to digest them as adult now.Apart from that, I believe that that 8.0 user rating you see (on 17-07-07) will melt before your very eyes in the coming period and here's why; as you may know, Micheal Bay usually makes up for what he lacks in storyline with special effects and American patriot propaganda. In this case, the perfect choice if you want a cartoon to look like a real movie and if you want it to appeal for a war-tired/teen American audience.Unfortunately for Micheal Bay the rest of the world has yet to judge it too. I also think it is people who have been counting the days till the release of this movie who have been grading it so well. The rest of us did not bother to get in those long lines just yet. To be honest though, it does transcend the cartoon series...but just by the skin of it's teeth. Which is the best way of looking at it because looking at it in a different way, it will be a total suckfest.Script: Thin as a sheet. Ironically, it almost felt like I was back in the eighties when I watched this movie. Tiresome Americans (military) saving the world with guns blazing with big breasted women running around screaming and guys getting blown away all over the place...by robots.Direction: Sugar-rushed paced. It's a shame that Micheal Bay still does not understand that action is defined by the moments of quiet in between. In the action, things get very confusing during fights but you do get the notion of the sheer size, weight and power of the transformers.Special effects: Very good. The fact that computer graphics always have a plastic and synthetic like feel to them works very well in this case of course. The Transformers look perfectly real in the movie. Although, who has ever seen giant robots walking around?Acting: Mediocre. Unfortunately Micheal Bay tries to appeal to all audiences with the strange effect that you get very clownesque or very serious acting. I did get a great feeling of nostalgia to hear to Peter Cullen do the original voice of Optimus Prime but, as with all the actors, I cringed with the bad lines they put out there.Maybe James Cameron next time. He's got a thing with robots... 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action and Fantasy pure,"For those who like this type of movie it is two hours of action and entertainment pure. It is some kind of Alien Vs. Predator not pretending anything different than what presented. Special effects are amazing, especially the transforming ones and the idea of the film is also not bad. The hiding of the transformers with eventual destruction of the garden is funny, but their stupid way of talking and behaving is so typical of a certain country in the world. Typical clichés are presented (cars, romantic sunrise etc.). However talking about live cars, the beetle was much more original. The way the protagonist gets to know her is not very convincing. They could have done something more creative. All in All this movie is typical American, some kind of fast food movie, no substance and a lot of artificial effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

However there were SOOOO many really needless tacky humor scenes.

Or the scene when the robots are hiding out at Shia's house (not a spoiler it was in the previews) it was drawn out far too long. The action scenes on the other hand were very impressive, even the bits where humans were fighting the machines. (Though the machine on machine battles were freaking awesome)Casting was good in my opinion and the voices for the robots was good, specially Optimus Prime, it was a very 'demanding of presence' voice.

Bumblebee defends Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Banes from the Decepticon Barricade, before the other Autobots arrive on Earth. They are searching for the Allspark, and the war on Earth heats up as the Decepticons attack a United States military base in Qatar. Sam and Mikaela are taken by the top-secret agency Sector 7 to help stop the Decepticons, but when they learn the agency also intends to destroy the Autobots, they formulate their own plan to save the world.I was quite surprised that many people were at the earliest showing today, July 4th. Hoping to watch the movie with a couple of people with teenagers and crying babies away, I was quite disappointed but it didn't ruin my movie experience.The film was decent. This is coming from a guy who knows nothing about Transformers. The oh-so-incredible action sequences weren't that good and the plot, well, you know, was paper thin. Sure the CGI was flawless but you expect more. I found the camera work better than Bay's past films and the score great (except Linkin' Park).This is all you know when you see this film: Good robots vs. bad robots trying to find this mystical cube. If you want to watch this film for its plot and story, you'll be disappointed. Do you even think this film needs a good plot? No. It's a fun filled action film.I thought the film excluding the last forty minutes was decent. I expected more from Bay but as the last forty minutes rolled in, it gets thrilling. The action is non-stop. I liked the humor throughout the film which makes it entertaining. Shia LaBeouf plays a charismatic character and Megan Fox a sexy, but smart, girl. Others like Josh Duhamel and Jon Voight was good.Do not watch this movie expecting a great story. Watch it to be entertained with the action sequences and humor. Michael Bay isn't a grand storyteller yet but he is a professional popcorn movie director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Neither as good nor as bad as folks on this site say,"OK, I understand that I am not exactly the target demographic for this film. (Over sixteen) But my take on it is that is it is neither as good as some people say it is, nor as bad as others say it is. I know nothing of the cartoons or toys that are supposed to be the base here, and thus cannot comment on ""being true to source material."" But some of the characters (such as Sam, Mikeala) were decent, some of the others (such as Turturro, Sam's parents, Bernie Mac) were utter caricatures. Megan Fox looked very good. IL & M did what they do with CGI. I'm sure it was visually impressive on the big screen. If you take this film for what it is, it is mildly entertaining even if you aren't a kid. If you expect the movie to be something it's not, you will be sorely disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ups and downs... but mostly ups (and downs),"All in all, Transformers is a really really good movie (stopping short of saying great). The action was really good and the CG was incredible. The reason I gave it a 7 was for two reasons. I really didn't like Sam Whitwicky in this movie. I felt like he was a spoiled little brat of a kid, whose ""witty"" dialog was quite frankly marginally written at best. Secondly, I felt like the writers tried a little too hard with the ""humor"" aspect. The whole ""finding the glasses"" scene took WAY too long, and was a little far fetched considering every step the Autobots make creates a loud boom sound. Sure it may not have been as ""funny"" but they should've stayed in their alternate mode to make it slightly more feasible that the parents (let alone the rest of the neighborhood) wouldn't have noticed giant robots outside their house.Again, though, a lot of fun, good action and a great movie that I can watch again and again. Hopefully next time I won't have to watch it with the stupid 5 year old twins sitting in front of me beating each other up and acting like stupid 5 year olds.

"A pleasant surprise, it's a entertaining blockbuster popcorn flick with giant CGI robots","When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't know what to think but the premise was something new to me on the big screen so was sort of hyped for this movie. I don't know if it's because it's the first time I seen robots in great CGI beating the crap out of each other or something, but I had a entertaining time with this movie. The plot isn't anything amazing but it's passable and the build up was decent as well and the final battle in this flick was just awesome to watch. The human elements in this movie is pretty weak but it's bearable and it's alright to some degree. I didn't really like the clichés in this movie though. About the boy with the heart of gold that gets the hottest girl in school by doing something heroic. The humor in this is alright, not great but didn't bother me all that much although it felt a bit cheap. I know a lot of Transfomers fan will bash on this movie, but I will give my honest opinion. This movie was actually a quite entertaining movie, a good popcorn flick that the whole family will have a good time with. I kinda dislike it when people say ""it's the type of movie you will have to shut your brain off while watching in order to enjoy it"" that usually means the story is a complete mess. In this case though it didn't get to the point of me getting so annoyed with it that I just wanted to see action every minute. Megan Fox is going to be exposed a lot more after this and I will just say it's not because of her acting. As for Shia LaBeouf, he was alright. Maybe it's because this is his first time being in this franchise, but didn't get all that tired of his character or was very annoyed by him. Overall this is a pretty darn good popcorn flick that just might be worth your time. It would have been better if some of the human bullcrap that was just there for humor and parts that was pointless to the story besides the action was cut out since the movie seemed a bit longer than it should be. But that is just a few negatives in my opinion. I give this movie a 7.8 for being entertaining, it would have been better if the robots at least got some more development cause you really don't care who gets destroyed. This movie is a pleasant surprise.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So with a 4rth film coming in Mid summer 2014, I figured i'd review the 3 films we already have.So, we finally (after 23 years) have a live action transformers film. And seeing it on DVD November 2007 (I'm a little behind), I enjoyed myself for 2 and half hours. But, it was not what I expected. It's slow, the first 2 acts, but the final act was fun.Realizing that there was a lot of explaining, I hoped for a sequel and thats what I got.

Seven Stars for Transformers !! Very Good Movie..,"As a die hard movie fan, I love watching all types of film genres. Iam a fan of transformers. I like michael bay movies since Bad Boys 2 and The Island. Well, I enjoyed watching Transformers movie, its action packed, comedy and dramatic too. Special Effects are awesome. Iam sure this film will get nomination for best special effects at the Oscars. Actors acted well. The storyline is satisfactory, not that great. I liked the emotional attachment between autobots and humans. Camera-work is good, Lighting is excellent. The action scenes is awesome, no doubts about that.But there are certain flaws in this movie. 1. There is one geographical error in this movie : Qatar Scene Mountains were shown in the background but there are no mountains in Qatar.2. Some of the decepticon robots don't have their own decepticon logo.3. Megatron is given predator look, I don't understand why michael bay is not sticking to original megatron shown in transformers movie 1986 animated version. Overall Barricade(Police Car) looks more better. I guess in this whole movie, the close shot of Starscream(F-22 Raptor fighter jet) is not shown.4. Last 30 minutes of film, Autobots and decepticons were fighting, there were few scenes, I could not understand who is fighting who.5. In this Film, there are few continuity errors in 1 or 2 shots.Iam not Michael Bay fan. Iam a fan of Steven Spielberg. At the bottom of my heart, I feel Steven Spielberg should be a film director and Michael Bay, an action director in upcoming transformers sequel. Michael Bay needs more improvement in direction platform. I watched this movie because Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. As a film critic, I will rate this movie 7.2/10 just because of flaws. As a normal audience, Its 9/10. Overall, Transformers is very good movie but could have been more better without these flaws. Its worth watching again when it comes in a DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie!!!!!,"To begin with.. i am a girl and i loved this movie. It's great.When i first heard that Transformers was going to become a movie i thought that this was going to be another disappointing movie. Recently i was kind of disappointed about many movies and i thought that this one wasn't going to be much different from the rest given the story.Frankly i thought that it was going to be a childish movie about some stupid robots.I couldn't be more wrong.When my brother introduced me to the trailer i started thinking that maybe this movie was worth seeing, even if it' s only for the special effects,but when i came out from the cinema i was totally amazed..... this movie is great!!!!!The director of the movie did an amazing job the movie turned out to be more that I would dream of.In conclusion i would like for people to go to this movie open minded, not have any prejudice and not label it as a robot movie or a childish movie because this movie is really worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Get what you paid for,"I was excited for Transformers to come out after watching all the previews for it online. After I saw it Monday night, I went out and saw it Tuesday again. I'm not typically one to see a movie in the theater multiple times, but I think Transformers is one of those movies where two viewings does it justice.The first time I came into the movie expecting ferocious, giant robot-on-robot violence. I know Michael Bay's track record (I completely avoided ""Pearl Harbor"" and didn't like ""The Island""), so I wasn't expecting much else. After seeing it, my taste for explosions, destruction, and violence was fulfilled (as expected), but the non-robot parts of the movie were entertaining as well. I've been consistently impressed by Shia LaBoeuf and the parents, John Turturro, Bernie Mac, and Anthony Anderson all keep your attention between Autobot-Decepticon battle scenes.The main reason why seeing the movie a second time is so that you can get a second look at the action scenes. The first time I saw it I was positively floored by them; the way the CGI interacts with the environment is stunning. When I saw it the second time, the adrenaline rush was a bit less so I could actually pay attention to what was going on during the battle scenes.This movie won't win any acting or writing Oscars (the story is simple and the romantic and family subplots are cute, but not deep or extremely engaging), but if you come into this movie expecting the right thing, you will get your money's worth.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pales in Comparison to the Earlier Movie,"During many points of this film, I found myself sitting there shaking my head in disbelief that I was watching it. A lot of the plot elements (especially where the government is involved) seem ridiculous and unbelievable, even for a movie about giant robots. The robots themselves looked very cool and realistic, though I sometimes missed the cleaner designs of their animated counterparts. I find it a bit odd that the filmmakers would go to such trouble to make the robots look real, and place them into such epic battle scenes, yet try so hard not to take things too seriously. It might've been more effective had they gone for straight drama. I wasn't even trying to compare this to the animated _Transformers: The Movie_, however, until this film lifted a quote directly from its predecessor. If they're gonna invite the comparison, they should at least make sure they measure up well. I would probably buy this when it comes out on DVD just 'cause the visuals are so cool, but I definitely feel the animated version was better and will continue to hold up better over time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Dumb first half, fun second half","While no one will mistake Michael Bay for making something intelligent or well-acted, they were at least watchable the whole way through. But Bay, the God of summer action movies' (Jerry Bruckheimer) favorite director, has made his weakest film yet. The first half of the movie is so dumb it's nearly unwatchable (maybe its because Bruckheimer isn't producing...). The dialogue is bad, the characters do stupid things, and stuff sometimes just doesn't make sense. Fortunately, however, the movie gets better around the 45 minute mark. It's not smarter, but it's actually entertaining. This is especially crazy since Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. Then again, he ""sold out"" a while ago, and is now more of a producer than a director.The story is completely absurd, but hey, it's a sci-fi movie, so of course it's going to be. Anyway, there are two warring alien races who are machines, the Autobots (the good guys) and the Decepticons (the bad guys). They bring their battle to earth because there's an all-powerful box called the Allspark there, and it could either bring peace, or destroy humanity and give the Decepticons control of the universe.The acting is okay, I guess, but no one is developed at all. Half the people are only memorable because we know their faces from other movies. Shia LeBeouf is immensely likable, so we care about seeing him through the movie. He's no different here than in any other movie he's been in, but he has an irresistible charm that does the job. Surprisingly, Megan Fox is not around just for good looks. She can act, and nearly steals every scene she's in. Jon Voight is awful, however. It's one of the worst performances he's ever given. Josh Duhamel is adequate, but not memorable. Jon Turturro is fun to watch as the of-the-wall secret agent. Tyrese Gibson is completely wasted in this movie.I really hate the Shaky Cam technique. For those of you who don't know, it's where the camera moves around a lot during an action scene so you can't get a good look at what's going on. Used effectively, it can heighten the suspense. ""The Descent"" is a case in point. The technique heightened the claustrophobia because it heightened the sense of being trapped in the dark and fighting monsters the characters couldn't see. But in ""Transformers,"" there's no use for it. Michael Bay used it probably because it is the trend, and, taking a note from Jerry Bruckheimer, he's never one to pass up on something that has already made money before.However, Bay is not a versatile director. He's good for filming action scenes, but not much else. He can't keep the material straight, and that's a problem because there are a lot of things going on simultaneously. With Bay's inadequate direction, characters come and go as the story demands it, and the rules that the film established are broken repeatedly and new ones are made. It's a mess.However, I'd be lying if I said ""Transformers"" is a terrible movie. It's no masterpiece (it's not even especially good). But it's watchable.Will I see the sequel? I guess, if I have nothing better to do. Because the film left me with that thought, I'll be generous with its rating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good entertainment action flick....but could have been more.,"Hmm where do i start...well this movie really wasn't all the bad everyone was expecting it to be, yet it had moments where it could have been better. The acting was OK, Shia did a decent job as Sam though i didn't see why they couldn't have had him called ""Spike"" once or twice here and there, to make reference of them 80's show and for someone to actually know thats him he's playing as. Cause i doubt highly many people, if not any, knew Spikes real name was Sam in the cartoon series...i don't think they ever mentioned that. But anyhow, it wasn't as big a deal.Cullen rocked as Prime again, though you could sense in his voice that it was a lil deeper and edgier and not quite the 80s Cullen voice as prime but in general i think it was still a great job, despite some corny and unnecessary lines. What i really had fair beef with was the lack of characterization on the Decepticons. Thats what made them so loved and comical and very entertaining to see in the cartoon. But in this live action adaptation they were really not much different then the T-1000s from the Terminator movies....lifeless walking chaotic machines. There was no intrigue to them, you would've like to have seen At least some more dialog from StarScream who we all know was the most witty and had his very individual personality which set him apart from the rest of the Cons. But all there was was one line which he had with Megatron, that was a moment i relished in the movie and was waiting for more...but there wasn't. Speaking of Megatron, Hugo Weaving did excellent and was a great replacement for Peter Welker...i kinda understand why they decided to go with him and not Welker. My favorite parts where when he would use the same phrases as the 80's Megatron did...like Boy! and Pet!I also loved the sequence when they first introduced the Autobots and you actually see them all transforming as the camera is shifting from Primes Feet to the other Bots. That part gave me goosebumps. The voices used for the Bots were good, Ratchet was my favorite you could believe the voice that it was him. Ironhide's was OK, still wished they had used someone like Sam Elliot. Jazz was good i didn't have much problem with his voice, all in all i was satisfied with the Autobots and their voices and characterization. The ending was surprisingly good, and made me already anxious for the sequel, which i hope when they're making it give a lil more attention to the Decepticons but either way, im sure will be a great movie w/e they do.Since i gave the Animated movie a 8 out of 10 im gonna give this one a 7. So, until 2009 comes.....Roll Out!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Impressive in the day,"When I first saw it - even though it is geared for kids i could see it was geared for adults as well. Fun for all.

When I went to see it, they told me it was sold out. So I saw it later. Michael Bay is very good at what he does - he knows how to make a ""fun"" movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tasteless,"I was a fan of the cartoons. I'm a lover of action movies. This movie is simply awful; and I like Michael Bay's 'The Island' The good; CGI is clearly reaching incredible complexity, the transformations are simply mind bending. However, they are few and far between, and simply do not make for a 'good movie'. Any movie can have 5 minutes of transformations, but you still need to fill the other 2 hours with content.The bad; everything else. The action scenes are way too close, too fast, too blurry, too loud, without any rhyme or reason. Whenever you think you are about to see something cool, it cuts away to the irrelevant human story that feels tacked on.The autobots are mere shadows of their former selves. The once intelligent ironhide is reduced to a trigger-happy moron. Optimus Prime is a single-minded brute who often makes clumsy mistakes. Jazz is just a rap-artist break dancer in disguise. This is just awful, awful stuff.The human 'story' is not a story at all. It cuts between a few different stories, and we don't care about any of them. Are human stories bad? No, not at all, in fact that is what this movie needed; a good human story. However, Sam the adolescent moron is hardly captivating, the untouchable soldier is simply not compelling, and the government hackers remind me of all those awful matrix/swordfish hackers that are just a joke.Here's how this movie should have 'rolled'. We should be introduced to cybertron, and the beginnings of the war. Start with a big battle scene. We make our way to earth. War continues. Human casualties cause a single person/group to hate the transformers and wage war on them. The autobots, under attack by the humans, convince the humans they are good by saving the humans from the decepticons. Autobots and humans team up to beat decepticons. Big final battle with all the decepticons vs. all the autobots. The end. Now, if you've seen the movie, a lot of those points may seem like what happened in the movie; but if you remember all the added garbage, like the awkward parents scene, the autobots hiding in the suburbs, the stupid government base nonsense and hacker garbage...you know my version would be a far better paced movie.Don't waste your time. thewaythetruth.com",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Since  before Time, . . . .There was the Cube""","If your like action movies, you are in for a treat.

Michael Bay is the Uwe Boll of Action Movies,"I will start this with an honest statement; I got more than I expected when I saw this movie, and I believe this is Michael Bay's best film to date.However; saying this does not mean this movie was any good.I'm not going to re-hash what was already said by others, but I will point out my two biggest gripes with this movie:1. My Second Biggest Gripe: The dialogue in this movie was, at times, bloody hideous. Overacting, cheesy one-liners, and bountiful supplies of obvious statements abound as it seems Bay is trying to fill in gaps of time. Maybe we would rather a shorter movie than have our time wasted with useless characters with worse dialogue. Hey, remember the kid who played that nerd from Buffy? Remember when he had about three crappy lines, and then disappeared inexplicably from the movie forever? Yeah, me neither.2. My Biggest Gripe: The Transformers were not the subject of the movie. Instead, we focus on the human players and their worldly struggles with surviving in the Middle East, getting the girl, hacking the code, proving their worth, and generally just mucking around and taking the focus away from where it really belongs: the Transformers themselves. The Autobots weren't even introduced until half-way through the movie, and even then they are limited script-wise to either some long-winded tirade by Prime,or some down right awful one-liners which are sometimes even worse than the dialogue from the cartoon itself (coming from the age of Thunder Cats and Visionaries, I think most of you '80s 'toons fans know what I'm talking about).All and all, I enjoyed the movie, but only because the action sequences were pretty keen, in my opinion. I like a good destruction-fest, and don't even need a real movie around one for me to enjoy it (which is a good thing, because there wasn't much real movie in Transformers anyway).EDIT: After watching this crap-fest for a second and third time, I have lowered my score from 6 out of 10 to 4 out of 10. Why? The horrible, horrible plot holes. I mean, come on, David Lynch has made movies with more coherent plot than this garbage.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent movie,"As a kid i used to watch transformers every day and i was a big fan of them. So i was really looking forward to it.

Thank God it wasn't anything like that. It was totally awesome, the robots looked great but i have to admit that bad guys looked cooler, plot was well adjusted and visual effects amazed me the whole movie.

I have read all the "" OH MY GOD this is the best thing since sliced bread!!!!"" reviews as well as the "" Michael Bay should be hung from the tallest tree possible for what he has done to the Transformers!!"" ones.While I'm not quite in the gushing pile, I am very far from the ""it sucks"" bunch.Right from the get go this movie broke into an action sequence that is just utterly amazing and well choreographed. Michael Bay does action very well and this movie played to his strengths.As a junkie of the old 80's cartoon and being something of a Transformers geek (I am married and do have kids) I held them in an icon stature and initially felt that the designs of the robots should have followed the toy line and cartoon closer. BOY WAS I WRONG.... The character designs were excellent and worked well for the movie and were totally believable.This movie delivered on so many levels for me. From the action sequences to the little touches of comedy such as Iron Hide commenting on wanting to shoot Sam's parents because they were annoying. I think the nay sayers are saying so because this movie didn't fit in with their narrow closed minded expectations of what should have been.My only true complaint was some of the overtly sexual innuendo and unneeded references to male self gratification which made for some very delicate explanations to my seven year old.Overall, this is an excellent summer movie and well worth seeing during the summer of sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Slick, pro-military propaganda and simple storyline","Transformers was fine entertainment. Definitely skewed towards a young audience (tweens) thanks to its simplicity.Big 'wow' factor, especially with the speccy spfx. One jaw-dropping moment, in particular, was a scene late into the movie when a gold-coloured Decepticon (the evil robots) appeared to be roller-blading down the freeway in pursuit of the good guys.Really impressive how seamlessly the animation blended with the live action.The part that left a really nasty taste in my mouth was how blatantly pro-war it all was. Military might and efficiency plus zero body count (wait, did someone die in this movie?) as opposed to the grim and harsh reality of countless deaths daily in this current war and pretty well every other war that's ever happened. I even turned to my guy at one stage and said (obviously ironically) ""I wanna enlist!""

"Good, fun movie for all the family!","The plot of the film begins when Earth becomes battlefield in a war between Autbots and Decepticons – two races of alien robots capable to ""transform"", or, to mimic any part of ordinary machinery. While evil Decepticons want to conquer Earth and destroy humanity, Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voice by Peter Cullen) want to prevent them. In doing so, Autbots receive help from Sam Whitwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), high school student whose ancestor accidentally found Megatron (voice by Hugo Weaving), leader of Decepticons, buried in Arctic ice. Young man is protected by Bumblebee, Autobot masked into car with whom Sam tried to impress his classroom crush Mikaela Barnes (played by Megan Fox).Reason why TRANSFORMERS is better than average Michael Bay's film is simple. Film based on a toy line is not supposed to burden scriptwriters with important and serious issues like penal system, human cloning, American pacifism or crime and punishment. TRANSFORMERS therefore couldn't be taken seriously, so Bay didn't need to try and predictably fail in such endeavour. Instead of that this film is taken as nothing other than an excellent opportunity to display the current state of CGI technology in Hollywood together with other, crude but effective ways to bring undemanding moviegoers to theatres during summer season.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Bay was born to direct this movie,"What is this ""Transformers?"" If you grew up in 1980s, especially if you were a male, the answer would have been part of your daily knowledge. This reviewer grew up in the 1990s, so even though the ""Transformers"" phenomenon was not as powerful as it was in the 1980s, this reviewer still remembers watching the many reruns on ""Cartoon Network."" Nonetheless, this reviewer remembers watching the reruns of the television show, along with many other ones from that era. The question will be asked: will fans of the television show like the movie? Will it appeal to the non-fans as well? The answer to those questions is an absolute yes.Sam Witwicky buys his first car, but, to his surprise, that car was actually Bumblebee, a member of the Autobots, disguised as a Camaro. Through Bumblebee, Sam discovers the secrets about the mysterious ""Allspark,"" a cube that gives machines the gift of life, and the war that is going on between Autobots and Decepticons. Unfortunately, Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have landed on earth. In Qatar, there was an attack on the US military base, but those attacks were not from any particular human terrorist but two Decepticons. In addition, two other Decepticons attacked Sam and his girlfriend, Mikaela. These Decepticons want the Allspark for their own needs greedy needs, while the Autobots want to destroy it because of its corruptive power. With more and more Decepticons appearing, Bumblebee sends a message for other Autobots to come to Earth. Now the war hits the Earth and it is up to Sam, with the help of the Autobots, to ensure humanities survival.The special effects, created by Industrial Lights and Magic (ILM), and fight scenes were phenomenal. Every time one of them did their transformations, your jaw will literally hit the floor. Special effects have been amazing over the years, but you have not felt this overwhelmed since seeing the Dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park."" Never once did you feel that it was computer generated. It is consistently action packed, and never once during its 144 minutes does it feel boring. Sure there is at times, when the trademark ""shaky"" cam came into play, making it very difficult to tell what was going on, but there is also times where they would slow down the fights to show you the most important scenes.There are many references to the cartoon series. Some lines from the original cartoon series are quoted in this. The great Peter Cullen, who was the voice of Optimus in the animated series, voices Optimus Prime in this one too. They do make little tiny tweaks to the designs of the characters, for a more modern look, but it would have looked extremely cheesy if it was left unaltered. If you were a fan of the series, you are going to love the references.Besides the action, special effects, and many references to the cartoon series, the humor was surprisingly well done. It is surprising how much humor is actually there and even more surprising how much it works. There are some parts where the audiences, and this reviewer, are laughing so hard that you could not even hear what the characters are saying after words. Warning to parents: some of the most humorous scenes are very adult, so if you do not want to explain to your young children some awkward things, do not show them this movie.The acting is nothing special, but it does the job. The most impressive is Shia LeBeouf as Sam. This role really showed that he can do big budget lead roles, a big step up from his days as Lewis Stevens in ""Even Stevens."" Megan Fox is in this for nothing else but eye candy. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel are in this film, but as expected, do not do anything for their roles but play Soldiers. Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac bring great comedic relief. Peter Cullen shows off his iconic voice as Optimus Prime. John Voight is a great president too!In conclusion, go see ""Transformers"" because it is an awesome action movie. Fans of the series are going to love it and the casual fans are going to love it as well. As a fan of the show, this is everything expected, and much more. You should see it as soon as you can to get the full effect. The audience, this reviewer saw it with, loved it. There were many laughs at appropriate times, lots of cheering for great action scenes and the appearances of popular characters like Megatron or Optimus and a big applause at the end credits. It just made the film so much more enjoyable, and that is why you see a big budget ""Transformers"" movie. It is not ""The Godfather,"" nor should the audience pretend it was. ""Transformers"" is a movie to have fun viewing, and boy is it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The start of a good franchise,"I consider the Transformers movie series to be one of the greatest action franchises of all time. These two movies are so entertaining I can watch them without being board. Along with the Terminator series, and Batman movies, they aren't meant to be taken seriously, just as entertainment. Although I like them both, I think the first was a little better, after all, it had to establish what happens in the rest of the series. This movie has all the action, effects, and hot celebrities you could ask for, and I can't wait to see what else Bay has planned. Transformers is a good action movie, and as long as you aren't expecting a big plot, you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Train Wreck,"I really didn't expect too much, I mean, watching the cartoon series today makes me cringe. But boy is 'Transformers' one bad movie.Action flicks seldom care about good stories, plots and screenplay. But most action flicks don't pretend to. This one, however, appears to have been four hours long, before they cut it to two and a half. It introduces about three dozen characters and just as many mini subplots, all of which are unnecessary, meaningless and stupid. Then they throw in so many bad clichés, I didn't know if it was a really bad satire or just reeeeeeaaaaalllly bad. The characters are two dimensional and the girls were obviously picked for looks alone.The only thing the movie could have going for it, would be the action. But no, not really, no. Visual and Special effects have reached the point of near perfection a couple of years ago, and between 'The Matrix' and 'The Lord of the Rings' there's not much left to impress by simply rendering it and showing off the with the coding work of a couple of nerds. The direction of the action is substandard. Most of it is simply having things blow up or chases. Nothing we haven't seen better in so many movies before.So with a sh*tty screenplay and boring action, the only thing that movie has going for it, is the acting of Shia what's his name. I really liked him, I think he's gonna be entertaining in lots of better movies yet to come.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The story line was brilliant and the cast were also fantastic picks (Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor) as the leading women they looked amazing. Go see in the cinema, I rated this film a Top 10 but some other people have rated this film lower, which I think they must have watched it on their crap pirate copy where you would lose all the special affects.Amongst all the other top films to see this year, this would be the best film and I know it's tough and a bold statement even from me being a huge fan of the Simpsons I think this film would be better, Sorry all fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
transformers an average movie after all,"I waited a week before heading to see the Transformers. I have to give it 6 out of 10. First because it was freaking hard to actually enjoy the fighting scenes because they were so out of focus ( The movie was clear and sharp until the fighting scenes) They moved to fast and from one side of the screen to the other. As a fan I could not appreciate the action at all. Secondly, the plot was really bad, nothing to do with what we grew up (I understand is a new era but at least make the story interesting) And finally too many dumb ass jokes, what was the director thinking? Would had rather waited to see on DVD than to waste money in the theater. Just another average movie, this summer has really been a let down. Hopefully for the sequel they improve the plot and make it a more part of the story than just fancy graphics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Hard on the eyes and ears at times, yet still bearable.","Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was entertaining. At times. But there are a lot of things wrong with it that you'll notice instantly if you stop paying attention to the explosions for two seconds. First of all, it takes place almost entirely at 5pm, with the few exceptions of a couple night scenes. The sun is always low on the horizon, beaming in light at impossibly dramatic angles. This rule goes double for the end fight. Don't forget about the well-placed slow-motion ""hero shots"". I can't tell you how many times I thought I was watching Armmageddon and that's not a good thing. Some of the ""hero shots"" are almost identical to this movie's. And having multiple slow-mo shots of your heros getting off of planes or helicopters gets old fast. The thing that really made this movie painful, however, was the script. I could handle the cheesy dialouge between the robots, but when the same crap starts shooting back and forth between the humans, there's a problem. Listen to what the people say in this movie and tell me that it even comes close to how people talk. I dare you.Still, despite all that, and many other things to be assured, I still had a good time watching this. For a summer blockbuster, its works just fine and the CGI action, while a bit over the top, is still top-notched and fun to watch.

Looking past the hype... disappointment for a long time Transformers fan,"As a kid growing up in the 80's I was of course a fan of the Transformers. I still own a bunch of cool action figures and I never thought I'd see it as a live action movie.The trailers were pretty good so I was excited and hyped, and as usual went to watch it on the opening night.Unfortunately the movie falls short. I knew of course it was meant to be a blockbuster and it should be straightforward enough to please anyone. However the plot is REALLY lacking in depth and the characters range from interesting to pathetic.Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good actors in this movie and they all go to waste playing mediocre rolls. The Defense Secretary is ridiculous, John Turturro's role as Agent Simmons is also completely idiotic. Shia LaBeouf is good and Megan Fox, although not a bad actress, has a stereotypical ""misunderstood babe who looks shallow"" role.The CGI is amazing of course but it just can't hold the weak plot. The transformers lack personality (except 2 or 3) and are in many ways unfaithful to the series.I wish they'd focus more on the plot and made a better movie. As a fan I'm sad to see this reduced to just another blockbuster with ridiculous characters, constant and exaggerated comic relief (IT DOESN'T STOP!), and a forgettable story.It really could've been so much more...",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Eyebreaking action for a rather silly plot,"As a kid I was a huge fan of the auto-bots (my favorite character in the series - I guess he's everybody's favorite- was Optimus Prime). Man, I even had Optimus as a play toy. It was really cool seeing him transform into a truck with my one fingertips. Well, I don't want to get all mushy and stuff, so let's just say I really looked forward to see this new summer blockbuster.Having seen a lot of Michael Bay's movies, I was pretty sure the movie wouldn't lack the action scenes, but in my head arose two questions: could his team really make these fantastic robots look real? Would the story be OK? As to the first question, let me tell you that these robots really rook on the big screen. I must give the visual effects team huge credit, because they did their homework. The robots are amazing (I mean visually) and the battle scenes are breathtaking. In my opinion the movie has some of the best special effects since Matrix hit the box office.But I guess that this represents also the weak points of this movie. Once your eyes get accustomed to see the robots on screen, you realize that their personalities are very superficial and stereotyped. And their isn't really a plot, but that is for you to decide. I guess with all the action packed scenes, there wasn't much time for anything else. So, as I suspected, the answer to my second answer is a big NO.The + aspects of the movie: The action scenes, the visual design of the robots, the acting of Le Beuf, (he's really funny when he tries to impress Megan Fox with his new car) and some good chokes.The - aspects of the movie: no real plot, abuse of the action scenes, the humor get's silly and childish at times and not to forget the grandiloquent end speech of Optimus Prime, come on, is this for real) So my recommendation is, if you want to enjoy yourself, have some good laughs and see some cool actions scenes and over the top special effects without having to think a lot, than this movie is definitely made for you. But if you expect more, let's say a real story and some good characterization of the robots, think again. But hey, this is Hollywood at its best!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The coolest commercial I have ever seen...,"I have to say that I watched this movie out of curiosity, people have been raving about it since it hit theaters and now that it is on DVD I decided to give it a go... No amount of spit and polish can hide the fact that Transformers is pure garbage. So let me start with the high points. The CGI is beautiful. I have experience with 3D modeling and animation and must say that my mind was blown by all of the beautiful transformation sequences and details in each robot. The team behind Transformers will surely get the Oscar for best special effects and deservingly so. The rest of the movie is mediocre at best... The foundation of any decent movie is its screenplay and this movie is a compilation of stupid character archetypes, clichés and failed attempts at humor that reinforce the summer movie money whoring feel. Slightly nerdy, doesn't quite fit in protagonist: CHECK. Sexy, slightly snobbish girl who needs to be won over by protagonist: CHECK. Life altering encounter with object that alters the ordinary world: CHECK. Source of conflict found in one all powerful artifact: CHECK. The dialogue is riddled with goofy lines that have come to be expected in crappy movies based on comic books and any theme is an afterthought since Michael Bay's only concern is filling every frame with things that go boom and special effects. Bay is what I fear most, an anti-artist out to make millions for movie studios every summer. His movies are empty and formulaic and aimed at the masses for maximum monetary return. He undoes the work of so many great filmmakers that has come before him by allowing audiences to escape into a ridiculous world where they are in no way thrust into cognition. Have Bergman, Fellini, Truffaut, Bunuel, De Sica and Kurosawa's work been for nothing? Literature, cinema, and music are artistic arenas and as such all entries into these forums should be judged on their artistic merit. Period. My biggest grievance is the fact that this film felt like a 143 minute commercial. Not since The Wizard have I seen a film that promotes a product so well. After watching I felt like I was being begged to buy a General Motors vehicle and joined the armed forces. It was disgusting. Performances are mediocre but it is really a moot point considering that the actors really didn't need to convey much, act surprised here, awkward there, courageous at the end... The usual. I beg anyone who has any respect for cinema to avoid this film and indulge in something of substance... To anyone who enjoyed this I implore you to take some time to try and enjoy something less commercial...",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite movies of all.,"Transformers is an absolute spectacle and one of my favorite movies of all time! Directed by Michael Bay, this film not only revolutionized the action genre with its groundbreaking visual effects but also brought to life the beloved characters from the iconic toy line and animated series in a way that feels both thrilling and heartfelt.Shia LaBeouf delivers an outstanding performance as Sam Witwicky, the relatable everyman who finds himself in the midst of an intergalactic war between Autobots and Decepticons. His character's journey from a typical teenager to a key player in an epic battle is both engaging and entertaining. Equally impressive is Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes; her charisma and strong presence elevate the film, adding depth to her character while also showcasing her skills in a high-stakes environment.The action sequences are jaw-dropping, with the transformation scenes and massive battles between the giant robots leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. The special effects are groundbreaking for their time, and they create an immersive experience that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the action.Beyond the explosive visuals, the film has moments of genuine emotion and humor that make it relatable. The friendship between Sam and the Autobots, particularly Bumblebee, adds a layer of warmth that balances the intense action.Overall, Transformers is a masterful blend of thrilling action, great performances, and a captivating story. For its spectacular visual effects, engaging characters, and heartfelt moments, I give it a perfect 10 out of 10! This film is a must-see for fans of action and science fiction alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robots,"""Transformers"" is undeniably a visual feast of CGI-enhanced, over-the-top action. Character development and a compelling storyline are lacking in the film. Like many overhyped films, I grew tired of hearing how great it was. It's just another big-bang film with no real story to tell.The Camaro isn't the only disguised robot that's made its way to Earth. On Earth, Optimus Prime and Megatron are both looking for the same AllSpark.""Transformers"" tells three stories in parallel before bringing them together for the dramatic climax. With so many plots, you'd assume it'd be a jam-packed film full of gripping, intricate tales. Instead, they exist solely to serve as a vehicle for all of the set-piece action.""Transformers"" is mostly a visual effects-driven film. The focus of ""Transformers"" is on special effects-laden action rather than story telling. With the rare action pause, the film begins to lull due to a lack of substance to fill in the gaps.""Transformers"" is a film that is a bit of a mixed bag. It is a mix of good and bad for me. There are a few highlights, such as the spectacular CGI utilized to construct the Transformers and John Turturro's appearance. However, for the most part, it's a superficial film with no engaging plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robots in Disguise,"The cartoon series of many young men childhood finally made it to the big screen and my God was it entertaining. Transformers has a simple premise, two giant robot factions, the Auto bots and the Deceptions who were in the middle of a Civil War on their own planet and after it ends up being destroyed, continue their fight on Earth. The television series was really a marketing top to sell the toys, but to children we didn't care and it continued to other franchises like GI Joe, He-Man and Pokemon.The plot of the film focuses on Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenage American student who happens to be selling some of his great grandfather's stuff on the eBay. He just brought his first car, a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro. But just happens to be to have brought a transformer. On the other side of the world the Deceptions start their war against humanity, attacking an American base in Qatar to access American military information. Their discover that Sam Witwicky's eBay may be of value to him, and the young man is thrown in the middle of the war, with Autobots coming to Earth to protect and Sam, and find the AllSpark that could bring life back to their home planet. At the same time is a sub-plot with Sam and his love interest Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox). Sam is the school geek, whilst Mikaela the hotty that everyone wants to be with, but has a macho side to her. As the film progresses their friendship grows.Now that plot is paper thin, there is not hiding the fact. But the Cartoon was never that deep on plot anyway. The target audience for the film was always going to be teenage boys and young men, all they wanted to see was robots beating the hell out of each other and seeing Megan Fox doing some poll-dancing would have been a bonus. The film was too long, and should have cut at least 20 minutes. It takes too long to see the Autobots. The action is excellent. Michael Bay is a expert on bombastic action. He was a sound choice and combine military action, and giant robots and CGI to great effect. This was also the biggest film the American military got involved with since Black Hawk Down, which was good for the military, but made Transformers a jingoistic film. It was also a irony in the cartoon that the Deceptions happen to be military vechiles, whilst the Autobots were mostly sports cars. I do wonder what the film would have been like if someone like Spielberg, J.J. Abrams or Zack Synder directed, but Transformers is Bay best film so far. As well as action, there is comedy, some hit, some miss, but it has a good in-joke to one of Bay's previous film.The acting is standard. LeBeouf and Megan Fox have done alright for themselves after their work on television. Who really wins out is Peter Cullen who reprises his role as Optimus Prime. You got to love his voice and their is nothing more awe inspiring then seeing Optimus first scene.Other issues with the film is that there are too many characters, both human and Tranformers, which makes you lack caring for some of them or wondering where some people have come from. Some characters should have been cut or reduced, especially the Peneagon staff. Also their is too much product placement, the film was a giant ad for eBay and the car companies. It's ruins the film and should have been done in a more subtle manner. Also it ruined some Transformers like Jazz who was a Porsche in the cartoon, but a Pontiac Solstice in the film.But with all the issues aside, Transformers is a fun action blockbuster, and it sequel looks promising. Let's hope it's as good or even better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Stunning,"Transformers: a humble children's toy. Transformers: a cartoon show. Transformers: one of the greatest theater experiences I have ever had. When I heard that they were making a Transformers movie, I thought the same thing that I thought about a lot of other recent movies: What the heck are they doing wasting their time with this movie? Then I saw the trailer and I changed my mind. I knew I had to see this movie when I saw a jet plane fly under a bridge, transform, grab onto the bridge, and throw itself into the air. I went to see this with my friend who had already seen it two times.I truly was amazed. Though the story line was a little shaky and the shots were a little confusing, they were outweighed by the best special effects I had ever seen and the most edge-of-your seat action I had ever witnessed. In addition to Transformers becoming the coolest-looking movie I had ever seen, it was one of the funniest also, which was a big surprise.Sure there were some plot holes and sure this movie was completely unrealistic, but its lack of realism made it that much more believable.

"Visually stunning, but with no plot, its nothing","This critically acclaimed fantasy action film from director Michael Bay brings special graphics to a new level with visually stunning scenes involving transforming robots who have arrived on earth in order to settle a dispute. It's the Autobots and Decepticons who have crash-landed and are here to fight for what is theirs.Unfortunately as good and as impressive as the graphics are, the 2007 summer hit fails to capitalise on its effects with a thin plot and exceptionally poor dialogue. Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) gives an average performance as the geeky teenager who wants to impress the attractive Megan Fox, but both are soon wrapped up in the robot war.It's a film which dollops a heavy amount of information about another world on top of you with no depth and feeling to it. Jokes are predictable and the Autobots can be very childish and annoying at frequent points. The ending is ridiculous as its one of those lets all unite and fight and save the day scenarios.The film however gets to an interesting start with mystery and a new look on the Sci-Fi genre with the robots coming from another planet and all that but like so many other films these days, focuses too much upon the graphics and not enough depth to the plot to make it a poor and predictable fantasy action film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent movie,"This movie was genuinely fantastic.

Considering the timeframe, they had a solid amount of depth.Visually, this movie was INCREDIBLE. For being 17 years old, I absolutely cannot believe the level of CGI.

Nope.,"This a film where the parts are not worth the sum of the whole. You don't see the Autobots until 1hr. into the film. It has a whole host of highly unnecessary sub plots, and the acting is atrocious on almost all counts (except for Michael O Neill who is quite believable, but seems to be in another film altogether). Shia Laboeuf comes off as a dumb version of Woody Allen's neurotic character, what with the stuttering and panicking. The character doesn't fit at all, although I'm sure he tried.There are plot holes and character deficiencies the size of meteors. The robots are outside the Witwicky residence 5 ft through open windows away from people. No one hears them talking. It turns from day to night in the beginning battle in about 20 seconds. The defence and phone network for the entire planet is knocked out, which would cause panic - yet nothing is mentioned. Where do the robots get their ammunition from? I am a kid who grew up with the Transformers in the 1980's, and from then until now have also been a way great movie fan. This film betrays the both of my childhood joys. I don't mind the fact that the robots were changed for the movie. Their designs are easily the best thing about the film. I don't even think Michael Bay is entirely to blame for this fiasco. Its the guys who wrote it. The subject has a fully formed mythology that could have easily benefited from a proper retelling - instead we are given a teen picture with no cohesive narrative, and no sympathetic characters...Nope - this is a screw up and no mistake. I would hold out hopes for Transformers 2, but I have my doubts unless someone pulls a Godfather style sequel to this dirge. Giving it 2 more stars than it desrves because its Transformers.

Awaiting the real 'Transformers the movie',"So I went along last night to see this film. Incidentally, if you can get to see a DLP screening of it, do, the digital projection is awesome.So, I thought the acting was OK, the plot mediocre, but the effects beyond anything I have ever seen.However, as a kid who grew up obsessed with transformers, and would probably be able (I know, I don't need you to tell me how sad I am) to recite the lines of the 1986 movie from heart I've seen it so often, I was disappointed at the god-awful plot and this is the reason for my OK-kinda good score.There is light at the end of the tunnel however.I understand that most people going to see this movie now would not be as familiar with the transformers as I am, and so launching them into the plot of the original movie would be far too complex and confuse too many people.I have a theory, or rather a theory borne on a wish. I am hoping, taking a long view of this, that these transformers movies will end up being a trilogy, with the last movie being the re-make that I would so love to see.The best thing about this theory is that the plot and some of the dialogue is already written, you just need to update it, take out the original jokes and replace them, and (sadly - I don't want to say this) replace the 80's cock-rock soundtrack with whatever today's equivalent is, and you've got yourself one fine movie.So if it happens - you heard it here first!

Their War. Our world.,"The partnership between Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay to bring the intergalactic struggle between the noble Autobots and Decepticons to life, in metal and CGIs on the big screen, could only be epic.It also reveals Megan Fox, whom Michael Bay films with passion.

Beyond Brainless but Mostly Good Fun,"Let's face it, when working for Steven Spielberg, Michael Bay could make an entertaining movie about a guy peeling a potato. We're into some serious trade-craft with these guys. From effects to casting to pacing -- as something to take your mind off your troubles for a couple hours, you could do a lot worse than this spectacle based on a children's TV show.The new Michael Bay film ""Transformers"" chronicles the adventures of a race of alien mechanical lifeforms and their human allies as they seek to deprive less enlightened Transformers of control over a magic cube that can turn a toaster into a terminator. Sound stupid? Oh, you bet it is.But when a Blackhawk helicopter lands at a U.S. military base and then ""transforms"" into a giant lumbering robot that lays waste to everything in its path, with effects so realistic as to be eye-popping, the menace was palpable and frightening.Along the way we get your standard boy-and-his-dog, boy-and-his-Camaro, come-from-behind Woody-Allenesque tale of some dippy nerd who manages to woo the hottest hottie away from the football jock in an earnest v. yearnless 2-scene battle of puny proportions a la every Hollywood script ever written.But if you pair your giant killer robots up with an absurdly appealing Megan Fox as the hottie in question, you are gonna have a hard time making a movie 99 out of a hundred American men are not going to enjoy. And goofy though it was, I'd have to count myself among the 99. It was a good time at the movies and there's just no two ways about it.Here's a few things I think they could have done differently:First, the volume and mass of the robots seems off when they ""transform"" into vehicles and back again. When they're robots they seem much bigger than the vehicles they can turn into. If you stood a Camaro on end and give it some legs, it seems you'd only achieve half the height of the robot we're seeing. But I'm probably just being picky.Second, I understand it's desirable to have expressive faces of some kind, but if these alien creatures can morph into roughly any manufactured piece of equipment, wouldn't they just grow speakers instead of anthropomorphic mouths with which to speak? Just splitting hairs, here.Third, the processes and scope of evolution are probably far vaster than even our smartest smart guys can fathom but it seems HIGHLY dubious that a race of machines could evolve without, presumably, the impetus of some organic life form initiating it. But hey, I guess in a nearly infinite universe, the possibilities are similarly infinite.And last but not least, these machine warriors, sadly, are probably playing heroes to a segment of the U.S. population's children growing up without a lot of moral or intellectual curiosity around them. These kids will grow up asking themselves what would ""Optimus Prime"" do when Billy from the trailer next door steals my Slurpee at the NASCAR trials. You know, when dad's passed out on Meth and mom's working her third job, kids face these dilemmas. And this is why you have to be careful with what you show these potential heroes doing and how they treat their enemies.And THIS is why you probably don't want to include a scene in which, after subduing a group of humans, a giant robot pees on one of them by way of compelling cooperation. And though it's played for laughs, like it or not, this is a real way the coarsening of our culture happens -- one mean-spirited movie scene played-for-laughs at a time. It's funny when it happens to a bad guy in the movies. It's not so funny when you're being mugged or car-jacked and the perpetrator decides he'll throw in an homage to the latest Transformers film and starts unzipping his fly. State Farm can replace your Lexus, but not your dignity. Spielberg oughta know better.Did I mention the movie has Megan Fox?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Looks incredible and has it's moments,"I am not sure how deep exactly a director is involved in the technical production of a movie of this scope, but whether it's him, whether it's the people working with him, someone on Bay's sets knows how to assure production quality. I usually do not give too much credit for how a movie generally looks and is made, as stuff for this can be learned and bought. But in this special case production value is so incredibly high that it emerges from its original place and becomes a separate art form. One might take stuff like this for granted, but just freeze the movie for a moment and try to sum up how many people have been working for countless hour on that frame to make it look like it does now, meaning not just the action parts but even the most simple scenes. Fortunately, all this reaches it's climax when it comes to the robots as the CGI applied here is just staggering. I recommend the biggest screen available to you, as the level of detail is mind blowing and has to be presented in the highest resolution possible for you to be able to get just a part of what is happening all together. Also, this provides the movie with a pretty high re-watch value, the scenes featuring the Transformers can be rewinded several times to discover new things happening on the screen every time.Now while the rest is pretty forgettable I must admit, it kind of works for most of the time. Shia LeBoef might not be academy material, but the way he seems to be on drugs for the majority of the movie is kind of entertaining. Ms.Fox doesn't need to do anything for me, I'd give her any award she likes. The Bay-specific humor deliberately smashed in to make this family friendly borders at slapstick at times but I admit actually having fun with it now and then. Also it's full of plot holes and banal script writing mistakes but then again it has Megan Fox's ass.Now Undoubtedly this is a Michael Bay vehicle and all this by itself could still be unwatchable, but the thing is, there are some unexpectedly good scenes and moments. I wouldn't have dared to hope for anything as dark and thrilling as the first scene with the decepticon attacking the military base, which was a genuine cinema moment for me, something I thought would have been extinguished by know. And though the movie never goes there again, with a few other moments and the transformation effects and Megan Fox's legs I am willing to forgive a lot of crap here. Even some of the stupid things that are severely effecting the movies quality which could have been easily avoided.So the movie is called Transformers and this is exactly what you get and technically produced in the most awesome way imaginable. The rest, while banal at times is actually entertaining, so you know... whatever... for what it is: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disturbing Pro-War Propaganda Disturbs otherwise Harmless Action Flick,"I was ready to switch my brain off walking into the theatre, especially when it comes to Michael Bay. But what bothered me were the obvious pro-Iraq war messages being delivered front and centre. A lot of current events involving world affairs play a part in the story. Why? This is a dumb movie based on a kids toy. That's what's disturbing. The pro-Military message: ""We are in for the long fight"", (like Bush's perpetual War Against Terror) is being drilled directly into young teenagers heads. For the sake of the Transformers legend (Good robots battle Bad robots over Energy Cube) there isn't much need to bring Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bush, and Rumsfeld (played by Jon Voight). Worse, there is the heavy line at the pinnacle of the movie, where our hero says ""No Sacrifice, No Victory"". Pick up your Army brochures in the lobby.The film gets off to a disturbing start, with an all too familiar site of US soldiers (and civilians) fighting and dying in the middle east. What is this scene doing in a kids Transformer movie? There are also jabs at outsourcing in India, immigrants speaking Spanish, and clichés about African-Americans. Technically, there was too much reliance on CGI to wow you at the end. Unfortunately, Michael Bay's patented moving camera shots left me feeling a little dizzy, and mostly unable to get a good angle on the robot fights. Seriously, when you cut from a tracking shot straight to another tracking shot, you need to be able to get your bearings. But no, you cut away too quickly for anything to register. This carries on at the end for way too long. There are really so many wow shots one can handle in succession to have any real appreciation for the peril that anyone might be in.It is really too bad this all falls apart in the third act, because I could feel the Spielberg influence in Shia LaBeouf's character, and could dig the Boy and his Car subtext. I also applaud the over-the-top attitude about how the robots behave. This is the first American movie that has really embraced the kooky Japanese MechaGodzilla type of nonsense. This comes complete with a clueless military, two kids that always hold the key to everything, and kid-friendly heroes. Michael Bay has no idea how to make a proper film, having directed 1000's of TV commercials. At least there was some decent story elements that entertained me most of the time. But Bay will never get any legitimate credibility as long as he literally has no ideas beyond - keep the camera moving.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Megan Fox is pretty hot, thanks to her the film gets 1 star","I don't hate Michael Bay, or Spielberg, or any of the money hungry ignorant contributers to this film. I do however resent being made physically ill. The acting, the script, and especially the music... it all made me feel violated in some way. Imagine throwing up blood in the shower, that's where this film takes you, it's a special place.It's poor at best. I went to the cinema expecting the worst, in hope that i wouldn't hate it as much after I'd seen it. The truth is, it's really, really, really, really, bad. An insult to anything cool, cultural, imaginative and honest. I am extremely disappointed that the original concept, story and characters were butchered with total disregard, but putting that aside (and i really tried), it is a genuinely bad film.Don't watch it. The people giving this film a positive review must like really shiny things, poorly timed and arranged music that doesn't fit the images, and thin plots riddled with faults. Action films are fine, this is a cringing attempt at a Disney-esquire, teen romance, sci-fi flick that fails everywhere. The 5 year old in front of me seemed to enjoy it, but maybe he likes shiny things too.By the way, Optimus Prime is the hero, not some kid called Sam.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Bay should never be allowed to make movies,"So, i saw Transformers last night. I went in armed only with fond, if vague memories of the cartoon when I was 5, but left sorely disappointed. The single thought I had most throughout the film was, what was the point in that? And I don't mean in the sense of over-the-top fights or visuals or anything, i mean in the sense of scenes and dialogue which either serves no purpose or leaves you cringing in your seat. For example - a hacker who is supposedly better than the Pentagon and NSA combined decides to 'hotwire' a computer. Or, witness the clumsiest attempt at political satire I have ever witnessed - the President with his feet on the desk in red socks asking for a ding-dong, or the shady official betting his 'ridiculously-oversized government salary' on it. There were some plus points about this film. The acting, in particular Shia LeBouef (sp?), was pretty good, while the VFX were simply stunning, easily the best I've seen. The combat sequences were also pretty good overall. But Michael Bay is simply the most inept filmmaker in the world; nay, in history. OK, maybe Im being a little strong but the whole film from start to finish just felt disjointed, as if he didn't really know what he was doing. He has succeeded in wasting a decent script, a good cast, and some breathtaking effects - it beggars belief that Steven Spielberg didn't either rectify things, or pull out. A waste of potential, and a big disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Actually quite enjoyable,"I don't normally like this genre of film, but found this one enjoyable.

ALMOST very well done!,"I'm going to do what few have done--I'm going to review the movie, not the director, or the plot holes, or the fact that it's derived from an 80's cartoon genre. I'm going to review THIS MOVIE!The good -- The CGI, fight scenes, and transformations were beautiful. You truly believe that huge robots are turning into vehicles and back again. During the fight scenes, the robots interact seamlessly with their environment. The human acting wasn't too bad either. All the MAIN human characters did well overall and were developed well. They also responded well to the robots who wouldn't ""be there"" during filming.The bad -- All PURPOSEFUL attempts at humor were freaking awful! I moaned much more than I laughed, it was really pathetic, so don't watch this movie for any comedy relief. There were some funny moments, but they were more accidental than planned. My biggest complaint is that, aside from Prime (played PERFECTLY by the great Peter Cullen), none of the other robots had much of a chance to either speak or show their personality other than their endless butt-kicking. I know it was 2 1/2 hrs, but more could have been done to show the personality of the robots other than Prime.Summation -- The humans were there for acting and the robots for fighting. If you see this movie expect something like Starship Troopers, only this time some of the bugs are on our side. My opinion is, if the personalities of the robots would have been taken 1/2 as seriously as the people, this movie would have been excellent. Next time they should let the voice actors develop their characters before making the second movie, then they can have more lines for the robots. Only expect a good performance from Prime, all other characters were wooden and underdeveloped.7/10 for a good effort, it's worth seeing ONCE just for the action. If you're not into huge, beautifully detailed, sentient robots beating each other senseless, it's NOT for you. And no, you don't have to have seen the 80's cartoon to enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Nearly 10 years later, still the best live action version of TF.","When Transformers first came out nearly 10 years ago during the 4th of July weekend, no one excepted it to be as big as it is today, although the hype has kinda slowed down a bit due to other big movies and the rise of the Superhero genre. This movie introduced Megan Fox to the male masses and showed how tough Shia LeBouf can be after his debut in Holes. I'm glad they used Peter Cullen's voice as Optimus Prime and the detail to the robots and the sound effects is pure magic. The music is well done, and the plot is simple: Autobots vs Decepticons for possession of the ALl Spark, a mysterious object that is lost in time. I first saw it in theaters and liked it a lot. The sequels, especially the second one, lacked the imagination and humor of the first one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well, it could have been worse...","I'm a Transformers fan from way back. That immediately puts me in an awkward position for judging the new film - no matter what, I'm going to hold it up against the almost mythic standard of the old series as seen through the eyes of an adoring child. But considering that the film was obviously meant to cash in on that glassy-eyed nostalgia, I think it's a fair trade.So here we go. The Transformers did not, as feared, look hideously deranged or disfigured. They weren't quite the boxy and familiar-faced robots of memory, but they were mostly recognizable. Colours were toned down, which is good in that some Transformers had some truly hideous combinations, but also bad in that it meant I often had to hazard vague guesses as to who was doing what. The Decepticons were very non-entity villains, which was disappointing, and I often found myself confusedly scratching my head and wondering where Starscream's wealth of personality was.The biggest strike against the film was probably the amount of time spent with the 'fleshlings'. It wasn't even done very coherently. Scenes would change with all the fluidity of an unexpected bus stop, or else drag on to the point where I found myself wishing an Autobot would accidentally trip and squish them all. I felt like I was being ripped off during those scenes - after all, I didn't fork out my cash to watch an awkward teenage romance, a stirring tale about the bond between American soldiers, or some dull government drama. I paid to see the giant robots! And not only see them (or the occasional glimpse of them between the indecipherable transformation scenes and the large explosions) but to hear them, too. One of the appeals of Transformers in my opinion was that it didn't star the humans. This movie has it pretty much reversed.Still, that's not to say that the movie was all bad. A lot of it was helped along by having Optimus' original voice actor, and some things, like Bumblebee's personality, were quite accurate. The special effects and explosions were cool, but they mostly are these days, so that doesn't really count for much with me anymore. When I heard how much time they spent on getting the complicated new designs for the Autobots and Decepticons to transform, I found myself wondering why they didn't just go with something simpler that would have allowed for more screen-time with them. It's not like their efforts yielded the result of more spectacular transformations. The sequences were almost impossible to decipher, and frankly the new designs had an exposed look to them that made me think they'd all run out half-dressed.There are a few factors that stand in the movie's favor. Seeing the Autobots in live-action was very cool, and the Decepticons were appropriately frightening in their aggressiveness and disregard for human life. I found myself drinking in the scenes that actually did contain Transformers, and while most of the jokes were cheesy, there were a few funny moments that had me genuinely amused. The film managed to evoke my worry for the well-being of its non-human stars, and there was nothing particularly offensive to old-time fans. I give it a 5/10, half points for having cool Transformers but very annoying humans.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent!,"I thought this movie was very entertaining in many ways. It brought back many good memories from the transformers cartoon from my childhood. The movie is very well done in terms of acting, plot, action sequences, and special effects. It has a great combination of action, humor, tragedy,and suspense from start to finish. The choice of cars for each Autobot as well as the vehicles chosen for the Decepticons was perfect. This is a true clash between good versus evil. I loved hearing Peter Cullen perform the voice of Optimus Prime once again! I also believe Shia Lebouf did a great job as well. If you desire to see an excellent action-packed movie (even if you are not a transformers fan), then definitely see this movie. Great job Michael Bay on a work of excellence!

A garbage can in a blender with the lid off.,"Why are they pushing me to get horny for a 16 year old? What the heck was that movie about? Why is ALL the physics so wrong? You can stand a fall from space but not (relatively) minor temperature or pressure fluctuations? You are light as a feather until you transform, when you can break asphalt with your footsteps? ALL the dialog is that rapid fire whining, typical of a Woody Allen movie. Most of all, when the action was happening, who was the bad guys and who was the good guys?

Action packed! Truly a Michael Bay film =],"Most people attend the movie theater to shut down their minds, becoming immersed in the diegesis of the film being viewed. This by all means is fine, as movies are made as an escape from reality. Transformers (2007) is a wonderful example of this as we are thrown into the plot, and forced to walk in the shoes of the characters. It's the director's job to captivate his/her audience, and Michael Bay definitely achieves this task.Michael Bay's directorial style in itself is what keeps his audience wide eyed and locked on the screen. Bay is an auteur, his style and personality reflected in all his films. Bay's style is very bold and his own, it's either you like it or you don't. Michael Bay's directorial style is fast edits and visually based (special effects). Having seen a few of Michael Bay's films, such as Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001), Transformers (2007), The Unborn (2009), Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), I Am Number Four (2011) and Transformers: Dark of The Moon (2011), I have come to know Bay on a deeper, more personal level. Many of his films' genres are action, thriller and sci-fi, resulting in his trademark of numerous fast cuts and visually captivating effects. Transformers (2007) reflects Michael Bay's style in regards to its various action scenes, specifically the intense battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons. With Bay you get the full works: explosions, collisions, weapons, and simply everything action. One action packed scene would be the final battle in the city with all the robots.Elements such as the film's cinematography, editing, sound effects and the film's overall style reflects Bay's artistic style. Bay's camera angles and movements are very dynamic, for example his use of canted angles and high/low angles. A crucial aspect of Transformers cinematography would be the special effects, especially computer graphics in creating the robots and bullet time during action scenes. Two examples of bullet time effect would be when 1) Bonecrusher charged at Optimus on the highway scene and 2) In the city scene when Ironhide propelled himself upward to dodge two missiles. The editing in Transformers, as present in most of Bay's films, consists of fast cuts galore. Bay's editing style is ""BAM! Look here! BAM! Look over there! BAM! What's that?!"" There is no slowing down in pace and therefore no room for thinking, just pure entertainment. Most of Bay's sound effects comprise of non-diegetic mood music and sound effects. The mood music is usually suspenseful, intense and/or exciting, paralleling the incredible visual effect. Sound effects are especially used in the action scenes, (the explosions, collisions, etc) and also in regards to the transformation of the robots.In regards to Bay's other films Transformers is similar in the fact that it's high energy and has stunning visuals. Though his films may not be visionary and plot oriented Bay gives the audience what they want, entertainment. A particular scene that portrays the strongest impression of Bay's personality would have to be the final battle scene in the city between the Autobots and Decepticons. This scene has everything an action scene should have and that's exactly why it reflects Bay. Bay is not a slow paced, quiet guy, but innovative and bursting of energy. A quote by the actor Ben Affleck, who starred in both Armageddon and Pearl Harbor states, ""I think Michael is actually an auteur in the true sense of the word. Every movie he makes reflects his personal creative vision. You may like it, you may not—but those movies are him without compromise. There's something to be said for sticking to your guns.""Transformers does not suggest any type of growth in a new direction away from his other films. Bay's films are what they are and cannot be recreated. Either you hate or love Michael Bay's directorial style, and I love it. It's enjoyable, entertaining and visually captivating, everything a movie should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Pretty good as far as ""action blockbusters featuring giant robots"" go","Transformers (2007) is a sci-fi action flick directed by Michael Bay, produced by Steven Spielberg and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It's based on the popular action toy line from Hasbro. It stars Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox in the leading human roles and also features Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving in supporting voice roles. It got mixed to positive response from critics but was otherwise a huge hit with audiences and a massive box office success. It spawned a movie franchise consisting of four sequels and a couple of spin-off prequels.The plot focuses on a war between two clans of sentient mechanical beings, the Autobots and the Decepticons, from the planet Cybertron. The war is centered on the Allspark, an ancient mysterious cube that has the power to bring inanimate technology to life but can also bring an end to it as well as humanity if fallen into the wrong hands. Young teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) gets caught in this conflict due to being in possession of an old pair of eyeglasses (which belonged do his great great grandfather) that have coordinates to the Allspark. This leads to Sam being hunted down and chased by the Decepticons as they want the Allspark to take over the universe. Sam meets and befriends the Autobots and together they come up with a plan to fight off the Decepticons and save the world.We have a set of different characters. I mentioned the protagonist, Sam Witwicky. There's Sam's love interest Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), who knows a lot about cars due to her dad being a mechanic (or as she puts it, a ""real grease monkey"") as well as a convicted car thief. She previously dated a jock bully whom she later dumped, and she and Sam develop a dynamic over the course of the film. Mikaela's car theft skills come in handy throughout the movie as she assists Sam on his mission.Sam's parents, Ron and Judy Witwicky are the human comic relief. Now we've got the Autobots. Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is the leader of the Autobots and can transform into a semi-trailer (Optimus Prime resembles his original action figure counterpart pretty closely, albeit with a more updated look). There's also Bumblebee, who transforms into a Camaro and whom Sam encounters at the used car outlet, the former serving as a guardian to the latter. Bumblebee is unable to speak due to his voice chip being damaged in battle but can use his car radio as an alternate source of communication. He's basically the Iron Giant if the Iron Giant were mute and could turn into a car.We also have Jazz who can turn into a Pontiac, Ratchet who can turn into a Hummer, and Ironhide who's the weapons expert who can turn into a GMC pickup. Then we have the Decepticons who are the bad guys, led by our main antagonist Megatron (Hugo Weaving). Megatron had been frozen for over 70 years and was the one who hatched the plan to get a hold of the AllSpark to take over the universe. After those years, the AllSpark was rediscovered and since then, the other Decepticons, led by second-in-command Starscream, carried on this evil plan, until Megatron is eventually unleashed. That's about the gist of the whole thing.I saw this in theaters when I was 14 and I really enjoyed it. Rewatching it now, I still have a soft spot for this movie. It's a pretty decent sci-fi action flick with some cool action scenes, funny moments and an interesting lore. It basically plays out like Independence Day but with robots. The acting and directing are decent. It's not a perfect movie by any means as the storyline is rather formulaic and there's very little character development. But for what it is, it's quite good.I can't say the same about the sequels. I kind of liked Revenge of the Fallen, but it was a little overstuffed. I didn't like Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction or The Last Knight. I really enjoyed Bumblebee and Rise of the Beasts though (Rise of the Beasts is probably my personal favorite of the Live-action CG Transformers movies). I may review those movies in greater detail, but I wanted to focus primarily on the first one. All in all, Transformers (2007) is pretty good, as far as big budget blockbusters featuring giant robots go.I give Transformers (2007) a solid 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Confused direction...some what disappointing,"I didn't really think much of this film when i saw it on adverts etc... but for some reason my mum and her boyfriend really wanted to see it, even though apparently i watched the TV series when i was younger.Good Points -Brilliant visual effects, the way the robots transformed was extremely realistic -the sound effects (not music), the metallic sounds really suited the robots obviously and fitted well. -The comedy, Perfectly timed and was extremely funny at times - even with the robots.Bad Points -The Soundtrack, this goes with the confused direction. One moment there was the hard instrumental almost 'patriotic American' drums that you get in some films;which really added to the films serious side. However then there was some rock in it which lightened the film slightly. Yeh some films can switch tones but it really didn't work in this. - Getting back to the directing. Usually with a film you get a gut feeling on how the film will be. This one i just couldn't decide whether it was a serious hardcore action or a child's comedy. The two didn't mix well and Michael bay really didn't do well...and the great Spielberg.I would advise watching this you could like it but it really didn't suite me the too sharp camera angles and the none fitting music just took away the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

When I saw the trailers and posters set up for advertising the film, I though this would just be another summer popcorn movie that's doing its job. I also though it would just be another exhibition of the newest line of special effects available at the department, something that director Michael ""Kaboom"" Bay is more comfortable to make.I stand corrected. While it is silly, dumb and has no ambition to write, TRANSFORMERS works on the levels where it should work. The action keeps viewers on the go, and under the watchful eye of exec. producer Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks crew, TRANSFORMERS has touches of class (a class of its own that is). Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets himself involved into a plot to save the world when his ""new"" car turns out to be one of the Autobots, a race of machines set to save the earth from their enemies, the Decepticons. They're also in search of an object called the Allspark, also known as ""The Cube"" before the Decepticons rest their dirty hands on them, therefore fulfilling their plans for intergalactic supremacy. Along the way, the film juices up a few subplots including Sam flirting with the hottest chick in his school, played by model/actress Megan Fox. There's also subplots concerning a bunch of American soldiers (mainly Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) and their families, but it's rarely exercised and almost utterly forgotten.TRANSFORMERS may not have much of a plot, and if it does, it feels like it's been written by a bunch of kids playing with their Transformers toys. But what's weak in plot is more than made up for pure summer movie entertainment. Bay booms up the sound system, making it quite possibly the loudest summer movie since Bay's own films like THE ROCK and BAD BOYS. The special effects are triumphant creations, making the famous gang of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee and the lot far beyond their plastic toy origins. Every single rust and scratch is captured by the film's creative and industrious effects crew. The fights scenes, most especially during the early moments of the film are especially exciting. The problem that lies on its never-lacking amount of action is that in almost overstays its welcome. The film runs at about 144 minutes tops (that's more than 2 hours!), much too long for a movie that doesn't intend to make much sense. The film could have cut at least 30 minutes or so of special effects and have nothing to risk losing.Still, while surely not free of its flaws, TRANSFORMERS is everything you can ask for in a summer action entertainment. It may not offer anything more in bargain, but it deserves much credit for offering one of the better times I've experienced at the movies during the year.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lame.,"I was really disappointed by this movie. A large part of it is because I brought my 9 year old son. Transformers were originally for 9-year-olds, so I figured he would like it. He even has a collection of transformers. At any rate, the sexual content in the movie alienated him and diminished his enjoyment of the movie. I guess they only care about the people who were 9 ten years ago.I found the movie really lacking in key areas such as writing and acting. The dialog was terrible. The special effects were about the only thing that were good. I have no idea how something like this gets an 8.2 average rating, except hyped teens remembering how much fun their transformer fantasy play was. It certainly doesn't represent the quality (or lack) of the movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
slight disappointment,"i had high expectations of this movie, but its been somewhat of a disappointment, first of all the movie's pace is somewhat slow the first half of the movie. The plot is too standard in my opinion and predictable at times though the story did have some good parts in it. I didn't buy the Glasses idea, i think they could have come up with something way better as the same device. most of the dialog of the robots i found to be really uncreative especially the cheesy lines of megatron and optimus prime towards the end could have been better. The plot seemed to focus a lot on the human characters with not enough focus on the transformers themselves and their backstory.the ending was good though as well as the CGI and it was funny at times, i just wish there had been more action and less drama.all in all its a reasonably good movie but don't expect to see a great movie you would want to watch more then once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Congratulations Mr. Bay,"Through observation, it seems the modern summer moviegoer doesn't care about corny dialouge and mediocre acting, but only about being being thrilled and entertained and being blown away by extravagant special effects. In this case, Michael Bay has created the perfect summer movie. He doesn't let one moment get boring, and even though I have never been a transformers fan, I couldn't help but be thrilled when a blue and red truck transformed and uttered the words ""I am Optimus Prime."" The action sequences are breathtaking and the final half an hour does not disappoint.

Best Soundtrack ever!,"I am really ashamed I have not seen this movie in the theater, I thought of this movie first as of something with childish robots shaped in cool cars. Well I have to disagree with my first opinion of the movie. When I watched this movie, I was astonished of the good effects, the humor, the dialogs, the action - and above all the soundtracks, made by Steve Jablonsky. It all sounds a bit like Hans Zimmer, though Steve has some incredible Cello-tunes in his song, especially in the song called ""arrival to earth"".

If they were going to spend the whole budget on just effects then they should have really been more impressive then they were.

"TRANSFORMERS (Michael Bay, 2007) ***","Being familiar with the original cartoon series of the 1980s, I was interested in catching the Hollywood live action blockbuster version. Basically, this turns out to be a combination of THE TERMINATOR (1984), INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) and even BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001). As was to be expected for a modern day popcorn flick, teenagers are involved but, luckily, the two leads (despite their anonymity to the undersigned) were unusually affectingalthough, in the second half of the show, they too are eventually sidetracked by all the spectacle.Surprisingly enough, the villainous Decepticons are severely underused and their leader Megatron himself doesn't appear until the last half-hour or so! In fact, the most notable of the evil machines is a new addition to the fold – a hacker robot who grunts and gesticulates like a Gremlin! Also unexpected is the film's comic highlight set in the hero's backyard which sees the benign Autobots attempting to hide from the latter's overly inquisitive parents.For all the spectacular CGI-infested action sequences, the look of the machines themselves is rather cluttered – would we have been as impressed with the original King Kong if we couldn't see the mechanism at work? – and the fast and furious pace of the action sequences becomes numbing after a while: imagine the chariot race in BEN-HUR (1959) where the crucial antagonism between him and Messala is all but lost in the shuffle! Also, aren't we all tired by now to see every disaster to hit the planet nowadays being given the paranoid 9/11 spin – with the resulting affirmation of the ingenuity and superiority of the U.S. Defense system (even if they require the services of the world's top teenage hackers to crack the alien code)?Anyway, this is not a film to break down and analyze but one to take your breath away with awesome special effects and, in this regards, it succeeds well enough; for what it's worth, the human cast, apart from the afore-mentioned teenage leads, includes Jon Voight as the Secretary of Defence and John Turturro as an oddball member of a mysterious government agency.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Transformers- One of the best, but not without it's flaws","Okay, this is my first review on this site so I'm going to warn you. This is not perfect, there will be some mistakes seeing that I'm only 14 years old. That is all, no lets get to the review.I first heard about the movie a couple of months beforehand. But before then, I had only seen the original movie and enjoyed it. I wanted to see the movie and when I finally did sometime near the end of July/beginning of August. I had one of the best times of my life. My mom did too (We went on her birthday) and I only have one thing to say about it- WOW! Now let's get to the review shall we?PLOT: The plot is pretty good, but for the series, it's straightforward- Robots come to Earth, Some humans befriend the good ones, the good bots (The Autobots) fight against the villains (The Decepticons). That pretty much it, but there are some thing that are added in,. For example, Megatron came first and got frozen, The villains free him and they go all Godzilla like on the Autobots for the All-Spark, destroying most of a city in the process. score-8.5/10 (If it wasn't the same formula that it was in all of the other series, I'd have given it a 9.5)Casting: The cast was pretty good, It's a shame though that they used a new voice for Megatron (Hugo Weaving) instead of his old one. My other gripes are that no one understands what the heck Bonecrusher (Jimmie Wood) is even saying and couldn't they have gotten Keith David to do Barricade in the movie instead, that peed off many fans. The score for the cast- 9/10(I'd given this a perfect score if it wasn't for those problems)SFX: This is where the movie shines, ILM has outdone themselves again. providing the majority of the CGI in the movie, there were also some props in the movie portraying the robots (Provided by KNB Effects and ILM-they did the Skorponok props, the head and tail in other words). My only gripe is the fact that the girl doesn't get any water on her when Ironhide (Jess Harnell) comes out of the pool. My score is 10/10 for these effects, they pulled them off nicely.Overall: This move is a must see for TF fans as I myself enjoyed it (and I'm one too). But I have one question, why do so many people bash this movie anyways-9.9 out of a perfect 10.Phil MacRae- Self appointed fan of Soundwave (I'm adding fun signatures at the end of my reviews just to tell you).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I wasn't sure how to rate this one.,"My children (12, 7, 6, 6, 3) received this movie recently from a grandparent. I had heard it was not a kid-friendly movie (language, violence, sex), so I was wanted to return it to the local Wal-Mart and get something else. At the insistence of my mother-in-law that it was an okay movie and much begging from my children, I agreed to preview the movie. I watched it Friday. My wife had no intention of watching the movie but got sucked into watching it.I must admit, that it is a well-make action film. The graphics are good, the script (while goofy) is engaging, and Shia Labeouf did a very nice job. Even my wife ended up enjoying the movie.But here is my problem: It is not a kids' movie! It is very violent, the language - though I have heard worse - is harsh, and there is too much overt sexual content. I am disgusted that this movie was marketed to children - as evidenced by the requisite happy meal and toy tie-ins.I ended up rating this movie a 7, because it was engaging.

S10 Review's Transformers (2007),"Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up to bring the popular cartoon and toy series to a live action film. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) is your typical teen: trying to get the money to get the car and the girl. His father agrees to help him out with the car and after grabbing a slightly beat up Camero, Sam's well on his way. After several weird incidents it becomes apparent there more to the car than meets the eye. It turns out that Sam has an intricate piece for a puzzle that brings a group of Autobots (robotic shape-shifting beings) to Earth. Lead by Optimus Prime, the Autobots must find the all-spark cube to restore life to their destroyed home of Cybertron. But the evil Decepticons led by Megatron want it for themselves and will destroy any city to get it.Pure popcorn fodder 'Transformers' could be nit-picked until the cash cows come home. This one has it all: silly script, annoying comedy relief, over blown CGI. You name it and it's here. But that's beside the point isn't it? What you want is robot-on-robot action tearing up the landscape. You do get a generous helping of it here with Bay's usual over-the-top MTV styling. The story does lag at times and only really works when the 'Tranformers' are on screen but again that's typical. The end result is a film that works perfectly for the little boy that lives inside many of us and that's about all you can hope for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Michael Bay is a blockbuster genius,"Transformers 2 does exactly what most fans go to see it for, it pits robot against robot on the big screen. It's an all-action explosion fest, directed by the king of over the top summer blockbusters, that turn out to be a funny, action packed flick. The CGI through out the film is top notch, one of best examples in the sci-fi genre in my opinion. the storyline, although has been largely set out for the writers due to the movie being based on a comic book series, is good quality and perfect for this type of summer blockbuster. uncomplicated, humorous and action-filled. Scenes between Meg Fox and Shia Le beuf are acted with affection and this clearly shows on screen, again, we haven't paid money to see a RomCom so the number of intimate scenes are adequate for the genre. The whole Transformers experience boils down to one thing, at the end of the day, visiting the cinema to see giant robots kick the C**p out of each other, and that they do in style. Michael Bay's portrayal of the epic battles that take place are well put together and give the audience what they are asking for. Overall this is a great movie, not there to grip the audience with a compelling storyline that deals with deep human emotion, one that shows of the wonders of CGI and gives us an epic war between giant robots. Michael Bay is a great director for the genre, and will no doubt keep making them in the future, and as much as everyone will slag him and transformers off, let's see how many of you are there to see the next one aye?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"17 Years Later, Still More Than Meets The Eye.","My family and I rewatched this film last night with nothing else to do. The experience very much holds up 17 years after first watching it in theaters as a summer blockbuster. Transformers was always set up to just be a explosive time killer. But the cast is full of some great performances. Shia LeBeouf had some good credits before 2007, but time has shown him to be one of the most capable actors of his generation. I'm not trying to say anyone was robbed of an Oscar nomination in this film, but an outsized number of cast member's raise the caliber of their characters above the expectations of a movie called Transformers. What sticks out to me most 17 years later is how great of a time capsule this movie is for its time period, 2006-2007. I think this movie has been rightly made fun of or critiqued as one giant advertisement. From the film concept, to the product placement, to Michael Bay's well documented work with the department of defense, Transformers can be called a feature length commercial. That may have turned people off at the time, but I hazard to guess that nature of the film combined with its genuinely good aspects (some characters, some dialogue, CGI) will keep Transformers relevant for longer than anyone would have thought.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I was bored,"This is a great example of a film that suffered at the editor's hands. They could have cut out about 45 minutes and made this a 7 star film. The last half hour, all that ran through my head was, ""C'mon already."" Special effects-- Yes, there are plenty. But the transformations of the transformers, as well as the fight scenes, are all blurred and framed with jittery or unsee-able distances. By the time you see the third transform, you've seen them all. The best scenes, IMO, happened in the first 1/2 hour.Characterization-- For the most part, tedious. You have Hollywood's versions of the typical hormone-packed high school dweeb trying to win the hot chick (played by Shia LaBeouf with no little amount of over-acting). You have his clueless, manipulable, imbecile parents who care mostly about their lawn. You have high ranking befuddled government officials (although Jon Voight does the part as much justice as can be done). You have a super-secret service contingency, filled with unlikeable, smarmy characters (headed by John Turturro who is the most mis-cast in all this movie). On the positive side, Duhamel does a good job maintaining a sense of coherency representing the US fighting soldiers. The highlight was Bernie Mac's cameo as a used-car salesman.Plot-- Plenty of it, with good aliens vs evil aliens, and humans doing their best to help out (although I couldn't help but feel it would have gone better for the good guys if the humans just got out of the way). You can pretty much guess what's going to happen after the first 15 minutes, so you're left to just sit there and watch it unravel, through the thin dialog and in-your-face effects.All in all, got a few smiles and chuckles, but unlike War of the Worlds, I couldn't wait for this film to finally end.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Robot wars,"One of Orson Welles last film roles was The Transformers Movie, an animated film in 1986. It was regarded as a low point to go out on. However in the cinematic world the name Transformers have been transformed thanks to Michael Bay kick starting the franchise and the original is the best so far.Direction wise this has all the Bay trademarks, swirling photography, stirring music and pumping action scenes with state of the art CGI. There is even some sly digs at the all powerful government agencies abusing the extent of their powers.The plot is straightforward. Shia Labeouf is a nerd who buys a car that transforms to a robot, his grandfather once made a discovery and now two gangs of robots are beating the hell out of each other. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are the good guys. The bad guys are the Decepticons and they are after the cube of power called the All Spark.The film is not as flimsy and indulgent as the sequels.

Transformers - Anything but.,"Let's get one thing straight: this movie was dreadful. It's best summed up by this: Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, there to look good in some dramatic pose, extreme lighting, and a disappointing absence of Transformers. All they had to do was make a movie with Transformers fighting each other. Instead, they had to complicate it with technical drivel, completely unnecessary characters, and retarded justification sequences which left you wondering how writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman got through life without getting beat up around every corner. Michael Bay can make an action flick, and that's all he had to do here. Instead, he tried to complicate things. When this is a movie called Transformers and there are hour long gaps between transformer on transformer action, you know you have a real problem.The CG in this movie was amazing... when it was on screen. Literally one hour passed before we saw the first transformer battle (albeit was awesome) and almost another hour before the final sequence. When people say it's a 2 and a half hour trailer for ILM, they are sorely mistaken. This was a 25 minute trailer for ILM pasted into a drearily dull and pointless story. Another problem with the CG was the complication of robot design, coupled with the ambiguity of color and design from all the other robots and a constantly tight camera shot, made it impossible to distinguish between how many transformers were on screen or who was fighting who. Only after the battle do you know who you're rooting for.The script was terrible. The lines were gag-reflex bad, and the story, if observed with any sort of intelligence, was a wasteful tack-on with no thought put in.Also a huge disappointment was the acting. Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, John Turturro- these actors have all shown us some great performances in the past, which only contributes to the argument that this script and direction were atrocious. The delivery on the already poor lines brought me out of the experience every time someone opened there mouth. But the worst part is most of the humans featured in this film didn't even need to exist. The ""new guys"" that were brought in to isolate the hack the stupid monkey terminator (I'll come back to him later) were some of the stiffest acting of this year, and they didn't even need to be there. At all.The absolute worst aspect of the movie was the monkey/boom box transformer. Or so they made him to be. That was no transformer. It was written and animated like a bad droid from Episode 1, and I don't see how anyone could have been fooled by the disguise. His part in the story was far too crucial, and his on-screen time compared to characters Optimus Prime and Megatron was so incredibly disappointing, I thought George Lucas was a pinch director for much of the movie.About the only sight-gag I found to be humorous was a dangling decoration in Bumblebee's car saying ""Bee-otch"". The humor was shallow, and at it's best got me chuckling.It was such a relief after an hour, to see the first real battle, and I was so engaged the moment it happened. The first fight was between Bumblebee as a Camaro, and Barricade as a police interceptor. Though it kind of bothered me that he had such a tricked-out police car, really, it didn't matter. This fight was cool, and actually had worth to it. Likewise, the last 20 minutes of the movie were engaging, and the human aspect went from bad to just okay (a sequence between LaBeouf and Fox was very out-of-no where, but it was totally a Bay moment). When the film's subjects, transformers, were on screen, it was the right movie. Too bad they were only on for about 10% of the time...Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever wanted to walk out in. I didn't care about the story at all, after about 10 minutes, I couldn't even care about sticking around for the action, if it ever came. I also seem to be the only one who feels this way, and I am deeply saddened to all who were brainwashed by Michael Bay and his stranglehold. Please listen to reason, and wait for this to rent. When you only have to spend about a dollar a piece on the thing.A final note, this is not a kids movie, like the new TMNT. If you are looking for a kids movie, turn back now. The story is too convoluted, the action is few and far between, and the subject matter and action are just plain not suited for children.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
...oil can ! ......,"Pretty good yarn with lots of visual and audible stuff going on that you can never really put your finger on. Gears twirl, shafts slide, hinges fold and unfold but you cannot really discern what the heck is happening until the robot actually becomes the vehicle or vice versa. Meanwhile, metallic sounds grind, whirl, sproing and groan during the transformation. It's all pretty good stuff and, I guess, represents the next generation of CGI potential. Shia LeBeouf (?) is very good as the star in this and someone to keep your eye on for future projects. He was amusing as the trash talking kid/friend of Will Smith in ""I, Robot"", and I enjoyed him in that very minor role. ""Transformers"" has hot vehicles and hot girls and is generally appealing. The plot is good and unfolds well. Sound effects are superior and it would be well worth seeing this film in a movie house with a wiz-bang sound system if you DO decide to see it in the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action packed -yes.  good story telling- no =(,"The truth is this film has little to do with the Transformers characters. It's a story about a BOY who befriends the girl of his dreams, and his car happens to be robot! The problem was Hollywood was too afraid to develop ROBOT characters, fearing the audience couldn't relate.It's sad that so many million$$$ were spent and forget about the main characters... and when i say ""main characters"" i ASSUMED it would be the, I dunno, the ""Transformers""???The story had potential, but is lost.The argument that fans are too attached and should accept 20yrs have past, has me wondering: ""If you're not going to make a movie about the Transformers characters (20yrs old), why call the movie TRANSFORMERS?"" It's like having a DaVinci exhibition, and only showing a Boeing 747.Progress is fine, Bumblebee could've been the new VW Beetle, no??? If Megatron can't transform into a hand gun -explain the cube?Spielberg, What happened? You used to make GOOD films. Don't tell me you needed the money? Crap movie, but a good exercise in marketing.This is a brainless movie, sad to say.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
When a childhood dream comes true,"The film may be nearly 18 years old, but it remains highly watchable and arguably the best in the franchise. The Witwicky family dialogue and Agent Simmons still make me laugh to the point of tears. Though the film's length means there isn't a constant stream of action (and some moments of downtime feel prolonged), the action scenes that are present pack a real punch. From the introductory action at the start, you only have to wait three minutes for the first Decepticon rampage. Another favorite of mine is the highway rampage, and of course, the fantastic, epic soundtrack. At the time, I was probably looking forward to the release of Spider-Man movie more than Transformers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So Good!,"Transformers was great! I would have only been 2 when it was first released, and even when I was 9, I didn't really like Transformers. I watched it with my cousin and thought it was okay. I told my parents about it, and then we just forgot about for the next 7-8 months. I was in Poundland, looking at the DVD section, when I saw it. I thought I would buy it, since it was only a pound. When I got home, I put it on and watched it with my dad. It was brilliant! Funny, great special effects and good acting. The effects were better than those in the Avengers, which was made 5 years later. I was nearly totally convinced that it was made last year.I definitely recommend this film, as it is my favourite ever!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A major disappointment,"What happened to Hollywood? How long it'll produce such a sh*t? Don't they care, that movies like this simply betray the idea of summer blockbuster? Don't they see, movies get worse and worser. There is no plot, no acting, just CGI and nothing. Of all movies I saw this summer all were awful. Next was a garbage, Spider Man 3 was a waste, Die Hard 4 was just boring. 11 years ago I thought Emmerich's Independent Day is a sh*t, but at least there was the narrative, you could follow. Transformers, which is nothing but an useless ID rip-off, even don't have a clear storyline. And I just wonder, how soon Hollywood will make a LEGO-movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Autobots rises!,"I do my film review of the TRANSFORMERS movie franchise and I am going to start with the first installment of the franchise, released in 2007.The film follows Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery.The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth.The film was developed in 2003 and the film went into production in 2006 and it was released on July 3, 2007 and the film was really amazing when I first saw the feature film and I was impress to see the Transformers on screen and I really did not know what they were until I went online and found out more about them.The CGI and action sequences were amazing and the Autobots and the Decepticons were really created well with the help of computer-generated imagery and the final fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron is my favorite action sequence in the Transformers film released in 2007.My favorite Transformer characters are Optimus Prime, Bumbleebee, Jazz and Ratchet. Peter Cullen does the voice of Optimus Prime and he does a great job. Mark Ryan does a really great job as Bumblebee. ""Family Matters"" actor Darius McCrary plays Jazz. Robert Foxxworthy plays Ratchet and they are both amazing in their performances. Hugo Weaving from V FOR VENDETTA and THE MATRIX TRILOGY does a really great job and it is amazing to hear him as Megatron.The human characters are also great. Shia LaBeouf is really good as the lead, while Megan Fox is really hot and is amazing and she was the right choice to play the love interest of Shia LaBeouf and the two on-screen together is really amazing in this film. Tyrese Gibson is real cool. Josh Duhamel is really amazing too. Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor plays their parts really amazing in their performances and the screen time they have.Steve Jablonsky's score is really amazing in this film and I really enjoyed Linkin Park's song, ""What I've Done"" and I loved the music video and their other two songs from the other two films, ""New Divide"" and ""Iridescent"" in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon and the song by Imagine Dragons from Age of Extinction is called ""Battle Cry"". I liked that song, too.Overall, TRANSFORMERS is a perfect movie by all means and I am giving this a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
