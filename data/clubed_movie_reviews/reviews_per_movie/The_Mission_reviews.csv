"Great location, Great actors, Great music","In 1750, Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. The Jesuits had converted many of the Guaranis. The Guaranis above the waterfalls still reject the church sending a crucified priest over the falls. Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) climbs up the falls and converts the tribe with his music. He confronts slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who is now hunting above the falls. Mendoza returns to town to find his fiancée and his brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) are now in love. In a jealous rage, he kills his brother. He is despondent and Gabriel offers him work with the Guaranis as penance. Together with Gabriel and other brothers like Fielding (Liam Neeson), they make the mission thrive. Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) arrives to decide if the church will continue to protect the missions from the slave running Portugese now that the land has been transfer from Spanish protection.The location is magnificent. The actors are terrific. And the music score from Ennio Morricone is both epic and haunting. This is an amazing historical drama. The story ends in a heart wrenching battle. Director Roland Joffé pulls together one of the best movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,History
To fight for a cause in a time of slavery and greed,"THE MISSION is a history drama about the expulsion of the Jesuits' missions in South America in the middle of the XVIII century. By what I've learned the plot's background is accurate to history and all we see in this movie truly happened in real life, unfortunately! The search for slavery work was continuous at the time by Portuguese colonists and the Spanish in spite of slavery not being directly allowed by their crown they also used the indigenous slaves. The Spaniards which had been creating Indian reductions since the middle of the XVI century, as a form to convert and control those indigenous people, were followed by the Portuguese, and both built Jesuit reductions in their territories. But after the 1750 treatment the Jesuits would be expulsed because they refused to leave their missions where their lived together with the indians, in peace. And the indians themselves they didn't want to abandon the reductions too because they knew that in the main jungle they would be an easy target to slave traders (known as ""bandeirantes"" in Portuguese colony).So it's just the main plot's topic of this movie which then focus on the personal story of father Gabriel (played by Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit missionary, and Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert de Niro) a former slave trader which was converted to the Christian faith (and to the Jesuits) after kill his brother (because of a woman). The movie has good moments, especially in the last hour, and it describes very well the feeling of injustice and desperation those native people felt by the furious anger of the greedy imperialist armies! There're a few scenes, which focus the sad and empty native children' eyes, that worth more than a thousand words!I enjoyed this movie and the plot's main topic which portrays a sad period of our history (unfortunately empires were always built under massacres and the subjugation of other people, and I know Portuguese empire was no exception!).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Awe-inspiring to see on the big screen,"I had the good fortune to see The Mission on the big screen in 1986 when it was first released. I went into the theater knowing only the title, the two lead actors, and that it had something to do with South America. Two hours later I was a puddle of tears, both from the subject matter and from the knowledge that I had just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most intelligently spiritual film I've ever seen. The cinematography is gorgeous throughout, the settings are stunning, the acting is top-notch across the board, the musical score is breathtaking, and the screenplay is brilliantly eloquent. Roland Joffé did a fantastic job directing The Killing Fields, but this one is even better. I just watched it again on DVD, and nearly 25 years later, the film has not aged or lost any of its power. Still one of the greatest and most underrated films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Final Victory in Might or in Love? Unique, profound, unforgettable movie","Father Gabriel: ""If might is right, then Love has no place in this world...""The movie by Roland Joffe was not popular in my country when it was released since such movies were censored by the communists. When, however, the situation changed in 1989, I remember that I saw THE MISSION for the first time on Polish TV in 1995 as a part of cinema's 100th anniversary celebration. The movie moved me so much that I have come back to it several times since then. Each time I see it, I find something new in the film. Therefore, I consider THE MISSION one of the very best films ever made, a film where history meets single individuals, where sadness is conquered by joy and disbelief and skepticism by profound thoughts on humanity.The content of the film, though historical, applies perfectly to modern times. The universal struggle of two spirits, the one of might and the one of Love, has always been noticeable wherever and whenever people live. Let us look briefly at the gist of the content: the Jesuits build a mission in the core of a jungle in South America, they understand the heart of the Gospels: Love without looking for reward. Yet, the politics of the conquerors (Spaniards and the Portuguese) steps in and destroys the mission... However, not everything dies even though goodness seems to be conquered... This story, presented here in a condensed way but developed in the film is so powerful that it leads to reflections: what, in fact, reigns in our lives; why good people have to suffer, why we are forced to do what we hate, it is so effortless to destroy while to build requires so much strength, why the world turns our good deeds into evil, etc. This aspect is the pearl of the film and the feast for the soul even though such thoughts require some courage from an individual. I reflected on the fact if I am willing to support the weak or if I rather choose might which is my master I attempt at in my actions? It's strange but we will never get to know our personalities completely... And that is what the film also shows. Altamiro (Ray Mc Anally), for instance, is a person of different psychological states hard to evaluate.The performances are exceptionally powerful which makes THE MISSION a very nice piece of film art. Jeremy Irons gives a very powerful performance as Father Gabriel expressing all values a good Christian should own: goodness, gentleness, patience, courage, and purity. He has this blink in his eyes that makes his portrayal particularly memorable. Robert De Niro... I would say frankly that this is his very best acting. People concentrate on different films when they hear of De Niro's performances, particularly in Michael Cimino's THE DEER HUNTER (1978) or in Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR (1991). Some of them skip THE MISSION. Yet his portrayal of Rodrigo Mendoza is a masterpiece in its own. This role is difficult to portray since Mendoza is a man of two contradictory spirits: from a slave trader to the devoted Jesuit. Nevertheless, De Niro does a marvelous job. One moment caught my attention from the first view of the film: Mendoza's death and this nostalgic look at Jesus in the Eucharist (even while writing about this moment a tear appears unintentionally in the eye). Ray McAnnally portrays Altamiro, a bishop who is forced to do what he actually does not intend to. He seems to be touched by the mission and in spite of that, he finally allows for slaughters. In the final shot, he expresses one thing powerfully: a face of a man whose conscience will forever suffer. ""Thus we have made the world...thus have I made it,"" which are his words said at the end by him clearly show what kind of person he was.Another powerful aspect of the film is music. Ennio Morricone is famous for having written music to many films but here, in THE MISSION, he did something absolutely sublime. I bought a CD listening to music alone and it was an unforgettable experience for me. People who heard it and did not see the film asked me where I got such wonderful tunes. Indian rhythms combined with Christian spirituality and ecclesiastic chorus - UNFORGETTABLE! I promise you that having seen this film, you will never forget, among other things, these lovely tunes.The filming locations, which obviously constitute an additional aspect in any film, add a thrill and authenticity to everything. It is hard to imagine other places in THE MISSION. The movie is shot mostly in the places where the historical events took place. We see the mighty Iguazu waterfalls, the jungle where Guarani Indians live, the city of Cartagena in Colombia as well as the hills of the Brazil-Argentinian border.What more is there to say? I think that most readers will agree with me that THE MISSION is a masterpiece, a film that opens people to new horizons of understanding the profound thoughts that are there in our lives if we are willing to reflect on them or not. Speaking religiously, Christ has once died on the Cross but then all was conquered by Love.The final scene gives an answer to Father Gabriel's thought that I entailed at the beginning. A silent sunny day in the jungle... we see a small group of Indian children who have survived the destruction. A little girl picks up a violin that she finds in the river and they begin to row a small boat towards the future...Father Gabriel, you are right. It seems that Love perhaps has no place in this world and might may seem to be right but it is always Love that wins since ""the spirit of the dead will survive in the memory of the living.""",10.0,Anonymous,History
A revisit is long overdue,"After hearing a quick clip from the soundtrack recently I decided to have another look at 'The Mission' which I hadn't seen for more than ten years. Interesting viewing in these days when epics abound: Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Troy etc.The first thing that struck me was the intelligence of the script which often seems an afterthought in today's big budget jobs. Robert Bolt weaves an intriguing web of characters; mercenary, slavetrader, starcrossed lover, papal emissary and man of faith. The passion of Robert de Niro's Mendoza beautifully contrasts the quiet firm conviction of Jeremy Irons' Gabriel. And the moral dilemma facing the Catholic Church, whether to abandon influence abroad for the sake of power at home, is ably brought to life in the tortured mind of Ray McAnally's Altamirano. This man sent from Rome by the Pope himself has the power of life and death over the Guarani Indians and the Jesuit priests who have dedicated their lives to Christian service in the deepest regions of the South American rainforest.The film isn't perfect by any means: I would have liked better representation of at least one Guarani character but the integrity of Joffe's direction and Chris Menges' spectacular camera-work make this one film you have to see. And there's that lovely soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.We may be more sophisticated these days in terms of technology, sound engineering and special effects but the lesson from 'The Mission' for today's directors has to be: it's the story, stupid.",,Anonymous,History
A Slow but Powerful Film,"""Rodrigo Mendoza"" (Robert De Niro) is a slave trader in South America who kills his own brother in a fit of jealous rage. Although he is not convicted by any court he still regrets his action and because of that he shuts himself out of society in a nearby church. Eventually, he decides to seek forgiveness by doing an extremely difficult penance. When that is finally accomplished he becomes a Jesuit monk working at a newly built mission far inside the jungle helping the same tribe he had tried to enslave. Unfortunately, time doesn't stop and all too soon other slave traders appear with the main goal of tearing down all of the missions in the area thereby ending any refuge for the unfortunate Indian tribesmen. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say this was a slow but powerful film which manages to capture the beautiful scenery of South America along with the power and greed prevalent during this particular time in history. It also won several awards including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival along with being nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards. Again, while it's rather slow at times, it's still something worth viewing for those who might be interested in this type of film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Lush Visuals, Score & Fascinating Story All Rolled Into One","The more I see this film the more I like it. First off, it has magnificent South American jungle scenery, filmed in an area that features multiple gorgeous falls. This is one of the prettiest films you will ever watch - guaranteed - and please see it on widescreen DVD. ""The Mission"" won the Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1986 and that award was well-deserved. There is just one stunning scene after another.The story is very interesting, too: a supposed true-life account what happened back in the 1700s when a few dedicated priests tried to bring Christianity to the natives. It shows what occurred when a combination of the Catholic Church and the Portugese slave-traders and politicians attempted to put a halt to their missionary. This is a drama, not an ""action film,"" but the movie has extended violent ending, and sometimes is shocking in that finale.Jeremy Irons, as the dedicated Jesuit who heads the mission, and Robert De Niro in a surprise role as the killer slave-trader-turned-repentant priest are both excellent in their leading roles. It was interesting to see a young Liam Neeson, too.To some, the story might be a bit slow I found it very involving. After several viewings, I began to fully appreciate to lush score by Ennio Morricone.

Feast for the Eyes and Ears,"Roland Joffe's period film is breathtaking to look at and listen to, but it's directed with a heavier hand than his breakout film from two years earlier, ""The Killing Fields.""I had trouble with the casting too. Jeremy Irons feels right for his role, but it's tough to accept Robert DeNiro in period films -- he's such a remarkable contemporary actor, and he's created such iconic representations of modern urban life, that he feels out of place in something like this.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears though, with Chris Menges, who had won an Oscar for photographing ""The Killing Fields"", adding a second trophy to his mantle for his work here; and Ennio Morricone providing an instantly classic score.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,History
The audience sat in silence...,"I will not describe every aspect of this masterpiece - you should just see it. It can not be told. You can (and you should) read R. Bolt's book, but it is not enough: you would not see nor hear it. Everything in ""The Mission"" is just perfect, from the first to the last scene. Perfect script with very convincing history, with serious and deep topics involved. Perfect acting (of every single actor). Perfect scenery and shots. Perfect music (the soundtrack on CD is a no-brainer purchase). In my opinion this movie deserves every award possible. I will just say one thing, which I experienced only once in my life: when the movie was over, all the audience in the cinema sat in complete silence. Nobody moved for several minutes. That is how powerful ""The Mission"" is. The best film I've ever watched.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting but not Spectacular,"The Mission is a film that boasts, above all else, breathtaking scenery of the South American continent, including the massive Iguazu waterfalls of Argentina (near its border with Paraguay). Underneath this eye candy, however, is an unevenly directed, and straightforward, though occasionally intriguing, story, topped by somewhat tepid performances from the cast.Based loosely off of true events, The Mission is set in the 1750s in the regions of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, when Spanish and Portuguese colonial forces were continuously seeking to expand their territories and constantly fighting one another. Wrapped up in these colonial skirmishes are the indigenous people of the region, namely the Guarani Indians. Jeremy Irons plays the Jesuit priest and missionary Father Gabriel, who with his comrades seeks to peacefully convert the natives to Christianity and teach them the finer aspects of Western Civilization. Compromising these efforts, however, are Spanish soldiers, particularly the mercenary Rodrigo Mendoza, played by Robert De Niro, who see the natives as savages and no better than animals, useful only as slaves for the Europeans and as occasional hunting targets.Through a tragic sequence of events, however, Mendoza is convicted of murder, and in his grief attempts to seek repentance. Father Gabriel decides to take Mendoza under the wing of his Order, and the group heads back from the Spanish settlement to the missions of the Guarani. Mendoza lives among the peaceful natives and is born anew as a Jesuit priest.The Guarani's and Jesuit's troubles are not over, however. The Portuguese are encroaching on the Guarani missions, seeking to enslave them and create profit for their overseas colonies. The Spanish and the Papacy's emissaries are unsympathetic to the Jesuits' concerns for the Guarani; the official Church, in fact, still does not really recognize the Guarani as human beings. This leaves Father Mendoza, Father Gabriel, their Jesuit compatriots, and the Guarani on their own, and a conflict arises between the Jesuits' views of nonviolence and the increasing necessity of preparing to do battle with the Portuguese, who will certainly destroy them if they do not resist.As stated earlier, the film has a fairly straightforward story. This of course would not be a negative if the story instead chose to focus on character development, but it only provides surface level insight into the main characters played by De Niro and Irons. The Guarani have no prominent role in the film; they are entirely props, background fodder to the white leading stars. In this sense The Mission takes the same path many films about the civil rights movement do: making white characters the main protagonists and leaving the black characters as supporting voices at best, often in order to appeal to a presumably majority white audience. We learn very little about the Guarani themselves beyond the fact that they have spears and seem to readily give up their own beliefs and traditions for Christianity. What are their thoughts and feelings concerning the warring Europeans? Do they truly believe what the Jesuits are telling them, or do they sometimes have doubts? The conflicts between the Papal authorities in South America and the Jesuits are handled well. Historically the Jesuits have been the ""thorn in the paw"" of the Catholic Church despite their nominal allegiance to the Pope, and this is quite evident in the film. The missions are designed in a style similar to the French radicalism of the period (the film is set decades prior to the French Revolution of 1789), where the Guarani share everything in common. This socialistic style is reminiscent of the Marxist liberation theology many priests chose to take in the 20th century, including the American Daniel Berrigan, who in fact has a minor role in this film.The film is beautifully shot and features lush cinematography; however, the battle choreography of the film's climax is somewhat ragged and unrealistic; the relative lack of character development adds to the ""ho hum"" feeling one gets while watching the Portuguese and the Guarani-Jesuit team fight it out on land and in kayaks.The performances are decent though not spectacular. Robert De Niro seems occasionally uncomfortable in his role as Mendoza. Jeremy Irons does a good job as Father Gabriel and the other actors perform adequately. The dialogue, however, is such that none of the performances, except perhaps for Mr. Irons, are very memorable.Apparently The Mission also seeks to give the audience a moral lesson about modern day transgressions against the Guarani and other indigenous people in the Americas, but this is not particularly effective and comes across as cloying and, frankly, patronizing towards the natives, who, as stated earlier, are simply props in this story.Those with an interest in colonial South American history will find this film watchable, as will anyone who enjoys gorgeous scenery. But aside from a few memorable moments, The Mission doesn't stand out as truly brilliant cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Emotionally devastating, Inspiring","I found myself emotionally devastated after seeing this film the first time. The film packs a punch in its contrast between the beauty of nature and human self-sacrifice on the one hand and the depths of human self-interest and ruthlessness on the other.  Its theme is as relevant today as it was in the 1600s - what are  the consequences of my actions, and what price must be paid by me and by others as a result?  The film depicts several characters with whose choices the viewer can identify - the missionary, the repentant killer, the papal legate - and gives no easy answers to the choices that confront them.  But the fact that there are no easy answers doesn't let them off the hook.  In the end, they all have to take responsibility for what they do or fail to do.The magnificent visuals of the Iguassu Falls and the moving score by Morricone (surely his best) all contribute to an unforgettable picture.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not altogether cohesive or satisfying,"Roland Joffe's ""The Mission"" can, with hindsight, be seen as the first directoral misstep by a filmmaker who has subsequently been slumming it (""The Scarlet Letter"", anyone?). This film has all the individual ingredients of a rousing, heartfelt masterpiece: Ennio Morricone's eponymous, redolent score, Chris Menges' strikingly mounted, symbolically saturated cinematography, Robert Bolt's erudite, literate and high-minded screenplay (apparently penned years earlier as a David Lean project) and a director just off from a round of plaudits for the excellent ""The Killing Fields"". Although the film has a number of isolated merits, the end product is a resolute dissapointment.The opening sequence, a missionary attached to a cross making his way towards oblivion by way of a thunderous waterfall, masterfully segueing into Ennio Morricone's majestic theme; Jeremy Iron's Jesuit priest making his way up that same waterfall; the montage conveying the construction of the mission; the well placed use of Ray MacAnnalay's ambiguously doting, melancholy voice over, amongst others. The irony is that the film's major flaws result from these moments: the constant crescendo of emotional peaks, swelling violins, etc. combined with a narrative which contains such an obvious, inevitable conclusion, underscores most of the film's dramatic power.The ending itself is a mess; it is badly choreographed (the soldier extra's don't seem to know in which direction to point their cannons and guns), with De Niro and Irons (as well as the Indian extra's) temporally confused as if their faculties have been clouded by langorous jungle narcotics. It seems rushed, probably due to its judiciously hurried inclusion in the 1987 Cannes Film Festival roster (it did win the 'Palme D'Or', granted).Overall, a noble failure.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Condensed history,"While at college I was given the assignment of producing a 30 minute talk on the 'Guarana Republic' which is off course the subject matter of this movie. Hailing from the Protestant part of Europe I had never even heard about this aspect of Jesuit missionary work before, but as I researched the matter I became fascinated. So when I heard that a movie had been made about this topic I went to see it as soon as possible. Knowing how the film industry tended to treat historical events I was somewhat suspicious, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie instantly became one of my all time favourites. I think the subject matter is handled sensitively and sensibly and the cinematography is stunning. What also impressed me was the clever way in which this story, which in reality spanned several generations, was compressed into a period of about ten years without becoming unbelievable. Even in a two hour movie there is a limit on what one can touch on, but I think that a good balance between dialogue, adventure, action, and character development, was struck. Even so if the movie would have lasted another hour I would still have been happy (perhaps even happier).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Words alone are not enough......,"I have read the other comments and am stunned by people who view The Mission in a negative light. It feels as though you are attacking a loved one - perhaps because this movie IS a loved one to me.  Never, ever have I felt so deeply about a film.  I don't have any idea where to begin checking off the pro's:  cinematography? stupendous acting? heart-breaking subject matter? moving soundtrack?  I don't think it's possible to do that with The Mission - one needs to absorb it as a whole.  An entire masterpiece.I was one of the fortunate ones to see this movie in a theatre back in the 80's - we were visiting friends in another city and, for lack of anything better to do that evening, decided to see this film. To say I was moved would be such an understatement as to be ridiculous. It is the saddest commentary on what horrors have been perpetrated in the name of God....I have seen this movie several times since then and own it now but I am always very careful whom I see it with and when I see it.  You need to have a block of time set aside when you can completely immerse yourself in this film. Unplug the phone, put the kids to bed, make sure the dog doesn't have to go out. If you don't pay attention - from the very beginning to right after the credits - you will miss something important.  Prepare yourself emotionally for The Mission.

Powerful movie about fighting for what is right or showing love and mercy,"This is a powerful movie that questions the morals of what is right and what is wrong. In this case if it's right to fight for what is just or to try to solve everything by love and mercy. I found this movie to be slightly dry but it got my interest most of the way through. Mostly because it is based on a true story. About a man that falls and later becomes a Christian and later fights for what he believes is right instead of what he only wants. So in this case he is fighting for the peaceful tribe of Christians. I just wish the movie was a bit more developed and explain certain parts of the movie. Such as how the tribe got evangelized after the beginning scene. All the actors did a great job, in fact it has actors that will play some big roles in future movies after this. Such as Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson. This is not a movie I would watch repeatedly but it's a powerful movie that questions the morals of what is right and wrong.

Deeply human,"I think ""The Mission"" is better than Joffé's ""The killing fields"". The background-story is about political power between Spain and Portugal in 1750 and a Cardinal sent by Rome. But above all it tells of two men. Jeremy Irons is Jesuit Gabriel who builds a mission in South American jungles. He has got a deep human character and believes in peace and love. Robert DeNiro is more interesting. After killing his brother in a duel, he changes from brutal slave-trader to an expiating Jesuit. One of the best sequences is when native Indians recognize DeNiro. It looks first as if an Indian would kill him with a knife, but then he cuts the rope with that DeNiro carried a heavy ballast of weapons and armings. DeNiro cries and laughs simultaneously because he is redeemed. This goes right through your heart. Chris Menges cinematography is wonderful.

One of the great epic historical films of all time,"In `The Mission' Roland Joffé has succeeded in putting together one of the most majestic visual adventures of all time: and a story that had to be told. Chris Menges' sumptuous photography is a feast, such that  for once  the Newsweek quotation on the video cover is superbly apt: `a sweeping spectacle'. The whole film is breathtaking: from the depths of the jungle to the indian villages, from face close-ups to broad panoramas, the visual effects are so powerful that I just cannot think of any other comparable film. Add to that fine interpretations, carefully considered and delivered performances by all concerned with Joffé's exquisite direction, and you have a guarantee of a magnificent production. But that is NOT all there is to this great film: Ennio Morricone's music reaches its greatest power, its most poignant intensity, its most gratifying melodic line, right here in `The Mission', surpassing everything this Italian composer had ever done before  even with his great friend, Sergio Leone. Here Morricone reaches symphonic levels in a wealth of melodic harmonies, such that what is supposedly `only' a visual attraction  a film  becomes also a delight to the ears, bringing a lump to my throat at various moments through this genuinely mighty film. You might wish to compare this film with `1492: a Conquest of Paradise' (1992) in which the best of Vangelis can be heard; but even so, I rate `The Mission' just ahead of `1492'. Both films highly recommendable.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Meaningful film with Jeremy Irons and Robert de Niro.,"The Mission directed by Roland Joffe cannot be termed as a film which can masquerade as some kind of populist entertainment stuff. It is not at all a film which entertains in the manner most of the films do. It is a film which makes us think as to what our past history was. The important message the film gives us is the reminder that numerous wars were fought in order to attain the religious supremacy of a particular religion. Now for those who think that The Mission is not a slice of history but a movie, I would say that both the leading actors are absolutely impressive. However it is Jeremy Irons who is in full command of his acting capabilities as the priest. Robert de Niro is good too as the man who repents after killing his brother out of revenge. The amazing thing is the manner in which South American native people have acted. Watching them perform alongside Hollywood bigwigs one wonders how they have not been influenced by them.

When movies had plots and amazing setting without CGI,"There was a time when movies actually had plots that made sense and major stars involved in the project were not necessarily the most interesting thing about them.This movie is based on real, but condensed events, about a colonialist tragedy that took place in Paraguay when Spain gave some of its territories to Portugal. Granted that neither nation had rights over that part of the world, the tragedy developed when the church refused to take the defense of the Guaraní, the local tribe, even if they'd converted.The main characters involved are Jeremy Irons as the jesuit Father Gabriel and De Niro as mercenary, then converted jesuit Mendoza. They both are incredibly good in conveying the main features of their characters, the sweetness of Gabriel and the harshness followed by penance of the very complex Mendoza.

As a 10 years old boy watching this movie first time, I could see the obvious conflict between the strong and the weak because, obviously it was clearly shown in the movie as gunfights and killings. Yeah, I had average intelligence of a young boy. And I was bored by this movie. (I was only 10 years old after all.) Some people still see only as much as young me, with tons of historical and political knowledge they gathered in their lives and described in their review. This movie isn't about wars and politics. Strictly speaking this movie isn't even about the religions. What this movie speaks about are forgiveness - self forgiveness -, love - the true love that we will never understand -, and most of all, the path - the path we should choose some day. (assuming you are not going to give up living it, if you know what I mean.) - Are you gonna fight for them like Rodrigo Mendoza? Or are you gonna be with them, and love, like Father Gabriel? The movie does not answer, after all, who can? This movie isn't about the obvious war which is just a background story, but about the parallel conflict between Rodrigo Mendoza and Father Gabriel, which represent unending war in our conscience.I know exactly why the Godfather has highest rating and I appreciate it so much. But having The Mission so underestimated with Robert De Niro acting (Just watch him at the waterfall!) and the music.... the music.. and so much love, so much human. I don't know, should they really be gangster movies to make us feel the Thing? I am very disappointed. Way to go Human Being.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Story Is Not Fully Developed,"""The Mission"" is a lush movie, shot on location in the jungles of Argentina and Colombia. It is set in 18th century Amazonia as the European colonial empire relentlessly moves into the heretofore-unexploited jungle. The Spanish Jesuits are the first Europeans on the scene, and have developed a benign relationship with the aboriginal inhabitants. The imperialists on the other hand want to enslave the Indians and exploit the jungle. The Catholic Church who has sent an emissary from the Vatican will resolve the conflict. Jeremy Irons plays a good-hearted Jesuit, and Robert DeNiro plays a slave trader, who suffers an epiphany after slaying his brother in a rage.Sadly, the story is never fully developed, and the inherent conflicts are not exploited. The movie becomes just a pastiche of related scenes lacking a strong narrative theme and supporting characters to tie them together. The story is subsumed by propaganda.  Granted, these are extraordinarily beautiful scenes, but breathtaking scenery is not enough. It feels more like a History Channel lecture than a character-driven story. I'd only recommend it if you have interest in the subject matter, jungle beauty, or one of the actors.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome,"Rarely does a film have all the elements in film making all come together so perfectly.  I can honestly say that this is THE BEST film I have ever seen, and the most powerful film I have seen.  I always said that some films are 'one' of the best, but I can truly say that this is THE Best film I have seen.  The cinematography is excellent, excellent casts, and an awesome score.  I kept the tape playing during the credits just to listen to the music.  If you haven't seen this, you better see it, it is unforgettable and will remain with you forever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Politics and religion are like oil and water; they should never mix.,"It is always very interesting how people react to movies and I was very surprised at my reaction to ""The Mission"". After the movie ended, I was more angry and exasperated than moved.I had no problems with the production. The breathtaking opening scenes alone had me hooked. It was beautifully filmed by director Roland Joffé and Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges. Two years earlier, they worked on the very moving drama ""The Killing Fields"".I've listened to sections of Ennio Morricone's musical score performed live by various choral groups and had a chance to listen to his full score on CD a few months ago. It is probably one of Morricone's best works. Even after 19 years, I'm still very shocked that he did not win an Oscar for that work. (This not to say that Herbie Hancock, the eventual winner for ""'Round Midnight"" did not deserve the award. Usually the Academy chooses traditional, epic-size scores like Morricone's. Go figure.)My major problem with the film was Robert Bolt's script. To me, the story should have been about the South American Indian chief and his tribe and not about the Jesuit priests (which included Jeremy Irons and, in one of his earliest roles, Liam Neeson) trying to convert them to Christianity.I also had a major problem with the character played by Robert De Niro. Was this character added to the story as an afterthought? I don't believe the character of the slave trader/mercenary/monk was necessary. It was more of a plot contrivance. It also did not help that De Niro was poorly miscast. Ironically, Spainard Antonio Banderas might have been a better choice. (I would have said Javier Bardem but he was 17 years old when the movie was released.)The late Ray McAnally easily gave the best performance as Cardinal Altamirano. Despite being enamored of the work of the Jesuits and having many natives becoming Christian, his decisions would eventually set in motion the fate of everyone. Is Altamirano an evil man? Did he do God's will? Were the decisions made to exert the power of the church? The character was very complex and McAnally should have gotten a Supporting Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance.There's a lot to admire but, overall, ""The Mission"" was a bit of a disappointment. It should have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Magnificent.,"My favorite movie, ever.  It works on so many levels: as a story about the dissolution of the Jesuit order in portuguese South America (and the subsequent enslavement of the natives), as an account of one man's ill-fated but necessary conversion, as a series of complex ideological battles, and, lastly, as a tale of innocence, of Eden.  All this, in addition to spectacular performances, brilliant direction, a fabulous script and one of the most breathtaking soundtracks ever recorded.  It simply gets better with each successive viewing.",,Anonymous,History
Film as art - a masterpiece,"On all counts a superb film: cinematography, score, setting, acting, screenplay, themes. I think it was cut perfectly.  Those who think it too long must be missing half the evocations that are made.  I've watched it eight times.  The central theme for me: how does Love respond to Might? Futile resistance or Ghandi-like protest were both expressions of love... crucified.  It may have been set in the early Americas, but the issues are just as relevant today.  Many powerful related sub-themes.  This is not frivolous entertainment, but an opportunity for transformative reflection. Probably the best film I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
What You  Do Unto The Least Of My Brethren,"It's a sad fact of life that hunter gatherer cultures even when slavery is not in the mix will always give way to societies higher up on the sociological scale. No one says its right, it just is. The Mission deals with the tragedy of such a situation in South America in the 18th century.Slavery was in the mix here however, practiced in the open by the Portugese and winked at by the Spanish where their king's writ ran. The area were concerned with in South America in 1758 is that area of the Amazon headwaters where the boundary between Brazil and Peru is not really to clear.Christianity was a both a savior and destroyer of animist Indian tribes back then in both American continents. It certainly did have as a message that their culture and beliefs were altogether wrong and have to change. But there are also numerous recorded incidents where priests and we are talking about the Catholic Church here put their lives and reputations on the line to defend these primitive societies from the evils of the civilization they were bringing.Such an admirable priest is Jeremy Irons in The Mission. He's aided and abetted by Robert DeNiro a former slaver who became a monk, renouncing civilization after killing his brother Aidan Quinn in a fight over a woman. The tribe they are working with and actually gaining trust and even some converts has been earmarked to be captured and used as slave labor over in Portugese territory.The Mission is told in flashback as Cardinal Ray McAnally is writing a report to the Pope of what is happening in South America. And in many ways what is still happening there.The Mission got seven Oscar nominations including best picture and won the Oscar in 1986 for best cinematography. The performances are some of the best that all the principal players have ever given on screen. The story is a tragic one, but with a message of hope that there are indeed people like Irons and DeNiro for whom the positive aspects of their religion is not just platitudes.The best way to see The Mission is back to back with At Play In The Fields Of The Lord which is a 20th century look at the same problem. Both films are among the best made in the past 30 years.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It looks great,"'The Mission' looks so beautiful that you almost forget the other things that can make a movie good or bad. That the story isn't that great and that some things don't make much sense is too bad but there is enough here to enjoy. The cinematography of the beautiful nature is great. Every shot has something beautiful in it. The music composed by Ennio Morricone is great as well.We also have Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons with nice performances. The movie was directed by Roland Joffé who directed the great 'The Killing Fields' and he does a nice job here as well, most of the time. The fighting sequence in the end was hard to follow. Like I said the story is not that great either but it will not bore you at all. If you like one of the actors and beautiful nature you will definitely like this movie. Otherwise you might like it as well, but that is not sure.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An under rated movie,"Yes it is an aesthetically pleasing movie. More importantly however, this complex story does not provide easy answers. Exploring the age old question of might versus right. And the struggles between Church and State. The movie portrays multiple sides in a way that encourages empathy for each from the audience. The inevitable and tragic end leaves the viewer questioning not so much what is right, but how to achieve a righteous life. Further, it is a treat to see both Jeremy Irons' and Robert De Niro's deliver some of their best acting. Also of interest is seeing the early acting careers of both Liam Neeson & Aiodan Quinn. A far cry from the usual Hollywood blockbuster that is short on substance. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Ambitious but flawed,"Roland Joffe's stately film, 'The Mission', tells the story of indigenous Americans first embraced, then abandoned, by a Catholic Church more interested in power than in good. But the film has failings: there are multiple lead protagonists (including Robert de Nero whose role seems inadequate for his star billing), denying us a consistent perspective; the pace is slow; and the battle scenes at the end more confused than dramatic. I also found Enrico Morricone's story invasive and partly unnecessary. In addition, the plot can be summarised as bad stuff expected, bad stuff happens: it's a story extraordinarily devoid of twists. The scope is broad, but for such a simple tragedy, a smaller movie might have serviced better.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Poignant and touching,"This is a movie that will always stay in my memory.First time I saw it, back in the late 80's,I thought it was too brutal and even morbid in a way.But the second and third time I was swept off by its non-conformistic beauty.The story begins unusually,with De Niro's character killing his own brother over a woman.The good priest in Irons' interpretation steps in as guiding light and leads him to salvation,which means that he takes him to his own Mission deep in the jungles.There De Niro is born again as an individual,though he doesn't lose his warrior instincts and I believe much of his story revolves around dealing with his newfound identity as a Christian and struggle to shake his old militant ways.The film gives us some strong performances and both De Niro and Irons should be praised for they pull it off wonderfully in their parts.I believe this to be De Niro's last great performance.The movie is beautifully shot,a Roland Joffe trademark,and though it ends tragically it isn't a sad film.Its poignant and highly enlightening and I believe many souls were deeply changed after seeing it.The Morricone score is brilliant as always.A nice supporting cast includes Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn in some of their best early work. Another strong part comes from Ray McAnally in the ambiguous part of Cardinal Altamirano. Its a landmark film all in all and deserves a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not bad . . . just dull.,"This film was beautifully made and acted, but I personally found it dull. The dialogue (by playwright and screenwriter Robert Bolt) was wooden, uninteresting and verging on pseudo-Shakespearean (Bolt's eternal flaw, I believe, was his inferiority complex over William Shakespeare. I wish he could have stopped trying to be so classicist for once and attempted to write something with some real verve). The acting was fine (bravo Robert De Niro for adding some real depth) but could have been enhanced by a more vibrant script. The endless shots of foliage and waterfalls I feel were distracting more than anything else. I mean, how interesting is a waterfall after you've seen 20+ shots of it? Really? Overall this is not exactly a bad film, it can make one think, but I came away thinking that it could have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Great, meaningful ideas; messy, inconsistent execution","The filming locations are absolutely gorgeous, and the production design and art direction hardly any less so. The costume design, hair, and makeup are lovely, befitting a historical drama, and Chris Menges' cinematography is stark and vivid in bringing all these visuals to bear; the film is beautifully shot. Those stunts and effects that are employed are great. More than anything else, the music in 'The mission' is terrifically rich and flavorful, easily stirring our emotions while perfectly complementing every mood and scene. I would expect no less from a master composer like Ennio Morricone, and while his score in this instance is not one of his better known ones, make no mistake that this is above all a superb credit to a man who has single-handedly enhanced so many movies. Those operating relatively unsung behind the scenes - and, honestly, the natural splendor of the jungles, mountains, and waterfalls seen herein - bear the lion's share of what success the picture can claim, and even if we say it's a just matter of superficial aesthetics, then it's all very aesthetically pleasing.What I find deeply curious is that for as fabulous as the latter highlights are, they do not represent the core substance of the feature, nor what one most attentively seeks in cinema, let alone what has allowed the feature to enjoy the acclaim that it has since its premiere. And personally, I question that acclaim, for those facets customarily deemed most important to a title's success - writing, direction, and acting - are the facets that I find in this case to leave a lot to be desired. This won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and was nominated for and won various other awards, and I'm given to understand that it continues to enjoy high regard among religious organizations. Yet to me, Roland Joffé's direction and the acting, even from respected stars like Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson, often come off as lax and unbothered, bland and stale, and halfhearted. Where is the vitality in each scene? Where is the emotion? Where is the intended impact? Much of these two hours feels passive, as if we're watching rehearsals and not the footage selected for a finished film. Even violence in the last stretch struggles to make any major mark as it very much should.Loosely working from historical record, screenwriter Robert Bolt provides a bounty of material ripe for dramatic telling in this medium. The script gives us a wicked man who finds redemption yet who still struggles with his baser impulses, and a people under threat and hanging in the balance, as conflict brews between matters of church and state pursuant to a treaty made an ocean away. What will the fate be of the Guaraní, and of Jesuit missions in South America, as territory is transferred between Spain and Portugal? Yes, there is much to digest and play with from a narrative standpoint. Unfortunately, I kind of think Bolt bit off more than he could chew, for the concept is too big and complex to easily abridge and condense into one two-hour flick. It seems to me that just as the direction and the acting too commonly fail to capture the weight of a beat or scene, the screenplay too commonly fails to fully explore all the ins and outs of a particular aspect. Similarly, the plot development feels forced - not severely but gently, like a riverboat tour that indifferently sails past landmarks, all the way through to the end.Furthermore, there are times in the script when it seems that Bolt has a faint glimmer of a still grander overarching thought to pursue, but he does not. I don't know what his presuppositions were, but I do recognize why various churches have held 'The mission' in such esteem. There is a passing exchange of dialogue in which Don Cabeza chastises the Jesuits for civilizing the Guaraní with the unspoken threat of hellfire, in contrast to the brutal oppression and slavery of the state and its agents. There are other instances, like an inner thought expressed by Cardinal Altamirano, pondering if the Guaraní wouldn't have been better off if the Europeans never showed up in the first place. We, as viewers, plainly see that the Guaraní way of life is upended either way, and Bolt does focus on this a tad more in the back end. Yet still the picture maintains a colonialist mindset such that it does not specifically repudiate the introduction of Christianity to a free people, nor of contemporary European conceptions of civilization that - as we know all too well a couple hundred years later - is woefully unsustainable. Still the picture treats Jesuit missions, and some presence of such outsiders in South America, as a de facto good, as in ""that's just the way it is, alas."" What could be more white, and what could be more Christian, than assuming you know best for people you in any way deem to be Lesser Than? Under these circumstances, when Bolt does briefly seize upon bigger questions, it almost comes across that it was a spontaneous manifestation whether than a deliberate consideration.I understand why others hold the feature to be so good. I understand, but I disagree, for I see how good it could have been if the writing, direction, and acting were more careful, and more consistent. All the ideas are there, but in no manner are they rendered in a fashion that makes the end result as meaningful as it should have been, and in terms of the themes and messaging this just feels messy. In turn, we get some flubbed lines, stuttered delivery, quiet dramatic moments that lack gravity, action sequences that carry no power, and a full-length viewing experience that goes by so smoothly as to be unremarkable. I'm not mad. Just disappointed. It should have been an epic and a spectacle, and it tries to be, but it can't inspire awe; it should have indulged in hearty subject matter, and does to some degree, but not to an extent that I find solid, concrete, and satisfactory. I don't dislike 'The mission.' I just think that despite all the inherent labor of a production that journeyed to Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, in the ways that matter most it fails to impress at best and at too many times altogether raises a skeptical eyebrow. Whatever one's impetus for watching, some lasting value remains to be had. Would that were more of it, however, for as it stands, I'm not inclined to give this title an especial recommendation.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"An intense as well as enjoyable  historical  drama plenty of war ,  love  , faith  and religion","A David Puttnam/Iain Smith/Fernando Ghia production developing dramatic deeds during Spanish/Portuguese colonization and the subsequent historic deeds . 18th century Spanish Jesuits try to protect a remote South American Indian tribe in danger of falling under the rule of pro-slavery Portugal . It deals with the tale of a Spanish Jesuit priest , called Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), who goes into the South American jungle to build a mission and convert a community of Guaraní Indians to Christianity . Later on , join other priests (Liam Neeson) and Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who undertakes a suitable penance . The Jesuit missions were safe, because they were protected under Spanish law . Meantime , a Papal emissary Cardinal named Altamirano (Ray McAnally) is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions . After that , Jesuits attempt to save a Guarani tribe in risk of submitting under mistreat and slavery . As they are forced to defend all they have built against the Portugese aggressors at an epic final battle.The picture was well based on facts , as the Treaty of Madrid -in the year 1750 and previously treaty of Alcacovas and Tordesillas- reapportions the land in South America . The land on which the Jesuit missions were located was transferred to the Portuguese, and Portuguese law allows slavery ; then Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives . Following the demarcation of the new boundaries, the region of the Eastern Missions , comprising seven villages of the Jesuit remaining on the left bank of the Uruguay river was moving to Portuguese hands . This resolution, however, was more significant than might appear, while in the territories of Portugal , enslavement of indigenous people was allowed, while in the Spanish territories all Indians were subjects of freedom , so they could not be enslaved . This difference in legal status of the indigenous population, was inflamed by the Jesuits themselves, led the resistance to the Portuguese that eventually burst into the Guarani War which lasted from 1752 to 1756. However , it was origin of the motivation for the Pragmatic Sanction of 1767, by which Charles III decreed the expulsion of the Jesuits from all overseas territories.This interesting film is full of compelling drama with emotion , passion , unforgettable scenes , historical events and good feeling . It is a dramatic and intelligent portrait of a time when priests Jesuits carried out a holy mission to evangelize South American natives . This is an agreeable account of the survival of the human spirit against difficulties ; an epic portrayal of Faith , Forgiveness and Redemption . The movie is plenty of graphic , striking and memorable moments about timeless power of forgiveness and dictating a strong emotional response from the spectator , and some moments results to be really touching and moving . ¨The mission¨ by Roland Joffe , was one of his greatest hits , had Palme d'or at Cannes , a graphic monument to Portuguese oppression in South-America , but Joffe has not quite held his place at the top level . The film is set during the Jesuit Reductions, a program by which Jesuit missionaries set up missions independent of the Spanish state to teach Christianity to the natives . Thought-provoking movie with evident excitement based on original story & screenplay by prestigious Robert Bolt . This exciting picture turns out to be a breathtaking spectacle about dramatic consequences of Portuguese invasion , including deep emotions , brooding dialog and a heartbreaking final . A strong , difficult shooting , as the majority of the crew became ill with amoebic dysentery . Robert De Niro was one of the few who did not catch the illness . Many of the people who played the natives were actual native South Americans who spoke little English , they were given free reign to say whatever lines they wanted, and it is rumored that in a couple scenes they're actually cursing up a storm. Colorful as well as luxurious cinematography by Chris Menges . Sensitive and emotive score by Ennio Morricone , considered to be one of the best soundtracks of cinema history .The motion picture was very well directed by the British Roland Joffé , being realized in lush style , filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship , without leaving a trace the thought-provoking issues , in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . He is a good filmmaker mainly of epic subjects . After a long career filming for television , he made his movie debut in a big way with ¨The killing fields¨ winner of three Oscar and dealing with madness and atrocities committed by humans , Joffe's usual theme . He subsequently directed ¨Fat Man and Little Boy¨ referring to two atomic bombs dropped by America on Japan . Joffe's meagre output for the cinema makes it all the more surprising that he has turned out three splendid films and several others near-disasters such as ¨The scarlet letter¨ , ¨Vatel¨ , ¨Captivity¨, ¨You and me¨ and ¨There be dragons¨ . The mission , rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching . Essential and indispensable seeing ..",9.0,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece,"When Spain and Portugal colonized South America the Amerindians were the main losers. European diseases killed thousands but many more were eventually killed by new settlers. However, in Europe, intellectuals debated the possibility of Indians having souls (the certainty that black people had no soul was the excuse used to allow their slavery without remorse). Okay... for us, all this seems horrible and surreal because we learn with this mistakes and change the way we think but, at that time, this debate was very important. If it were true, then it was an universal duty to evangelize the Indians and protect them from slavery. It's in this context that Jesuit missions are founded, going against the will of the settlers, who had every interest in maintaining that source of cheap labour (keep in mind that European settlers were a minority in the new lands, despite Spain and Portugal sent millions of men there). The action of the Jesuit priests, though blessed by the Church, displeased the two empires, which saw themselves, from time to time, at war because of the exact demarcation of their frontiers in that region. And it's precisely in this historical context that the film unfolds, portraying the efforts of the priests to protect the Indians and their missions, and the governmental attempts to get them closed. Portugal, in particular, maintained in this period a bad relation with the Jesuits, that would end up being expelled from the Kingdom few years after the period portrayed in the film.The film is truly capable of humanizing all these issues, showing a human side that is often overlooked in history lessons. The merit goes to Robert Bolt, who wrote the screenplay, and to director Roland Joffé, whose efforts deserve no negative note. The film has excellent characters and a luxury cast. Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) represents very well the ideals of the Jesuits, imbued with the combative and evangelizing spirit that still characterizes this Catholic order today. Irons was totally at ease with the character and made, in this film, one of the most remarkable work of his career. Robert De Niro gave life to Don Rodrigo Mendoza, a contradictory character who begins by being one of the most active captors of Indians. His redemption, however, leads him to join the missionary effort to the point of becoming one of his most active advocates. And how interesting it was to see De Niro in a human and emotional role, in such an obvious contrast with the characters he usually represents... The film also features Ray McAnally as a cardinal sent by the pope to evaluate the complaints of the Iberian kingdoms.The shooting sites are magnificent. The film was partially shot in Iguazú Falls, in the South of Brazil, very close to the places where these dramas were felt in real life. Finally, it's necessary to mention the incomparable original soundtrack composed by Enio Morricone, still considered today one of the most emotional, touching and melodious already created for the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Will be watched for all time,"The Mission is amoung the top ten or twenty films ever made. At this point it is my favourite film. It is an eloquent essay in faith and redemption. The two most moving scenes are the one in which the Brother enters the Jungle above the waterfall, from which the Indians have cast the previous Brother that went up to them, and knowing that the Indians are all about him unseen in the jungle with their poison tipped arrows, he sits down in a clearing and plays the hauntingly beautiful ""Gabriel's obo"" tune on his own obo. The Indian's are mesmirised and emerge and befriend him. The Brother thinks: ""If I had an orchestra, I could have subdued the whole continent."" The other scene is where the former Slave driver, who repents after killing his brother, whom he loved above all else, goes with the Brothers up to the settlement of the Indians whom he was taking away to slavery on sugar plantations. The former slave driver has been forgiven his sins but he nevertheless feels the need to do a private penance of dragging the battle armour of his previous life with him through the jungle. When the brothers come upon the Indians, the slave driver fully expects them to kill him for his deeds but instead they cut away the bundle of armour he is dragging and welcome him to them. This echoing of divine Love by the Indians enables the former slave driver to believe in his redemption and to be born again at one with God. The mission is a film that you won't forget. See it today. (Watch out for Liam Neeson in it too by the way.)",,Anonymous,History
This is an exceptional film,"I first saw The Mission when I was sixteen years old and Ennio Morricone's haunting score as a backdrop to the visual leitmotif of Iguaçu Falls captured by the cinematography of Chris Menges's persist as some of my favorite cinematic moments. Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons successfully portray Jesuits in Paraguay prior to the Charles III's expulsion of the order from the Americas in 1767. The movie succeeds on various levels and perhaps is the best movie that Hollywood produced in the 1980's apart from Amadeus and the Last Emperor.This movie summarily is a morality play in which passive and violent resistance are contrasted. Robert Bolt, the script writer, avoids subscribing to either approach, but intelligently constructs a plot in which the conflict centers around whether violence against repression or passive resistance are a priori. In the end, neither of these approaches is sufficient and the Portuguese army slaughters the Guarani. I can't help but think that liberation theologians like Archbishop Oscar Romero, who the Salvadorian government murdered, influenced Bolt's consideration of this topic.As I perused other user comments, I believe critics of this film are turned off by the ""jolted dialogue"" and the ""under-developed characterization"". In truth, the dialogue is relatively sparse compared to other Hollywood movies and relies upon visual and musical motifs to communicate developments in the plot and characters--our indebtedness to Shakespeare's dialog driven plays perhaps prejudices us against other forms of communication. The use of apt imagery with terse but effective dialogue results in more than adequate character development in the Jesuits.The movie does not develop the Guarani and can be accused of reifying these people as noble savages. However the movie is about Jesuits and both native and non-native laymen are backdrops to the development of the conflicts exhibited in the priests played by DeNiro and Irons.I certainly recommend this movie as a great drama that presents interesting questions in a formally pleasing way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Mission's Battle,"The Mission was absolutely one of the best films I have seen and I regret not having the privilege of watching this beforehand. Robert De Niro excellently portrays Mendoza, a converted Jesuit, whose former life reflects the convictions of his enslavement against the South American Indians. It is this conviction that leads him to defend these same Indians from slavery by engaging in a battle against the Portugese oppressors. Father Gabriel, played by Jeremy Irons, represents the polar opposite of Mendoza. A kind and thoughtful man, he instead resorts to a peaceful method of fighting for the liberty of the Indians through a silent and non-combative battle---through hymns and worship as opposed to guns and bloodshed. The treatment of these simple but strong-willed and determined Indians through slavery and disdain not only creates a sense of sympathy, but a heart felt agony towards their situation and rising anger aimed at the cruel indifference of the Catholic leaders, who had the power to stop such a tragic event. Ultimately, neither side truly wins, leaving a battered nation and a lost cause.What made this film even more impacting was the fact that it was based on true accounts. So the question arises: How could we as humans be so brutal towards others who have every right to freedom and happiness? A must see film that will open your eyes to the harsh reality of slavery and those who desperately fought for their rights.

Sweeping and Majestic!,"Roland Joffe's The Mission is a sweeping and beautiful historical epic of two men with two entirely different professions band together to save an endangered Indian species. Led by a majestic score by Ennio Morricone and sweeping cinematography and beautiful shots of the lush South American wilderness, this movie is one of the best of the 1980's. The movie has been overlooked mostly because of it's Christian themes, but as it's about saving people and a man of the cloth, it should have these themes.This film is about how a Jesuit and a slave trader unite to save a South American tribe from relocation and other dangers.The acting is really good. Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro make a very good team thanks to great chemistry. The Indian actors are also really good as they brought a sense of realism to their lifestyle.Overall, this is a great, underrated epic that would teach some people history they did not know about. My only complaint is that the battles at the end of the film lacked effective choreography and I did not find them to be realistic. But what I did liked is how these two men did everything in their power to convince the church that these native people are worth their lives and their land. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Majestic score but disjointed plot,"""The Mission"" is a movie that has good parts but doesn't quite work properly as a all. Indeed I had the feeling that it's like two different movies condensed in one, not because of poor pacing or editing problems but merely as a plot level. The film can be divided in three parts: the initial redemption, the missions and the finale but they don't fit well together and they feel like two very different storylines. Indeed I can't tell what the movie is about: it's about a man who goes trough a journey of redemption and acts in a way that I won't spoil after that? Or is it about the missions in South America and how those missions relate with Spain and Portugal? I don't know because it's both and none. The problem is that the first part (centred around De Niro's character) is long and you care about this man, his struggles and he's the clear protagonist of the first part. Then the movie shifts to the missions and it hides De Niro's character and I was like: ""yeah I like this but where's De Niro?"". And though I liked the second part I was quite bored because I watched like 40 minutes of a story that wasn't important for what I was seeing. And then the finale brings together the two previous stories but not in a satisfying way (and I'm not talking if the story went where I wanted or not but I'm implying that it didn't tied well together the first parts). ""The Mission"" however is not a bad movie overall, the acting, the direction, the cinematography are all great and the score is divine. Ennio Morricone proves his talents once again and ""Gabriel's oboe"" is a masterpiece. As I said the story and the parts are good, but have some problems interacting with each others. And so ""The Mission"" was a good time but I don't think it will be one of those movies I will strongly recommend watching to my friends.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Limited, lacking, listless","But then, I have always had great difficulty with films that religiously subscribe to the 'style over substance' formula. Joffe's The Mission (1986) is no different from the usual unremarkable visual fares. All cinematography and no story. In fact, the film goes to great lengths to place any aspect before story  be it gorgeous nature visuals of the setting, classical musical score or actors. The latter is the most heavyweight weapon in its arsenal and it boasts of Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn... all of whom are ultimately unable to elevate The Mission above generic 'visual film' formula.It follows then that we have here an endless tirade of shots of trees blowing in the wind, pouring waterfalls off rocky cliffs, lush damp jungle air and, above all, long introspective images of Native Indians. If you have ever seen Malick's The New World  another fatal 'style over substance' self-indulgence dribble about settlers coming across a Native population  you know exactly what this film is like. Thankfully, it has slightly more substance when you scratch the visual-laden surface and it is more strongly acted by its leads. Nevertheless, expect the same kind of lofty narrative, lack of focus in dawdling nature visuals and SAME COMPLETE LACK OF ANY TEMPLATE STORY.There is, however, one scene that has remained with me from the film. This is Jeremy Irons embracing a crying, kneeling and broken Robert De Niro in the midst of the junglefloor, while the warm breath from the murky brown river gives rich to a tense, beautiful atmosphere. This is regrettably as poignant as it allows itself to get because a minute later it zooms back into listless wandering with the camera and falls apart once again. It simply loses itself in its own self-indulgence of nature portrayals and the Native civilisation, which is not nearly as fascinating or mesmerizing as the film tries to have you believe. Sure, it's pretty; it's picturesque  but what else?I set out to watch The Mission for its triumvirate of fantastic actors (Irons, De Niro, Neeson) but was offered no showcase for any of their acting abilities. Although it was quite interesting to see a young very Oirish-looking Liam whenever his character was squeezed in between the thin nature visuals. It needs to be said that this is not an unwatchable film unless you have a short attention-span and demand non-stop action. It does, however, need to be said that The Mission is not a poignant or remarkable film and it manages merely competent.5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best movies I've seen,"It may well be due to the soundtrack which is absolutely outstanding. But the cinematography is quite well done. And the story is a reasonably good rendering of a complex historical issue. I do not currently have it in my collection but I hope to add it soon. However the soundtrack has never been far from my CD player (now perma-loaded on my ipod). It's been years since I last saw the film yet many of the details of the film are still vivid in my mind. While there are a few films which I like on an equal level, I am hard pressed to think of a film better than The Mission.

Poignant and inspiring epic tale of a Jesuit mission to the Guarani,"This is an incredible film...historical tale, religious experience, character study, and disturbing depiction of native peoples' abuse at the hands of their European masters. I've forgotten some of the details as I only saw the movie once when it was first released, but its basic themes & main characters have stayed fresh in my mind all these years, particularly the sense of awe I felt upon leaving the theatre following the dramatic closing scenes.Set in the mid 18th Century, the story revolves around Father Gabriel, a Jesuit priest and missionary, who travels to the South American wilderness, establishing an evangelizing mission to convert the native Guarani peoples to Christianity and teach them certain aspects of European civilization. The Spanish soldiers attempt to thwart his efforts, especially the mercenary slave trader, Rodrigo Mendoza, who views these natives only as savages & chattels. Mendoza later experiences personal redemption following the murder of his own brother and joins Father Gabriel as a priest, working at the mission. When Spain cedes the colony to Portugal, both men must work to defend their mission against the brutal Portuguese aggressors who seek to enslave the natives.Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro are both magnificent in their respective roles as Father Gabriel and Rodrogo Mendoza. The film contrasts these two very different men and their polar opposite approaches to the threatening Portuguese. Father Gabriel (Irons) is a thoughtful man who advocates peaceful means (prayer and hymns), in keeping with the Jesuits' belief in nonviolence. On the other hand, Mendoza (De Niro) takes a more direct and violent approach with armed resistance, guns & bloodshed. Earlier in the film, Mendoza's personal experiences in seeking forgiveness for his brother's murder are also dramatically captured, as he is converted from heartless mercenary to benevolent priest. Gabriel is consistently a kind, selfless, & incredible pillar of faith throughout this story.The events are based on the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, where Spain transfered part of South America to Portugal. Spain and the Papacy apparently showed no concern regarding the plight of these Guarani, certain to elicit a sense of outrage in the viewer. However, the Jesuits at this mission are both devout in their faith and dedicated in their service to these natives.The South American scenery is utterly spectacular, the Oscar winning cinematography superb, and the music & costuming perfect. However, the compelling aspects of this magnificent film are the character portrayals of Father Gabriel & Mendoza, the sacrifices these Jesuits are prepared to make for this mission, the beauty of the peaceful native Guarani people, the abundant symbolism, the sense of grave injustice that these South American natives are nothing more than helpless pawns to European politicking, and the brutal atrocities to which they are subjected at the hands of the encroaching Portuguese. This movie is a masterpiece...a tragic, poignant, & heart wrenching, yet ultimately uplifting epic tale that is certain to remain with you for years. It is amazing viewing for anyone, but especially inspiring for people of faith.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An excellent and moving film,"I would have to say that this is probably my favorite film of all time. Its got an amazing cast, with Irons particularly giving a powerful performance of great depth. De Niro is very good, although his underdeveloped character in the film prevents him from showing his true range as an actor. I especially liked the even-handedness of the story line. While many movies that deal with the exploration of the western hemisphere present a simplified and inaccurate portrayal of the European and Indigenous people's roles in that segment of world history, The Mission is written with a depth and complexity that better reflects what was really happening at that period of time. I first saw this movie in high school and have watched it again and again during 9 years of undergraduate and graduate education in Anthropology, and the insightfulness of the storyline still impresses me. Written as a screenplay that attempts to make the viewer think about history, culture and human interaction, it succeeds on all counts.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Think,"For me, along with `Dances With Wolves' by Costner, `The Mission' was a drop of sincerity and reflection. These two movies are alike in their most general message, that being pondering over relations between two worlds - the old one and the new one, and the crack the World gave after these two worlds previously unacquainted faced each other.`The Mission' is not a completely hollywood-style article. Fortunately, it `lacks' pathos and leaves no hope. The first thing I like about this movie is its historical truthfulness. It was indeed the Misiones province of Argentina named so because of the missions. It is indeed the Iguazu waterfall. They were indeed Guarani people. It is indeed the place where borders of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet. The second  is the objective picture of a piece of the Southern American history the movie tries to deliver. There is no black and white, no absolute truth, and no absolute God. The key merit of `The Mission' is that it makes you think - the thing that is obviously in scarcity in nowadays' cinema. And it also makes you wonder. But one can find no answer.The film is hardly known among viewers if at all, nobody knows why, while it shows some unexpected facets of Jeremy Irons' and Robert De Niro's talents. Silent tough men whose burning worlds are all inside.This film is not for spending time, it is for looking around and back and thinking. That is why I like it. And also of course because it's so rare to see a movie talking to you about these things, about this continent, its people and its past.",,Anonymous,History

Gorgeous music,"Producer David Puttnam evidently has a gift for selecting composers that can lift good films to the status of seemingly great ones. In 1981, Puttnam hired the Greek composer Vangelis to write the score for a low budget film about two obscure athletes who competed in the 1924 Olympic Games. The resulting score, which was the most memorable attribute of the film, catapulted ""Chariots of Fire"" to a Best Picture Academy Award. A half-dozen years later, Puttnam selected the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone to pen the score for a high-minded film about the Church-sanctioned abuses of indigenous people in 18th-century South America. The result was a magnificent musical work that not only enhanced ""The Mission,"" but remains as one of the finest scores ever written for a motion picture. However, like ""Chariots of Fire,"" Roland Joffe's ""The Mission"" without its music would be less impressive.While Chris Menges's beautiful cinematography of Iguazu Falls and the South American jungles makes every frame suitable for a National Geographic centerfold, the tale of two men with conflicting moral centers often plods under the weight of its importance, which is written with a capital ""I."" Although Robert Bolt wrote the script with obvious conviction and feeling for the injustices doled out by the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors, good intentions do not always hold the audience's attention. The man of flesh, who is intensely played by Robert De Niro, struggles with his conversion from bloody soldier to submissive Jesuit. Meanwhile, the man of spirit, equally well delineated by Jeremy Irons, ponders the hypocrisy of his Church, which seems to put politics and greed above spirituality and souls. Unfortunately, when Morricone's soaring music is not swelling through the speakers, inner struggles with guilt, penance, and the meaning of life do not make compelling cinema.However, patient viewers who can immerse themselves in the music and the painterly images on screen may find ""The Mission"" a moving experience that will leave them angry with the fate of the indigenous peoples who still struggle to hold onto their culture. One character rhetorically asks if these people would not have preferred that the Europeans had never arrived. Although ""The Mission"" is less than the sum of its parts, the film is nevertheless worth seeing for its fine performances, stunning photography, and, above all, unrivaled music.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Once the mid-section begins to slot into place a lot of the momentum starts to weaken somewhat as 18th century politics takes over, but with that said it doesn't ruin the film by any means as the final few scenes wrap the film up well.

A piece of  our story  that merits attention,"The Mission has been recommended to me through a friend of mine. This film is based on true events about the Spanish and Portuguese colonialism in South America in the 18th century. It shows in easy way the brutal combat against the Indians. There are a few themes that gave me to think even later. For example the position of the church and the hungry idiots that wanted enlarge their power in these poor countries against every price. An historical event that in reality continues nowadays on our planet. I take with me one of the sentence heard in this movie: ""The world is so"". ""No, it is the way we did the world!"".....Robert De Niro delivered no doubt one of his best performances. Don't expect mega action show. In fact the fight scenes are executed poorly.

Simply church propaganda.,"The whole movie plot is about to show us, what good the church do, when it can. In reality, where the church go, there bring chaos, death and degradation of culture. A prime example could be all the crusades against Arabs/Muslims. At that time we should learn from them, rather that convert them to Christianity by sword and fire. These jesuits are presented as heroes, but into reality, they bring the destruction of the Indians by driving them from the jungle to homes, witch can be subject to attack and conquer by the ""settlers"". Back in Europe is was the jesuits, who started the chase on witches. So, given the general reality that any religion is just for control of people, I see these movie as unjust and very unfair church propaganda. Yes, there are individuals that tried to do good. But they can't overstep the shadow of their curse - their religion. Cristian religion (very interestingly founded by jews) is prime example of religion to divide and control the mankind. By proclamation of fake values it turning the real values to dust and bringing the degradation of culture altogether. The fall of Rome is nice example of early christians (jews?!) work. It is good to mention that when Rome fall, the ""holly lands"" ""god promised"" to jews are then free of Romans and fell into control of jews, so they had the motive too...

"Roland Joffe's follow up to the masterful The Killing Fields is well-crafted and often easy to admire, but ultimately comes up a bit short.","Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Back in 1984, Roland Joffe accomplished the near impossible; his major motion picture debut, The Killing Fields, defied every expectation typically associated with neophyte filmmakers and what Joffe delivered was one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. So it's no surprise I highly anticipated his follow-up film, The Mission, and it's obvious that by bringing back the same team (producer David Puttnam, cinematographer Chris Menges, and editor Jim Clark), they attempted to capture the proverbial ""lightning in a bottle"" a second time. Unfortunately, the end product isn't quite cinematic magic.Set in the 18th century, Jeremy Irons stars as Father Gabriel, one of several Spanish Jesuit priests (including Liam Neeson) assigned to convert the Guarini tribe of South America into Christians. His efforts are gradual, but successful. Converging with this story is Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro), a slave trader who seeks penance after killing his own brother in a fit of rage. For all the Guarini that he has killed or sold off into slavery, they still show compassion and forgiveness towards him, and he is accepted into the mission, even converting into a Jesuit priest under the guidance of Father Gabriel.The priests and the Guarini natives eventually find themselves in heated discussion with politicians and slave-owners, who are debating over whether the mission should fall under the rule of Portugal, thus endangering all the Guarini with the possibility of being made into slaves. Determined to prevent such an action at any cost, Mendoza takes up his sword once more, coming into conflict with Father Gabriel's peaceful approach.The Mission was released in 1986 with little success in theaters, despite garnering a respectable 7 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Since then, it's developed a devoted fan base who consider it among the most underrated films of the decade. As much as I'd like to, I can't quite agree. Though a respectable and often beautifully crafted effort, the film ultimately comes up short in human interest and emotions, with Joffe often favoring lingering shots of lush jungle scenery and needlessly overlong political machinations involving secondary characters whom we couldn't care less about.The film is divided into three acts, the first, involving the spiritual transformation of Mendoza, is easily the most compelling. Despite De Niro's occasionally stilted performance (his delivery of some of the dialogue, particularly ""Are you laughing at me?"" still makes me cringe), his emotional torment is heartfelt and absorbing and his acceptance into the mission is genuinely moving. It's almost all downhill from there.The build-up in the second act is initially effective, with the heated debate over the Guarini engrossing, but the conflict eventually loses steam when we're subjected to dull, endless dialogue that grows inadvertently confusing even as it intends to clear up the matters at hand. It's also in the middle segment the film loses its human focus and all that's really left is the question of will they or won't they fight.The third act is the inevitable battle, and while there are a few powerful moments amidst the chaos, the sequence is a badly choreographed mess. The editing also feels a little rough, with quite a few scenes feeling like they clocked in a little too soon (the sudden transition after Irons' ""God is love!"" line is disjointed, to say the least). The Guarini are never developed beyond the typical ""noble savage"" portrayal, so it's difficult to feel for their plight beyond the fact that their forced subjugation and mass slaughter is a heinous crime. I wanted to feel more for them, but they're merely a backdrop for the more seasoned cast.As Father Gabriel, Jeremy Irons is superb, unquestionably one of the film's consistent bright spots. It's unfortunate he's never that well-developed in any of the film's separate acts, but his performance alone is able to draw us in even if the script lets him (and the audience) down. In supporting roles, Ray McAnally and Liam Neeson are excellent, though a bit limited in screen time. For Neeson, this was more of a hint of greater things to come.Ennio Morricone's score deserves a special mention; whatever emotions Joffe is unable to convey on screen, Morricone's music can conjure in just a few notes. It's one of the most beautiful scores I've had the pleasure to listen to, especially in segments with oboe and flute. The chorus in the background is perhaps a bit much, but an overpowering score can do wonders in a film otherwise unable to muster all the intended emotions.Joffe's work in the film is still overall quite solid, but he completely lost his footing soon afterward, losing a grip on his career with a long string of critical and financial disasters, including Super Mario Bros., The Scarlet Letter, and Goodbye Lover. I'm convinced The Killing Fields was not a fluke, but the sign of a genuine auteur who showed his prowess thanks to a brilliant script and cast. Blend those two elements with his natural skills and I'm sure we'll get a film worthy of mention alongside his debut. Let's just hope this happens sooner rather than later.",,Anonymous,History
"High, wide and handsome","Roland Joffe's movie belongs to that epic tradition of British cinema one associates with Richard Attenborough or David Lean, (it is scripted by Robert Bolt, a long-time collaborator of Lean's), and is none the worse for it. It succeeds in being intelligent, intimate and full-blown, not quite in the ""Lawerence of Arabia"" class but very much in the same ballpark.The subject is the Catholic Church and the Portuguese government's treatment of the Guarani Indians in the conquest of South America. A different producer, (in this case, Lord Puttnam), and director, (Joffe, finding his feet magnificently), might have handled the material differently, filmed it in a more abrasive style befitting its subject matter, but if the film is mostly high, wide and handsome rather than dark and genuinely disturbing, you can't fault it's makers sincerity or skill in delivering the goods. It is both moving and exciting.Unfortunately, the performances don't measure up to either the subject or to the scenery with the exception of Ray MacNally's duplicitous Cardinal and Bolt's script reduces everything to black and white with no shades of grey; not so Chris Menge's luminous colour photography while Ennio Morricone's score is among his very finest.

Liam Neeson,"18th century Spanish Jesuits try to protect a remote South American Indian tribe in danger of falling under the rule of pro-slavery Portugal.""The Mission"" is based on events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, in which Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. A significant subtext is the impending Suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit.What struck me about this film is that I watched it immediately after ""Cannibal Ferox"", another tale about Europeans / Americans going into the Amazon where the natives speak a little Portuguese. Both can be seen as anti-colonial films, though one is a period piece and the other is modern day (1981). What other messages do they share?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bring it back!!,"This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen! This film took me to a place and time that I have never seen before in a mainstream film. Never before have i become so emotionally involved in a film. The characters portrayed in this movie are characters with strength, courage and determination. The excellent cinematography taken of the breathtaking jungles of South America along with the beautiful music by Ennio Moricone makes this film a masterpiece.Since I'm only 14, dramas aren't exactly my cup of tea so i was very reluctant to see this film. But for many years of my parents talking about how great this film was i finally decided to see it. I looked at the awards won by this film and was very disappointed that it only won Best Cinematography at the Oscars. Talk about underrated!! I told my friends about this film and absolutely none of them had even heard of it.

The dead will live in the memory of the living.....,"I think this movie deserved much more attention than it's been given, cause today, June the 14th 2006 (20 years after its release), I realized this movie is one of the closest to perfection. This is how a movie should be like! I love the story (and the way its told), I love the score (Morricone rules!), I love the photography (simply amazing and fascinating), I love the acting of both the main actors (don't need to name them) who help the talented director Roland Joffe' depicting one of the finest images of the struggles the native South Americans have been through centuries ago just to keep their culture and identity alive (and the battle is still raging, as we can read in the ending lines). This is a movie filled with pure and deep humanity, charity, this is about mistakes and forgiveness, sins and redemption, the power of weapons against the weight of love, but most of all, the lessons we read between its lines is that, even in death, hope never dies, like the memory of great people will live forever as the living keep it alive.

An oscar-winning film that has aged badly,"''The Mission'' is a drama directed by Roland Joffé. The film is based on historical events and tells us the story of a group of Jesuits trying to found a mission in Guarani territory. Among them, a priest played by Jeremy Irons and a former slave hunter, performed by Robert de Niro, who joined the mission in order to find God's forgiveness.The film revolves around the sale of Guaraní territories by Spain to Portuguese. A sale that forces the natives to fight and the Jesuits to make some choices.I found this film magnificent. ""The Mission'' was shot In Iguazu National park in Argentina, a fantastic place. The photography of the waterfalls, which separate the European ""world"" from the Guarani world, lets us breathless. The film is also driven by an excellent cast that plays truly and contributes to the tragedy of the film. The soundtrack is also successful, very good. The music composed by great Ennio Morricone is powerful and touching.But ""The Mission"" has some problem. It is slow, too slow. The pace of the film certainly lets us appreciate the beauty of the South American landscape but too long scenes sometimes almost drown us into boredom.This feeling of slowness is reinforced by the fact that the film has simply aged badly : the action scenes, fighting scenes, are nowadays hard to believe and take us out of the story.''The Mission'' is a magnificent film which raises awareness about the impact of humans on nature. I had a pretty good time watching this movie. On the other hand, its duration and its slowness can make viewing difficult. ""The Mission"" will not appeal to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Superb telling of how christians' interpretations of the ten commandments can vary,"This movie, more than most I have ever seen, demonstrates graphically, and accurately (from a normal, human point of view, not academician), the net result of the union of fanaticism and greed, where one compliments the other. Where the tyrants and plunderers go, the frock soon follows, (or is it the other way around?) De Niro's character demonstrates how true faith is the result of enlightment, not coertion, self-affirmation, not self-negation. And Jeremy Iron's character represents the true calling of priesthood: Self sacrifice, surrender to the work of healing and loving.Even the land itself, after almost 300 years, appears pure and ready to forgive.This movie touches the soul of all but the most ethnocentric of us to a depth not previously experienced.",,Anonymous,History
One of the best,"Now to give this movie 10 is a big deal as I think there are very few 10's out there.Im a sucker for movies based on historical events and this movie portrays a beautiful captivating story based on the occupation of Spain in South America and the profitable slaving of the Amazonian rain forest people.What truly makes this a classic is the cinematography which earned it the Oscar and Golden Globe for this catorgory in 87.You top this off with some of Ennio Morricone best work and you have the making of some uplifting scenes which will humble you.The story is simple as it happened a lot in the 1700's. Jesuits were sent out to teach the word of god in this case Jeromy Irons along with his notable follower Liam Neeson and they make there arduous journey into the Amazon.Meanwhile the Spainish which discovered and claimed the area, are making good money slaving the rainforest people as there is a demand for these exotic people. De Niro is a slaver and the film is based around his way of life and finding god.The catholic church is the other big part in this movie and this is represented by some fine acting by the late Ray McAnally who plays Altamirano.The soundtrack will grab you the scenes will leave you awed and the things we did to each other will appall and inspire....enjoy a 80s classic",10.0,Anonymous,History

Amazing demonstration of the injustices of Slavery and Conquest,"De Niro and Irons give great performances in this wonderful story of redemption, faith, and fear. As a converted slave hunter, De Niro's character gets a first hand look at the wrongs of slavery. This movie really asks the question, what right do men have over one another? Philosophers Locke, Rousseau and Hobbes all contemplate this question themselves. In the movie the Portuguese, who wish to capture and enslave the natives, think of the native people as animals, not deserving of freedom. Only beasts in the state of nature. According to these philosophers, man has no natural right to other's freedom and in this movie, it is demonstrated how this must be true. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in Philosophy.",10.0,Anonymous,History
In my Top 10,"Cinema at it's best. This is one of my absolute all-time favourites. The only reason I can see anyone ever not giving it 10/10 is that it has a tragic climax. I say we need more tragedies in film, if only to balance out the overwhelming tsunami of persistent and formulaic fluff at the multiplex. Fans will already know, but the same writer for The Mission, Robert Bolt, also wrote Ryan's Daughter, Laurence of Arabia, A Man for All Seasons, the Bounty, and Doctor Zhivago. It has one of the greatest stories of redemption in movie history. It's drop-dead gorgeous to watch, the acting is incredible and it stars Robert De Niro. Seriously, what more can you ask for? A few laughs? Some hot chicks? A happy ending? If you can live without these and have not seen The Mission, go for it, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I'm just glad that I didn't pay to see the film in the cinema; I watched it at a friends and left after an hour. I'm afraid that nice music and beautiful scenery can't make up for a poor film, though I have to admit that I couldn't bear to watch the final sixty six minutes.

Passion and excellence rarely seen in movies anymore.,"The fact-based plot of this film is as subtle and yet is as complex as the sequence of events that were actually happening during this time in the history of our world.  The setting is the Spanish-owned jungle territory of South America in the 1750's.  The Jesuit order of Catholics is hard at work establishing missions all throughout the region in their effort to convert the natives who live in the jungles.  The main focus of this part of the story surrounds the acts and deeds of Father Gabriel (portrayed to near-perfection by Jeremy Irons, who may be best known as the villain in Die Hard 3), who is desperately struggling--but succeeding in his struggles--at converting a small tribe of natives, who later work with him in the building of the mission San Carlos.  Father Gabriel and his small band of Jesuit priests befriend the natives, learn their language, and grow accustomed to their culture.  The natives, in return, willingly accept the priests' offer to teach them the ways of Christianity.Meanwhile, the South American slave trade is as active as ever.  One particular slave trader is a Spanish army captain turned mercenary, Rodrico Mendoza (portrayed with extremely effective passion by Robert DeNiro). Mendoza is in love with a woman who is in love with Mendoza's younger brother.  When the woman confesses to Mendoza her love for his younger brother, he grows furiously jealous, which culminates with the murder of the younger brother by Mendoza himself.  A Shakespeare-like sequence of events took place during these love/murder scenes that I'm sure the Bard himself would have very much appreciated.The stories of these two men merge together seamlessly and form a powerful, complex tale that only history itself could express more beautifully.  The result is a film that is better to be seen than to be read about.The cinematography is excellent, and the Academy agrees with me, as it awarded the cinematography with an Oscar in 1986.  And in regards to the performances, every single performance is to perfection.  No one over-acted nor were they bland with their parts, no matter how large or small.  But kudos goes especially to the two leads:  Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro, who both deserve as much praise as they can possibly get for their performances in this film.  DeNiro definitely was the actor of my favor during the first half of the film, but Irons stepped up and performed his absolute best throughout the entire film, especially during the last half.  He has never performed a more amazing role than this role of Father Gabriel.  DeNiro's role in this film is second perhaps only to the brilliance of his performance in ""Raging Bull,"" as far as I'm concerned.Action, drama, a message that isn't forced or preachy but is definitely filled with meaning and significance, this film has all the prime elements of a superb, cinematic achievement the passion and the excellence rarely seen in movies anymore.",,Anonymous,History
"DeNiro With A Sword, What Could Be Better?","SYNOPSIS: Jesuit missionaries struggle to build and protect a mission in the Amazon jungle during the late 1700s.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Often times, good does not triumph over evil. But it is still worth the struggle.PROS AND CONS This is a very good film. It won the Grand Prize at Cannes and also won an Oscar for best cinematography for obvious reasons. According to the opening credits the story depicted in this film actually happened.The acting in this film is somewhat low key with the story and the scenery taking center stage. Having watched this film several years ago, I was struck by my slightly different perspective after this viewing.The real focus is the turmoil and suffering of the Viceroy that is sent to administer the will of the king and not the fate of the native peoples or the Jesuits that are sent to show them salvation. The Viceroy, played by Ray McAnally, gives the best performance in the film as the ex-Jesuit Priest who now obeys the king and not the teachings of the church. In the end he is a shattered man, having done his duty against his better judgment.This film is about the difference between doing what is right and doing what you are told. The struggle we all have between being obidiant or following our heart. This is a dilemma we all must face at least once in our lives.The mercenaries and profiters try and comfort the Viceroy at the end of the picture by reaffirming that, ""This is the way it has to be. So is the world made."" To which the Viceroy responds, ""No, So have we made the world."" Even after 300 years, somethings never change. That is why this film still carries such profound meaning.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Still Stands As My Favorite Movie Ever Seen,"I first saw this production about 26 years ago, and my initial impressions were that the cinematography, settings, acting, writing, everything about it was fantastic. I have watched it time and time again over the years, and no other movie has yet surpassed this as being number one in my very long list of watched movies. It is a poignant story of grace, forgiveness, redemption and honor. It portrays these attributes in very moving ways, similar to Les Miserables. I try to see most films starring Robert De Niro, and my personal opinion is that his acting for this role was his best performance to date. Now, that is saying something, because I consistently find his acting brilliant in most of his roles (i.e., GoodFellas, Casino), even in the movie Stardust (where he provided us with a very unique performance). I don't want to detract from the acting by Jeremy Irons, which l also found tremendous. Despite the great acting and beautifully filmed settings, the top honors for this film should go to the fantastic story written by Robert Bolt, who formerly brought us renowned screenplays such as Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and other great stories before he passed in 1995. It is my hope that everyone see this historically monumental film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A little slow, but also sad and moving.","""The Mission"" is based on real events--though the ending is highly fictionalized. When the story begins, a lone Jesuit priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), treks through the jungle in South America to try to establish a mission where one had previously failed. However, he is very successful and soon the place is filled with eager native Christians. Additionally, Father Gabriel recruits a vicious slave trader, Mendoza (Robert De Niro) to join him at the mission--and soon Mendoza is converted and becomes a member of the order. All seems great...until a treaty is suggested which will move this mission from Spanish to Portuguese territory--and the Portuguese plan of dismantling the Missions. What's next? See this film.The film is extremely beautiful and was filmed in the jungles of South America using Colombian indigenous peoples. The music, though sometimes a bit repetitive, is also quite beautiful. The only complaint I had with this very compelling film was the ending. It made it appear as if the priests stayed behind and died with the Indians when they ultimately attacked, though they didn't. They were pretty much abandoned to their fate. Very sad, very thought-provoking and well worth seeing. Just be aware that the film (especially near the beginning) is very slow and if you are looking for a nice, happy ending then you should keep looking!",8.0,Anonymous,History
A great film,"When our Year 10 English class was told that we were to be studying the film 'The Mission', instead of 'Dead Poets Society', I was not impressed, because, among other things, I had never even heard of 'The Mission'. But, as the movie progressed, I was pleasantly surprised, and deeply moved by the beauty of the film. I not also mean that figuratively, but literally. The landscape was wonderful, and whilst the storyline was not a pleasant one, The Mission exceeded all my expectations . The symbolism runs rampant in this film, and my teacher, who could be considered mad, went to every length to point this out to us. The use of film techniques and music (wonderfully composed by Enrico Morricone - the theme song is now on the Sunsilk ad) added to what became for me a wonderful viewing experience. Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons were superb in their roles as the pertinacious yet confused Mendoza and the magnanimous Father Gabriel. This movie deserved more recognition than it received, and it deservedly won Best Film at Cannes in 1986. I think that is why I gave it 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Completely trivial,"I didn't like this movie. It had nothing to say. The characters were one dimensional and their motives were not explored at all. For some reason the character played by deNiro had no depth at all and his crying scene did not affect me at all. Only the background music told me that this was supposed to be a significant event. But, for me, it didn't seem so. The movie would have needed more human interaction all around to make those so-called meaningful scenes to actually mean something. And the ending was the worst of it all. Supposedly dramatic, but the only thing that affected me was the realisation that 'that was it!?'.Only 2/10 for this one.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A masterpiece of modern cinema.,"The effort that clearly went into this film shines out in all areas, which makes watching it a satisfying and absorbing experience. Visually the film is perfect, with some of the greatest cinematography ever viewed on screen, combining majestic jungle scenery with religious imagery and style. Ennio Morricone's musical score is another highlight, incorporating exultant vocals and pensive, moving segments in an effective mixture. The acting is less obviously excellent at the start, but becomes so in later scenes. Truly this film is underrated, too underrated: people condemn the length and occasional slowness of the film, but you do not notice either really. From the incredible opening scene to the moving ending you are carried along on an epic, spectacular and thoughtful voyage through the beginnings, troubles and workings of the mission in question and of the people involved in it.

Still potent after all these years,"I just finished watching a movie that, when I first saw it in 1986, made such an impression on me that I could think of nothing else for days. It came at a fragile and life changing moment in my life and for some seven nights I walked several miles back and forth in a bitter winter to see it at the once splendid Ontario Theatre in Washington, DC. The film was Roland Joffé's epic ""The Mission"" with the unlikely cast of Jeremy Irons, Robert DeNiro, Liam Neeson and Ray McNally. When I first saw it I thought it to be amongst the most beautiful films I'd ever seen, and nearly 25 years later, think so still. While nominated and winning many international awards, The Mission was mostly ignored by Hollywood, receiving only one Oscar (cinematography).The complexities of the story telling in ""The Mission"" are almost too much to take in in a single film lasting a bit more than two hours, but Jaffe has woven them together with a touch that is both delicate and profound, creating a tapestry as impressive and intricate as any medieval Flemish tapestry, its story held together flawlessly.While supposedly created for our own preservation and edification, politics and religion have done as much or more unspeakable horrors in the names of God and Man as they have good and in ""The Mission"" we see the bloody result, despite the effort of a few rebel priests who believe in the power of love and the natives with whom they try to share their world. The villains are plentiful in this ""true tale"" and Joffe never disguises them, allowing the deceptive simplicities of ""good versus evil"" run its predictable course, as they twist and turn everything they touch into the inevitable choked and knotted apocalypse of sorrow that is always the end result of greed.Despite its bleak, often hopeless nature, Joffe nonetheless gives us a miracle: a film of such ineffable beauty that stirs both heart and mind through the combination of remarkable acting, a wilderness captured in breathtaking cinematography, battles both physical and spiritual, and wed it all to one of the most remarkable musical scores of the late 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Why is that only interesting movies are financial flops?,"I know why some critics dislike this movie, it's because Robert de Niro is not the centre of attentions for a change. It's not really about him, it's about indians in the Amazon and it's about a piece of history Americans aren't familiar with (they probably don't even know who the Jesuits is, never mind Portugal or Marquis de Pombal). I absolutely loved it, I think Jeremy Irons was great in it, it was visually and melodically (Ennio Morricone) mesmerising, it made me think about the world being a rubbish place, about evil and power. The only thing I would like to say against it is that it portrays the Jesuits as being all about love and poverty. That is not true. One of the reasons why Marquis de Pombal and the King of Portugal wanted to end the Jesuit order was because they were filthy rich, they owned lands, they had a lot of power in those days. It wasn't just about the slave market, there were political reasons behind. Anyway, I don't know why I never watched this movie on TV, why I only found out about it through Ennio's soundtrack, because it's essentially amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I have never seen a film that looked so... genuine.

Mediocrity at best,"I see from the other reviews that people had a lot of good things to say about this movie, and I'm not denying the cinematography or the score.

The movie brings up a conflict between two Jesuits, one who is for peace and one who is for war, when they are both under attack. The same fate behalls them both. This movie in not satisfying in the least. It is boring with a couple of good waterfall shots. I know it's not an action movie, but the action that is in the movie is goofy and the score doesn't help it at all, either. Sometime the score even comes to ridiculously dramatic crescendo for no apparent reason. The acting is all fine, but there truley is little. Again, the score is good, the cinematography is excellent, good acting, now you just need the movie to bring it all togethor. And the fight coordinator should be killed.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"While with its flaws, still packs a very powerful punch","The Mission had a lot of talent on display(Jeremy Irons, Robert DeNiro, Ennio Morricone) and fortunately doesn't waste that talent. Could it have been better than it was? Yes. Is it a good film still? Yes it is, with its best components being absolutely outstanding.What stuck out as particularly outstanding were the production values and especially Ennio Morricone's music score. The Mission's cinematography looks gorgeous and the scenery and period detail are nothing short of magnificent. It does have to be one of the best-looking films of the late-80s. Words cannot describe how truly amazing Morricone's score is here, easily ranking among his best and containing at least two of his most memorable themes. The Gabriel's Oboe theme is the most well-known theme, and justifiably, it is hauntingly beautiful, and The Falls is also justifiably famous. For me however, it was the To Earth As It Is In Heaven track that really sends shivers down the spine.In terms of writing, The Mission is a long way from flawless, but nevertheless a good deal of the script is very thoughtfully written and evokes thought and emotion for a while after. The story is mostly compelling and deeply moving emotionally, with an especially powerful final act. The subject matter is devastating enough as it is, and The Mission deals with it intelligently and movingly, while the well-meaning message resonates on an emotional level and without being too preachy. The characters, while on the whole not the well-developed in the world, are still interesting and carry the film well, none of them feeling pointless. Cardinal Altamirano is particularly well-realised. The direction acquits itself fine and The Mission is generally strongly acted.The two best performances came from Jeremy Irons and Ray McAnally. Irons brings huge amounts of heart and great sincerity, he is particularly good at the end. There his acting is heart-breaking, and even with saying little to nothing at all. McAnally is advantaged by having the most interesting character in the film, and he plays with real authority and ruthless abandon, while succeeding in giving some dimension and light and shade. Look out also for a young Liam Neeson, whose appearance read as a promising one.On the other hand, The Mission does contain some flabby pacing. This is especially true in the middle act, where it does get talky and bogged down in some heavy-handed politics. For personal tastes, too, Robert DeNiro's performance is uneven. He does have some wonderful moments, with the character's torment and emotional turmoil being very heartfelt-ly portrayed. At other points however he seemed detached to the drama and somewhat out of place, especially in some of his line delivery, which bordered on aggressive and being more at home in a Scorsese film(one line and his delivery of it reminded me of Taxi Driver and it takes one out of the period setting). Aidan Quinn also doesn't fare too badly in the acting stakes but jars a little in the setting.All in all, could have been better, but the production values, Irons, McAnally and especially the music score are enough to make the film well worth seeing; they are superb and as a result the film for all its flaws still packs a very powerful punch. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,History

I was 13, and I was utterly captivated and moved by this beautiful masterpiece.I won't tell you the story - you can read that elsewhere.  But it contains possibly one of the best displays of raw acting ability I've ever seen - Robert DeNiro (who else?)His ability to portray essentially two different characters, yet maintain a sense of cohesion throughout is magnificent.  I remain moved and enthralled by his change of heart in this film, and his ability to constantly, in every movie he has ever made, but this one especially, make you believe and care about him.Jeremy Irons has a wonderfully subdued yet brilliant part as the missionary who brings DeNiro into the flock.  His quiet faith and unwavering pacifism and belief that God's will be done is almost enough to make an unbeliever like me have faith.Ennio Morricione (i believe that's how you spell it) constructs yet another memorable and fitting score to this movie.

Robert De Niro is the Spanish mercenary and slave trader who sees the Light, wielding cross and sword with equal vigor in this visually rich but difficult and often uninvolving drama. The story itself is all but overwhelmed by the spectacular photography and my Ennio Morricone's typically overwrought music score, which at least succeeds in distracting attention away from the stiff formality of Robert Bolt's screenplay. Sincere efforts and a well-intended message ought to count for something, but the film distills complex issues into a simple slaughter of innocent women and children, with the added, condescending title reminding audiences of the continuing destruction of primitive cultures.",4.0,Anonymous,History
G*d So Loved The World,"In the highlands of what is now Paraguy, Jesuit priest Jeremy Irons founds a mission for the Guarani people, as a refuge from Portuguese slave traders. Reformed slave taker Robert De Niro soon joins him. But Spain and Portugal are swapping territory, and everyone is worried about the power of the Society of Jesus. Can the mission survive against all these forces?It's a movie that needs to be seen on the big screen, and I did not, alas. Chris Menges cinematographer, Ennio Morricone's score, and the performance of Jeremy Irons could not fail to benefit what is a fine movie even on a television set. Although DeNiro is given first credit in the cast, and much more screen time, it's Irons who impresses me. His thoughtful, guarded manner is often used in the movies to hide a duplicitous nature. Here, it guards a heart too big for this wicked, wicked world. With Aidan Quinn, Ronald Pickup, and Liam Neeson.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I wish I could have so much love in my heart.,"The Mission, 1986, written by Robert Bolt, directed by Roland Joffe.Wow.  Powerful, yes, but not heavy handed.  It's a shame that excellent writing like this is so rare in movies.  Or maybe it's just rare in general. I didn't find myself focusing on the writing.  That's because it was so good that random clever or ""deep"" or ""profound"" dialogue didn't stick out. I was never pulled (or is it pushed?) out of the story by the writer's ego. Damn this was good.A summary of the story can be read elsewhere, so I'll just tell you how this film touched my heart.  It reminded me that love takes many forms.  So does courage.  Redemption is gained through both.

Love or Hate it Thought-Provoking Film,"The Mission contains all the ingredients needed to be a great film. It was spearheaded by Roland Joffe, a British film director, who wanted to take on another ambitious project like his previous film The Killing Fields (1984). It was shot by Oscar winning cinematographer (Chris Menges) who reunited with director Roland Joffe two years removed from the critically acclaimed film Killing Fields. It was written by a well-respected 2-time Oscar Winner screenwriter Robert Bolt. For those of you who do not know he wrote (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and A Man For All Seasons) three movies I have seen at least three times each. The film consisted of an all-star cast Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, and Ronald Pickup. There were upcoming actors people who be familiar with, but May not know Liam Neeson was in this and Aiden Quinn was in this. The cast is made up of the finest actors and extras any film crew could ask for to make a film of this magnitude. People reading this review should be familiar with a brilliant conductor, orchestrator, and composer by the name of Ennio Morricone who wrote the Oscar- Nominated worthy musical score of The Mission (1986).Morricone opened my eyes to the world of such beauty. As other readers, year after year, read this review and think what the heck was he blabbering about I may tune into one of his pieces and find myself in a trance unable to wake for a few minutes to a several minutes when listening to his composed scores. Ennio Morricone like all great composers can assemble a classical score that allows the audience to have a connection with the music. Each piece he has composed was specific for the movie he did, but every music score he has ever composed is symbolic. It represents how the audience can lose themselves in their thoughts and minds for a few minutes to a few hours.You may know some of his other works such as; The Man with No Name Trilogy (Dollars Trilogy), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), Cinema Paradiso (1988), and The Untouchables (1987). All of which got some recognition, but he has composed hundreds of other musical pieces that are considered masterpieces. When he dies he will be remembered always. If you ever heard one of Morricone's musical scores at least one of his musical scores would move your heart, your mind, and your body. It is not possible to not be moved when you listen to the beauty in his music he created. If you are not moved by any of his music you are either deaf or do not have an interest in music.The film revolved around the events of the Treaty of Madrid 1750; in which at the time Portugal and Spain were the so called ""Superpowers"" of the known world. Great Britain would become the ""Superpower"" shortly, but they would lag behind these two countries for now waiting their turn. Portugal and Spain were discovering new lands and colonizing these lands they discovered such as the continent of South America. Both countries wanted a part of South America so they happened to draw an imaginary line across the continent and determined who would control what boundaries.As history suggests to us countries will try to exploit anything possible to gain control of land and its resources for wealth, influence, and power. It seems the Spanish saw the tribes in their boundaries, the Guarani Indians, as potential converts to Christianity, while Portuguese saw the inhabitants as nothing more than animals, only appearing to look like a human in flesh. Portuguese wanted to use these Indians as slaves for slave labor when the Treaty of Madrid occurred; Spain ceding part of Jesuit Paraguay. Between what each country's government wanted and the Catholic Church the region was unstable for years.The film is about the work the Jesuit Priests are trying to accomplish in South America before and after the Treaty of Madrid was signed by Spain and Portugal in 1750. The Jesuit Priests unlike certain people tried to learn the inhabitants' culture and language before they tried to convert them to Christianity and set up missionaries. The Portuguese did no such thing to learn their culture as they felt they were inhuman and they could not be taught. I will not bore you with any more details as other reviewers have told you plenty about Robert De Niro's character Rodrigo Mendoza (a slave trader), Jeremy Irons character Father Gabriel (Jesuit Priest). Ray McAnally's character Cardinal Altamirano who must decide what missions will remain under the Church's protection and must be done away. He is sent by the Vatican to decide such matters.The film is full of moral social commentary, as it shows what happens when an unsuspecting/unwilling people are conquered. Did the Guarani Indians really want to be converted to Christianity? Are we to think a peaceful, remote colony of Guarani Indians left on their own for thousands of years really wanted to become westernized or found? Who are we to judge what culture is more superior?The Mission forces us to think about topics as well. What would you do if we were part of the Guarani Indians whose culture was taken from us? What would we take with us? Everyone has their own answers to these questions. The film is a timeless classic, but some people will see it not. If everyone who has a good heart or a functioning brain they will realize this film is not bad. The director of the film said this, ""The first two movies I made The Killing Fields (1984) and The Mission (1986), I loved making, but in some ways they've been an albatross round one's neck. Everybody thinks that's what you're supposed to be doing."" These two movies were huge projects unlike his small projects thereafter.",9.0,Anonymous,History
great film,"this was a great film, but emotionally devastating.  beautiful cinematography, great dramatic performances, and historically accurate. riveting is a good word to describe this film, but i was emotionally drained with the ending - one of those films that mirrors reality in all its harshness, and one that should not be missed!",,Anonymous,History
Political fail,"In an all too simple storyline this film tries to blur the responsibility of religion in the slaughter of people.This movie tries to tell you, that there is in fact a good (Jesuits) and bad church (rest of the catholic church). And if everyone would follow the good part, well, heaven on earth.Even though not as brutal as the rest of the catholic church, the Jesuits were in some way pathfinders for the west. And they did not have, and do not have, any respect for foreign cultures and believes. In their blind religious faith they think (until today) that a non-Christian soul is lost forever. In fact losing its eternal afterlife.And that justifies almost anything to convert heathens into Christians. They were and are in strict accordance with Rome.A large church of course has a lot of factions, true believers and straight forward earthly politicians. So the roman catholic church never has been a pure spiritual organization and often enough sacrificed believe over power.So in this example of its history. Big surprise, isn't it? And sure, the natives are living in a paradise and are true angels. The usual romantic stuff. So the audience feels a lot of sympathy for the natives. Classic Hollywood.This combined with rather uninspired movie-making results in a shallow piece of irrelevance. The simplicity might make it appeal to the masses. But the film fails with all major historic issues.Do not watch it, if you are politically interested.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Exciting ethical common sense, excellent music and no moralist finger wagging","Set on the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in 1750, this exceptional film tells a tragic tale of European colonialism that not only had direct relevance to foreign interference in Latin America at the time of the film's release in 1986 (Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc.) but also, and more positively, to developments in more recent times (Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina). Joffé's film features Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro, the latter in one of his best performances. It also features the Waunana people who, enacting the Guaraní Indians protected by humanist Jesuits but eventually massacred by colonialist mercenaries working for Portuguese slave traders, also stand out as the film's true stars: they present credible, tangible individuals and never come across as exotic extras. Another powerful performance is given by Roy MacAnally whose character, Cardinal Altimirano, embodies the dilemma of the ""good man"" trying to work within an oppressive system and whose strategic efforts to save the Jesuit order in Europe lead to an unpardonable bloodbath.Morricone's score for The Mission is exceptional. ""Come farne un tutt'uno?"" - how to make an integral whole out of two humanist music traditions (European and Native American) - was his problem. That he succeeded to fuse these convincingly is patent. For example, ""Gabriel's Oboe"", mixed with the syncretic choral ""Vita Nostra"" and with its lead played alternately by oboe and recorder (flauto diritto of quena type), became a favourite to play at Brazilian weddings, while the soundtrack album has been a major commercial success worldwide. Morricone draws on influences ranging from the European avant-garde (those Penderecki-like slithering string clusters with huge death-drum hits at the very start, for example) to the thoroughly singable (e.g. main theme), from baroque chamber music to the suggestive use of Native American sonorities. His music contributes massively to the thoroughly humanist message of this movie and I find it incomprehensible that the composer did not receive an Oscar for this score. No matter: The Mission is a set work in my courses on Music and the Moving Image.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Compassion Surpasses Culture,"It's rare to see a movie treat reverence with, well, reverence.This film treats viewers to one man's journey from being engaged with a crew of slavers to finally giving up his mercenary lifestyle and reaching out to members of a tribe of natives in order that he can fortify both his own life, and theirs. Mutual understanding is the goal of De Niro's character, Mendoza, but the tribe have been mistreated in the past, and they are distrustful of the initial hand of friendship he extends. This is partly because Mendoza has former ties to the slavers, and partly because he now represents an authoritative religion in the Jesuits.Though the Jesuits' (and the protagonist's) credo is beneficent, he must consistently work to earn their trust in the hopes that both groups of people will finally be able to engage with one another symbiotically. He brings them a view of the world that is rigid in some ways, but with enough humility from his travails and enough compassion to compromise when necessary.All is not well, however, because though Mendoza and his mentor, Father Gabriel eventually earn the trust of the Guarani, elements within the governments backing the two peoples are pushing for a sectarian approach to the land, and its people.Mendoza and his mentor eventually decide that what motivates them is a love for the people, rather than a rigid adherence to the institutions that caused the situation to spiral out of control. Their efforts and the fate of the people caught under the governmental territory dispute come to light only as the movie progresses.The performances of all actors and especially the soundtrack to this movie help make it a stunning period piece in the history of rapid religious and imperial expansion, and provide a somber look at how one man can, with diligence, empathy, and sincerity, build bridges that unify, and that send a message of hope for the future.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It is nuanced and expressive despite the weight of its themes, which are some of the most profound and relevant issues of the human condition ever wrestled with on film.

Very valuable movie,"This movie works wonderfully on several levels. One, it could be said to be based loosely on the life of Bartolome de Las Casas, the contemporary of Columbus who originally went to the New World to take advantage of it, but became convicted in 1511 of the ""sin"" of the Spaniard's treatment of the indigenous populations and became the natives' greatest advocate, traveling back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, pleading on their behalf before all who would listen, including the Pope. De Las Casas is considered to be one of the first anti-imperialists.Second, it could be said to be a powerful statement of liberation theology, which began to emerge in the 1950s, coming to full flower by the late 1960s. Produced in 1986, the philosophical struggle between arming oneself against oppression (De Niro) or ""turning the other cheek"" to that oppression (Irons) is portrayed in this movie as a non-choice: one must fight against the oppressor, even though The Church forbids it. This is the message of the liberation theology movement, which began with priests working in the barrio who saw their bishops and archbishops increasingly in bed politically and economically with the corrupt dictators who ruled their countries. These priests were faced with the dilemma of either fighting on behalf of their people, or obeying their superiors. Liberation theologists chose to fight on behalf of their people, much like the De Niro character.The fact that Father Daniel Berrigan plays a minor part in the picture is a nice touch. The Berrigan brothers, Daniel and Phillip, both Jesuit priests, took a courageous stand against the war in Vietnam, and paid for this stand with years in jail. They were part of the Catonsville Nine, which destroyed draft board records by, I believe, pouring blood on them. At one point, believe it or not, both priests were on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. Phillip died some years ago. Daniel is still alive.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Very interesting and touching historic film,"I saw The Mission thanks to the British Screen Festival, and it was a great discovery for me. Even if the movie by Roland Joffé was released in 1986, I actually liked it. The content of the film is based on the true story of slavery and Christian missions in South America. It gives us information about their lifestyle after the colonizers arrived, and explains the process of religious conversion by Jesuits.The film is very dramatic and we know from the beginning of the projection that there won't be a happy ending but it was actually interesting to see how the actors will grow when the film reaches a climax.During the film, there is a constant opposition between love and might, religion and power, and it makes you think about the past, but also the present because this dilemma is omnipresent in our modern society (and always has been).Plus, the cast is really good, and the actors did a very good job portraying the characters: we can see Jeremy Irons in the role of Father Gabriel, a Jesuit, but also Robert De Niro performing Rodrigo Mendoza, a slave hunter converted into a devoted Jesuit. Two of them are really good actors.The music is also a masterpiece in this film. The mix of Indian rhythms with Christian spirituality and ecclesiastic chorus is very powerful and touching (even if you don't believe in God).So, I think it is well worth seeing if you like history and aren't afraid to shed a few tears!

The contrast in the characters of Irons and De Niro is portrayed beautifully, and yet the similarities in their courage,determination, and belief in their methods in almost identical.Aidan Quinn and Liam Neeson make up the more familiar names in the cast, and both give great performances in their own right, particularly Neeson, in his earliest film that I've seen.

My rating 9
That is a beautiful film. It gieves peace to the viewer, while showing a great battle between Spanish and Portugese authorities in South America, and the Indians who are trying to protect their territoey as well as Jesuit mission.
As I see, the main theme here is redemption. Redemtion of Mendoza in partucalar and Europeans in general. Though them, represented by Portuguese have a long and difficult path towards it.
So the Jesuits and the Guarani tribe are planning to fight to save the mission. Only Father Gabriel is ambiguos, as for him God is love, and the way of war is not for him.
Although the cast is marvelous, no one has leading position in the movie. the story is centred on Indian tribe and protection of their home - the mission. I like it very much.
The historic context is well put regarding treaty between Portugal and Spain about American territory. What and why they were doing there.
I have to admit, high priest is shown as true God´s person, yet we knw that veven churchmen had their evildoing part in South America.
So finally I think that this film redeems everyone apart Portuguese slave trading authorities.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"For the most part, this is a classic","This is one of those movies that I'm always happy to revisit. It's a religious-themed movie, but not in a way that would likely turn non-religious viewers off completely. I think it condemns a large portion of the Catholic Church while celebrating some of its individuals, though that could still be off-putting for people who would rather not see anyone within the institution being portrayed heroically.I don't know; it's hard to speak for everyone. But this film really works for me. It has a few flaws that hold it back from being 100% great: namely, it's a little slow-going in parts, with a few scenes that maybe drag on a little too long, making the pace occasionally challenging. I also think Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro both give great performances, but Irons' character is quite one-note, and De Niro's character goes through most of his character development within the first 40 minutes. It's a great character arc of course, but there's little for him to do until the film's climax, once he goes through it.But the climax itself is great: there's a real spectacle to much of the film, but especially its final 30 minutes. It's very powerful filmmaking, and it does make the slower scenes worth getting through. Also helping the movie more watchable: its visuals and its Ennio Morricone score. It's absolutely one of the best scores Morricone ever did, with several distinctly memorable themes that often overlap whilst perfectly accompanying the film's scenes, and being memorable pieces of music in their own right, divorced from the film.It's a really impressive film overall, and it feels truly authentic and ""real,"" thanks to all the real-world locations used, and just how visceral many of the film's action/""adventuring"" scenes are. It's amazing that there are only four stuntmen credited in the end credits for a film like this, and what they were able to achieve is pretty remarkable overall. I think it ends up being a good movie that's elevated by its music into becoming a close to great one.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Amazing!,"Me and the Pope agree on this one: ""The Mission"" is my favorite film of all time. It's been nineteen years since this film was first released and it still continues to set the standard for serious historical dramas. It not only touched upon one of the most important issues of the 1980s (the debate over liberation theology that was currently taking place in Latin America), but also provided important historical context and raised haunting questions about war, pacifism and the power of forgiveness for the human soul. It's still hard to watch this film without tears. Irons is great and DeNiro gives perhaps the greatest performance of his stellar career. It's hard to believe that such a milestone in film-making has continued to be somewhat overlooked in discussions of the greatest films of all time.

horrible,"The Mission tells the story of the effects of the Treaty of Madrid on native South American tribes and the Jesuits working to convert them. While this is a solid plot for a film, Roland Joffé displays the worst directing I have ever seen-a monkey could have done better-making this film complete trash.One of the more palpable failures was the sound track, a simple oboe tune that plays throughout the entirety of the film, which threatens to cause even the most energetic audiences to fall into a coma, the only purpose this film serves is putting hyper children into a deep sleep. This film does not display an actual antagonist but rather has characters that reinforce the idea of the unseen malicious presence of Portugal when done correctly this plot works well, but the poor execution and lack of explanation only serve in making the film more confusing. Even though this film was released in 1986 the effects are dreadful from bullets that leave a large circular hole when they enter with no exit wound nor blood splatter to actors looking down at the arrows already protruding from their chest as if they had just noticed them.

Very Good and Extremely Tragic,What I would call a heart breaker of a movie emotionally. It is no surprise to a lover of history that this sort of thing occurred on a regular basis but to watch it transpire on film is horrifying. Jeremy Irons gives a great performance and ditto for DeNiro. DeNiro is a pirate and killer who by unfortunate circumstances murders his brother and forces himself to atone for it. Irons plays a priest who saves DeNiro and gives him a purpose to his life. Become a priest and follow the order. DeNiro agrees to this and joins his cause. But events beyond both of their control force them to choose a path neither one wants. Their lives and the people in their mission are doomed and the cause is lost. Watching that priest on the cross fall over the waterfall in the beginning is one of the most shocking things you could ever see in a movie it sticks in your mind for years. Good performances by Adian Quinn and Liam Neeson. Must be watched to be experienced a review just won't do it or give it justice.,10.0,Anonymous,History
The Mission sets the standard for religious films,"The Mission is one of the most uplifting, inspiring, and at the same time tragic films I have seen in a very long time. It tells the tale of Roberto Mendoza, who was a wealthy mercenary and slaver until an unthinkable act committed in a moment of anger compelled him to seek absolution. He found it in the arms of the church, and in serving the very people he had once preyed upon. But when the people he has dedicated his life to are threatened, he will give everything he has to protect them. This is a story of the power of faith and redemption, devotion to a higher cause, and the tragic consequences of man's lust for land and power. The ending is not a happy one, but is more powerful for it.This is something of an unusual role for De Niro, better known for playing mobsters than monks, but he absolutely nails it. There are similarities to his previous roles. As Mendoza he is hot tempered and oft impulsive, a man of strong passions and strong opinions. But he also becomes a man of humility and compassion. He exudes a palpable sense of remorse and self loathing throughout his penance, and his joyous collapse atop the plateau is perhaps the most beautiful and overwhelming expression of emotional catharsis I have ever witnessed. He displays so many conflicting emotions, from despondency and brokenness to acceptance and ecstasy.The effects of this transformation are present throughout the story. Mendoza works tirelessly to serve needs of his flock and give them a voice before the powerful, risks hardship and danger in the service of the Lord and humbly submits himself before authority, even when he knows he is right. And in the end he and his brothers show themselves willing to defend their home and calling with their very lives, although it is not with reservation that he once again takes up arms. This devotion and obedience stands in harsh contrast to the pride and greed of the nobles, who are ruled by their own desires without regard for life or fear of God.De Niro's acting is far from the only beautiful thing in this movie. The film's shooting locations deep within the Amazon are magnificent. The lush jungles, sheer cliffs, and roaring waterfalls are filmed in stunning detail and drive home the remote and alien conditions the brothers- and the actors- worked under. Every pain has been taken to enhance the film's realism, with sets and costumes painstakingly detailed and the natives played by actual tribesmen. The climactic battle against the Portuguese is very well staged, by turns exhilarating and heartbreaking. Ennio Morricone's musical score is also worth noting. At times playful, majestic, and mournful, it underscores and enhances the actions and emotions in every scene.On a somewhat related note, I recently came across a discussion of James Cameron's Avatar, which also involves protagonists who defy authority and side with natives against encroaching settlers and their armies. One of the commenters made a lengthy and eloquent comment expressing his dissatisfaction with the portrayal of the natives and the interaction of their culture with humanity's. He rightly pointed out that although the N'avi are clearly meant to be the 'good' guys, they are essentially the stereotypical noble savage, completely egalitarian and living as one with nature, but without sophistication or lasting accomplishments. And more troubling to him was the fact that the two cultures had nothing in common, nothing to offer each other, and no chance of coexisting. The hero's climactic act is to become one of the natives, turning his back on his people, and driving the evil humans back to ""their dying world."" Cameron could have learned much from the Mission. The cultures here can and do blend. The Indians of the mission keep their own culture and dress, but live within the mission and worship God. Likewise Mendoza learns the natives' language and customs, is initiated as a member of the tribe, and leads their warriors in the final defense of their home. But he is still a white man. He dresses, eats, and sleeps like a Spaniard and remains foremost a member of the Jesuits, there to befriend and convert the Indians. He does not join the natives against European civilization; he defends them and his order against the worst of the colonial authorities. Both sides learn from the other and adapt without abandoning their own identity. And instead of some new age forest spirit, The Mission presents saving faith in Jesus Christ.This movie's first half is about finding forgiveness, acceptance, and a new and better purpose in life. The second is about holding fast to your conscience and convictions when all around you and above you are willing to compromise theirs and standing up for what you know is right, no matter the odds or the cost. All of it is beautiful, and having watched it I feel humbled by the courage and selflessness of these men, and hope that I can someday be half as righteous.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Compressed history,"This is a very good movie, specially since the producers have managed to compress over 200 years of history into a mere few years. I had done previous study about the subject matter of this movie, and that was certainly a help. One comment I would like to make: It is not clear in the movie why the Indian community would disintegrate so completely in the end. In real life the reason was not so much militairy conquest, but rather the abolishment of the Jesuit order and the ensuing leadership vacuum. The locals had not provided their own chiefs for more than 200 years. As an audio/visual spectacle this movie rates very high with me, I have watched it often and with much pleasure.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A heartwrenching film of mesmerizing beauty........,"What can one say of ""The Mission"", but that it is one of the most beautifully photographed films I have ever set my eyes on.  I first saw this epic film in 7th grade and it still haunts me to this day. If you are a lover of historical films this is a feast for the eyes.  It is also very sad because it shows you the demise of the native American peoples of Central and South America as a result of colonial Spain's conquests. Robert de Niro and Jeremy Irons give great performances here as Jesuit priests that yearn to save and teach the Indians.  Nominated for 7 Academy Awards and winning for Cinematography this film is a treasure that should be seen by everyone to remind us of how imperialism destroys civilizations and the beauty of other cultures.

Another fine film from Roland Joffe,"The Mission was a well written, well produced movie with terrific actors and authentic scenery. It should've won the oscar for best picture, for it was far better than Platoon. And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons didn't win an oscar here either. Oh well. Robert De Niro was great as captain mendoza, but he was unable to shake his new york accent (despite playing a spaniard). The cultural imperialism theme was adequately conveyed, without the hysterical opinionated frenzy of most other similarly toned stories. After all, the opening scene shows a nonviolent Jesuit crucified and floated over a waterfall by the natives he sought to help (though also convert). The lessons and irony of the story were also perfectly placed: the natives are shown to be victims, but was it their lack of savagery or technology that caused this? Of course the disturbing climax of the film was somewhat comforted by the ending, which briefly shows the children trying to rebuild their future. And Ennio Morricone's fantastic musical score was the highlight of the film, and a perfect complement to its rich south american locales.",,Anonymous,History
"Incredible!!! Very good movie, a lot of emotion and inspiring.","When I started to watch the film, I didn't know much about what was the historical true story used for it. So, at the beginning of the film I tried to understand stakes and what was going on. But I was immediately interested anyway because the film director, Roland Joffé made, inn my opinion beautiful choices with the settings . The Amazon rainforest and amazing waterfalls were really fascinating. Later, I started to focus on the story, the different characters, stakes and issues. The different points of views of every character were really interesting and well developed. I could really understand the oppositon between the Jesuits' positions with the Guarani (native tribes) and the mission to convert them but with pacific ways and the Spanish and Portuguese's position who want territories and slaves and don't mind using violence. The tragedy of the Guarani people really broke my heart and made me realize the terrible massacre that was committed un the past and made me think about the similar things that still happen in the current world.

Stick with it,"Irons plays a Jesuit priest who sets up a mission in the South American jungle which is then threatened by greedy merchants and political factions within the church with De Nero as a converted mercenary and slave trader. Roland Joffé's film looks superb thanks to Chris Menge's beautiful cinematography but has divided audiences and critics as to its content. It is true that the film moves along very slowly until the last half-hour and De Nero seems oddly detracted in his performance. However it never bores thanks to a sincere performance from the ever-excellent Irons and equal sincerity in Joffé's handling. Endlessly beautiful, the film evokes a true sense of period and setting with its production values, photography and Morricone's brilliant score. Although some will start fidgeting an hour in, the climax, when it comes, is deeply tragic and rewards all that has gone before and the film presents an interesting and provocative view about the hypocrisy of the church and the sheer brutality of human progress.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Jeremy Irons as a priest and Robert de Niro as a soldier working hand in hand against the cruel force of unacceptably enforced reality,"This is one of those films you will always return to, although you know how outrageously cruel and inhuman it is, and although you know you will be upset again ands remain so for a long period of time, but you will never forget it and always keep it in mind, for it hauntingly beautiful music, for its exquisite photography all the way through, for Jeremy Irons and Robert de Niro and their wonderful characters with Liam Neeson among them, and for its vitally important message echoing through all times, bearing witness for the dead against the living. You just have to love it, it's a story of redemption and persistence against impossible odds, of the true value and meaning of martyrdom, of the mortal vanity of the mundane world with its petty politics minding only political vain concerns of power and its futility, while only the eternity of love ultimately will prevail and remain, putting all else to shame. This was Roland Joffé's second film after ""The Killing Fields"" about the atrocities of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, but this is his masterpiece, while he continued to make films concentrating grimly on reality and revealing the true nature of evil, like in ""The City of Joy"" a few years later. But ""The Mission"" is unsurpassed for its beauty and colourful splendour, and if you hesitate to watch it again for its outrageous inhumanity, you could just interrupt it before the cardinal returns from his investigation trip to the mission territory to face again the crass reality of political interests and ruthlessness.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A great film. Avatar before Avatar.,"'The Mission' is a great film. But it had trouble when it was released. Trouble in the form of negative critical reviews. I remember the film's release, and the bad reviews. Also its disappearing more quickly than one might have thought; given its cast, its having won 'The Palm D'Or' at Cannes, and its majestic story.To this day I do not know the source / cause of the negative reviews. But I can guess. And it's this. Robert Di Niro. He is plain awful in the role of the slaver turned missionary. It is his voice, his dialect. It is all wrong. It is Brooklyn playing The King of England. That said, he has relatively few lines; as though the director Roland Joffe recognised the problem. But as one of the film's two protagonists, Di Niro does a fine job when not speaking. His body does the hard work when he is paying his penance for having committed an unspeakable crime. His eyes do the hard work when he is forced to listen to Catholic hypocrites and, even worse, apologize to them.The story. 'The Mission' provides the framework for the later film, 'Avatar', in that a character who is paid to brutalize another civilization, sees the error in his ways, joins that civilization, and comes to fight on its side. Di Niro is that character. Jeremy Irons is the priest whose role it is to (1) Save Di Niro, and (2) Save the indigenous people of a corner of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina from the land-grabbers and slave-traders of the Catholic Church. A young Liam Neeson plays a young priest who pledges his allegiance to the indigenous people.'The Mission' is filmed at or near spectacular Iguazu Falls. The cinematography surpasses anything I have ever seen. Certainly the actual falls and their role in the film make one long for the days before computer graphics. Here is the real thing. When the Irons character climbs the vertical walls beside the falls, there is no question in this viewer's mind that I was seeing Irons in real peril (even if, in fact, he was not).Finally, again I don't know why the film was panned as badly as it was. It was another time. Perhaps Di Niro, perhaps the fact that it won at Cannes, perfect Director Joffe was out of favor. The important thing is this.If you have the opportunity to see it, do.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A lesson of life,"I had the chance to discover The Mission thanks to my English teacher during an English film festival which took place in my school. The presenter described the movie before it started and told us it was a British classic. I can say now that he said the truth.In fact, the film was so powerful that it gives food for thought. Through a real story, the movie shows us a hard reality : the plight of indigenous people during colonization in the 18th century. But more than a historical retrospective, the film highlighted human psychology and behaviour during that period of history. I don't want to spoil the story for those reading this, but The Mission is really suitable for those who want to spend a good time full of surprises and twists. On the other hand, the cast is quite convincing with De Niro as Mendoza and Jeremy Irons as Father Gabriel for example. The indigenous children's faces are full of emotion too. I will conclude with an extraordinary lesson of virtue given by Father Gabriel, whether you share his convictions or not. As you can read, I recommend this film.

Criminally Underrated Beauty!,"I must be one of the only people that truly believe The Mission is a great movie. Do not get me wrong as the film got solid reviews and was a big player during awards season, but I do not believe it got the true recognition it deserves. This movie is a passionate, fiery film about religion and imperialism. It comes as no surprise that Roland Joffe is the man behind the camera as he tackled the likewise passionate The Killing Fields. The film expresses some important ideas within the historic background. As an avid student of history, the entire Jesuit history in South America perked interest in me. To me, it comes as no surprise that the film is powerfully directed by Joffe with two outstanding performances from Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons.The film was written by Robert Bolt. I really liked how Bolt decided to tell this story. The story is mostly told in flashbacks through a series of letters. This could have easily gone astray but Bolt kept everything on track and made the story believable. His screenplay was able to bring the history to the screen. By that, I mean that he was able to bring forth the differences between the imperialist slave traders who wanted to use the natives and their lands for riches and slaves, while the Jesuits believe they can turn the natives, the Guarani, into peaceful Christians. The story was based on the Treaty of Madrid which in 1750, Spain ceded some South American territory to the Portuguese who wanted to use the natives for slavery which Spain had abolished at the time. Interesting stuff!You cannot talk about the movie without talking about Ennio Morricone's score, which is definitely a gift from heaven itself. Talk about getting emotional multiple times during the movie. Thank you, Ennio! From ""Gabriel's Oboe"" to the haunting choir rendition of ""Ave Maria,"" this is one of the best scores of all time. Also, Chris Menges's Oscar-winning cinematography. Even though the movie was released in 1986, his views of the South American jungles are stunning. Maybe its that waterfall, but this could make a good travel movie in terms of location as it was filmed in Brazil and Argentina.The film centers around Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), a missionary whose goal is to transform the native Guarani into Christians. It is hard work for him considering they deeply mistrust white men in general for their thieving and murdering ways. Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) is an unlikely addition to the mission as he seeks redemption from the tragic death of his half-brother. The arrival of Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) spells trouble when he brings news that the land is now Portugal's and they want to enslave the natives. Mendoza, a former slaver, wants to fight back with armed rebellion but Gabriel believes in the power of prayer. Can these two men put aside their differences in order to save the mission?The performances from the two men are nothing short of excellent. Robert De Niro is awesome as usual and I loved his headstrong, emotional performance. That said, this is Jeremy Irons's movie. He nailed it as the priest. This is actually one of those performances that will convince people to become a priest...or at least help people that are in need. His final scenes are powerful and will never leave my mind. Any Liam Neeson or Aidan Quinn fans reading this? If so, keep your eyes peeled!Overall, I believe The Mission to be a great movie. If I had to make a complaint, the battle scenes can be confusing because the editing is choppy at certain points. Regardless, I loved the message this movie relayed. It is a complicated story thematically with different ideas about religion and colonialism. It also talks about a sad history that I am positive not many people know about. Joffe's sure-handed and fiery direction, Irons's godly performance, and Morricone's triumphant score make this film an emotional must-see.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History

**** from *****,"Breathtakingly beautiful, stunningly shot, narratively muddled, long, difficult and with a downbeat ending, but nonetheless powerful and superbly produced religious drama starring Jeremy Irons as a ambitious priest trying to establish Jesuit mission in the jungles of Brazil around 1750, accompanied by former slave-dealer Robert De Niro, who joins him after killing his brother Aidan Quinn for the love of a woman, and young priest Liam Neeson. But aside from cultural, linguistic and climatic problems, they have to face ruthless politics within and outside of the church undervaluing its importance. The cast delivers respectable performances and the script by Robert Bolt is thoughtful in examining diverse issues of belief, cultural differences, violence etc., but they are almost lost in brilliant scenery and Oscar-winning visuals from Chris Menges.

The music, composed by Ennio Morricone, is also outstanding, and serves to heighten the emotional impact of the story.The performances by the cast are excellent, particularly those of Robert De Niro, who plays a remorseful slave trader turned missionary, and Jeremy Irons, who plays a steadfast Jesuit priest. Their nuanced performances bring depth and complexity to their characters, and help to convey the film's central themes.One of the film's most compelling aspects is its exploration of the intersection of religion and colonialism. The Jesuit missionaries' desire to spread their faith and protect the Guarani people is complicated by their association with the colonial powers that are exploiting the same people they seek to help. The film does not shy away from the darker aspects of colonialism, and portrays the violence and exploitation inflicted upon the Guarani people with unflinching honesty.Despite its many strengths, ""The Mission"" is not without its flaws. Some may find the film's pacing slow at times, and its themes may be heavy-handed for some viewers. Additionally, the film's depiction of indigenous people has been criticized for being overly romanticized and for perpetuating the stereotype of the ""noble savage.""Overall, ""The Mission"" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that succeeds in exploring complex themes with depth and sensitivity. Its exceptional production values and performances make it a must-see for fans of historical dramas, and its exploration of religion and colonialism make it a valuable contribution to the ongoing conversation about these important issues.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Wonderfull!,"This incredible movie is focusing on a Jesuit who went to convert Indians to the Christianism but without any violence, no, with a lot of love. This Film is mind-blowing and gives another vision of colinisation. Throughout all the story we hope that the Indians will survive with the preters. The actors all have a very convincing role, all of them touch our heart, indeed Jeremy Irons, perfectly expresses goodness, which makies him a great actor. In reallity all is great: the music, which mixes Indian music and Christian music, the filming, very delicate and transitions... All these conditions make this film a masterpiece which gives you all emotions: happiness with child's laugh, sadness, anxiety and love. Love is all the point of this movie, love which in reality, wins the war even if there are a llot off deaths. So, with love, don't miss it or you will miss a life-changing masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great performances !,"The Mission is a film about Jesuits' intention to convert Indians into Christians, but is also about the war against slavery.I saw the film for the first time last week and I really liked it for a few reasons. First the film is set in South America, in the Iguazu National Park, so the landscapes were very beautiful and it felt like a travel to watch The Mission. Then I loved the actors' performances, the way the actors played their characters was excellent, the acting was true to life. Moreover, the camera work was also really great, so it was easy to get into the movie, and the music was touching, it made the film very entertaining. Also, the stakes of The Mission are universal because the plot focuses on settlers and religions, so in my opinion it is still interesting to watch The Mission today, even if the story is about colonization during the 18th century.The only negative aspect for me was some scenes that seemed very long to me but it was certainly the film maker's choice to focus on the character's emotions. Nevertheless, I think The Mission is a film to see, simply because it is a masterpiece.I really recommend it, whether you are passionate about cinema or not.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Indian and Christian spirituality, a movie with a powerful message.","The film has been directed by Roland Joffe, a great film director. The film is set in Iguazu National Park in Argentina. This place made the film more fascinating, the green landscapes were beautiful. However, I thought the film was very slow and not interesting at the beginning.The story begins with Father Gabriel, who wanted to Christianize the indigenous tribe, but the conquerors' policy destroyed the mission. The plot is fascinating, touching and interesting.I think the cast is excellent, I particularly liked Father Gabriel's performance. The script is clever and exciting too, I hoped for a happy end, but it was tragic. I really like Ennio Morricone, I think he is a fabulous music writer but I didn't like the music of the movie that much.

The films that SHOULD have won Oscar for Best Picture: 1987,"In 1750 Spain, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) takes the place of a previous missionary whom was killed. He along with the help of reformed killer/slaver Mendoza (Robert DeNiro) and others hope to bring Christianity into the hearts of the natives of the land. He is successful, but when Portugal acquires the colony the question of if the missions are still under the protection of the Chuch arises. This is a powerful movie, one that I appreciated much more then Roland Joffe's previously directed ""Killing Fields"" which felt sanctimonious and one-sided. This film ,on the other hand, has breath-taking cinematography and well-developed characters. And while the film does falter in places (somewhat condescending and near the end over-preachy) the good far outweighs the bad. The Academy Awards had made yet another mis-step giving the Best Picture Oscar to ""Platton"" rather than this film.My Grade: ADVD Extras: Disk 1) Commentary by Roland Joffe; Theatrical Trailer; select Cast and crew filmographies; and list of Awards Disk 2) ""Omnibus"" (a great documentary on the movie)",9.0,Anonymous,History

"""The Mission"" Continues To Be My Personal Favorite","I have known this movie for many years now. I watch it every once in a while and only when I have a private moment to myself. In fact, I've just listened to the commentary on DVD. I can relate to every word, comprehension and motive of Roland Joffé's direction. He simply pieced together a great and touching movie.There are many comments about ""The Mission"" found here. Most of it positive while others not. Having said that, I don't want to get into the historical, religious and political views found here. After all, accurate or not, however with some relevancy, it was produced as a ""movie"" as opposed to a history book or in religious form.It is now May of the year 2006. The issue's and plight of the Indians or any other forest dwelling community is still a valid issue today as it was in 1986 or in the mid 1700's. The right to live and the will to survive is such a powerful force.""The Mission"" is a touching and emotional journey. Every scene is important and relevant to the next and flows smoothly from it's curious beginning to it's tragic end.Robert De Niro plays a character I can relate. Although not for profit, I have operated in forest environments, tracked targets and captured to win. It's dirty, it's tiresome but the ""rush"" of the hunt is fun. His transition is important as well. The people he has captured and/or has killed are the very people he becomes to love. When you know more about yourself and the world around you, everyone's life becomes important and one will fight to the death for others to survive.Jeremy Irons portrays a compassionate character whose love of the people I share. I am not a religious individual and that I don't claim any preference. I have traveled over the Atlantic, across the Pacific and to the Central America's. There's a lot many people can learn and share about each other.Chris Menges'is noted for his cinematography. There are many amazing and picturesque scenes. It reminds me of my own trek's in the wild and a very cold river bed. Keep in mind, seeing nature on screen or in your own professional/unprofessional landscape is one thing but the real experience can be quite different...trust me.Ennio Morricone is praised for his music composition orchestrated for The Mission. Although evident in the beginning and at the end, it is wonderfully played in subtle tones and variations throughout the movie. To my surprise, I found NO description in all the comments that lead to the evolution of this ""instrumental piece"" to it's present ""lyrical"" version found today.FYI. Mr. Ennio Morricone finally gave his approval to classical artist, Sarah Brightman (Phantom of the Opera), for the development of a song. Written in Italian lyrics by Ferraù, it became an international classical hit known as ""Nella Fantasia."" There are many classical artists who now sing their own variation of this song but my personal favorites are sung by Sarah Brightman (original artist) and Russell Watson. If you love the movie, you will love this song. Nella Fantasia greatly compliments The Mission.The Mission is not very everyone. You must experience the fullness of life to truly connect and feel for EVERY SCENE, DIALOGUE AND EXPRESSION. Otherwise...you just don't get it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"religious movie, but it's wonderful.....","It was like the protectors who keep what they should. I think this is very impressed because it is based on the real history. This movie deals about the time when the conflicts between Spain and Portugal's colony in Latin America. To conclude this problem, in the church, they sent a bishop. In the new continent, there was many churches, one was the church managed by Father Gabriel. The bishop knew they will be destroyed, everything. Finally, the victims of cruel actuality became ashes. The survivors in the ruins, they came to live with mistrust.Because of old movie, its graphic is not good at all.

Lost for words...,"I am lost for words in trying to make a oneliner that summarizes this incredibly impressive movie. Winner of the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival, which is the most prestigeous award a movie can get. Defenitely not suited though for the masses who might expect just another action movie in the jungle like ""Apocalypse Now"". This epic picture thankfully is the complete opposite: made by the director of multiple oscar winning ""The Killing Fields"" and the story was written by the same screenwriter that gave us ""Lawrence of Arabia"", which is rated at 100 at metacritics.com. That is impressive, to say the least...Jeremy Irons and Robert de Niro play at the peak of their carreers. I would dare say that de Niro's performance is equal in strength to similar performances like ""The Godfather"" and other classics of his brilliant carreer. The direction and photography is like I have never seen before, because of the incredibly powerful and gorgeous pictures of the thunderous waterfall. That overwhelmingly, powerfull waterfall is featured in many scenes, because it is the home of this peaceful indian tribe, which lives just above this grandiose waterfall.The Mission is a gorgeous portrait of a peaceful indigenous indian tribe which community had converted to the Christian faith because of one inspirational jesuit father played by Jeremy Irons. Robert de Niro plays a jesuit monk. Both are passionate in their beliefs and in defending this peaceful indian tribe from being conquered by the portugese military, hundreds years ago. How they fight for their beliefs and what they are prepared to sacrifice, that is the horrifying beauty of ""The Mission"".Based on a true story, unfortunately, because the portugese conquerers slaughtered that peaceful indian tribe. It is better that you know, because this movie will shake the ground beneath your feet with its revolting portrayal of the slaughter of innocent children and women.

How one can be selfless, forgive and turn the other cheek.

Political Statement,"In the film, The Mission, a classic argument of political and religious conflict is presented. A symbolic tale of the colonial struggle between the nations of Portugal and Spain is explored through the interpersonal relationships between the main characters. The story takes place in Brazil during the mid-eighteenth century. The imperial colony's borders are in dispute; however, in Europe, Portugal and Spain are negotiating an agreement over the contention. In Brazil, the Spanish Jesuits are building missions in order to spread Christianity to the local Indians. They face both the hostile Indians and the slave traders hunting the Indians. One such Spanish mercenary and slave trader, Mendoza, murders his brother in the heat of passion. He retreats to the missionaries whom he formerly scorned. There he meets Father Gabriel. Mendoza becomes a Jesuit thus aiding the very people he once hunted and captured for profit. In time, Father Gabriel builds the mission San Carlos, in the disputed territory.  Gabriel's mission seeks to introduce Christian values that include treating the native Indians as 'Christian' equals. However, the determination of the nations clash with the will of the Church, especially those of the Jesuit order. Thus, the stage is set for resolution of the political and religious conflict. The conflict can be seen distinctly in three areas. Politically, Spain and Portugal play a role. The Jesuit order and the Roman Catholic Church represent religion. In addition, Father Gabriel and Mendoza symbolize polarized ends to the same means. Politically, the conflict arises because Gabriel's mission was founded within Portugal's new territory.  The Spanish do not allow slave trading, although this is somewhat biased. In the colony, they are an economic necessity for running plantations. Portugal, a slave-trading nation, wants to control the Indian territories. It endorses slave traders that hunt and capture Indians for profit.  Spain can then buy slaves from the Portuguese. The local slave traders want a political guarantee that their property and trade will be protected. While the conflict has been resolved by the Treaty of Madrid, the Catholic nations feel obligated to send a Church emissary to deliver a verdict on Gabriel's mission. The far-reaching affects of religion on the nation-state is seen in this action. Spain and Portugal will accept the decision of the Roman Catholic Church. The cardinal embodies religion in the film. Together with the Jesuits, he endorses the conversion of the Indians. However, he must decide if the missions deserve the protection of the Church. The cardinal is accountable for the political goals of the Church.  He inspects the missions of the Jesuits, finding them to be of ecclesiastical worth. Yet, he has to weigh the religious aims of the Church with its political goals. He decides the Church will enforce the Treaty between Spain and Portugal; he orders the disputed mission abandoned. By showing authority over the colonial Jesuits, the Church appeased the European powers while saving political face. The cardinal suggests that a Christian attitude should be used in the transfer of mission. He ignores the plight of the Indians. He assumes that after conversion the can be returned to their natural state. He was obviously wrong. By placing the Church's political interests above religious concerns, the cardinal demonstrates the true political nature of the Church.The dilemmas that face the individual characters further explain the theme of the film. Father Gabriel represents the classical Christian missionary. His name means 'messenger of God.' This is symbolic of his role in the story.  He feels it is his calling to bring Christianity including a European lifestyle to the local Indians.  He has little humanistic concern for the indigenous population and their culture. His religious mission focuses on teaching the Indians not only the word of God but as much about Western culture as possible. Yet, in the end, it seems that the Indians might have been better off left in their 'natural' state. The political conflict begins after the Spanish have ceded the disputed areas to Portugal. The converted slave trader, Mendoza symbolizes religious fundamentalism. He turns religious fervor into political activism. Gabriel, the religious pacifist, will not act to protect the mission or Indians. Mendoza uses his experience as a mercenary to fight for the Indians. Gabriel's non-action and Mendoza's action are diametrically opposite of each other. Yet, the result is the same. The mission is over run by Portuguese mercenaries and the Indians captured or killed.  The Mission is a film about the state of 'Natural Man.' The introduction of complex politically and religious institutions into the natural man's world have uncertain repercussions. At best, those institutions bring knowledge and imposed order to the Indians. The basic needs of shelter, clothing and food were already being met by the Indians. The lasting legacy of The Mission is represented in the modern problems of South America, especially the Indians of Brazil.Political and religious solutions still escape the issues in those areas.",,Anonymous,History

Could've been a perfect movie,"Everyone should see this movie. It is a very well-made and satisfying movie that takes place in South America in the 18th century--a movie about conquistadores, native indians, and Jesuit priests. It stars two great actors, Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro. The costumes and production design are excellent. Pretty good depiction of life in 18th century South America, with its class distinctions and mistreatment of the native indians. The score is wonderful and memorable--it's one of the best scores from a movie. In addition, the cinematography is breathtaking; this is certainly one of the most beautifully photographed movies. However, all of the different speaking accents ruined this movie:  Jeremy Irons speaks with his proper British accent, De Niro speaks with his New York accent, Aidan Quinn speaks with his regular American accent (and his monotonous tone of voice), and then there are all of the other accents. It would've been nice if the director of this movie had required that all the actors speak only with an American accent, or only a British accent. Plus, the movie just moved along too slowly. For a movie of this subject matter, the emphasis should've been placed on making the story as interesting as possible, rather than making the movie just a visual spectacle. Overall, it is a very good movie with a nice message....were it not for its notable flaws, it could've been a perfect movie. *** out of ****.",,Anonymous,History

This is not ancient history!,"The Mission can be read as a recounting of an early version of a strain of Catholicism which gained in popularity in Latin America during the 60's, 70's and 80's, called Liberation Theology by some and a Preferential Option for the Poor by others. It taught that the Church's primary responsibility lay in solidarity with those who suffered most in this life, and that salvation did not lie simply in acts of faith, but also in acts of justice. Grassroots priests and lay pastors who, by virtue of their contact with the lives of their congregations, came to identify with their daily struggles, much as the Irons and De Niro characters did in the film.  The Mission is a clearly political film, and probably one that is intended to be so by its Director and Writer. It's undoubtedly a moving film, especially with its decidedly non-Hollywood ending, but I think that it's greatest political force is derived from its implicit commentary on the political climate into which it was released in 1986, and by extension, the political climate today.In 1985, the year before this film was released, Reagan declared that he would ignore a ruling of the World Court, the highest judicial body on the planet, and one whose judgements the US is bound to uphold. The ruling in question was one which ordered on the US to cease its ""Illegal use of Force"" (which is another term for international terrorism) and to pay $17 billion in reparations. The plaintiff in the case was Nicaragua, which was under attack by a proxy army armed, organized, and managed by the US. The Congress, for its part, announced immediately that our proxy army, the Contra, were explicitly authorized to attack what were called ""soft targets"", namely undefended civilian targets such as schools, clinics, and churches. That is, our response to the charge of International Terrorism was to increase our International Terrorism.Nicaragua at the time was one of the few places in Latin America where the State actively supported Liberation Theology, which by then was very prevalent amongst lay Jesuit pastors throughout Central America. It's hardly a coincidence that so many Jesuits were killed by US proxies, especially in  El Salvador, where we even had the temerity to kill a conservative Archbishop who had dared to do his job and defend the pastors of his order. Far fewer died in Nicaragua, where the army actually acted to defend the population instead of attacking it.So while it's nice to admire the film for its various technical and artistic achievements, and it makes us feel good to lament the past history it purports to tell, for the film to become truly relevant, we'd need to make the connection to what is going on in the present, and more importantly, what we can do about it.The attack on Nicaragua succeeded, like most of the violent undertakings of the Home of the Brave. If we're honest, we'll take a look at the rest of the world and see where we're continuing to play the role of the Portugese soldiers; if we're decent we'll do something to stop it.",,Anonymous,History

As he reaches the top he is confronted by the Indians who have drawn knives. DiNiro wants them to end his life and put an end to his self loathing.Instead their weapons are used in love and forgiveness to free their former enemy and DeNiro's guilt as they sever the rope and unburden the former slave hunter.

One of the greatest films ever made,"(This will be the first of 30 essays on films that I believe are the 30 greatest of all time. Being the first written has nothing to do with the standing against the other films)Recently AFI released a top 25 list of best film scores written. It was a terrible list, with predictably the emotionally detached but hummable Star Wars at #1 and Gone With the Wind at #2. It doesn't get much better from there, but it did have ""Out of Africa"" (John Barry) and ""The Mission"" (Ennio Morricone) (although On Golden Pond and The Pink Panther are also good, they are not top 25 material)It may be the only thing ""The Mission"" is remembered for - that theme ""The River"" (Vita Nostra) that is used occasionally in film trailers. Oh yeah, and that notorious scene at the beginning where the guy is sent down a waterfall is bound to a cross.That scene, of mixed horror and spellbinding beauty, is a lot of what ""The Mission"" is like. Being as critical as possible, The Mission is one of the greatest, and certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made.The synopsis: The setting is the 17th Century, South America. Our Protagonist is Jeremy Irons, a priest who, unlike the Hollywood stereotype of ""villanous priest,"" is really quite pacifist - Ghandi-style. I generally find Christians annoying, but I might just get along with this guy. He sets off, alone in the jungle, to start a mission to try and convert the natives to Christianity. He climbs the cliffs next to the waterfall and at the top runs into some naturals and manages to avoid becoming the guy in the opening scene by playing an Ennio Morricone theme on his oboe.Another character has to come into play here, and its Robert DeNiro. After Irons has successfully set up a small mission and befriended most of the naturals, he runs into DeNiro, a slave trader who takes some of the naturals captive. This time the camera follows DeNiro who inevitably kills his brother in a fit of jealousy. When Irons meets him later in jail, he is ready for redemption, so Irons, and another priest played by some guy called Liam Neeson (!) take him up the cliffs with them, DeNiro carrying a huge pack of armor. DeNiro mercilessly drags himself up out of self hatred. After making it to the top (barely) he feels redeemed and becomes a priest of the mission.I won't tell you the rest of the plot, but it involves Irons, DeNiro and young Liam trying to save the mission from Portuguese soldiers who would like to solve the problem of the naturals by enslaving them.The Mission was made by the people who made ""The Killing Fields"" which is a great film, but not as great as this. If Chris Menges' photography in The Killing Fields was pretty, in The Mission its stunning. If Roland Joffe(director) had an Axe to grind in The Killing Fields, he has an army of axes to grind here. If Haing Ngor was great in The Killing Fields...well, DeNiro is maybe not quite as great as Ngor, but still worthy of a huge amount of attention.And ""The Mission"" had a WAY better score than ""Star Wars""",,Anonymous,History
