"Beautiful film, giving hope to all those seemingly unrequited loves.","Can you beat some of the lines in this film? As a guy, which I am, I identified with Harry's lines so much, and you can't help but side with him. The chemistry between the two actors, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is superb, and you believe in them when they talk, you feel for them when they look at each other. Even the friends are well casted, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. It's such relaxed acting and filming that you do nothing but watch these people fall in love, and pretty soon you feel like you're involved as well. With a fantastic soundtrack, direction, script and acting, it's a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless,I decided to watch this for the first time and thought it was one of the most realistic romance movies that there is. It is also really cute with showing older couples between the scenes and hearing their love at first sight stories.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
the perfect modern take on a classic idea,"Aside from freer language and more explicitly sexual humour, When Harry met Sally is a very traditional romantic comedy, very much in the mould established in 1934 by It Happened One Night. Two very different but evenly-matched people are thrown together by circumstance. They are initially hostile to one another, but over the course of the film, this hostility turns to love as their personalities are softened by exposure to their opposites. Indeed, the central traits of Harry and Sally correspond very directly to those of Peter and Ellen in IHON - he worldly-wise and cynical, she spoiled and certain of what's what. Neither of them, it turns out, is as right or as self-confidant as they believe. What's very modern about WHMS is its attitude to long-term relationships. It's no longer enough for the couple simply to fall in love and live happily ever after. They must have a full and real understanding of exactly what, or who, they're letting themselves in for. They must also be sexually compatible (hence the importance of their having slept with one another before they finally get together). Within this framework of traditional romance in an unromantic world, WHMS is almost perfect. Structurally, there are no gaps or implausibilities. Even the central coincidence of these people running into each other under these circumstances is answered. The short but affecting intermissions of successful old couples describing their relationships are not only crucial to the pacing of the film, they also make the point that Harry and Sally are just another couple with an unusual and interesting story. There's an element of luck and coincidence in every successful relationship. The effectiveness of the film's structure is perhaps best highlighted by the soundtrack. There's a perfectly selected Louis Armstrong track for every phase of their relationship - the soundtrack not only complements the mood of the film, it comments on the action. The acting is superb, with the two main protagonists as well as their two foils (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher) all giving career-best comic performances. Without such fantastic performances, it's very possible that the film could have failed: these are essentially self-indulgent people, that we sympathise with them and recognise them is in great measure down to the stars. Finally, the script is fantastic. Of course nobody really speaks like that, but like all great scripts it distills emotions and points of view into a few lines. And it's funny. The one-liners are still sharp and amusing on the twentieth viewing, and the set-pieces are beautifully realised (the orgasm scene is only the most famous - check out Harry's olympic sex-dream speech - ""Must have been the dismount"" - or the ""I'm through making a schmuck out of myself"" phone call). All this, and a dinner party talking point about male and female relationships. Can we ever be just friends? Not even with an ugly girl? ""Nah, you pretty much want to nail them too.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best romantic comedies ever!,"Not too long ago I finally got around to seeing this film, I'd heard so much about it that I had to see it. After seeing it the first time I thought it was good, but I have to say that I liked it even more on my second viewing. The film is absolutely wonderful! The story is very amusing and keeps you interested in the characters from start to finish.I literally couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next scene. This is one of those movies that goes by very quickly. I think that's a sign of a good movie, when you just can't believe that you're already an hour or so into the movie. The story really flows nicely from scene to scene.The cast is great in the film as well. Billy Crystal pulls off one of his best performances, and has a slew of great jokes throughout the film. Meg Ryan looks as beautiful as ever and has such a cute way about her. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher definitely deserve a great deal of credit too, they both did superb jobs as well. Director Rob Reiner did a great job with the film, keep up the good work Rob.If you're into romantic comedies, then you definitely should see this film. Even if you aren't really into the whole romantic part of it, the comedy is great and worth seeing. I would most definitely recommend seeing this film.I hope you like it. Thanks for reading,-Chris",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Icon,"This movie grows like a good wine. I really didn't get it when it was first released; I avoided it like the plague. But people have a curious tendency to mature and change their POVs with time, and so was it with me. This movie opened me up to a lot of things - believe it or not, I didn't get the 'Call Me' sequence at first: I was lost, and admit it. But I am not lost now, and this movie is partly responsible.Meg might be the reason guys want to see this movie, again and again, but after a while you begin to appreciate the contribution Crystal made to the film. The dialogue has his name all over it. The dialogue in this film is at times simply amazing - check the memorable quotes here if you've seen the movie and have forgot.I would not pick this movie out of a barrel as most likely to be so influential, but it's a fact that it is, and rightfully so. Great support from Kirby and Fisher. Today it's Hanks and Ryan who are paired, thanks undoubtedly to Sleepless in Seattle, but one wonders why no one has tried to get Crystal and Ryan back together again. They're fantastic.This is one of the all-time best movies ever made. All-time 10? Or 20? or 1000? I don't know; it's just one of the best - it has that quality about it. Keeper.",,Anonymous,Romance
peerless,"I love romantic comedies, and this may be my all-time favorite. Nora Ephron's writing is sharp and VERY funny, and the perfect cast delivers the dialogue with flawless timing. I own it on DVD, and will almost invariably turn to it for at least a couple of minutes when I see it in the TV schedule. There are so many priceless moments that I can't pick out one to highlight; most of them are subtler and funnier than the famous Simulated Orgasm scene. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are perfect in their supporting roles, and Rob Reiner's direction couldn't be better. I'm afraid that I'm doing nothing but gushing in this review, but great is great, and it's hard to say anything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""When Harry Met Sally"" - Stands the Test of Time","""When Harry Met Sally"" may not at first seem to be the kind of film that remains classic and timeless. In this very cute exploration of an age-old question: ""Can men and women truly just be friends?,"" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play the kind of characters we have come to love to see them play. No surprises there as they skillfully banter back and forth between adorable, hysterical and morose as the plot rolls on. But upon closer inspection, this film is actually full of nice surprises, including its durability. Watch carefully and you will find one of the best examples of the way an excellent script can propel the plot, character development and pacing of a film perfectly from start to finish. Many lines may seem to be merely entertaining one-liners, but they also serve these other purposes simultaneously. This is a well crafted and well acted script. Even the most dated aspect of the film, the intentional focus on clothing, hair and makeup styles as they change throughout the decades, has taken an unexpected poignancy now that the styles we may remember as current at the time have come to be old-fashioned themselves. The end result is that ""When Harry Met Sally"" speaks to us if we remember the times portrayed in the film or not. We're still asking questions about men and women and friendship, and films such as this still help us answer them.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A pretty good romantic comedy,"I have never really liked romantic comedies, I think there's too much crying and sentimental sap. I mostly think of romantic comedies as the kind of movie single women sit down and watch, and cry their eyes out, which is a concept I've never understood. But this movie is definitely one of the better of the genre. I saw it again after having seen it a lot of years ago, and I remembered it as having one single good scene. This is, of course, the famous restaurant scene. But seeing it again, I laughed almost at the very beginning, and kept laughing throughout the next twenty minutes. After that, the hilarity of the characters faded, and it settled by being interesting and capturing. I wanted to know what was going to happen to these characters. Unfortunately, it didn't last, and I lost interest for a few minutes, and then I saw a funny scene again, and regained interest. The same thing happened a few more times, I lost and regained interest with brief pauses. The movie is worth seeing if you like this sort of movie, or if you like debates about male/female friendship. I found the ongoing debate in the movie very interesting and thought-provoking, and most of the movie is pretty funny as well. Some of it is laugh-out-loud funny, and some of it is more like recognize-the-situation funny. If it had kept my interest a little better, I would have given it an 8, but as it is, I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll have what Reiner was directing in the 80's,"""I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.""My favorite Rob Reiner film has always been When Harry Met Sally, a romantic comedy that I never expected to enjoy as much as I did. It's the best Woody Allen film not directed by Woody Allen. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's quirky chemistry in this movie is probably one of the best I've seen in any film. Reiner is a director that is hard to categorize since he has worked with different genres: thriller with Misery, fantasy/adventure with The Princess Bride, coming of age with Stand by Me, mockumentary with This is Spinal Tap, drama with A Few Good Men, and comedy with The Bucket List. He's made his share of bad films (his latest films are probably his weakest), but he seems to have excelled in every genre without establishing a common trademark. You could watch When Harry Met Sally back to back with Misery and you'd never guess it was directed by the same person. The secret to his success with this rom-com is that the relationship feels true to life as he first introduces these flawed characters that don't seem to care too much for each other, but over the years they begin bonding and establishing a strong friendship. These characters are so relatable and we can see ourselves or our friends in the film. It reminds us of that friend of the opposite sex we had and how easy it was to blur the line between friendship and love. It makes us think of that universal question: Can a man and a woman be best friends without falling in love with each other? A lot of credit must be given to Nora Ephron's Oscar nominated screenplay because the dialogue and debates between the main characters are authentic and sharp at the same time. There are so many memorable scenes, including the fake orgasm which turned Meg Ryan into such a star, but the final tear jerking scene is my favorite because Billy Crystal delivered his lines in such a perfect way. Even the scenes where old couples are being interviewed in documentary style works perfectly and serves a purpose other than simply serving as transitions taking place in the story. The honesty that comes through in each conversation between Harry and Sally and the incredible chemistry between them is what makes this one of my go to films when it comes to recommending a romantic movie. Did I mention that the film takes place in New York of all places?http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's no such thing as Harry and Sally,"There's no question that this is the perfect movie about love and masterpiece, having its own genre. The location New York is beautifully presented and Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal showed their best performance ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
When everything changed...,"Whenever I hear something about him, I wonder; what ever happened to Rob Reiner's career? What ever happen to that man that could direct any genre? The man who made us cry in ""Stand by me"" or made us scare to death in ""Misery"" is now out of the focus. I saw his last film, ""Alex & Emma"" (which I tried to tolerate because of the actors who starred in it) and it was shameful to see he was promoting it with and advertisement saying: ""from the director of"" The director of ""When Harry met Sally"", this movie, Reiner's most successful romantic comedy and film ever and by now probably a classic, because of Meg Ryan's famous scene and because of its general charm. Believe, everything is pink in this film, and the romantic story it proposes is something everyone has experienced. In some ways it reminded me to ""The mirror has to faces"", but that couple relationship was totally different.Here there are two guys in their 20's, travelling to New York for a better life, arguing about the things they think, do, and expect of their future, and so on. These scenes in the car driving to New York could be extremely boring, but writer Nora Ephron (who would write for Meg Ryan again in ""You've got mail"") makes them very interesting. ""How can't you be afraid of death?"", Sally tells Harry, and he answers: ""I'm just prepared, when I read a book I always read the ending first in case I die and I can't finish it"".Years later that trip is history, and they both have various encounters through the years. She pretends he doesn't recognize her, because she remembers him perfectly. She was actually captivated by him on that trip but never told him. On the other hand, he pretends to be casual, but hasn't erased her from his mind; after more than a decade! Soon they start hanging out, telling each other everything, and become best friends; but if you saw them on the street you wouldn't doubt to think they are a couple.Why don't they confess their feelings? You've got to see the film to figure it out; you've got to witness what happens, how it happens and most importantly why. In our original time, Rob Reiner did this picture more than a decade ago, and he directed it simply and honestly. Without knowing he also brought us one of the first climatic endings in a romantic comedy; those when the guy declares his love in the last minutes, in a powerful touching final speech, you know.But what he actually got right was the cast. Yes, he got together two actors that achieved a unique chemistry in a movie that needed it entirely. Billy Crystal, showing that way of speaking that is only his and a mark for any good comedian. Rob Reiner helped him to become the super comedic star he was already becoming. And Meg Ryan will be ever grateful to this opportunity that showed her unusual beauty, natural talent and all the other things that would make her the queen of the romantic comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
When Neil Met Woody,"Man, 127 comments so far and all but two are breathless raves. I just saw this movie for the first time, and I gotta say, Woody Allen should be getting royalty checks.  I'm stunned how many Allen trademarks were ""borrowed"" for this film (starting with neurotic Jewish male / flakey Shiksa princess romance all the way on down to the use of ""It Had To Be You"" -- ANNIE HALL's theme song).  I can just imagine the pitch meeting:  ""It's like ANNIE HALL, only re-imagined by Neil Simon as a sitcom pilot!""  I mean, it's a sweet movie, but I think its classic status is way overscaled. Plus, the notorious fake orgasm scene was rather, uh, anticlimactic.  It was so over-the-top (anyone really behaving like that in a public NY establishment would be escorted out immediately), it felt more like an SNL sketch than a romantic comedy.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
When romance met sheer genius,"I am no expert on the genre, but I'd have to say ""When Harry met Sally"" is, besides the plethora of truly wonderful films made by Woody Allen, the wittiest and most funny romantic comdedy waiting for you out there in video world. I'd only wished I'd seen the film sooner because this seems like that perfect film for discussion with a circle of good friends at Pizzaria Uno. The movie came out in 1989, but for some reason, I think this is one even our kids may like.Like all good films coming from the genere, this film thrives most on its witty dialgue and cleverness in not ""sentimnetalizing"" it too much. In other words, there is that perfect equilibrium between scenes of sheer poignancy and scenes of brutal comic relief. The thespians involved, of course, have a lot to do with the film's success and overall appeal. Ryan and Crystal are perfect for the roles assigned, each one of them bringing their charisma and fresh breath of life to the screen. Crystal fits snugly into that character we find all too obnoxious but can't help but loving and Ryan, well, she is as adorable as always.The issue the film tackles is an important one, I think. It asks us a question of universal importance, namely, can women and men ever be friends?. I'll leave that for you and your friends to talk about at Pizzaria Uno. For now, I'll just say that with heaps of quirky, funny dialogue, a taut script from Nora Ephron, and clean directing form Reiner, ""When Harry met Sally"" is a highly enjoyable film that unsurprisingly has held strong a decade after its inception.dan",,Anonymous,Romance
"Gold standard of the "" rom - com"".","The "" Rom- com"" is not my favourite genre and as such I have not seen as many as I might have. Of the ones I have seen this is probably the best. The dialogue is crackling , it's funny, It's serious enough when it has to be and It's just great storytelling. At the heart if it is the question- "" can a man and woman truly be friends?"" This whole thing doesn't work unless the casting is right - and Billy crystal and Meg Ryan are perfect here. They start off not liking each other- and whilst this idea is not original It's done so very well and you really buy the way they feel over the journey. What elevates this over other good films of this kind is hard to explain. I guess you would call it nostalgia. It just works here.

When Harry Met Someone,"This is Billy Crystal's show.  He has an understated, ordinary, humble screen presence.  It's not the case that every single line HAS to be funny in order for us to like him - with Crystal, a joke can fall flat and somehow it doesn't make him personally look bad.  But here every line IS funny, so he has charm to burn.I know people like Meg Ryan - I guess I do, too, in this particular film - and I know that there are people who find her `orgasm' scene amusing, but Sally is really just someone for Harry to meet and ultimately fall in love with.  She's completely clueless.  Most of the jokes are at her expense rather than his.  The genuine wit, the power of observation, the theoretical insight, all lie with Harry.  Is this a problem?  Not in the least.  Unlike most romantic comedies this is not some kind of duel - it's the more realistic study of many, many separate encounters.Also unlike most romantic comedies, this one is funny.  I think I mentioned that.The film benefits from its second rank support: good performances by Carrie Fischer and that guy whose name doesn't matter, locations someone actually went to some trouble to look for, and a song-score that is doesn't intrude and hit us repeatedly over the head.  Allegedly `When Harry Met Sally' has been imitated by later productions, but I can't think of a case where the imitation is accurate enough to even be recognisable.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breath of fresh air,"I'm convinced that everyone should see ""When Harry Met Sally"" just for the orgasm scene. I can assure you it's worth sitting through a romantic comedy for (on display here is meg Ryan's considerable charm and comedic talents), and it's a classic piece of cinema for a reason. And speaking of romantic comedies, here's one that defies the ridiculously formulaic nature of the genre as it's become in recent years; intelligent, accessible, and even though the relationship material has been mined by myriad sitcoms over the last twenty years, its voice still seems fresh. The dialogue's got wit, and it works well given this well-chosen cast.Even if this isn't doing it for you, settle in for a great Harry Connick Jr. soundtrack.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless Classic,"When Harry Met Sally. One of the greatest movies of our time. True I was only a year when it came out but once I discovered it many a year later I can not stop watching. It is one of the most timeless and most relatable films. Everyone can find something to relate to in this movie as it attempts to answer the age old question: Can men and women be friends? Or does the sex thing always get in the way? From Sally's sweet naiveness to Harry's outspoken ways the characters always feel like old friends. The quotes are memorable from days of the week underpants: Sally: ""They don't make Sunday"" Harry:""Why not?"" Sally: ""Because of God"" to Answering Machine ramblings: Harry: ""The fact that you're not answering leads me to believe that (a) You're not home, (b) You're home but you don't want to talk to me, or (c) You're home, desperately want to talk to me, but you're trapped under something heavy. If it's either (a) or (c), please give me a call.""Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron could not have possibly written a better screenplay. It's witty. It's charming.

It was average at best,"WHEN HARRY MET SALLYI was disappointed.This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it.This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special.Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a café.Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny.The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college.They do not get along very well on the way.5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other.Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped.So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy.The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written.The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too.One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film.They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them.In my mind, the 80s films are the best.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Lite,"The relationship between the title characters is explored over the course of a dozen years. This treads the same ground that Woody Allen's romantic comedies have been exploring for decades except that this feels like one of his lesser efforts because Reiner is not in the same league as Allen. This is an uninspired, by-the-numbers exercise that is fondly remembered by audiences primarily for its single funny scene - the fake orgasm by Ryan at a deli. Unfortunately, everything else about this witless comedy also seems fake, including the emotions and the relationships. The intermittent interviews with the couples is meant to be touching, but comes across as pathetically contrived.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Famous romantic comedy,"Can men and women ever be merely friends, without the temptation of sex rearing its ugly head? This is the question that this movie so famously posed - and so glibly answered - almost fifteen years ago. As it follows the progression of Harry and Sally - a pair of charming, if neurotic, Manhattanites - from enemies to confidants to lovers, it seems to smugly relish the fact that it has proven its point: men and women can never just ""be friends"" - sex is always the bond that unites them. But the film is so manipulative, so dogged in its pursuit of this goal, that it never appears an alternative position was ever considered. So, as philosophy, chalk When Harry Met Sally up to around zilch.Now, disregard the above paragraph. Because When Harry Met Sally makes up for its slights to credibility and lack of rigorous thought by being easily the funniest movie of its year (1989). This humor flows mainly from the beautifully crafted scenes and dialogue; indeed, each scene is a dialogue set piece (and could be transferred to the stage quite easily - surprising no one's ever done it, actually), which flows with the firm and confident rapidity of a 20th century Shaw or Oscar Wilde. Of course, this approach has its downside, too: mainly that the lead characters seem less and less like real people and more like tools for the brilliant lines and conceits of the screenwriter (Nora Ephron - never better; in fact, never even remotely close ever again). This may have something to do with the film's inability to seem completely real or true to human nature as it actually plays out - but with lines like these, who's complaining?For, what is great about the movie is not its originality (it steals from all over, especially Woody Allen movies, and the few ideas it can truly call its own are, as I've said, not particularly bright or well-thought out), but its ability to hone in on stereotypes of character and situation and offer pithy and hilarious precis of the male-female condition through the witty banter and interaction of its characters. As such, the film is less like a conventional movie and more like a stand-up routine dealing with life and love in the Big City: it is to be judged not by its content, but by the dexterity of its put-ons and one-liners. (It is not surprising, for example, that several of its set-pieces and comic notions were revisited just a few years later, and in much the same manner, on ""Seinfeld"".) In that regard, it succeeds flawlessly.Just think of all the conventions it gets in, and skewers: the one-track mind male (Harry); the ""sensitive"" and practical female, repulsed yet intrigued by said male (Sally); the emotionally unsettled mistress playing the field (Carrie Fisher, who keeps an index card file of ""available"" men); the live-ins who can't ""commit"" (Sally and her ex-boyfriend); women's concern with middle age and their biological clock (""I'm gonna be 40,"" weeps Sally. ""When?"" asks Harry. ""Someday.""); the male's tendency to skip out after making love; the horror and unpredictability of blind dates; and, in a scene which is almost passe to mention anymore, women's ability to fake orgasm. The way this film jumps from one familiar convention to another would be embarrassing if it weren't for the fact that each one is handled with such economy, humor and grace.Billy Crystal acquits himself well as Harry - predictably, perhaps, as it's a part tailor made for a standup comedian. Still, seeing him in this after years of half-baked movies and fawning Oscar presentations, it's a revelation how glib and unlikable he can allow himself to be . . . and *still* be likable. Yo, Billy, if you're listening out there: try incorporating some of Harry's darker shadings and more egocentric traits into your future roles; it gives you a more complete palette to work from and keeps you from being too generic and schticky. And your charm and humor will always shine through anyway.If Billy needs to edge a little bit closer back to Harry, though, Meg Ryan needs to get Sally completely out of her system. This role, deservedly, made her a star - but she has tried to go back to this particular well once too many times, and it's become way too familiar: you know, the adorable, bright-eyed bit - mentally disheveled, prissy around the edges with just a wisp of klutziness, all topped by that cute, mega-watt smile.  It has become now the ""Meg Ryan"" character, but back when Sally came along it was still fresh, and it was tied to a particular personality. Ryan gives Sally a shy-cum-toughness as well as a moody, slightly cynical and self-deprecating wit that is just totally right. She and Crystal play off each other like two old pros, and they weave in and out of some charming and hilarious verbal music.It's funny, but I just recently saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon television marathon of ""Romantic Weepies"" - and it struck me as an odd designation, because this movie is anything but a weeper. It takes a clear-eyed, almost cynical view of love and companionship, and creates around it a charming tapestry of bracing wit and crunching dialogue. So save the violins and the handkerchiefs for romantic comedies less sure on their feet - whose deficiency in wit must be made up for by a surfeit of melodrama and manipulation. This movie is manipulative too, of course, but its manipulation is almost beside the point. It's the laughs along the way we remember here, not the big kiss or the grand embrace. That Harry and Sally were ""meant"" for each other and that the film ""proves"" it is much less important than the fact that Sally does one hell of a great orgasm.Waiter, I'll have what they're having . . .",,Anonymous,Romance
"(the one with the scene in the diner) A very funny, witty and charmimg romantic comedy","Words cannot describe how much I loved this film. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud(I'll have what she's having""), and other times when I was like ""Aww, that's really sweet"". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner(The Princess Bride, This is Spinal Tap and Stand By Me-the latter is a favourite of mine). The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is in one word beguiling. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece, the only scene I was familiar with prior to watching the film. And of course the acting is outstanding; Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Greatest Romantic Comedies,"AFI 100 Comedies. AFI 100 Passions. AFI 10 Top 10. AFI 100 Quotes. AFI 100 Songs.""When Harry Met Sally"" is easily one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time. It is short in duration, it is extremely watchable, Nora Ephron's script is hilarious, and Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan both give fantastic performances. There is very little to dislike about this movie if you are looking for entertainment. However, this is in no means an artsy film or a game-changer, but simply something that will definitely put you in a good mood.When Harry met Sally... they hated each other. Their actual meeting for the first time was nothing special at all: Harry's girlfriend at the start of the movie was a friend of Sally's, and Sally was simply driving Harry back to New York from college because she lived in New York as well. It only takes a couple of minutes into their journey to New York to make it apparent that the script will be full of philosophical discussion between the two of them (as well as other characters) just like most Richard Linklater films. It is an interesting notion that the main point of Harry's initial discussion with Sally is that the two of them can never be friends because the ""sex stuff"" always gets in the way of a man and a woman - yet 10 years after they meet, they become ""just friends"" (but do we really believe that?).There is a very creative scene in the movie about two thirds of the way through where a friend of Harry's and a friend of Sally's are now a couple, and they are each talking on the phone simultaneously with Harry and Sally respectively. Really interesting editing is applied here to get all four characters on the screen at once, each taking up about a fourth of the screen. It is three separate images, the first image being an image of the couple in bed, and the other two being superimposed images of Harry and Sally on opposite ends of the screen while they are each on the phone. It is one of the most creative scenes in Rob Reiner's filmography.Above everything else, ""When Harry Met Sally"" has a lot of heart, which comes in different forms. It has heart due to its sense of humor, it has heart by showing a lot of emotion between Harry and Sally later in the film, and every now and then, the movie cuts to different couples explaining how they met and when they knew they were meant to be together, putting a smile on the audience member's face. It is also a joy to watch Harry and Sally grow as people as they become friends (which is against Harry's initial beliefs) and as they realize their feelings for each other, even if they do not admit those feelings immediately. From the famous ""I'll have what she's having"" moment to the finale at midnight on New Year's Eve, ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a triumph of a motion picture, capturing our hearts and holding on throughout.""When Harry Met Sally"" might not be a masterpiece in terms of technicality (it is pretty simply shot and edited aside from that creative scene mentioned above), but it is a film many should experience just for how enjoyable it is. It is a great love story and highly re-watchable.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
toooo muuuch whinnning.,"I see all the favorable reviews of this one, and when I first saw this in '89, I thought ""great"". And it is a leader in the romantic comedy genre. Billy Crystal has a way of pulling off these kinds of roles. He's good, great timing, funny almost anywhere. Meg Ryan plays a good part also; she is good in most of her comedy roles. Her serious roles leave little to be desired. Rob Reiner's direction is good but predictable. We see New York through a stereotypical camera. He makes us think everyone in NYC is Italian when they're young, and when they get old, they become Jewish. I suppose this is humorous to the populace.Well, I watched it again recently, and I have a question: Am I the only one who thinks these characters whine too much? Don't they have any better things to do with their energy than lament over the slightest trouble they confront? Yes, this is ""Seinfeld before Seinfeld"", and Seinfeld is funny, but I can't watch it for too long before feeling exhausted.The movie is about couples and their love troubles. Billy Crystal is charming, woman love this, it's his unintimidating, ""I'm fallible"" humor. Meg Ryan is made out to be a smart career woman who is stupid(big career woman can't drag a Christmas tree).Characters suffering from a neurosis for our entertainment is funny, but it's not romantic. Woody Allen invented neurotic, romantic comedies in the movies. That's enough.If you love the TV comedy ""Seinfeld"", you'll love this one. If you get tired of ""Seinfeld"", you know what to expect. It's entertaining but.............It gets a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Rob Reiner's tribute to Woody Allen's theories in a sophisticated manner.,"When Harry Met Sally (1989) :
Brief Review -Rob Reiner's tribute to Woody Allen's theories in a sophisticated manner. I don't know where it came to my mind, but almost every scene of Reiner's When Harry Met Sally reminded me of those Woody Allen's movies that spoke about romance, sex, and relationships. Allen was damn allegorical and brutal about it, whereas Reiner made it sort of sophisticated, that is, with the use of the sex word again and again and in more likely rom-com fashion. The outcome wasn't satisfying, hence the entire narrative and the entire process of those two characters knowing, liking, and avoiding each other went in vain. I mean, a happy ending wasn't something to look out for in the late 80s and definitely not appropriate for such a film, which was talking about relationships in intelligent and weird manners right from the beginning. ""A man and a woman can never be friends"" was the tagline, or rather, a question. Then why go mainstream and typical to find the answer? You were speaking of Casablanca (1942) having a great ending and the best last line for a movie ever, and you didn't learn anything from it? Did Casablanca have a happy ending? Imagine Ilsa running back to Rick instead of getting on the plane, and then they kiss and live happily ever after. Would that have made Casablanca iconic? A big and capital NO. Then don't tell me When Harry Met Sally is iconic or anywhere close to that. I'd have preferred a negative, or rather an intellectual, ending with Harry and Sally being friends forever and happily married to different partners. Harry was speaking about men, women, sex, bed, and love so frequently and easily, then what made him go dramatic and soft about it all of a sudden? We liked him that way, so don't destroy his image for us. Sally, too, was so smart, then became desperate and jealous of her own ideology. Enough said I guess, WHMS had its own high moments and its own dumb falls, so it's better to call it a decent-to-good watch, especially after watching so much of Allen Cinema.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

My favorite movie EVER!,"This is my favorite movie ever (hence my nickname!). The dialogue is Nora Ephron's best writing ever, with almost every line quotable.  My best friend and I can say the whole movie by heart!  The dialogue is not only sharp and witty, but true-to-life, as are the situations.  I agree these are Meg Ryan's and Billy Crystal's best performances.  It is a film whose standards I uphold to all romantic comedies, and I've yet to see another movie in this genre that exceeds When Harry Met Sally's quality!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Conversation,"It may be a sad fact that the majority of couples living in this country are not having open / good conversation with their spouse. It may be the opinion of this critic, but the world would be a better place if all couples had the same kind of conversation that Harry and Sally have. Considered a favorite by many, When Harry met Sally is the story about how Harry met Sally. Throughout the movie, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan do not hold back their true feelings and opinion. The end result is a happy and realistic ending. Much of the conversation between the two are not only entertaining but far fetch. Many people hold back their truth feelings let along the truth. Here, relationships take center stage as the audience watches what they wish they could and would like to say to their significant other.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
hard to imagine a more pedestrian romance,"It isn't exactly love at first sight: Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan share a car from Chicago to New York, and after a decade of chance encounters finally become close friends. But by mutual consent the two are determined not to sleep together, thinking that a commitment between lovers would somehow jeopardize the casual rapport they otherwise enjoy. Will they or won't they? It's a ridiculous argument at any rate: men and women can of course be just friends, but there's no reason for this couple to prove the point, since both are young, single, compatible, obviously attracted to each other, and have no luck with other partners. Nora Ephron's overwritten screenplay benefits from two stars with plenty of chemistry, playing characters with very little appeal: Harry is smug; Sally is cuddly; and neither is able to define him- or herself outside of a sexual relationship. Meg Ryan fakes a good orgasm, and the film in general does an even more convincing imitation of 'Annie Hall', to a point where it could easily suffer from charges of plagiarism.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Would you like to have dinner?... Just friends""","There have only been but a very few films that have tackled the friendship-turned-to-love theme as beautifully as 'When Harry Met Sally' did. There have been numerous attempts thereafter, the most recent one being 'A Lot Like Love' but none of them come close to this wonderful gem. Nora Ephron's writing is top class as it provides clever one-liners, great dialogues, well-written characters and a lovely story. Rob Reiner tells a common story in a very uncommon way. A lot of the movie is based on both Ephron and Reiner's experience. Similarly the characters of Harry and Sally are based on themselves. However, they allow the actors to insert their own input which leads to the electrifying chemistry between the lead actors. The cast and crew have had a lot of fun during the making and the amount of heart that's been put into the film is quite obvious. The story obviously revolves around Billy Crystal's Harry and Meg Ryan's Sally. The two actors are fantastic to say the least and bring magic on screen. I wonder why they were never paired again. Perhaps it's for the best as they are remembered for this movie rather than what happened with Gere and Roberts after 'Runaway Bride'. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher deserve mention too for their great support as Harry and Sally's friends. Together with Crystal and Ryan, they create some of the funniest scenes. The background music flows in a subtle way, giving voice to the city and the songs fantastically add to the narration. Without a doubt, 'When Harry Met Sally' is one of the finest films of its genre and one of the very few that stood the test of time. Even today people vividly remember Meg Ryan's memorable orgasm scene. Not that that's the only great scene in the movie. There are too many to list but to mention a few that I liked include the scene where Harry and Sally date each other's best friend but things take an unexpected turn, the car-ride to New York, the scene where Sally for the first time opens up to Harry about herself...For some people the film raised a question whether men and woman can be platonic friends without having sex ruining it. I don't think it was the intention of the movie as it's only about these two characters who have very different viewpoints and when they meet the first time, there's a very strong attraction which stays throughout the end and Crystal and Ryan display that in a very subtle way. As the friendship grows stronger, so does the attraction because it's not just physical anymore. The more they know each other the more they're drawn towards one another and the love gets stronger. Thus, it's not about whether men and woman can have a successful platonic friendship but about two people who were always fond of each other, become friends and gradually realize their love. 'When Harry Met Sally' isn't only for those who like romantic comedies because it can absolutely be enjoyed as a hilarious comedy.",,Anonymous,Romance
Missing Meg Ryan's romantic comedy,"I give this movie a 10 not because I think it's as good as The God Father. My enjoyment is based on its simple plot, quotable dialogs, the progressive chemistry, and the one and only Meg Ryan. I can't ask more for a typical romantic comedy. When some 'successful' romantic comedies today are merely nothing but a accumulation of stars, it makes me miss Meg's top three movies even more, which are When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle, You've Got Mail. Then the reason why I regard this one as the best is its foreseeable ending but with touchingly unforgettable 'Harry style' lines, and now I can see that what Sally replies is just a good summary of their relationship, which I was unable to understand in this way at the first time I saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrific!,"This is in the Top Ten of my favorite rom coms of all time! Both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were terrific, and played their role to perfection, as both characters could easily have been portrayed in an over-the-top manner that could have gotten on your nerves and spoiled everything. Not so here! They both give low key performances which emphasize the comic parts of the movie, without overdoing it.You find yourself wanting the HEA to begin, yet enjoying each step of the way, as they go from short acquaintance, to friendship, to love.Both Carrie fisher and Bruno Kirby are great in their secondary roles, and there's a familiar face from soap opera history, as well as American, with Steven Ford (son of the former President) playing a small but memorable role.One not to miss, and to see over again!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll have what she's having,"When Harry Met Sally is one of the smartest, most sincere and honest comedies I have ever seen, and the fact that it's also really funny is just the icing on the cake. The conversations the two leads have in the movie are as meaningful, quotable, and genuine as they are blunt, witty and hilarious. And of course, there are tons of equally hilarious scenarios, particularly the legendary diner scene that still gets me every time I watch it. Helping matters is the fact that Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have such great chemistry, even though their characters couldn't be any more different; or maybe that's why they work so well. Heck, they're so different even their development is opposite; while Harry grows as a person, it doesn't really feel like Sally does, which isn't really a problem, just how life is sometimes. What is a problem is, of course, the film uses that awful cliche where the leads break up over a misunderstanding and they mope for most of the remaining runtime, though thankfully, there are still some funny moments during this part. I'm also split on the interludes with the couples telling of how they met; they're charming, well acted, and decent enough stories, but they aren't really funny.The directing is really strong, no surprise seeing how it's Rob Reiner, who directed other classics like Stand By Me and The Princess Bride. New York is well shot and presented, mainly through several great montages set to classic music. And there is some really great editing thrown in, like when Harry and Sally are on the phone while watching Casablanca at the same time and they are both shown through split screen.Overall, When Harry Met Sally is a great, classic comedy that never fails to get a big laugh out of me. It's a shame that Crystal and Ryan never did another movie together (at least as far as I know), but hey, at least they got their one film as right as they did.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Movie,"I used to watch thriller movie. I rarely watch comedy movies but the ones I have watched I will rate it third in my all time comedy movies after Forrest Gump and me, myself and Irene. This movie is not just about comedy but also about the question ""Can two people of opposite sex be friends only?"". I do believe that yes they can. The movie is also about love and marriage. ""Divorce"" is not common in India as it is in US. But still ""Love"" always thrives over ""Marriage"". As you can't be happy with a person you are not in love with. As depicted in the movie as well that it is all about love and not about sex only. If you really love someone you will always want them to be happy. This part is perfectly demonstrated in the movie and I loved that about the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Baby Fish-mouth, the wagon wheel table, the day-of-the-week underpants, I can watch it a hundred times and I will laugh a hundred times. The setting in a fairytale Manhattan, where young professionals can afford roomy apartments and where old jazz standards fill the air, adds to the magic. The scenes with the old couples telling their love stories are very sweet.A perfect film for the Christmas period. Highly recommended, this film has aged well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the finest directors of the 80's. He took a simple story and turned it into something incredible.The chemistry between Meg and Billy is so wonderful and you just keep rooting for their characters to get together because you know how perfect they are for each other.

Picky Romantics Find Unique Passion in Their Fundamental Differences,"Fresh out of school, a pair of young adults with a mutual friend take a long road trip to New York City. The common acquaintance doesn't stick in either of their lives, but the content of their time-killing conversation sure does. He's callous and cynical, she's composed and idealistic, and when the subject shifts to romance, they both get off on the wrong foot. She thinks platonic friendship is possible between the sexes, he confidently disagrees, and that's a conflict they just can't move past. The first impression is so bad, they both allow it to color a decade's worth of terse social interactions. While chance and coincidence place them, repeatedly, in the same room (or row of airline seats) over the ensuing years, they each fight the inevitable, even as their rare romantic compatibility grows obvious.Reminiscent of Annie Hall, both in its timeless portrayal of a complicated relationship and its heady mix of prickly truths with pointed punchlines, When Harry Met Sally still feels contemporary, thirty-five years after the fact. Society might be enamored with fast paced dating apps nowadays, but the secrets of lasting love remain unchanged. It's all about the interplay, about finding a partner who can challenge us to improve without upsetting the cart, and about taking the leap of faith necessary to open up and share our inner selves with someone who might just reject us out-of-hand. Harry and Sally both make such attempts in New York, with mutually disastrous results, but the failed risks finally give them something new to commiserate over. A fresh slant on the topic that split them so many years prior. As they ease into exactly the sort of strictly-platonic friendship that Harry once insisted was impossible, they grow closer; relaxing and revealing themselves without even realizing what they've done. It's a beautiful change to observe, two spirits in simpatico, even as their artificial boundary (JUST FRIENDS) stands in the way of a total revelation. Eventually, they've gotta deal with that elephant in the room.I loved this. Billy Crystal's style of comedy isn't always for me - I usually associate him with an exhausting flood of quick-hits and dad jokes - but Nora Emphron's script and Rob Reiner's direction keep his brasher tendencies in check and Meg Ryan serves as his perfect counterpart. Once they give each other that long-sought second chance, the two are wonderful together. A harmonious set of conversational sparring partners that can poke and tease each other without losing their smile. I couldn't wipe the grin from my face, either. Sharp, witty and often laugh-out-loud funny, this also serves as a valid observational / confessional piece (a sort of on-screen therapy for the unhappily divorced Reiner) that should strike home for jilted romantics of any generation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rom-Com with depth,"This is a special movie. You could call it a romantic comedy, but it is also a character study that speaks to a universal human experience, which is the question of identity. Who am I in this world, where do I belong, and how can I tell if I'm there? In this movie, there is a powerful emotional connection between the main characters that also translates beautifully to the audience's connection with them. Their internal struggles, doubts, and needs are so familiar you can't help but identify with them on some level. If it weren't for the jokes, this would be a very difficult movie to sit through mainly because of the loneliness that is so pervasive. Through love and providence, the protagonists remain connected through their lives. Their experiences together are woven into a tapestry of memories that define them as the individuals they become but also as they were meant to be. Is this realistic? Maybe not. Is this romantic? Without question. We all wish for the ""right one"" whether it takes a decade or whether it is by arrangement. This is a great cinematic expression of romance.I did remove 3 stars for occasions where the dialogue and direction felt forced. This impacted my suspension of disbelief and took me out of the movie momentarily. The connection with characters, however, is strong enough to get back into the story, however. If it wasn't for that, the movie would not have worked nearly as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, lame, uninspiring","I am infinity surprised this movie gets good ratings. The plot is mediocre at best, the pace is drawn out and slow, but most importantly, it's sooo boring. After you watch it for 10 minutes you already know how it ends, and if you are expecting great acting, clever dialog, or visually interesting images you will be utterly disappointed, like I was. There are maybe two or so somewhat interesting scenes but that's about all. Also, the actors play their roles as if they don't care, and they really don't. I consider time spent to watch this movie to be a total waste.

Acerbic insights and clever sound-bites,"Nora Ephron's original screenplay for ""When Harry Met Sally..."" often doesn't feel original at all. Her acerbic insights are wrapped up in Woody Allen-isms, while director Rob Reiner lays on the autumnal romanticism of a dozen other movies. Still, it's an enjoyable picture, with at least one line (delivered by Reiner's real-life mother) that still brings down the house. Single man and woman (he the chauvinistic one, she both headstrong and insecure) are thrown together for a one-time car trip, which leads to numerous such meetings in which both characters constantly square off against the other for their respective sexes. Ephron's world isn't peopled with living, breathing human beings ; she's interested in clever sound-bites and lyrical humdingers--anything to get a smile out of the audience. Reiner handles stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan very well, and his chapter stops involving various married couples, done pseudo-documentary style, is cute in a winking, Hollywood way. Still, while the public was tickled and critics were entertained, nobody thought this was great filmmaking, resulting in one Oscar nomination for Ephron. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Entertaining, but Woody Allen-lite","Certainly has its place in the romcom genre, but not quite as good as I remembered it. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play people trying to navigate the world of being single, as well as what it means to be friends with a member of the opposite sex. They start off as brief acquaintances who are mostly annoyed with one another, then run into each other after years have passed and develop a platonic friendship, even though he doesn't believe women and men can ever truly be friends because ""the sex part always gets in the way.""Crystal's character is rather smug and irritating, and even though he evolves over the movie, the film seems to take his view, which to me was simplistic and outmoded. He bins women into high maintenance and low maintenance, men talking to each other only about sports, and makes an incredibly offensive joke about the famine in Ethiopia which killed over a million people just a few years earlier. He quips about an Ethiopian restaurant, ""Hey I didn't know that they had food in Ethiopia. This will be a quick meal. I'll order two empty plates and we can leave."" Good lord.Offsetting this are some memorable moments, like Ryan faking an orgasm in a crowded restaurant (never mind that her strait-laced character would probably never do this), as well as some wonderful interviews with older couples talking about how they met (never mind that they were all actors). Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby are pretty good in their supporting roles as well.The film trundles along to an ending we know is coming, which is fine, it's a romcom after all, but along the way it felt mostly like Woody Allen-lite. The soundtrack, Manhattan setting, dialogue dealing with death, various plot devices, etc ... it all seemed like Annie Hall, but not done as well.

Best Romantic Comedy of All Time....,"When Harry Met Sally is a film that not only supports witty and memorable dialogue, it provides a great analysis of the interaction between the two sexes: and poses the universal question of whether men and women can truly be friends. This is the film that launched Meg Ryan as queen of the romantic comedy lead, as well as established Billy Crystal as a strong leading man, both becoming their characters with such unique tastes they are destined to become cinematic icons.This is the film so many other romantic comedies try to live up to, yet most often fail to accomplish. Creating two memorable and likable characters such as Harry Burns and Sally Albright has proven to be more stereotype than unique. Harry with his easy going attitude towards women, and Sally with her obsessive compulsive ways. The two are seeming opposites personality wise, and at first, these traits keep them apart. It takes them ten years to even have a real conversation without tension between them because one is a man, and the other a woman. Yet it takes one event, both getting dumped by their significant others, to bring them together to bond over.What makes this film so memorable is the dialogue, with an outstanding screenplay by Nora Ephron. The Oscar nomination she was given for writing this film was highly deserved, for penning such lines as why men and women can never be friends, as well as Harry's declaration of love t the film's end.The film also supports a strong supporting cast from Carrie Fisher, as well as Bruno Kirby as the best friends to the lead characters. Every supporting player here remains memorable, down to the cameos such as director Reiner's mother who states the now famous, ""I'll have what she's having."" line.The ending to this film can bring tears to those who watch it every time. It is films like this that give hope to people that one day, they will find that one person who challenges them, and loves them for exactly who they are. When Harry Met Sally is the perfect film to watch for people of all ages, and will certainly stand the test of time. Highly recommended.MJR",,Anonymous,Romance
Lots of Laughs,"Harry and Sally seem to be complete opposites on first encounter, but as time passes their personalities meld into one another and they become inseparable. It's interesting to me how I sensed no chemistry between the characters at the beginning but by the end I couldn't imagine them being with anyone else.I think this movie does at a good job at creating believable chemistry between the characters, developing it, and also offering lots of laughs on the side. It's rare that I laugh out loud during a film but I did multiple times during this one. The orgasm scene in the restaurant is way too good.Harry isn't the best looking guy in the world, but he's devilishly charming and has a dark sense of humour, which I guess proves that any guy, no matter his looks, has a chance with a good looking woman if he plays his cards right. Sally is, of course, stunning and way too good for him, but like many women she's tired of being with jerks and is won over by Harry.I think the magic of this movie is creating on screen relationships and situations that mirror the ones we've all experienced in real life, at one point or another. There are many times throughout this film I was thinking, ""oh, this is so relatable. I think that all the time"". Harry is like an endless source of truisms about how relationships are doomed to fail and the reasons why.And yet, somehow, even though most of us have been through terrible relationships and have hit rock bottom a time or two, we all eventually manage to end up happy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Comedy That Most People Can Relate To,"This movie is easily one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time. I don't like giving spoilers so I'll just put out some points so you can decide whether or not to rent/buy this:If you like Billy Crystal as a comedian, then you will love this movie. He makes his signature subtle, pessimistic jokes throughout the movie.Meg Ryan is also great. Although her character develops from a snobby, sheltered young woman to a mature, open-minded woman, she maintains this innocence that makes this fun to watch because you get to kind of feel what she feels -- she speaks what comes to mind, and you see her emotions all over her face. It kind of reminds me of her role in Sleepless in Seattle and her other earlier roles.Together, Billy and Meg have this great chemistry on screen, and this makes the movie feel like you're watching a real story. The way the relationship develops is probably the most interesting thing, so even if you know what happens, you will enjoy watching it happen. If you don't know what happens, it's a perfect feel-good movie with a happy ending, but it's not easy to predict how it gets to the happy ending.Overall, this movie is a great choice if you're looking for something uplifting, romantic, and funny but also realistic and not too mushy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple and clever.,"Yes, I finally got around to watching this and I have to say it's actually aged fairly well. There is a good pace and some very clever direction.It is very typically 80's, the hair more than anything, but it still works.I don't know if it's just because it's Meg Ryan, but it seems to bear some similarities to 'Sleepless In Seattle', perhaps it's the filming style or the Nora Ephron connection.Billy Crystal isn't your standard sexy male lead, but he is a character and that's something that a lot of films miss these days. The couples get together, because they're both beautiful and successful, but where are the films about the frumpy looking potatoes like me? We need hope that it's possible to find love too ya know?Carrie Fisher in her supporting role thrives in this sort of thing and without being sucked out in to space and using the force to survive too.Bruno Kirby does a good job as well, it's a shame to have lost him at such an early age.Overall, it's a charming film, with some good humour and cute romance. It's full of classic lines and scenes that have been replicated in many films since and ""I'll have what she's having"" will probably never get old.I put it off, because I thought it would bore me, but I really enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A portrait of the problems of adult love relationships,"Probably the question that approaches this film with the naked eye is can men and women be friends without a sexual attraction involved? However, this film addresses a couple of other questions that I have realized are going unnoticed in the reviews of most people, this movie also talks about the gap between love and friendship, how easy it is to pass from one point to another without knowing it, Harry and Sally probably knew that they were in love from the beginning but refused to accept it and here another interesting subplot opens that addresses another question, or rather the issue of unrequited love affairs.WHMS is an open book on problems of adult life related to love and portrays how women and men face it in different ways, this film, like most, states that men do not pay much attention to this and spend their days having forced relationships without any connection or compassion, just thinking about pleasure, while women cry and suffer thinking about loneliness, it is probably a real portrait, however when Harry discovers that he loves Sally he begins to face these problems more mature way and begins to imagine a life without Sally, Harry goes into shock and runs to look for Sally, this is the moment when Harry really matures, in an early scene Harry tells Jess that he is maturing because now he can having a friendship with a woman without sex in between, however, this is when he discovers that the true way to mature is to have a woman and love her without the sex in between, and this is exactly what he feels for Sally.This movie is a gallery of deep and well-written characters and each one with its well-detailed personality, occasionally Sally's character took a different direction from the original configuration of the script but these problems were only momentary so it practically does not spoil at all the experience and history that apart from talking about sexuality and adult romantic relationships presents other problems of age such as fear of loneliness and becomes the main cause of depression for many people.WHMS also presents a a different portrait of relationships and love, with an existentialist and depressing tone in the style of Woody Allen, full of interesting dialogues that also has many similarities with the epigramatic and sharp dialogues of Woody Allen that evoke extensive discussions on seemingly banal themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Refreshing Take on Classic Romantic Trope.,"Its a new spin on the classic rom-com trope of boy meets girl, they hate each other & eventually they fall in love. Meg & Billy dont really like each other & they just go each their own way everytime life makes them stumble upon each other. How they find friendship and love, is the story. The screenplay by Nora Ephron is the biggest positive here. Refreshingly casual dialogues with hilarious one-liners performed exceptionally by Billy, Meg & Carrie. The merciless & jarringly funny dating culture of New York is on showcase here. But the main message of how real friendships can turn into great relationships is very well presented. One of the better rom-coms out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

amazing movie for both men and women,"THIS IS MY ALL- TIME FAVORITE MOVIE! I can totally relate to it and, and even with some drama, they cleverly add hilarious comic relief and make a wonderful, unforgettable film.OMG this is such an excellent movie that every generation will love.Its a movie about love, and friendship, and at the same time a comedy! So many lines from this movie are memorable for anyone who sees this.Everyone who watches this will relate to at least one of the characters: sensitive, smart Sally; immature, but caring Harry; clueless and hilarious Marie and Jess; or even the couples that are shown as a tribute to marriage. Nobody who sees this will be disappointed,although i can only give it a 10/10, if i could i would give it like a 15/10...........GO AND SEE THIS BRILLIANT MOVIE!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best dialog in romantic comedies!!,"Don't look! Just listen. It'll work. Of course you can enjoy watching it as well. But if you think Billy Crystal is not handsome enough to play a leading role in romantic comedies, or if you think Meg Ryan is still so cute to make you feel sick, it'd be better for you to listen to the movie with your eyes closed. Because the dialog is the best part of the movie, which is witty, piercing and memorable. The cast did a wonderful job in the dialog. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal seemed to be mismatched together at first. But soon you'll find that they are not only making a miraculous harmony but also enhanced the quality of the dialog itself. Billy Crystal especially makes you giggle or laugh with his well-known sense of humor. The supporting cast is also appropriate. In their conversations you hardly find flowery words. They are always dry and blunt, and it makes this movie different from other mainstream sweet romantic comedies. And the screenplay is also good. ""Men and women can never be friends."" This topic keeps appealing to you throughout the dialog, which is really sensible and you can really identify yourself with the characters. Don't you think it's nice to have someone, who you believed was your best friend for a long time, turns out to be the one you really really love?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Charming with great music.,"I liked this movie on two levels.First, the story is cute, charming and easy to follow. There are no gimmicky surprise twists. Just your basic boy meets girl romance. From the beginning, you kind of start rooting for our two leads to get together.Secondly, I liked the actors who were chosen to play these characters. Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher create an ensemble that is engaging to watch.Nora Ephron's cute scenario includes enough funny stuff to keep it light as the story plays out. Director, Rob Reiner likes his characters and his actors and elicits good performances from a proficient them. Billy CrystalThis definitely falls into the romantic comedy genre.

Rest of Your Life,This is what all rom-coms should strive for. It created a perfect atmosphere (Autumn & holiday season in NYC with jazz is just heavenly!) and have showcased fantastic performances of the two lead casts - Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan. The writing was also very interesting because I found it amazing that they could pack so much into 90 minutes. Not a single moment to waste.Personally found very fond of it because I've gone through and going through a Harry-Sally relationship. It brings up many complex emotions that is different from the typical romantic relationship and I found that the movie portrays that pretty well. A classic is a classic for a reason. Beautiful movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice Romantic Comedy,"This film is about a man and woman who doubt whether men and women really can become friends or not. In the film, first, the hero and heroine meet at the first time, but they don't have a good impression about each other. Second, they meet again after a long time and become best friends. Finally, they have a quarrel, but thanks to it, they can get the answer about their doubt. I like the music which is used in the film since it is apropos and gives the film a good effect. Then, I like the theme of this film because it is interesting. Some people probably have a same doubt as the hero and heroine of this film. Therefore, I recommend such people watch this film to get the answer. I feel this film shows us the essence of a relationship of mutual trust between men and women. I think this is a good romantic comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll Have What She's Having,"When Harry Met Sally is a true modern classic. Honestly one of Rob Reiner's best films and it had some big names attached, like Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. Even Reiner's mother makes a cameo in the infamous diner scene with the quote ""I'll have what she's having"" after Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal discuss orgasms. Steven Ford even has a small role as Joe, the one-time boyfriend of Sally.The interviews with the couples that are interplayed between scenes in the movie make you fall in love with Harry and Sally and want them to fall in love with each other as well. The speech that Harry gives to Sally on New Year's Eve is one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, and was even used and hilariously recreated in an episode of Scrubs in 2004 when Turk and Carla marry.It is hard to believe that the film was rated R in 1989 though, as by the standards of 2024, it would almost be PG or PG-13, as it doesn't seem at all that bad, but changing values I guess. It's still considered a classic, and it's hard to believe that the film is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
When Harry Met Sally,"When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that I was in no way prepared for, which is my favorite kind of new favorite film to watch. Having never seen a Rob Reiner film, I wasn't sure of his style or technique or how he approached his subjects. I quickly learned through his 1989 feature that he provides a very real look at the lives of people in relationships. When Harry Met Sally tells the tale of a chance meeting between two strangers who then continue to reappear in each other's lives. The way in which Reiner exposes the truths of finding someone you can best tolerate in a partner, rather than the person that makes your heart turn to mush is a brilliant grasp of how to illustrate the human condition. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan star in the titular roles and provide the brilliant illustration of everyday, flawed human beings often sensationalized for cinema.Sally (Meg Ryan) agrees to give her friend's boyfriend, Harry (Billy Crystal) a ride to New York upon their graduation from the University of Chicago. After a long car ride of sharing all the quirky details that make up their existence, completely uninhibited since they are unavailable to each other. After the journey to New York is complete, the two part ways not thinking much of each other. Harry and Sally keep bumping into each other over the years as their lives intersect. They finally decide to maintain a friendship, and quickly become friends and confidants. As they see each other through each successive stage of their lives, it becomes increasingly more difficult to watch the other date. Neither of the two has ever shared such intimate details of their lives, their hopes, fears, and dreams with another person so it only makes sense that the two fall in love. Two people with such neuroses in some ways make a perfect match, but in other ways are their own biggest obstacles in love.A film that looks and feels this much like Annie Hall is obviously going to rank highly on my list. I had begun writing about the similarities this film shared with Annie Hall, but I soon gave up because there are just too many. The dialogue is fantastic and the entire film is so well-written. Even though the famous line ""I'll have what she's having."" has worked its way into the American lexicon, it loses nothing when it is spoken. Oftentimes, with a line so popular, the audience member has the ""roll-your-eyes-""oh"" moment when it's spoken; but that's not the case with When Harry Met Sally because the script is so perfect. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfect in their roles, with just enough chemistry to make their unconventional friendship work. Despite how great Meg Ryan was in the role, and also despite the fact that the fate of the universe wouldn't allow it, I couldn't help but think all throughout the film how perfect Gilda Radner (R.I.P.) would have been in the role opposite Crystal. Anyway, When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant look at the lives of real people, and an exceptional film that has already become a new favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
THE romantic comedy,"I saw this film in the theatre in 1989. I went with a very good female friend. At the time, we had been platonic friends for a few years and did everything together. I'd like to say that our story ended the same, but, alas, she is married and has three children. That's okay though, she is still a friend. The reality of this film is, of course, that a relationship like Harry's and Sally's is next to impossible.If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm a man. What's more, this film is truly my favourite. This movie is a romantic comedy defined. Is it odd that, as a man, this film should be my favourite? Well, no. I wish I could define why in terms of specifics.Perhaps it was because Harry, throughout the movie, tells Sally the many truths about men that even most men won't admit (after sex, they just want to go home, etc). Perhaps it was because it gave hope to all men that that great woman he was friends with would eventually stop dating all the losers and choose him to be his wife. Perhaps it is because Meg Ryan is so adorable and plays the roll so convincingly. Maybe it was that, in spite of all the atrocious things Harry tells Sally about men (specifically, himself), she still falls in love with him. In the end I believe that it was just the overall picture and impression it created. This film, even with the storybook ending, was very believable because of the writing and talent of the actors.This movie is executed perfectly on so many levels. The comedy is side-splitting, but subtle. The writing, as we know from the DVD, was based in the reality of being single in your thirties and men and women's attitudes toward it. The direction was careful not to take away from the scenes. The chemistry between Crystal and Ryan was magical (the scene where Meg is repeating Billy's statements in that strange voice is impossible to imagine with other actors). There is so much going on in this film to make it work, how could it lose?Kudos to Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher as well for their performances. My particular scene with them is where they hail a taxi together after Harry and Sally's poor attempt at setting them up with, well, Harry and Sally.If you are a man and can't relate to SOMETHING in this film, then you are not human. We have all been in Harry's shoes. Sally gives us hope and reminds us that being in love is not always easy, but still one of the greatest things to happen to you. It also stresses the importance of friendship. I admit it, even after several watches, I get a bit misty in the end. After 11 years of being friends, Harry finally admits to Sally that he loves her. When she asks him why he tells her this, he says ""because I realize that when you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible"". Brilliant.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Cute Little Love Story,"This movie has one of the most classic scenes in the history of cinema. The scene where Sally tells Harry how easy it is for a woman to fake an orgasm and then, demonstrates it in the restaurant is straight classic!! That part alone, is worth watching the movie. On a whole, it's a cute story about falling in love, and finding love where you least expect it. The principle characters Harry (Billy Crystal) & Sally (Meg Ryan) find their paths keep crossing after a chance meeting while driving to New York. They try to set their friends up with each other, before realizing that they are the ones who are meant for each other. A cute film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

my orthodontist sat at the table where they met,"I guess that most people can't think of ""When Harry Met Sally..."" without picturing the orgasm scene. Certainly that scene's a hoot, but there is more to the movie (including the line about a New York death). The one song by Louis Armstrong played during the first sequence (""tomato...to-mah-to"") really heightens the mood. Although I usually don't like Meg Ryan, she does a good job here, as does Billy Crystal. Above all, this reaffirms Rob Reiner as one of the best directors of our time.

When Harry Met Sally,"Were it not for the now legendary scene in the diner - and, for me, the lovely follow-up from the observing woman at the next table to the waitress, this would just be another quickly-paced, run-of-the-mill, romantic comedy that's exceedingly heavy on the dialogue. It's all about the evolution of the relationship between ""Harry"" (Billy Crystal) and ""Sally"" (Meg Ryan). They've been friends since God was a boy, but always preferred to date other people. Now clearly, as we progress through this feast of relationship mishaps, that isn't really working and they come back to their perennial question. Would them having sex ruin a beautiful friendship? The story is set across quite an extended timeframe, and that allows Rob Reiner to reset the episodic nature of the comedy and introduce new partners for us to appreciate, like and loathe as the punchline to the story becomes as obvious as the sun in the sky. The writing is witty and pithy at times, yes, but there's just way too much of it and even though there's a semblance of chemistry between Ryan and Crystal on screen, I just found the whole thing just a bit too obvious. It's not a bad watch, and I know I'm very much in the minority of opinion here, but this is really only a standard vehicle for two averagely talented stars, one of whom can ""yes, yes, yes..."" with the best of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not to miss,"What a great movie. The dialogues between Harry and Sally are extremely funny and interesting, they're basically everything that I like to think and talk about with my best friend. Who is a guy, and not a girl, a thing that is perfectly explained in the movie by Billy Crystal. Except for the dark side thing his character is somebody I really relate to, we just think alike. Great acting, great music, great dialogues(especially by Crystal who, at moments looks like Jerry Seinfeld;I don't know if i's those white sneakers or the dialogues:) and a bunch of very funny jokes make this movie a must see for everyone. Oh and a nice touch with those scenes where old married couples explain the (sometimes almost unbelievable) circumstances in which they met. Old people had ""Casablanca"", this is a movie for the younger generations. And you don't even need the hankies.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic with a script that gives it a personal touch.,"I love romantic clichés and more if they are classics without caring about the bad details, I usually contextualize myself and I am not interested in anything but love but here the certain unknowns that are proposed made me see it differently.The friendship between man and woman as something false (???), something that is obviously very clear that it is not true today and it is not necessary to clarify, but here it does not bother me that they give a wrong answer but a development that really they seemed like friends, maybe a little confused or cool but I didn't think they were close enough to end up together although obviously it was predictable.Neat performances by both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have a beautiful chemistry with two such opposite personalities that they rose to coexist.This friendship / love story was nominated for the 1990 Oscars for 'Best Original Screenplay', a well-deserved recognition by the academy, nominating a genre that is not so accepted in technical matters among the 5 best.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply dreadful,"Sorry, but someone's got to say it ... this movie is dreadful! Perhaps I don't have the right to pass judgement since I only managed to sit through about half of it, but I can't stand seeing all these 5 star eulogies and no-one putting the case for the prosecution.Meg Ryan, probably the most irritating actress to have (dis-)graced the big screen, had already perfected her cutesy/dippy persona to such an extent that five minutes exposure was enough to send the less hardened of us gibbering from the room. Even fifteen years later, I'm finding it difficult to cope with the trauma of having been shut in a darkened cinema with 'that performance'.As for the 'memorable dialogue' - it's possible I've blanked it out to protect myself, but I certainly couldn't repeat any of it now. Or even a minute after I left the building. Apart, of course, from the 'hilariously' original orgasm scene. Aaaagh!

Timeless,"I introduced this film to my 27-year old girlfriend; I am - um - older. I watched it with her for her first time because every time we'd be in a restaurant, she WAS Sally, and she missed the reference, so we had to watch it. Not only did I enjoy it for the umpteenth viewing, but she absolutely loved it. I mean, I came home from work tonight, and there she was, watching it - again - for the 5th or 6th time. She loves it because I am Harry and she is Sally. But, more importantly, she loves it - and I love it still - because it is a timeless classic. It's a great movie because Billy Crystal's deadpan delivery of every line hits every time, because Meg Ryan is in her prime as America's sweetheart and plays off Billy so well that it's hard to imagine anybody else in that role, ditto for the rest of the supporting cast, the direction by Reiner is well-paced and doesn't stagnate as many of these rom-coms tend to do, and the interview-style scenes with the random couples are funny and poignant.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Old favorite never gets old.,"I saw ""When Harry Met Sally"" in the theater upon release back in 1989. I remember it well, I was single, had a date with a school teacher from Kingwood, a very nice lady but we just weren't right for each other. The orgasm scene was a bit embarrassing with someone I hardly knew. Then just a couple of months after that I met the Banker that I did marry.Anyway, I bought the DVD after it was recently released, and watched it again, much of it was fresh as the first viewing 13 years ago. However I knew that eventually, after years of meeting and parting, they would get together. Billy Crystal was asked recently about a sequel and he replied, ""It would be interesting to do a film about Harry and Sally 15 years after the first one ended."" Maybe Meg Ryan will get the word and they will.I give the film a high rating. The story spans 1977, the two just finishing up at University of Chicago and carpooling together to New York City to start careers. The overall story is straightforward, spanning 12 years. Harry and Sally become friends but hesitate to take it further for various reasons. But Crystal's goofiness and Ryan's perfect portrayal of Sally, ""a high maintenance woman who thinks she is low maintenance, the worse kind"", makes this a highly enjoyable movie. Re-watching it (in 2025) is like visiting old friends after a number of years. Their interplay is what makes the movie hold our interest for the duration. Plus, there's some clever writing and good direction obvious in there too.",,Anonymous,Romance
"It's reputation precedes it, but being labelled the best rom-com is like being king of trash mountain","Admittedly, the movie does miss many of the trappings that can make the genre especially nauseating. It strolls along at a leisurely pace, and while you always know where it's going, there is some satisfaction when it gets there. It doesn't aim for big laughs or big tears, favouring more realistic and relatable character development. Billy Crystal's sharp and fast dialogue is impressive and entertaining, but Meg Ryan's character is kind of a vanilla wafer that's only one fake orgasm away from having no real personality. Overall, it's a rather dry affair that hovers just above being boring, but it's jazzy score and perfect shots of New York through the seasons do offer some classic Hollywood sentimentality that's not without it's charms.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't want to know what will happen in the end. I just don't care.Secondly I did not find anything funny. Now comedy is a matter of taste and the people i watched this with laughed out loud.

And all through it asks one pertinent question that can a man and a woman be friends without the sex coming in between.We all beautiful movies, romantic movies and we shall surely love this one coz it's both beautiful and romantic. It's romantic and it speaks for the most part about sex and then later on to the small things that we surely appreciate about the other person. It's the small things that make the big picture of life and those are shown beautifully like Sally ordering a dish at a restaurant. Also, this one has of the best embarrassing moments in cinema that is Sally faking an orgasm in a restaurant and situation of Harry. Immediately the woman on the other table tells ""I'll have what she's having"".Screenplay by Nora Ephron is just wonderful; the poignancy is maintained by bringing in elderly couples that have held on to each other for years and letting us know how they had met or got convinced to tie the knot.More than anything it simply works because of the chemistry between the two leads. Bill Crystal (Harry) and Meg Ryan (Sally) are wonderful in their roles.

Perfect,"When Harry Met Sally... does something most rom-coms don't have the guts to do. Instead of presenting a couples meet-cute as the end-all, be-all of their relationship, it treats it merely as a wonderful anecdote. The truth of romance isn't the perfect, magical moments we tell at dinner parties, but is the endurance of the commitment and love. Reiner proves this through transcendently great characters and a unique series real-life vignettes of couples telling their own stories. That interest in familiar sincerity gives us a rom-com that's both honestly romantic and truly comedic, never sacrificing one for the other.
It's a ten-year journey of two people who hate each other, become friends, and inevitably but unintentionally fall in love; the kind of comedy Woody Allen could've made if he weren't so cynically self-obsessed. Ryan and Crystal get past their own professional limitations, stepping into their titular roles with endless likability. Their magnetic radiance helps sell every ever-changing aspect of their relationship.
But the script is the star here. The dialogue sweeps you up, having the bounce of old screwball-fare, but with a more naturalistic touch. Moments like ""I'll have what she's having"" have become so ubiquitous, we forget how perfect they really are.
Best of all, it manages to present the western stereotypes of men and women, while never defending them as absolute truth. Reiner and writer Nora Ephron use those stereotypes, certainly, but not as exact sciences so much as comedic tools, before upending them wherever possible.
This was at the pinnacle of Reiner's filmmaking streak, having a flawless knack for picking great scripts, and When Harry Met Sally... is arguably his crowning achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the greatest romantic comedies ever made.,"When Harry met Sally was a massive critical and box office success when it was released. This is a witty comedy set in the big apple and both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are in fantastic touch. They were both huge stars at the time and the respective king and queen of comedy, unarguably. The reason the film was so successful is because it taps into the omnipresent societal dilemma: Can a man and woman simply be friends and nothing more.

When Harry Met Sally is a fresh modern take on the tired romantic comedy genre.,"Suffice to say throughout the course of Hollywood, we have been faced with many romcoms with most ultimately failing. However, the late 80's and early 90's added many entries that reinvigorated the genre. In this sweet flick, sweet and sarcastic Harry meets sweet and beautiful Sally. Then the sweet couple meet again. And then again...and again. Oh, and again. Basic plot full of conveniences, but director Rob Reiner took the risk of removing a complex and captivating story to flesh out the characters. I can see why this is popular yet I do see issues that detract from my personal enjoyment with the film. Firstly, I adored the minimalistic approach that Reiner took. Just two friends communicating. That's all this film is. There is no plot device. Instead we experience the natural progression of two friends slowly falling in love as they spend more time together. Incredibly relatable and insufferably sweet. The only thing sweeter than this is a bowl of sugar. The narrative boasts an utterly witty screenplay that brings these characters to life. Perhaps slightly too focussed on the topic of sex. Billy Crystal's Harry is brimming with sarcasm and a dark intelligent sense of humour whereas Meg Ryan's Sally reeks of innocence and exhumes optimism. The juxtaposing personalities make for some compelling conversations including, but not limited to, an orgasm reenactment in the middle of a diner. Sally's got balls. Big balls. Meg Ryan's performance was solid however I felt Billy Crystal was too monotonous in an attempt to come across as sarcastic. Didn't really connect with him. The lack of substance within the plot does unfortunately prevent a thrilling story and I did occasionally find myself disconnected with the narrative. However this is just a personal preference. As a romcom, When Harry Met Sally is refreshingly innovative that can be enjoyed by all, just too sweet and thinly plotted for my liking. This is as much fun as observing two young people's lives should be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A modern masterpiece,"""When Harry Met Sally"" is certainly the wittiest romantic comedy of all time.  It is also perhaps the most daring romantic-comedy ever produced, and I say this out of respect for its sheer honesty about the roles of physical attraction, sex, and friendship between men and women.  For a long time I accidentally avoided the film, though as a graduate of The University of Chicago (where Harry met Sally at the beginning of the film), I finally decided to rent the film, a decade after its original release.  As it turns out, all this time I have been missing one of modern cinema's greatest masterpieces.  Rob Reiner has brought to life a gem of a screenplay, and the inspired performances of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, as well as the supporting cast, create scenes that capture the true essence of people and relationships as they are in life; I never felt that either Harry or Sally were merely ""characters"".   The chemistry between them worked for me; though at times I did feel that Meg Ryan took Sally Allbright's wilful, almost wooden naivete a bit far.  (And to be honest, I fail to see how The University of Chicago could have ever produced a Sally Allbright, whereas Billy Crystal's Harry, with his skepticism, quirky humor, and his insight and questions on the subject of human nature, *would* feel right at home at the U of C. )  All the same, this is not the type of film that comes along every day; Rob Reiner's achievement with this film is of a quality that should stand the test of time.   I find it hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this film.  My rating: 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Perfect RomCom,"The primary purpose of a film is to entertain. If it happens to make you think then, so much the better. When Harry met Sally will certainly entertain, although you'll probably not need to do too much in the thinking department. This film is a classic of it's genre and it has certainly inspired many other films since it's release. It's almost certainly true that Ryan and Crystal were forever typecast in roles similar to Harry and Sally.The story follows the slowly simmering relationship of Harry and Sally played out over a decade from an unpromising start during the pairs move from Chicago to New York. It's a very warm film that promotes the concept that opposites attract. 7/10/",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It took long enough,"Nora Ephron's original screenplay was the only Academy recognition for When Harry Met Sally received when it was nominated. I think it's a funny film, but I'm not as big a fan of it as some are.It's the story of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who take 12 years and 90 minutes plus of film footage to realize they are right for each other. I think the concept interesting but it is also good for maybe a 20 minute sketch as opposed to a feature film.Meg Ryan's faux orgasm scene at the restaurant is still the scene most remembered from the movie and she certainly carries it off with breathtaking style. Some bemused underplaying is done by friends Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher who keep wondering why these two just don't kanoodle and be done with it. My favorite scene is the contrasting split screen phone calls from Crystal to Kirby and from Ryan to Fisher describing the long awaited big event.It took long enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A quirky New York love story with real life couples trying to explain the secret to their success.,"It's hard to imagine that this film is 33 years old! When I first saw it, this film was refreshingly honest and unique.""When I buy a new book I always read the last page first, that way in case I die before I finish I know how it ends. That my friend is a dark side.""-HarryIt tells the story of two opposites Harry and Sally, who meet as strangers on a long cross country road trip from college. This starts a long friendship between the two.The story is told interspersed with candid interviews with elderly real life married couples and a wonderful soundtrack featuring Harry Connick, Jr. (which really launched his career) and the incomparables Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.""Men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way.""-Harry""No man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive, he always wants to have sex with her.""-Harry
""So you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive?""-Sally
""No you pretty much want to mail them too.""-Harry.Five years after their college road-trip to New York, they meet again at the airport in New York. Sally is played by the young and incredibly endearing Meg Ryan and Harry is played by the very funny Billy Crystal...and the two just work.

I don't believe it,"The script is weeeeaaaak.
Maybe people in New York act like this, but for me these two characters are completely unreal. Their jokes, their talks - nobody speaks and thinks like that.
They also make a horrible mismatch and I will never buy that they love each other or can be together in long perspective.
There is one character in this movie who is real - Marie, a Sally's friend. Now that is a real woman.As for acting - Billy is convincing, but Meg is not. When she cried because of Joe and was throwing Kleenex around, I never believed that she is sad, disappointed or upset.So I watched this movie twice - first one was ok because I didn't know how it will end, but the second was not needed. I will not watch it anymore.",,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated,"Sometimes, there are stories in which from the beginning you already know how they will end, but what is interesting is seeing the entire journey that took place in between. It's fun and anecdotal. This applies to When Harry Met Sally. You know at all times how the young couple will end up, but the journey they take together is what is entertaining about the film. Now, when I say entertaining, I say it under the assumption that it will be, however, in this particular plot, the level of entertainment is quite measured. It is there, but with its levels merely in the category of ""decent"" or ""meets expectations."" The truth is that despite only having almost 90 minutes, they feel like they were much more, as the film is too redundant, stalling several times without letting the story progress naturally. At times it was like watching several similar episodes of a romantic sitcom. I must admit that there are some points where the script makes a good pair with the editing. They are quite intelligent moments, although they are clearly just isolated sparks. Most of the time, the editing has minimal errors that are not distracting, but they are there. The performances are regular. A better leading couple could have made better use of the roles.In short, a movie to spend the afternoon with something that creates a light adult conversation, but does not transcend beyond that.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
'I'll have what she's having',"It is a great love story and a great comedy, and the segments with old couples telling the story of how they met (based on the real life stories of the crew's families) are brilliant, and will have you look back on when you met your significant other. The movie world owes Rob Reiner a favour for the fact that his fine film is truly timeless. Part of this is due to the fact that it is set over a fifteen year period. Part of it is due to the fine easy listening score. Most of it is due to a very refined director extracting two brilliant performances from a flawless script and a perfectly cast couple of actors.Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the titular two, and neither have ever been better. The observation of their relationship is utterly convincing and completely engrossing. Beyond this, there are subtleties that neither actor has ever shown before or since. There are moments early in the film where we can see Sally is falling for Harry (for example, her response to Harrty telling her he is pleased she is going on a date with another man) but these moments are never overplayed. The credit for this is due as much to Reiner as it is to Ryan, as it is his pacing of the film that really allows the actors to embrace their characters.The film is a perfect balance. Its story-line unfolds like real life without seeming thin or dissatisfying, and the viewer never loses interest. Both Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally are perfect; in 1989, the former was still funny, the latter was still charming, and both of them were still young. The chemistry between them is flawless. But this would be nothing without the dialogue. The film's razor-sharp, conversational dialogue is the true selling point. Witty, realistic and above all hilarious, it's what makes the film the classic it is. Making legitimate observations about relationships, combined with some laugh-out-loud moments (the white- man overbite, for example), the film draws you in, makes you laugh and then, at the risk of sounding clichéd, makes you think.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun, But Too Much Like a Romantic Comedy","Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) have known each other for years, and are very good friends, but they fear sex would ruin the friendship.This film has become iconic, in part for the scene of Sally ""faking it"", and for its bigger question: can a man and a woman be strictly friends? The answer is one that is open to debate, but no movie is better known for tackling the subject than this one is.And does it answer the question? Well, you have to watch the movie. We cannot give that away. But, unfortunately, despite being a Rob Reiner comedy, it tends to get a bit too close to the ""romantic comedy"" (no doubt because of Nora Ephron's script).

Genuine and Fun,"I very much enjoyed this romantic comedy. It's amazing how you meet people in life that become a big influence. I notice how a lot of the romantic comedies of today have been influenced by this movie. The brief true couples part reminded me of the ending of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", as well as the brief twin interviews in ""Jack and Jill"". I love that; it makes the movie all the more interesting and funny, but mainly entertaining. This is another one of those movies I'm ashamed of not seeing earlier in my life; I just can't believe I put such a wonderful movie off for this long. Harry reminded me a little of myself when he explained his logical observations. It's hilarious because he comes across as obnoxious to people on the receiving end. Sally is genuinely high maintenance when it comes to ordering food (also like myself). But the chemistry the two have is perfect. You can tell they're meant for each other; especially when they hate each other. Most 21st century romantic comedies lack meaning (besides sex) and originality. They're out of ideas after all this time I guess. This is a truly brilliant film fun to watch again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Passing Fancy,"I dunno, just kind of bounced off of me. There were some parts I thought were funny but they had more to do with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby than Crystal and Ryan. I didn't really find there to be much chemistry between the leads to be honest, I get what they were going for with the whole opposites attract thing but Crystal was kind of just a jerk until he suddenly wasn't. And man this film is so obsessed with sex, I got really tired of hearing the third long winded monologue about sex written in this weird cocky attitude. It's like, instead of making Crystal feel natural it felt like everything he said was supposed to be some witty or funny observation and it was just really tiring. There's a way to write comical dialogue in this vein but the film is not self aware enough. I don't think it's the actors fault I think it suffers from redundant writing.

Iconic romance,"Often recommended as one of the best romances ever, ""When Harry Met Sally..."" is a completely recommended pick, very funny and having one of the most memorable couples in movie history.Both Harry and Sally are initially shown as incompatible, almoust oposites, but as the movie goes, we, the audience, realize that their personalities are actually complementary. Their conversations become more emotive and intimate with time, both changing to become better and the good cinematography emphatizes that; specially with details as the multiple split camera scenes (which seemed to be the hardest to film).Talking about the singular elements, the script is amazing, one of the best in the genre, the movie has a lot of quotable lines itself, but that doesn't define a good script, but rather the smoothness in their conversations and -a very important thing- self-refering quotes that -like a postmodern book- criticize constructively the stereotypes in both the fictional and real romance (with data as the ""fake ; rate or the male/female frienships). This kind of elements give an intelligent aspect to an already enjoyable tape, but of course, it all reduces to that question: is it worth your time? To which I assure you it is.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Good writing, so-so delivery","I think it's was good, the dialogue was nice - maybe a bit outdated but also refreshing at times.

He shows NO expressions throughout the WHOLE movie, he's ALWAYS stone faced? I haven't seen a lot of movies with him so he might always look like that but I must say what a terrible choice for a movie like this. I don't think I've ever seen such a dull character in any movie, I thought it was laughable.So yeah that was a failure for me making the whole movie's vibe feel bad at times.

When Clemenza met Princess Leia,"Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher play the obligatory wisecracking, slightly less attractive best friends of the title characters, who make a thoroughly predictable journey from sniping to smooching in this formulaic romantic comedy. It's not without charm, of course -- writer Nora Ephron has a good ear for a one-liner and director Rob Reiner is a good, economical storyteller. But it's still just a cute date movie, since Epron's wit is more glib than deep (real people don't debate the meaning of ""Auld Lang Syne"") and Reiner is not above resorting to cliché (every plot point is punctuated by some Golden Oldie like ""It Had To Be You,"" just in case you're missing the point of the scene). There's also the title characters, two neurotic yuppies in New York. Harry is a whiny, self-absorbed, self-pitying schnook, but since he's played by Billy Crystal, he gets all the best lines. Sally is brittle and high-maintenance, but since she's played by Meg Ryan, she's also utterly adorable. There's too much sentiment, and at some point you're going to want to clobber Crystal with an aluminum baseball bat, but there are plenty of fun set pieces (the legendary restaurant scene, the interviews with happy old couples that have nothing to do with the rest of the movie) and really, in 2010 it's refreshing to watch a middlebrow romantic comedy since they don't seem to exist anymore. (Quick note to Rob Reiner: if you are driving from the Hyde Park to New York, you will not pass downtown Chicago unless your are going via Canada. Which would take a lot longer.)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A little dated...?,"When I saw this film, my instant thought was 'oh my god, this is so overrated'. But, when thinking about it more, I think that it's just not aged particularly well and maybe I'd have appreciated it more if I'd the age I am now in 1989.Despite this, I thought the script still sparkled - there are some genuinely funny (and strikingly truthful) lines sprinkled about. I was surprised that the fake orgasm scene, even though it has been played SO often, remained laugh-out-loud funny. Thought Billy Crystal was great but I wasn't all that taken with Meg Ryan - possibly because all that wide-eyed innocence doesn't wash with me having seen her surly and quite frankly, rude appearance on Parkinson. And I wasn't all too sure about the 'real-life couples' bits.However, come the end, I was crying - it was genuinely touching, after all, and as a romantic comedy, is a lot funnier, smarter and more salient than many of its modern-day counterparts.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

tears of a clown,"this film choked me like the Suffolk strangler. it is a story of great and unexpected love, and it reminded me of my one true love which i find hard to talk about, especially to an audience of millions that this website provides. all i can say is the experience left me broken, bitter and club footed. as a result, i have a hard heart, and i watched this for most of its running time with stony eyes and a blank, impassive face. by the end i tried to explore my emotions by staring intensely at my own face in the bathroom mirror. five hours later a tear appeared. something in it had moved me. very few films do that. thank you Harry. thank you Sally.",,Anonymous,Romance

"The chemistry is perfect not just because of the actors, but also the script.","Gotta praise this one for getting everything down perfectly. The story was neat, and the chemistry was out of this world. The dialogue for Harry was absolutely fantastic! His character's personality was so well defined in everything he said and did. Billy Crystal played the part the best he could and to be honest, he really just did it flawlessly. He Is Harry.I've gotta praise Meg Ryan on this too. Seemingly one of the earlier movies in her career, but still she carried her character in a way no one can really recreate. Just like Harry, she was written wonderfully with her own unique personality and mannerisms.The story was neat! The opening scene had a very weird feel to it thanks to Harry's blunt remarks and cynical dialogue. It was funny in so many ways. The movie had tons of funny moments usually instigated by Harry. It was one of the few romcoms to get me to laugh and not just chuckle and exhale through the nose.The side characters had their own unique personalities, which isn't something you see in romcoms too often. They weren't just there for the protagonists to lean on, they actually had their own stuff going on, and their own iconic moments.Another thing that was oddly nice was the length of the movie. It didn't feel a minute too long, or a minute too short. Though, that bit right before the credits felt a bit off, but I won't let that ruin the movie.10/10. Nostalgic, cute, and funny. A well-written and well-crafted masterpiece that will hopefully never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's Billy Crystal, so watch it!!","I love that Billy Crystal is in this movie, he can bring comic genius to any role, he could make Romeo and Juliet's death funny if he was in a remake. My favorite scene is at the end where Billy's character is telling Meg Ryan's character how much he loves her and why he came to her at someone else's New Year's party. It really is one of those things that you just can't stay mad at, but I really didn't like the diner scene where Med Ryan is faking an orgasm to prove a point to Crystal, it wasn't needed, and I fast forward threw it every time I watch ""When Harry Met Sally.""

Brilliant. Watch repeatedly. Lots of laughs.,"A brilliant film that keeps the viewer enthralled throughout. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are perfectly cast and make you really care about them.

Loved the Christmas,"Just think of all the conventions it gets in, and skewers: the one-track mind male (Harry); the ""sensitive"" and practical female, repulsed yet intrigued by said male (Sally); the emotionally unsettled mistress playing the field (Carrie Fisher, who keeps an index card file of ""available"" men); the live-ins who can't ""commit"" (Sally and her ex-boyfriend); women's concern with middle age and their biological clock (""I'm gonna be 40,"" weeps Sally. ""When?"" asks Harry. ""Someday.""); the male's tendency to skip out after making love; the horror and unpredictability of blind dates; and, in a scene which is almost passe to mention anymore, women's ability to fake orgasm. The way this film jumps from one familiar convention to another would be embarrassing if it weren't for the fact that each one is handled with such economy, humor and grace.Billy Crystal acquits himself well as Harry - predictably, perhaps, as it's a part tailor made for a standup comedian. Still, seeing him in this after years of half-baked movies and fawning Oscar presentations, it's a revelation how glib and unlikable he can allow himself to be . . . and *still* be likable. Yo, Billy, if you're listening out there: try incorporating some of Harry's darker shadings and more egocentric traits into your future roles; it gives you a more complete palette to work from and keeps you from being too generic and schticky. And your charm and humor will always shine through anyway.If Billy needs to edge a little bit closer back to Harry, though, Meg Ryan needs to get Sally completely out of her system. This role, deservedly, made her a star - but she has tried to go back to this particular well once too many times, and it's become way too familiar: you know, the adorable, bright-eyed bit - mentally disheveled, prissy around the edges with just a wisp of klutziness, all topped by that cute, mega-watt smile. It has become now the ""Meg Ryan"" character, but back when Sally came along it was still fresh, and it was tied to a particular personality. Ryan gives Sally a shy-cum-toughness as well as a moody, slightly cynical and self-deprecating wit that is just totally right. She and Crystal play off each other like two old pros, and they weave in and out of some charming and hilarious verbal music.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Review,"This movie describes the relationship of a man and woman named Harry and Sally. When first they meet at their university, they had bad impressions each other, but the more they meet and talk, they come to be friends. Since then, they go round for many years just as friends, however, one day at a new year's dance, their relation starts to changeThe main theme of this movie, ""Can a man and woman become real friends?"" is a really difficult problem. At the beginning of story, Harry and Sally both have another lover. At first Harry and Sally see each other as her friend's lover and not as object of feeling of love. And I was fussed but enjoyed the way of their feelings change but can't take a step because of their high pride while and after I watch this story. Not only the two, their friends, Jess and Marie is also charming. They hold each other dear and also are concerned about Harry and Sally.

One Of The Greatest Romantic Comedies Ever,"Dearly departed screenwriter Nora Ephron's best - and that's saying a lot, because she was one of the best of her generation. BRILLIANT screenplay. So much wit to the dialog. So many pithy scenes. Billy Crystal's very best movie and Meg Ryan's too (although does she over-act on occasion, try too hard to be cute?; I forgive her - she's otherwise brilliant). The dialog and story are genius and, ultimately, very moving. The story is hugely relevant, too - the search for love in today's fractionalized society (especially in New York City). There are so many memorable scenes and lines in this movie, too - the sign of greatness - not to mention one of the funniest scenes in any movie ever (I won't tell you what it is but it's in a diner; after you've seen it for the first time, you'll be repeating the punch line for the rest of your life). This is also one of those movies you'll want to see over and over again - another sign of greatness. The late lamented Bruno Kirby also puts in a fabulous performance as Crystal's best friend. And while I'm not a huge Carrie Fisher fan, she puts in a commendable performance too, as Ryan's best friend and Kirby's wife. And if a lump doesn't come to your throat, or a tear to your eye, at the end, you're not a romantic. Any sentimental romantic will absolutely love this film - forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my favorite movies of all time,"I don't know where to start.  I loved this film so much when I saw it in theatres back when I was in high school.  I saw it several times on video and just loved the ending.  I couldn't get over it and watched it over and over.  Billy Crystal is fantastic as Harry Burns.  Reiner did an amazing job of telling it like it is (at least in my opinion) and discussing how men and women can NOT be friends.  The movie mentions many things that we know to be true but either never realize or never discuss.  This was the first movie I ever bought on DVD and I still watch it to this day.  Mind you, I am a 30-year-old man and the ending still brings me to tears -- ""I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out, I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich, I love that you get this little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts, I love that after I spend the day with you I can still smell your perfume on my clothes and I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night... and it's NOT because I'm lonely and it's NOT because it's New Year's Eve.  I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.""I still think that's one of the best monologues ever.

Near perfect romantic comedy,"Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be ""just friends"". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question ""Can men and women be friends?"" is around.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lighthearted story about the build up of love between two old acquaintances,"I watched the film because someone suggested me that film as a primary example for a lighthearted love film. In that respect it worked quite well for me. It had plenty of light but sincere dialogs that people discredit way to often. The acting is pretty calm and emotions are shown in a controllable manner. But that is pretty much the bottom line of the movie. The film completely rejects the difficult aspects of love since none of the two is ever really isolated, lonely or desperate. They have either each other or friends who cheer them up with smooth remarks. My guess is that this film appears better to people who shy away from spending to much time alone. As for me it did not really work as I prefer a satirical or poetical treatment of the misery of love to not really mentioning it at all. Of course I also saw the scene when Harry meets his ex-wife or when Sally learned about Joe's marriage. But those moments were lived though in company and Sally's was answered with sex. In a way it paved the way for the happy end. Of course the film is a piece of fiction but to me that is too simple to offer any reason for joy in the end. The love they have in the end is as light as the whole film. As a result it seems to be something that feels nice but dispensable. I thought it was an OK ending since it left out too many fancy objects and focused on the lovers. I prefer more complex movies but acknowledge that movies like this are important to make people feel good once in a while.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why Can't We Be Friends,"I always rate this film higher than I think others would rate it. It is by no means the pinnacle of art, but I find few films that say as much about love as this one does. It's fitting that it took a woman to write perhaps the best love film in a decade, because where other films fall flat by the very end this films crescendos and fully captures its meaning and thesis in a powerful way.It is never pretentious and overbearing, and it unveils its heart just enough to make you want to be in love all over again. Because what the film is about, a man and a woman, who believe they can't be friends because they'd fall in love (or have sex). They end up becoming friends anyway (and have sex), and what they learn is that to be good friends IS being in love. Because when you are good friends with those you love, you realize that the joy of relationships and the excitement of life does not come from fresh romances or sexual escapades, it's comes when all of you is bore before before someone else. They don't fall in love because they weren't friends, they fall in love precisely because they were.It is the foundation of all lasting marriages, and even though it's always a gamble, it is always worth it to love and lose, then never having lost anything at all.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Can Men & Women Be Friends Or Does Sex Always Get In The Way?,"From the director of Stand by Me, The Princess Bride & A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally is an elegantly crafted, cleverly composed & wonderfully narrated romance comedy that raises a pretty interesting question of if a man & a woman can just remain friends without sex coming in their way and also covers many other fascinating ideas about relationships with a zestful spirit & endless charm.The story of When Harry Met Sally follows its titular characters from the time they finish school & share a cross-country drive to New York City to the next 12 years or so when they keep bumping into each other on chance encounters, eventually become friends & try to help each other through the various hardships of their respective lives while unaware of the mutual feelings they have for each other.Amazingly well-directed by Rob Reiner, the film exhibits an immense charm from start to finish and also includes many brief segments of old couples telling us how they met each other which leaves a flavour of its own plus acts as a filler in between the various time leaps its story takes. Written by Nora Ephron, the various concepts of relationships are nicely presented with enough wit to keep it fresh in the viewers' conscious without halting its entertainment.Cinematography covers many beautiful locations in Manhattan which contrasts with the colourless lives its characters have been living, editing keeps the narrative smoothly flowing & the music department makes excellent choices in the selection of songs. Coming to the performances, both Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan are very impressive in their given roles and their on-screen chemistry feels incredibly natural & is sizzling with passion at the same time.On an overall scale, it's been 25 years since When Harry Met Sally was released on the big screen and yet, its magic hasn't diminished by one bit plus it continues to age like wine. Featuring one of cinema's most notable sequences followed by an even more memorable punchline, When Harry Met Sally is a film for the ages that will remain relevant no matter how many generations pass by it. Delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"When Harry Met Sally... a bunch of stuff happened. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting, mainly Billy Crystal's (it's fun seeing him as a hunky ladies' man). From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is not a great movie, but the cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship depicted between Harry and Sally.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I just made that phrase and to some it might make as much sense as the lyrics to the song ""Auld Lang Syne"". My take away from this movie is that relationships are complicated.

Gratifying movie.,"I usually watch movies if I like the actor.I didn't like Billy Crystal's appearance,I know this is very superficial.I think it's his hairstyle.Although he did look good in the first few scenes.Meg Ryan is so adorable and she looked much better in the first few scenes.I decided to watch this movie after I saw Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's 'The Challenge' where she says that this film is one of her favorite romantic comedies and comes in her top five favorites and also I saw 'Hollywood's ten best' on Zee studio and I think this movie was the number one comedy.As far as I observed,two Bollywood movies have been inspired by this movie-'Dil To Pagal Hai'(the scenes where they show the old couple's in the title song)and 'Hum Tum'(in Hindi movies usually they make it the opposite for the boy and girl-as opposed to Billy Crystal getting married,in 'Hum Tum' Rani Mukherji gets married.)

The romantic comedy that helped set the standard for romantic comedies.,"I'm not a connoisseur of romantic comedies, and I wasn't surprised to feel like the film didn't do much for me, nor did it really interest me. It is, however, a curious and pleasant story to watch, which will not mark anyone's life, but which is suitable for couples and Valentine's Day tributes. I don't think it is, as I read, the best romantic comedy of all time, but I admit that it is, at least, among the most popular and pivotal for the evolution of the genre.The film's strongest point is the intelligent plot written by Nora Ephron, which begins with Harry and Sally's car trip to New York. They are very different, and they keep talking along the way, and wonder if a man and a woman could nurture a friendship without any hidden sexual or romantic interest. A decade later, they decide to get closer and try to establish a friendship. Indeed, it tells the tale of a love simmering gently, a contrast to the fervent plots of many other films. Furthermore, the script creates good light comedy situations with a good dose of clichés and banalities, and a slight inspiration from Woody Allen's cinematographic work, in terms of dry humor and visuals.Rob Reiner, the director, did a very elegant job in the way he guided everyone, bringing out the best in each of them. Elegant, but not flawless: for example, I can't understand how he didn't figure out that the plot, as it stands, wouldn't sustain a feature film. The film drags on painfully, like an elderly man on a walker on his way to the bank to deposit his last paycheck, and is saved at the expense of comical scenes designed to take up time and distract the audience. I'm also sad that it responds negatively to whether a man and a woman can just be friends (that's the generic verdict I draw): I myself had, and still have, numerous female friends and had no desire to jump into their beds. I'm not a pervert, I have more things to think about, and I don't feel terrible about sleeping alone while having fifty girl friends in my phone book.The film greatly boosted the careers of Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, two actors currently absent from the spotlight and who can sometimes appear dated. Ryan, currently more focused on directing and enjoying the laurels of past glories, appears at the height of her vitality and beauty, and gives us a sensitive character, with sharp intelligence and solid opinions. Crystal moved to the small screen a few years ago, but this film still shows us the actor's talent and presence in the golden phase of his career. Both act very well, establish good chemistry, make the most of the situations and support the film without any problems. The famous fake orgasm scene remained in everyone's memory, and I understand why: at that time, even the mention of such a thing was a taboo. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby provide some welcome support for pretending that the film actually has more characters with deeper meaning.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Sad Statement on Relationship,"I thought this movie was terrible. I watched it once, many years ago, on cable, but this time, I only lasted up until the scene where they were walking in the park and she evidently was allowing him to become a part of her life. There was no character development in the movie. Who are these two people? What are their dreams, their history? Why are they together? It seems that neither of them have any solid identity. Maybe that is their greatest commonality.I did get the impression that Sally was somewhat enthusiastic about life. What, in the world, did she see in him? I was trying to look at Harry psychologically, but could not come up with any specific pathology, but some warped blend of anhedonia and delusions of grandeur. Crystal sounding like he is reading all his lines does not help things, and this gives the movie a droning tempo. The fact that his character expects his assuming, pompous and otherwise rude nature to earn him friends and lovers is bad enough: When relatively-normal but easily-influenced Sally started actually accepting Harry's depressive confrontationalism, I could see where the movie was heading. I loved Billy Crystal in City Slickers and Meg Ryan was great in Addicted To Love, but When Harry Met Sally reminded me of The Mirror Has Two Faces, in that it inadvertently explores the issue of women ""settling for less"" in a relationship and allowing themselves to be there-by abused. I am frankly offended by When Harry Met Sally, and can only imagine how the movie would have run if Meg Ryan's character had stood her ground and demanded more: More than Harry, as well as the putz she was with at the airport.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's about living on the outskirts of love and fearing the commute.,"What makes this movie click is  the fine comedic actress Meg Ryan whose every facial posture perfectly punctuates her lines. How any man can walk away from her, as Billy Crystal does in the opening scene, is difficult to fathom. I'm laughing out loud many times, an oddity for me. Such perfect retorts, such flashing wit...and Crystal's and Ryan's genuine intelligence made the lines live. I've read a critique saying that no woman would DO what ryan does in the famous restaurant-orgasm scene. Not true. I dated a woman who would. She got away. Life does not duplicate art. If you haven't seen it, you've missed one of the best romantic comedies of all time.",,Anonymous,Romance

I LOOOOOOVE this movie. I love the friends to lovers trope. I'm obsessed with the characters. Harry and Sally are the definition of opposites attract yet somehow they are good with and for each other. They see each other for who they are and they neither have to dim their light or alter their personalities to appeal to the other. Maybe it's cos they're friends first then lovers after. They're also a testimony for the concept for detachment. ""What's yours will always find you."" They've crossed paths many times through out the years yet only when it's their time that they've fallen in love with each others. It makes you wonder if you've ever crossed paths with the one and you don't even realise it cos it's not your time yet to come together.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film,"Good film. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on ""Soap"".

Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in ""Sleepless In Seattle"". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely.

Among the Elect Posse of Exceptionally Valid Romantic Comedies,"When Harry Met Sally... is among the elect posse of exceptionally valid romantic comedies, because each scene ends, in whatever way, significantly different from our expectations. Many girls, and guys, like my dad, which is strange, are drawn im perpetuum to films that have been made since that ride roughshod over nuance in favor of embellishing every emotional cue to the degree that we won't be surprised if leafhoppers just began feeding off of them. But only seldom has a modern romantic comedy with all the button-down ingredients---Manhattan yuppie life, New Years' Eve drama, man-to-man hoo-ha in the batting cage, humor drawn from a woman's uptightness---really worked on a sincere and disciplined level like this film, which even has the shrewdness to make a Harry Connick, Jr. soundtrack appealing.Minus the machismo complex, a chick flick is slang for a film designed to appeal to a female target audience. Including the macho dismissal would mean reference to films that are heavy with emotion or contain relationship-centered themes. Including the macho dismissal, this movie is not a chick flick. As for minus: If it's good, it doesn't matter. With a combination of imagination and realism, Nora Ephron's big breakthrough script raises the question ""Can men and women ever just be friends?"" and advances many notions about love that have become household concepts now, like the ""high-maintenance"" girlfriend and the ""transitional person.""Ephron never seems to have a problem with crafting very tight-knit self-contained plays from scene to scene, aligning broad comedy and seasoned pondering so that they spring from the same catalysts. Rob Reiner keenly gift-wraps it for us, with the thematic progress and humor reassured, but it is never disingenuous. Yes, that's Meg Ryan. Yes, that's Billy Crystal. But they come off just as real as Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher effortlessly do. The beats and timing, even when exaggerated, are unflappably natural. Caryn James said it was like the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an awkward familiarity. In spite of my normal defensiveness of this film, not to mention any and every Woody Allen one, I think I can live with that assessment on the grounds it is succinct and indeed comparable.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"In one word, the story was rubbish.  Acting was OK.","After having received very positive comments from a friend I had tried for years to find a copy of a film, but in vain. Now that the film was at last shown on TV, I set out to watch the film with great expectations.The beginning of the film was very promising. The University of Chicago was familiar, as I had visited the place even myself, but after that there was only one scene which made me burst into laughter, i.e., the scene where Sally had an orgasm in a restaurant and another customer wanted to have the same (dish) as her.Sally was pretty to watch. Acting was fine, but the story was so American. In one word, the film was rubbish.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The thinking man's romcom, despite the bait and switch tactic","When Harry Met Sally is a very good film, a standout among romcoms. It's got two witty and engaged performances from Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and great dialogue. It also reflects real life back on us throughout. At some point Nora Ephron pulls a very clever, very effective bait and switch, by disrupting romcom formulas and stereotypes. That's when Billy Crystal's character goes from being the typical distant male, horny but detached, to being a grief-stricken, sad and jolted husband. He can't understand or accept why his wife left, and he's a bundle of nerves and raw feelings. As he and Meg Ryan work through their characters' similar experiences, over years, love gradually builds and the romcom formula gets restored just in time for love to triumph !",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very relatable,"I personally am not a huge fan of Romantic comedy's and I absolutely cannot stand Billy Crystal as an actor or as a comedian. But for some reason I just can't find it in myself to hate When Harry Met Sally.I only recently decided to give the movie a chance after having it recommended to me for years by friends and by every girlfriend I have ever had. I was honestly expecting this movie to be just another romantic comedy with an all too neat and happy ending. This is one of those rare instances where I'm actually glad I misjudged a movie because it led to me enjoying this movie more due to it's surprisingly clever written dialogue and relatable characters. I went into this movie expecting an unfunny romantic comedy about two people who hate each other but end up falling in love. Instead I found myself laughing and relating to the main characters in a unique way that actually made me want to see these two people end up together.This is easily Billy Crystal's best performance in his entire career and I say that as someone who hates Billy Crystal. Meg Ryan also gives a superb performance in this movie. The two work well together with Crystal's character being the more sarcastic and skeptical of the two. This works well with Meg Ryan's character who is much more upbeat and optimistic bringing some much needed balance to their characters ever evolving relationship.When Harry Met Sally is a film that was certainly ahead of it's time with it's cleverly written dialogue, relatable characters and sophisticated adult humour. I highly recommend giving this movie a chance if you have never seen it before you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hands down the greatest romantic comedy of all time,"Romantic comedies are perhaps the most formulaic movies around. Some are better than others (such as While You Were Sleeping and Sleepless in Seattle) and some are weaker (such as License to Wed and others), but they all follow a rather familiar plot. Boy meets girl and after a series of improbable and funny situations, they ultimately fall in love. So how does ""When Harry Met Sally"" feel so original and fresh every time I watch it despite following this same basic premise? Two major reasons stand out which make this film a one of a kind: Firstly, the screenplay is undoubtedly one of the five funniest I've ever seen. It's similar to Juno (which people were divided on; I personally loved it) in terms of it's wittiness and while most people don't talk quite like this, it is a joy to hear the actors perfectly pull it off. Secondly, the actors are perfect. This is essentially a four person movie, and it is perfectly cast; Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have the best chemistry that I've ever seen on screen and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher have some of the funniest lines as the best friends of Harry and Sally (""you made a woman meow?!) Each scene is a little gem, from Harry and Sally's first conversation about sex on their way to New York to their chance encounter in an airport to Sally's famous fake orgasm in a restaurant. The movie is also peppered with hilarious tidbits from random couples about how they met and fell in love (""At that moment I knew. I knew the way you know about a good melon."") I am not the kind of guy who hates all romantic comedies, branding them as chick flicks which bore me to tears. In general, they are not my favorite genre, but if done correctly, I enjoy them. ""When Harry Met Sally"" sets the bar for romantic comedies. It is sensational from start to finish and after over a dozen viewings of it, I love it more than ever. ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a perfect movie. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic film that helped move along Seinfeld & every other romantic comedy after it.,"What is most excellent about this movie are the actors......they were perfect for their roles and the writing is superb. What is sad is todays 20-somethings actually think the romantic comedies being made today are good and the irony that follows is you have to be ""in the time"" to really appreciate a movie.....HOWEVER, that notwithstanding if you have a brain in your skull and the ability to ""see"" humor then this movie is definitely for you. This is probably the best first date movie on the planet. It's not too ""schmoopie"" and doesn't have an ounce of intrigue....just straight forward angst and the ability to just make you feel all warm and fuzzy all over....Even if you're just a single, angry guy with nothing to do in the middle of the night this movie will give you hope. (hmm, I wonder how I know that). Anyhow, this movie will last forever....Sleepless In Seattle & You've Got Mail are by the same writer (nora ephron) and W.H.M.S. is the best of them easily.....Although if Sleepless was before WHMS I might say it the other way around....Although sleepless has the death plot in it so as a true romantic comedy it's not and WHMS is. Did all that make sense? I've probably had too much Frogs Leap. Happy film watching out there earthlings! By the way, MEN! As a second date where you cook her dinner at your place....rent out this movie and you'll be suckin' face by 10o'clock.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You realize of course that we could never be friends,"This is one of those Rom com movies that surprise you in a sense that the plot is unique. Harry's and Sally's relationship actually shows a not rushed and similar to real life story of enemies to friends to lovers.Good parts: Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal have great chemistry and deliver very beautiful and not overdone chemistry on screen, I loved that up until the end you don't know where the movie is going to take you. The story often has these setbacks in their relationship and it is fun to watch, jokes from both of them actually work and I have giggled or laughed almost every time. Movie is visually dynamic and shows us New York in Autumn, winter, spring and summer which perfectly immerses you in the atmoshpere.Bad parts: I understand that those interview intermissions are real life stories of marriage, but they don't really amount to anything since the movie is more about the question of man-woman friendship rather than marriage. So it doesn't resonate with the plot too much. Doesn't add too much value.Overall a very solid 8/10. Not giving it a 9 since it didn't blow me away, but it is perfect evening watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
When he had sex and she had sex,"When Harry Met Sally is a romance film about some people who were acquainted and meet each others throughout their lives in New York to make a new relationship. These characters fit very well together in this story and the actors work very well off one another the supporting actors in the film are also well in keeping the story going the entire 95 minute runtime. Which I believe is a perfect runtime of the story it did not need to be any long then it was as it only needed that time to reach the end.
I was fairly entertained throughout the entire film it was fun to watch the characters bounce off of one another to make a heart warming story for two people who didn't really know how to love. This film, directed Rob Reiner and written by Nora Ephron in 1989, worked really well as a fun relationship story but I thought it was alright overall. It is a good movie and put together very well but it is just not my cup of tea. The dialogue was fairly good, I however felt that the movie could have been sweeter and more heart warming if it didn't revolve around sex. There is not a conversation in this movie that doesn't talk about sex and I felt that the character's were kinda gross at the end as they threw themselves at everyone who walked by. Other than there being a large concentration of that topic the dialogue felt very real and natural.
This was my first time watching this film and it was not what I expected it and I thought it was a little refreshing to the other love stories I have seen, that all seem to have a Romeo and Juliet template. This was just two average joe people who who had similar problems, that they couldn't accept their pasts. It was fun to watch them work it out in their different ways, but both ways went back to having sex with random people again. It is fine to have in a movie but the movie was surrounding the sex life of the characters and the ""science about sex, for men and women"".
One of my favorite parts of this film that i thought was done very sweet and cute, was the phone calls between Billy and Meg. At this point in the film the characters have been very good friends and talked to each other about everything in their lives. You could tell that they both wanted a little it more from their relationship but neither one wanted to ruin it and admit that a Women and a Guy couldn't be friends. So they liked to call and talk with one another, to vent about their days and they did this while watching Casablanca on TV. I loved this scene so much because of how it was edited, making it seem as though the characters were sitting next to each watching the film together even though they were both alone at home in bed. Looking at them from behind, it looked like they were on a couch together. It was done very well.
One last thing that I noticed in the movie that is probably very common in movies from this time, but the background in this movie was very strange. The direction for the characters in the background was look busy, or at least that is what it looked like it was to me, they just stood there some times and looked confused or they were whispering as though they didn't want to talk over the main characters covently.
This movie was put together, acted, directed, shot and written fairly well but I just didn't get connected to the characters. I can see how this movie could be someone's favorite romance and be rated so well as sex sells but it was a little too much for me. So on a scale of one to 10 I'd give this a 6.5 out of 10. It was done technically well but I just didn't connect.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A groundbreaking rom com,"In the 80s, the rom com was becoming quite stale. While there certainly was some good films from this period, the decades preceding and succeeding it were definitely more well known for their Rom Coms. When Harry Met sally spearheads this renewal and transformation by breathing fresh life into the genre by recalling the humour of the great 70s Woody Allen rom coms, at the same time thoughtfully exploring the age old question of whether men and women can ever just be friends. The screenplay of the film deserves much credit for its success. When Harry Met Sally feels like a Woody Allen film toned down slightly, in that its humour is less outrageous, its characters less extreme in their peculiarities. But it remains funny and at the same time thoughtful- the dialogue sparkles with intelligence and wit, but is never overly intellectual. These people say things which are incisive yet relatable, not abstruse or forced. They are also very very funny- Sally's Fake Orgasm at the restaurant should crack any human being up.But the film remains notable in its exploration of its themes. The films central question is: can a man and a woman ever remain just friends? I find this to be an intriguing question explored deftly, though never decisively answered in the film. I find the films nebulous answer to be pitch perfect because in real life the answer is also fuzzy. Harry and Sally grow closer together because of increased intimacy with each other. For a long time they do remain just very good friends, but eventually, they sleep with each other. So is it romantic tension masquerading as a growing friendship, suddenly released through their having sex? Or are they really just friends and the sex is merely a superficial and meaningless mistake which discredits the depth of their friendship? Harry and Sally do get married in the end, but are they friends then lovers, or have they been lovers all along? The film leaves these questions open to us, and it remains non committal in offering an answer through its clever screenplay. For instance, Harry and Sally try to set each other up on dates with their friends, but their friends fall in love instead. So is the film hinting that Harry is destined to be with Sally? Or merely affirming that the line between friends and lovers are fuzzy as high levels of intimacy are a common characteristic of both(romance and friendships).But perhaps the film is remembered more for its endearing characters than for its philosophical themes. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal share electric chemistry on this film, chemistry which I have not seen on screen for a long time. They are both assertive and strong willed, and their interactions sizzle with penetrating wit and incredible humour. Their fine acting skills really sell the conundrum further: they speak and comfort each other like how friends would, but there there always seems to be a palpable tension between them. My only objections of the film are personal- the film veers off into tangents in some scenes, like Harry's outburst when the 4 friends were at Jess' place. I felt it seemed slightly odd and clunking handled,These little hiccups aside, When Harry met Sally is an unqualified triumph. It breaks genre conventions by offering both devastating humour and exploring its clever theme. This allows the film to distinguish it from the countless other rom coms made- it really is exceptional both in its humour and in its cleverness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Try more than the soup,"A long time ago, in what feels like another galaxy of the late '80s, a movie emerged that everyone talked about. However, as an early teen, it seemed out of reach due to its ""content."" I first watched the film during my freshman year of college. I recall the witty dialogue and, of course, the famous ""Soup Scene."" Beyond that, I didn't take much away from it. Over the years, it has become a part of the lexicon of movies and culture, popping up on various channels across the entertainment spectrum.Recently, when contemplating classic movies to revisit, I decided to sit down and watch ""When Harry Met Sally"" for the first time in decades. It felt like revisiting an old friend-the fashion, music, and the different approach to life of that bygone era before the internet, all captured in a New York skyline I'll never see again.In this forgotten time, Billy Crystal plays Harry, introduced as Meg Ryan's (Sally) ride from Chicago to New York. Thus begins the ""relationship"" and the great debate of whether men and women can truly be friends without sex getting in the way. The interplay and banter lead to them parting ways, with five years passing before a brief interlude reconnects them on a plane flight across the country. Once again, the conversation and debate rekindle, setting the stage for another five-year gap where the story truly unfolds.This time, when they reconnect, Harry is recently divorced, and Sally is coming off a breakup. They decide to test the theory and become friends. Rounded out by their supporting friends Bruno Kirby and the late Carrie Fisher, the whirlwind that follows is what places this movie on the great lists and explains why it has left its mark on thousands of films that followed.The beauty of the simple moments they share, conversations uncluttered by the world around them, and the effortless collision of our hero/heroine's journey are the factors that make this movie stand out on so many levels.

Ryan and Crystal make this film,"A smooth, funny, and endearing romantic comedy. If you like Billy Crystal's style in film then you'll like this.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
This is an interesting play on friendship and romance, and one that I agree with 100%.While the story is plagued by educated psycho babble, it will appeal to those who are classic ""YUPIs.""
For the children reading this: that's ""Young Urban Professional (and) Independent."" It also helps if you're white.Delightful story, but it's a bit too perfect and ""white"" for me. That's not racism (I'm white), it means that if you're
upper class, well-educated, progressive, and think psychotherapy actually works, then yes, that's ""white.""ACTING:
Ryan and Crystal are this movie. Obvious you say? Not quite; you see, there are oodles of other male-female
teams that could have been cast for this. My guess is they cast Crystal first since it's his humor that runs end to
end. While Ryan's role could have been played by others of that era, e.g. ???, her temperament was perfect:
playful, sharp, articulate, and cute.The supporting cast were believable and fun.ENTERTAINMENT:
As for romantic comedy it has moderate -> high entertainment value.TEMPO:
It gets a bit too involved with itself sometimes, but overall an excellent pace.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
It's NYC, but the sets were too perfect and they'd have to be rich to live as they were portrayed. Unrealistic.DIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: Reiner has directed some of the sweetest films: ""The Princess Bride"" (1987) and (this). His other more
dire work, e.g. ""Misery"" (1990) and ""A Few Good Men"" (1992) were good films, but they weren't in league with
the romantic work.Writers: Ephron's work is almost entirely not my cup of tea as they appear to be too much veneer and syrup.However, I could stomach that here only because of the acting, and the occasional reality that comes into play.Is it a good film? Yes, and funShould you watch this once? Yes, especially if you've been in love and / or married. You probably should be white though : )Rating: 8.2 (for its genre)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great romantic comedy...,"When Harry Met Sally... is one of the best rom-coms ever made. Nora Ephron wrote three scripts for Meg Ryan - When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. All three are romantic comedies. All of them are incurably romantic and reference B&W/old classics - Casablanca, An Affair to Remember and The Shop Around the Corner respectively. All three are very good, with When Harry leading the trio.Harry and Sally meet each other on a road trip from Chicago to New York where both are relocating. We see their initial two encounters turn to disaster but they eventually decide to become friends ten years after they first met. They also decide not to have sex so as not to destroy their friendship. Of course they are eventually going to develop feelings for each other and of course the hero always gets the girl in the end - no deviation from the standard script Hollywood has been rehashing for decades.What makes this particular re-working of a fairly standard plot is primarily the script. Very intelligent, with lots of wit and good dialogue. Then, there are classic scenes, the best of which is the ""I'll have what she's having..."" diner scene. The inter-cuts to actual old couples who've been together for decades discussing their relationship is brilliant.Romantic comedy is admittedly not a genre that pushes the boundaries of cinema. But, its very enjoyable and When Harry Met Sally is one of the enduring classics of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This was a great story about the friendship between a man and a woman,"I watched ""When Harry Met Sally..."" for the first time the other day and I thought it was a great romantic comedy and it was a great story about the friendship between a man and a woman. I just loved how they talked to each other on the phone and just held each other when one of them was sad. Both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were great in this movie. The scene in the deli was hilarious. I bet Harry (Crystal) was so embarrassed. But Sally (Ryan) just looked like she was enjoying herself! I was shocked that their friends (Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby) ended up getting married and Harry and Sally were just left alone. I loved how they stayed friends over the years and kept in touch. That doesn't happen very often with friends, especially if they're the opposite gender. I think they were made for each other. They were just so perfect and they made a cute couple. And I liked how the movie showed that when Harry and Sally finally did sleep with each other they realized that it was a mistake and it just drifted them apart. But I'm glad that Harry told Sally how much he loved her and what he loved about her. And they ended up getting married! That was so perfect.

Sex in the city,"Irritating, cynical, emotional Harry (played by Billy Crystal) and irritating, ditzy, repressed Sally (Meg Ryan) have a long term non-sexual relationship before finally living happily ever after. There might seem to be a lot to dislike about Rob Reiner's comedy before you start watching it, but a sparkling script by Nora Ephron ensures that in practice, you have to forgive it it's generic rom-com structure and give yourself up to the laughs. At the time when 'When Harry Met Sally' came out (and in fact, ever since), there was a lot of media comment about one of Harry's propositions, namely that men and women cannot enjoy platonic friendship. But the film doesn't answer its own question, and even where the movie is insightful, this insight seems very restricted to the peculiar world of New York's professional dating classes. Perhaps we should blame this film for 'Sex and the City'. But while it may not be deep, the simple fact is, it's funny, and almost impossible not to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Golden Standard of Romantic Comedy,"Now I'm not a fan of romantic comedies, at least not recent ones. Most movies already add in a love interest so the notion of making a small perfunctory part of a good movie the whole point of a single picture just seems trifling to me. It doesn't help that Hollywood no longer tries to make the genre appealing to all or even many; producers only make them desirable to middle-aged women and gullible tweens. Not knocking those demographics, its just not my thing. That being said, When Harry Met Sally (1989) is for all intents and purposes a romantic comedy yet it is a lot more than that.The story takes place within the space of twelve years. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet through a mutual friend. Sally agrees to take Harry with her to New York in her car and the two don't get along famously. Yes, there is banter, yes they eventually fall madly in love, yes every romantic comedy before and after When Harry Met Sally have followed the exact same pattern but here its different.The late, great Nora Ephron wisely took the romance as a starting point to truly delve into and study the notion of love. Harry and Sally's story is intertwined with interviews from elderly couples who briefly discuss how they first fell in love. Director Rob Reiner enhances the experience with poignant editing and a smart use of split screen for some humorous and enlightening set pieces along with some truly lovely views of New York City in all its glory.Twelve years is an awful long time to track two characters and its amazing to see how each time the story jumps to a certain time and place how they have changed yet remained the same. Harry starts out as a little self-absorbed yet always charming and funny in the only way Billy Crystal can be. Years later his character goes through a brutal divorce that humanizes Harry in both the eyes of the audience and Sally. Sally goes through a similar transition through the progression of time. She doesn't deal with her life altering breakup lying down even though her mannerisms betray her proactive attitude.Throughout the movie Harry and to a lesser extent Sally often explore the differences between men and women when it comes to sex and love. Again, this is a common theme in romantic comedies from Adam's Rib (1949) to The Ugly Truth (2009). Yet while reinforcing gender tropes in the collective minds of the audience, this writing trick serves a larger purpose in When Harry Met Sally. It fleshes out the characters we've grown to love. Take the famous scene at Katz Deli where Sally fakes an orgasm proving the point that men can't tell the difference. Funny? Yes. True? The jury's still out. Do we love her for it? Of course.My only real concern with When Harry Met Sally is this; they never seem to be working. Or talking about their work. Supporting characters Jess (Bruno Kirby) and Marie (Carrie Fisher) mention their work albeit casually. Harry and Sally on the other hand almost never do. In an interview with Rob Reiner, the director explained he didn't want to include their work life because A: its not the point of the movie; and B: no one likes to talk about their work outside of work. Fair enough to the first point but I find it hard to believe that no one in Rob Reiner's circle of friends talks about their work on a quasi-regular basis. I prefer explaining it away as a question of editing. Within a twelve year span, Harry and Sally talked about work, it just wasn't filmed.When Harry Met Sally is the golden standard for modern romantic comedy. A standard that many have attempted but few have achieved and fewer still have surpassed. It exhibits the talents of the brilliant Billy Crystal and the strikingly beautiful and exuberant Meg Ryan. It presents the work of director Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron at the top of their game and it showcases timeless love songs by virtuosos George Gershwin and Richard Rodgers. Truly, does anyone know anyone who doesn't enjoy it? If you do dump them from your life; they're too high-maintenance.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a Classic! One of the most romantic movies ever!  It is hard to express in words what the movie expressed so well! Rob Reiner is the best male director of  Chickie movies!,"From script to sound track this is a magnificent movie. It deals with: loss, male and female perspectives of: love, friendship, dating, being married, being married and then being single again, sex issues, anger, happiness, and jealousy.  The movie has great dialogue, a beautiful script,  the CD soundtracks do not get better than this with classic songs just to name a few: ""When and Where"", ""It Had to be You"", ""I Could Write a Book"", ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"".  The later recorded by Harry Connick Jr.  who is just outstanding!The acting is invisible, Billy Crystal does a great job and is very believable as Harry (City Slickers).  The guy who believes that men and women cannot be friends, and sometimes he is annoying but yet charming in his own way. Meg Ryan (You've Got Mail) is cute as the perfectionist Sally who has all her tapes alphabetized, can order food better anybody else, and admits to being too rigid and structured.  Marie, Sally's best friend (Carrie Fisher)  is always looking for a man for everybody including herself with her very own personal box of names and addresses; Bruno Kirby (City Slickers)  as Jess,  thinks that a woman who has a great personality cannot be pretty, is Harry's best friend. Between their conversations of Jesse and Harry there is a whole spectrum of the male perspective about feelings in relationships.Director Rob Reiner is the best!  (Mixed Nuts, The American President). I will see any movie that Reiner has anything to do with it and buy the video because there is always something to chew on after I have watched the movie once.The script is clever!  Nora Ephron (Mixed Nuts, Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail) just knows how to write a good script! She is brilliant!My favorite scenes: When Marie is trying her wedding dress on and Sally says: ""That is beautiful!""  I feel that she is reflects in her own situation. Those scenes with all  those old couples telling how they met and fell in love are precious scenes. Harry getting mad because he was singing in front of Ira!  The jealousy of Sally when Emily (Tracy Reiner)  comes into the picture, she is Aunt Emily the pie maker. I don't know how many people realize that Tracy is Rob Reiner's daughter. The ending is precious when Harry sees couples around while he window shops alone New Year's Eve, and starts running to tell Sally how he really feels! That is a tearing scene. This is one of my favorites. I highly recommend this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly boring,"Because of Covid-19 we're watching far more movies than normal, and by this stage we're exploring old classics. This movie is supposed to be classic, but boy were we disappointed. There's only one truly funny in the entire movie, the famous restaurant scene, and there are a couple of smiles, but overall it just isn't particularly funny.One could perhaps accept the movie as a romantic drama, rather than a romantic comedy, except that there's also not a lot happening from a dramatic point of view. We found ourselves looking at the clock several times, and at one point looking at each other as in, 'shall we stop or continue?' The characters are not particularly interesting, and the story itself is plain boring. Boy-meets-girl and in first instance dislike each other but draw closer over the years? Come on, that's old and by now boring.A movie with a story like that needs an exceptionally witty or insightful script and great acting. The acting wasn't bad, but perhaps because of the 70s and 80s hair and clothes and the other trappings of that time, it felt like an alien country. Was it really normal for women to obsess like that about getting married as if it's the only thing of importance in their lives? It's difficult to really identify with the characters and root for them.In the end our reaction was a shrug of the shoulder. The movie is not truly dreadful, but still felt like a waste of our time.

Sleepless in New York,"""When Harry Met Sally..."" is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. In fact, this year's ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"" is even a pun on it. At least the title, anyway.Many people will tell you the plot is weak, but the movie is good because of characters. Okay, well, I disagree. I think the plot, the characters and the script all work together to form an excellent romantic comedy. Whether it be the irony in the script, the characters' quirks or the smart, snappy, crisp dialogue thrown between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, ""When Harry Met Sally"" not only meets every expectation, but exceeds.The film opens up with Harry Burns (Crystal) and Sally Albright (Ryan) driving to New York. Sally is best friends with Harry's girlfriend, Amanda. As they drive along, Harry and Sally start getting into a heated debate over ""Casablanca."" This discussion ends in discussing something a bit more risque: If men and women can sleep together and still be friends in the morning. Harry's standpoint is a no. Sally says yes. Harry explains that ""no man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive. He always wants to have sex with her."" Sally replies, ""So, you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive?"" Harry comes back with, ""No. You pretty much want to nail 'em too.""That's the kind of dialogue you get a lot in this movie. If you want to compare Crystal's character to another fictional one, it would be George from ""Seinfeld."" George has all these intricate theories worked out about everything, from double-dipping to violating the ""splash zone."" (If you've seen the episode I'm talking about you'll get it.)Harry Burns is the same way. Only his theories are all on sex, and/or the differences between men and women. You could call him pessimistic. He admits he has a dark side. Sally says, ""I have as much of a dark side as the next person."" Harry replies, ""When I get a new book, I read the last page first so I know what happens in case I die. That, my friend, is a dark side."" Funny, I do the same thing and I've never really thought about it.Writer Nora Ephron based her screenplay on none other than the director of the film - Rob Reiner - and his love life. She sat down with him and another person once, and listened intently to his stories. According to her, she then coughed up a screenplay, handed it to Rob, and they made the film.Rob Reiner is one of the most talented and dependable directors in Hollywood. He adds a certain innocence, a certain charm, and a certain chemistry to his films that is hard to miss. His last great (or very good) film was ""The American President,"" but everyone finds themself in a ditch after a while, and I think as far as directors go, Reiner was one of the most consistently dependable directors during the eighties and nineties. Check this out: ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Misery,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""The American President"": All very good - some great - motion pictures that have become as famous as I don't know what.Coming to the cast, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are an absolute comic and romantic pairing. Every line is real. Every inch of attraction doesn't seem artificial. I swear that the first fifteen minutes of this film has some of the most interesting, engaging and downright smart dialogue I have ever seen in a film. Crystal and Ryan - especially Crystal - really break down everything and kind of make rules out of everything. Like Harry's amendment in the beginning, or how they dissect everything later on in the film and analyze it. I like when characters in films are quirky and have theories on everything. To me, people that have theories on life might as well hold the meaning of life in their hands, because to them, they are.""When Harry Met Sally"" is a keen observation on modern life, romance, men, women, friendship, and sex. And if you want something a bit tamer and more for the general audience, I recommend ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" which has just as much chemistry and observation going on as ""When Harry Met Sally"" does.In a time of cheap teen romance films, artificial dialogue and downright uninteresting stories, rarely does a romantic comedy like this come along, and it's an honor to watch something as observational, true, sweet, engaging, humorous, and lovely as ""When Harry Met Sally.""4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my all-time favorite comedies; romance at it's finest,"WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... (1989) **** Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, Bruno Kirby. Nora Ephron's dead-accurate screenplay and Rob Reiner's sentimentally funny direction make a valentine to falling in love and the war of the sexes answering the age-old question: Can a man and a woman still be friends without the sex thing getting in the way? Crystal and Ryan (both in their best roles) are a stormy couple of platonic friends for over a decade and meet up every so often until finally they face a crossroads in their close friendship with some hysterically funny moments. Ryan's orgasm scene in Katz' Deli is one for the time capsule. Realistic, warm, poignant and universally recognizable all in one: classic comedy of love. ** I TOTALLY RELATE TO THIS FLICK.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A little overrated,"I saw this film a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it but I really dont think it deserves a 7.7 at all.  The acting is good and everything, but it tries too hard to be funny, for example: The deli scene.

I Adore This Movie,"I'll say from the start of this review that I adore this movie. It has a real charm to it, helped by great performances from its leads and solid direction.Plot In A Paragraph: Harry and Sally meet in the summer of 1977 when they share a car ride to New York City together, they don't stay in touch, but over the years they keep running in to each other. Eventually the become friends. But can can men and women be friends, or does sex always get in the way??There is so much to love about this movie, Rob Reiner never disappoints as a director ""Stand By Me"", ""A Few Good Men"", ""Princess Bride"", ""Sure Thing"" and this are all very different movies, yet are all superb. Meg Ryan is at her cute best here, she is both gorgeous and adorable, Billy Crystal is at his best here too, I like Crystal, I have enjoyed him in everything from this, ""City Slickers"", the animated ""Monsters Inc"", ""Running Scared"" or another Reiner movie ""Throw Mama From The Train"".

a step above the norm for the genre,"Charming, humorously insightful romantic comedy about a man and a woman and their attempts to maintain a friendship despite any inevitable physical attraction that they may develop. Having both recently graduated from the University of Chicago, they set off on a road trip to New York City, and are convinced by first impression that they have nothing in common. It's not until years later that they reunite, form a genuine friendship, then struggle to keep things platonic despite their obvious affinity for one another. Crystal and Ryan are perfectly cast, and the script is overflowing with humor, wit, and amusing observations about the nature of men and women. A memorable film for fans of the genre, as well as the two stars. ***½",,Anonymous,Romance

The sex part always gets in the way,"In 1977, Harry Burns and Sally Albright have just graduated from the University of Chicago and meet when both need someone to share the drive back to New York. During the journey they start discussing their ideas about relationships. Sally believes that it is possible for men and women to enjoy platonic friends without sexual or romantic attachments; Harry disagrees, claiming that ""Men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way."" Harry and Sally do not stay in touch after arriving in New York, but they meet again by chance five years, and yet again five years after that. The film then traces the course of their relationship following this third meeting. There is also a subplot about a parallel romance between their respective best friends, Marie and Jess.The film is a romantic comedy with a difference. The plot of the traditional Hollywood rom-com tends to be centred upon some obstacle to the love of the young couple and tells the story of how that obstacle is removed or overcome. In ""When Harry Met Sally"" there is no obstacle to the love of Harry and Sally- except perhaps their refusal to admit that there is no obstacle. The plot, in fact, is a good deal less complicated than that of many romantic comedies, and we know that it is only a matter of time before Harry and Sally will fall for one another. This, of course, raises the question of which of them was right in their original disagreement. The obvious answer, of course, is that Harry was; he and Sally did not succeed in remaining ""just friends"" but ended up going to bed together. Yet in another way Sally was correct. Friendship and romantic love (which is about a lot more than mere sexual attraction) are not as distinct from one another as Harry assumed, and the first can be seen as a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of the second.What sets this film apart, however, from the hundreds of bog-standard rom-coms which Hollywood has churned out over the years is neither the plot nor the ideas discussed but the standards of the script and of the acting. Billy Crystal, another diminutive Jewish New Yorker who began his career as a stand-up comedian, has always struck me as a younger, better-looking version of Woody Allen, and his films often remind me of Allen's. ""Forget Paris"" had something in common with ""Broadway Danny Rose"", and ""When Harry Met Sally"" seems to have been influenced by ""Annie Hall"", another romance set in New York. Harry wisecracks his way though the film like Alvy Singer (and many other Woody incarnations), although he is more self-confident and less neurotic than most of Woody's characters, and Sally may owe something to Diane Keaton's Annie. Even the use of a split screen to show both main characters simultaneously when they are not together is derived from the earlier film.The script is officially credited to Nora Ephron, but in fact much of the dialogue appears to have been contributed by Crystal and the director Rob Reiner, a close friend of Crystal's, and some of the incidents were based on happenings in Reiner's t own life. The film's most famous scene is, of course, the one in the restaurant where Meg Ryan pretends to have an orgasm; the restaurant in question, Katz's Deli in Manhattan, is a real institution, and now marks with a commemorative sign the table where this scene was shot. There is also some very funny dialogue, much of it well up to Woody Allen standards. (""Harry, you might not believe this, but I never considered not sleeping with you a sacrifice"").Both the sparklingly witty Crystal and Ryan are brilliant as the main characters, so much so that one overlooks the age discrepancy between them. (Harry and Sally are supposed to be contemporaries, but in fact Crystal is thirteen years older than Ryan). It is strange to thing that Ryan was not the first choice for Sally; that was apparently Susan Dey, with Ryan several names further down Reiner's list. Although Meg had played the female lead in a few earlier films, such as ""The Presidio"", this was the one that really made her a star, and lead to her becoming one of Hollywood's two great romantic comedy queens of the nineties. (The other was Julia Roberts). Ryan was to work together with Ephron in two of her future rom-coms, """"Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail"". Here her Sally is an enchanting, angelic-looking girl, although one who has her own eccentricities. Besides her tendency to fake orgasms in inappropriate locations, she can be infuriatingly picky about her food, leading Harry to dub her a ""high-maintenance"" woman. (The film was, allegedly, responsible for popularising this particular usage, although here Harry is using the phrase to mean that Sally demands a lot of attention, not, as it is often used today, to mean that she demands that he spend a lot of money on her).I would not rate the film quite as highly as ""Annie Hall"", but then for me very few films can rank with Woody at his best. ""When Harry Met Sally"" is certainly one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties- indeed, it is probably my favourite except for ""Crocodile Dundee"". 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Capra, Allen, Cosmo","If you're going to like this, it will basically come down to a few things.Do you like Capra and old Hollywood? Which is to say, do you cherish movies where we can pretend that people are struggling in the real world, while knowing every step of the way they're falling in love in a movie? And that life ought to work a bit like this, love as unpredictable fate.Do you not mind Woody Allen? Enough to accept the roundly toned-down narrative tricks, neurosis, cynical wit as disillusioned truth and reference to other movies as blueprint for life, in our case (linking back to #1) Casablanca. (if you like Allen too much, this will grate as second-rate compromise)Can you still stomach Allen's movie image of the cute, jazzy New York?Do you watch endless reruns of Friends, just because of the cozy mood?Can you kid yourself for a while that Cosmo blurbs can substitute for relationship insights?None of it means you are a bad person. You just want from time to time some comfort food for the eyes.

One of the best Romantic Comedies out there,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.If you have read my reviews that I have posted(I do not blame you if you have not, they are awful), you will know that I am not a huge fan of Romantic Comedies. I mostly avoid them at all costs. The only time I will watch one is if someone forces me or I am bored (or possibly near death). However, I had heard nothing but good things about When Harry Met Sally so not only decide to watch the film, I decided to buy the DVD. Buying the DVD was clearly not a mistake.Its hard to say why When Harry Met Sally works so well. It maybe because of the director. However, it may have more to do with the actors. Another possibility would be the script. It is all three of them put together. Today, the scripts in Romantic Comedies range from average to sub-par. It is usually the actors that make the difference in today's Romantic Comedies.Rob Reiner was the perfect choice for directing the film. I cannot honestly say Rob Reiner was typecast as a director(he did do Misery and A Few Good Men)but this was the kind of film he did well. He was known for his more upbeat films. I am unable to say When Harry met Sally was hist best Film (I have not seen all his film and I slightly preferred The Princess Bride) but Reiner's work here is a reason the film works. Put this film in the hands of an unexperienced and untalented director, it is possible this film would not have been as successful.The acting is pretty damn close to perfect. This is without a doubt the best performance given by Billy Crystal. The same goes for Meg Ryan, who's last couple of performances(mainly Kate and Leopold and Proof of Life) have been quite dull. These two also exhibit a great deal of chemistry.The supporting actors to get the most screentime are Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher(who are also a couple). Bruno Kirby does a solid job as Harry's best friend. Likewise for Carrie Fisher as Sally's Best Friend. These two do not have as much screentime but they work well together.The screenplay is written by Nora Ephron. She has a lot of experience with Romantic Comedies(she also wrote Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail). Her script is a huge reason the film works. Today, the characters in Romantic Comedies usually say some cliched dialogue, not so here. Ephron's dialogue is fresh and smart. There are a bunch of quotable lines. For the most part, her script does follow the formula but the characters and dialogue are so well-written that When Harry Met Sally seems different.When Harry Met Sally represented a pinnacle for nearly everyone involved. Most of the cast had never been better(at least from what I have seen from them). Nora Ephron's You've Got Mail was enjoyable but paled to When Harry Met Sally(I did not see Sleepless in Seattle). Like I said, I do not feel this was Rob Reiner's best film but it does come close. I strongly recommend the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Genius Reinvention of Romantic Comedies,"A romantic comedy set during Christmas time? Hell yeah. Immaculate acting from the duo. Despite being skeptical about the structure and the many time jumps I have to say that it worked out well, as at the end I felt a sense of satisfying closure uncommon for a 1 hour and a half film. The thing about this is that there would be no Harry and Sally without Woody Allen. There would be no Ephron without Allen. This film would not exist if it wasn't for Annie Hall. Meg Ryan reminded me of Diane Keaton, the same for Billy Crystal. Despite maybe taking ""too much"" from Allen's films (when Billy Crystal runs at the end to reach Sally it reminded me of the ending of Manhattan) you cannot not enjoy it. Ephron's screenplay knows it's deeply inspired by Allen. So why not enjoy it. Without Allen's revolution of comedy, one of the best mainstream romantic comedies would not exist.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
There are three things to remember in relationships,"1) Men are always idiots before they hit thirty (And usually after) 2) Most men have no taste and 3) and the one that never gets mentioned is that even when women are wrong they will never admit to it.And for me this is the key thing that separates this movie from others as I have seen countless romantic comedies where the bloke makes mistakes and gets things wrong, but there very few movies where the female lead is as flawed and f***ed up as the man (Only 2 spring to mind).This is the story of Harry and Sally, two people who meet on the journey to a new life in New york. In the road trip there we learn 2 things, 1) Harry is a jerk and 2) Sally has still not been opened up sexually. These are clear from the conversations that take place, and the two leads play these roles to perfection.We leap frog 5 years and then another 5 years to see both characters coming to the end of long-term relationships and both suffering in different ways, Harry by seeking refuge in one night stands and Sally by being in denial, however as their friendship blossoms they both start to begin the healing process and as the movie moves further through their lives to it's inevitable conclusion we find out a hell of a lot about relationships and life in general as we go through one of the most enjoyable 90 minutes that the movies have produced over the last 20 years.The two leads are played with charm, vulnerability and honesty by Crystal and Ryan as the discuss anything and everything, from young girl's lack of understanding of ""Casablanca"" to the difference between women's and men's sex dreams. Whilst Nora Ephron's script is superb, what marks this out from later efforts are 2 things. Billy Crystal's superb comic skill, which can take something that's nothing and make it fantastic, and the direction of Rob Reiner, which avoids some of the later Ephron efforts of being too over the top or over-long due to her desire, like most writers, to get every word from the page onto the screen, which often doesn't work.This is one of the best films of the eighties, but like many great films of this era ""Tootsie"", ""Bill and Ted"" and ""Ghostbusters"" it is regarded as being, well, not as good as it is due to being made in the eighties.Fashion changes, class remains and this is classNuff said.Em.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Terrific Comedy,"When Harry Met Sally... (1989)**** (out of 4)Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet right after graduation on a road trip to New York but don't hit it off too well but over the next twelve years they become friends, lovers and enemies. I'm a die-hard fan of classic Hollywood and whenever someone mentions the greatest romantic comedies of all time they usually stick to the films of the golden era that featured Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and the likes of them but for my money this film here gives any of them a run for their money. This is an incredibly smart, witty, romantic and at times depressing look at the lives of two people who were meant for each other even though neither one of them might know it. A lot of romantic comedies out there are aimed directly at women or directly at men but that's not the case here as both sexes can really enjoy what's going on here because I think the film does a wonderful and hysterical job at showing both sides and how they look at certain issues. The screenplay by Nora Ephron is incredibly well written and hits on all sorts of subjects ranging from death to marriage and of course sex. The way the screenplay builds up the two characters is so well written that I might even say that this is one of the greatest character developments in the history of cinema. The real magic of the movie comes from Crystal and Ryan, who in my opinion, give the greatest performances of their careers. Everything from the way they talk to the way they walk really brings the characters to life and seeing them work together is just pure magic and something Ryan never could recreate in all of her future films like this. Crystal really stands out and delivers a hysterical performance with all his quick one-liners and facial gestures. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby also add great support as the friends.",,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it,"Going through movie classics has always been a goal of mine, and that movie had to make the list. This is always so weird to me that within a man and a woman, I am genuinely closer to the man. And in this case, the more sarcastic Harry was, the more I laughed and thought that I would have said the same. And while Harry hated how Sally acted, I mostly felt the same, she too controlling and a bit too narrow for me. I learnt to love Sally at the same time as Harry, and just loved their relationship. Their love for each other was genuine, and full of contradictions, and of course you know how it will end, but the journey is still very much worth it. And let's be honest, laughing that much in a movie about love (even between friends), is always a win in my book.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A perfect romantic comedy,"I grew up watching romantic comedies. My mom tenaciously forced me to watch them when I was young.

The characters seem real, like people we would know.The story is beautiful. About a friendship no one knows how it will end. The friendship is also something that this movie respects. Instead of fast-forwarding all the time, it takes it's time. Long walks in Central Park, dinners, museum-visits. This is a well-crafted story.Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are both amazing. You feel like you would like to be friends with them and go to their dinner parties. Amazing.All in all this is a wonderful romantic comedy.

One Of The Greatest In It's Genre,"At one point in everyone's life, they are able to show some sort of soft spot for films like these. When Harry Met Sally is the film that stand out against it's competitors and was able to stick with me with multiple viewings. I adore this film and the film was able to draw out certain emotions from me, which is rare in romantic comedies, that it blinds me from watching this film objectively. This is a prime example of a film that defines the genre it belongs to.Nora Ephron is regarded by some as the greatest writer for romantic-comedy/drama films. I have not seen all of her films but so far I hold When Harry Met Sally as her magnum opus. Ephron has written a story that explores the concept of friendship between man and woman, the role of sex in relationships, and the basic construct of a man and a woman. The film examines the role of fate in love, showing that people self sabotages or be in situations that destroys relationships in order to be with the love of their life at the end of the story. The choice of having New York was a great choice as it allowed the theme of fated love to be much more effective. Dialogue in this film is a stand out because it's what drives the characters in this film, because neither characters have any strong intentions to be with the other for the bulk of the film. The dialogue, and also the strength of the actors, deliver the comedy of the film and it gets me every time because it felt natural and was also able to come off as sweet and endearing.Rob Reiner, from his first feature film ""This is Spinal Tap"" and to ""A Few Good Men"", has made a string of very well made films and sometimes it's hard to choose which one is his best of the bunch. Reiner wanted the film to be very optimistic, which made it so accessible, and he has made something that is so natural and relatable. The film can appeal to people searching for love, allowing us to understand or think that there is a much larger work going on in finding it, or to people who have already found it. Reiner did not allow the film to really show the other people that Harry or Sally have dated and how these people are not for them, instead the director just has these characters talk to each other about it allowing the film to spend more time with these characters together. The film has the ability to have us be attached to these characters. I love that the film takes it's time with the characters', allowing them to grow and allow us to see the growth of the maturity of the relationship/friendship and the personal maturity of these characters. I was very glad that Reiner didn't congest the film in humor and allowed it to feel organic instead, like it could come out of our own mouths too. I also adore that the film's humor is driven more by the characters and the conversations that takes place rather than the story or the use of physical humor, aside from the diner scene. The film, even in multiple viewings, doesn't lose it's genuine touch which is why it is one of my favorite films of all time.Barry Sonnenfeld as the director of photography for the film was a good choice by Reiner. Sonnenfeld was able to connect with Reiner's vision for the film capturing the relationship between these characters through a long period of time with such accessibility and optimism. Sonnenfeld wants shots to be a bit stretched out in order to get the most out of the scene and allowing the actors to feel more natural and not just act in service to the story. Because the film is focused more on it's characters rather than the environment they are in, preventing the film from feeling like flashy and pretty though at times there are a few beautiful wide shots of New York like on the winter and autumn seasons.The film is soundtrack driven rather than a score driven film and I thought this was a great decision because Reiner chose songs that keep in tone with one another and the tone of the film. The songs are usually big band type of songs which was able to project a sort of class that other films lack. This though has made a big impact on future films/TV shows set in New York.Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal demonstrated amazing chemistry as they both look and play roles that clearly show in paper that they are meant to be together. Both actors deliver their lines so naturally that certain moments can allow us to really relate to conversations and events in our own lives. Crystal's humor may not appeal to everyone but in my opinion it really worked here, he wasn't too over the top and instead of being the center of attention on screen, he was able to share it with Ryan which supports in making the film amazing. It's nice to see Carrie Fisher do something great instead of the Star Wars franchise. Fisher has amazing comedic timing and she doesn't try to distract us from the lead characters. This also applies to Bruno Kirby who has moments that just has you laughing.When Harry Met Sally is one of the greatest of it's genre and it contains such likable leads and played by actors that are able to drive the film forward. Ephron has written an accessible and relatable script and Reiner has crafted a brilliant film that enhances the themes that drives Ephron's script. This is a film that I would recommend to everyone due to it's universal themes.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Contrived, boring and entirely forgettable.","As most people, I saw this film when it came out. Normally, I remember films very well, but except for the well known restaurant scene (""I'll have what she is having!""), I couldn't remember any of it. So I decided to watch it again. The film starts of relatively well - not your typical romcom style, and that's a good thing. But that's also where the list of good things about this film ends. What starts with him being cold and distant and her being ""structured"" as she puts it, ends with both of them being pretty much the same. (Occasional emotional outbursts do not a character arc make) I could not focus on the film and whatever story there was in it, because dialogues were mostly forced and unnecessarily long. I even stopped the film a few times just to see how it would play with a few sentences taken out here and there, and it played much better. Maybe this is poor writing, maybe poor editing, but in any case, it resulted in a film that is hard to watch and a story that reminds you that it is artificial, quite regularly. The illusion of a relationship between the main characters is the worst part: they are friends, and that only in the second half of the film. I never believed that they were for real; I was also annoyed with both of them too many times to care if they loved each other or died in a freak accident. In the end, the most important question about this film is - how did it get such a fanatical following? I remember that when it first came out, it was pushed and promoted all over the place. The ""I will have the same"" scene in the restaurant was daring for those times, and it certainly helped, but even that scene plays quite badly: structured characters do not just jump out of their structured world to entertain audiences - more was needed but it was never there. Maybe it was all that advertising and PR, or perhaps everyone wanted to see a (faked) orgasm on the big screen... In any case, the film was never that good to start with, and it really aged badly. If the editing and dialogues were a bit better focused, and if character development was a bit more realistic and deeper, I would consider this for an upgrade. As it is, it gets very generous 3 stars from me.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

An All-Time Great!,"Pros:Firstly, it's definitely a classic.The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal on screen was superb. Bouncing off each other at every point. I definitely became emotionally attached to both. Both giving career defining performances for meThe telephone scene... if you know and the fake orgasmThe script was fantastically written. Had its mix of romance as well as humour that blended so well togetherThis film certainly changed the many romantic comedies were perhaps made thereafter.It's a simple film. No dramatic plot twists, simple narrative that is used to the best of its abilityCons:Honestly at this point I can't think of one...Overall, 'When Harry Met Sally' has stood the test of time to become one of the great romantic comedies of all time. The chemistry from Meg and Billy is so touching and heart-warming to see as the film progresses, its screenplay from Nora Ephron was brilliant and not repetitive in anyway, the telephone scene and the fake orgasm scene are some of the best pieces of acting I've seen in a while and I just love how this film is simple but yet so effective in its delivery.Quote - ""I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."" - Harry BurnsScore - 4/5",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awfully funny,"When I first saw When Harry met Sally, I didn't like it, simply because I was too young - meaning that this movie is not fot everybody. you have to know things to like it, and as soon as you do, it's one of the funniest movies ever. The best thing about this movie is, or are, without a doubt, the dialogue. Sharp as a razor, well performed, and desperately funny. Billy Chistal is great as Harry, but he tends to act Meg Ryan off the screen. Meg Ryan isn't bad either, but it's hard to stand up to Billy Christal; but she's doing fine anyway. I think it's one of her best movies sofar. But anyway, this is one of the few really fine feel-good-movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming,"For many, this is the ultimate romcom, although I have others I prefer.  But it does come from a director I respect and stars a man whose comic potential has so rarely been scratched beyond his Oscar hosting duties.  Although I liked Forget Paris.  The orgasm scene is overrated, but it's the interplay between the two leads that is so good here  it's the best elongated relationship movie since Annie Hall, and some scenes can only be the result of the actors goofing around (`pecan pie...')  And then there's the date scene where the wrong partners get together.  Mm, yes, don't know what else to say.  I liked it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not your typical romcom,"I always assumed when harry met sally was just another romcom until i actually watched it. The viewing of male/female friendships is very spot on, how they built the tension was phenomenal. The dialogue was just so clever It's so different, refreshing and real in the most unexpected way. I watched an interview where the director (Nora) talks about the most unusual aspect to a romcom film which is that there's no conflict, the characters get to be together and bond without the need of an external conflict I just love that it's not enemies to lovers because it gives the leads the opportunity to reveal themselves while being friends.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The perfect romantic comedy.,"Perhaps the last truly great romantic comedy, 'When Harry Met Sally' has truly stood the test of time.Most movies made in 1989 are condemned (at least for now) to being little more than kitch memorabilia. The movie world owes Rob Reiner a favour for the fact that his fine film is truly timeless. Part of this is due to the fact that it is set over a fifteen year period. Part of it is due to the fine easy listening score. Most of it is due to a very refined director extracting two brilliant performances from a flawless script and a perfectly cast couple of actors.Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the titular two, and neither have ever been better. The observation of their relationship is utterly convincing and completely engrossing. Beyond this, there are subtleties that neither actor has ever shown before or since. There are moments early in the film where we can see Sally is falling for Harry (for example, her response to Harrty telling her he is pleased she is going on a date with another man) but these moments are never overplayed. The credit for this is due as much to Reiner as it is to Ryan, as it is his pacing of the film that really allows the actors to embrace their characters.I feel it is worth pointing out here that Reiner's other movies of the time have equally outlasted much of Hollywood's output. 'Satnd By Me', 'This Is Spinal Tap', 'The Princess Bride' and 'Misery' - films that could scarcely be more different in style and tone - all remain bonafide classics. One has to wonder what went wrong...All things considered, it's hard to think of another film from this era of film-making as satisfying and consistently enjoyable as 'When Harry Met Sally'. The fact that this is a romantic comedy made at the tail end of the worst decade cinema has ever known, is all the more reason to commend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Required viewing for teens before dating,"Remembering a line from the Lion in the Wizard of Oz, ""Ain't it da truth!""

"Harry Burns and Sally Albright share a car ride from Chicago to New York, during which they argue about whether men and women can ever truly be strictly platonic friends.","A stunning romantic comedy with possibly one of the funniest fake orgasm scenes ever. A light-hearted take on the question""Can a man and woman every be just friends?"". Casting proves to be one of the film's strengths. Rob Reiner's excellent instinct for jokes and punchlines paired with the obvious chemistry between Crystal and Ryan makes for an outstanding classic. What adds to the greatness of the movie is that it was not so much about Harry and Sally as it is about men and women in general. Reiner includes documentary-style interviews of couples who recall their first encounter which adds to the reality of the movie and makes this romantic comedy slightly different from the rest. A carefully crafted love story, growing over time along with witty banter between the two main characters. When Harry Met Sally...is hard not to love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unique. Well written. This is just what your heart wants when you are feeling light at hear.,"The title gives you a very wrong impression that this movie is gonna be typical and annoying kind. I felt that too. But I'm gonna say that when I finished the movie I was in total disagreement with my previous self. I won't say this wasn't typical but it had some good laughs. Most importantly, Harry (Billy Crystal) was quite amusing and a charismatic character with whom I wanted to stick with throughout. He uncovers some fine secrets of life while he's being funny at the same time. I mean being subtle at its best. That was really lovely. Of course I won't talk about his performance, he felt like quite real to me. Sally (Meg Ryan), on the other hand, wasn't that appealing to me. Now some of you might contradict me and I totally agree with you too. What I really want to say is the character she plays is quite real too. You have many Sally's around you, you might have been in a relationship with her too, but performance wise I thought she was a little under-ethusiastic. She could've done better. Supporting cast and characters were good too.On a short note I liked the movie, the writing, direction, they might have missed some details but can be totally neglected. Watch it with your boyfriend/girlfriend or spouse or the best partner would be your OPPOSITE GENDER BEST FRIEND if you may.

Great Romantic Comedy,"The good romantic comedy is a rare breed indeed. Many start off well, but then too drippy, too mean-spirited, or just plain unfunny. A movie that stays sweet, funny and good hearted from start to finish is to be cherished and this is it.When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that many people have seen a dozen times and still enjoy. It covers a period of a decade or so when Harry Burns (Crystal), a self confident, wordy, cynical writer first meets Sally Albright (Ryan) and uptight, perfectionist, a truly high maintenance woman. Or has Harry calls her, the worst kind, high maintenance who thinks she is low maintenance.They meet to drive to New York together, hate eachother, meet again in an airport five years later, hate eachother a little less then meet in a book store five years after that, to discover they have both been dumped and have more in common than they think.They become friends. They date and share experiences. They try to set eachother up with friends and then the inevitable happens. They spend the night together and we spend the balance of the film discovering whether or not their friendship was love, and if it can survive a night of sex.This set the stage for all other Nora Ephron offerings. The movie does not miss its tone for a second. Rob Reiner keeps it funny, lets us in on the characters flaws, but at the same time, makes us care about them rather than be repulsed by them.I have seen this film at least 10 times and would watch it again in a heartbeat. It is likely the best date film of all time, and can be equally enjoyed by both sexes. It is funny  from the first frame to the last features a great soundtrack from Harry Connick. **** out of ****.",,Anonymous,Romance

My favorite scene is he realizes all along that she is the best thing that will ever happen to him and he wants her more than anything else.

More than just a few immortal scenes,"""When Harry met Sally"" is about what we call in Dutch a flashing light relationship. This term describes the situation that two people are made for each other and everyone sees that, except the two people in question.This sort of love - hate relationship was typical for the screwball comedy's of the '40s, and indeed ""When Harry met Sally"" is a sort of neo screwball. The screwball comedy needs sharp dialogue and that is just what screenwriter Nora Ephron provides. The direction is done by Rob Reiner and this makes the film a little bit more spicy than ""Sleepless in Seatlle"" (1993). ""Sleepless in Seatlle"" is also a film in which people doubt until the very end about their relation, but this time Nora Ephron did both the screenplay and the direction.A lot of people know some immortal scenes from ""When Harry met Sally"".

"One of my favourite rom-coms, because of charming and talented Billy Crystal","The title of my review is very clear. But let's talk about every aspect of the film.First of all, I liked the plot and since I love cult films, I decided to watch it. I wasn't disappointed. The plot was very catchy, the actors' performances were very good and convincing. This film can be easily watched today by people that only like watching new films, and the reason is simple. It's classic and future-prood. The topic is ""a man and a woman can't be friends"". This topic is menacing us since forever.Then, the most important thing for me that made me love this film, is Billy Crystal. Yes. I think objectively, not many people would find Billy Crystal a charming man. But I don't care. I really find him. As an actor and as a man. Maybe his performance in this film, made me watch him in this way. A popular comedian, that can act also dramatic and sensitive. He had great chemistry with Meg Ryan, I have to admit it. And the way he looked at his love interest... I felt that it was so real. I felt like I wasn't watching a film. I have to admit that I never cried in ""Titanic"" or in ""The Notebook"", but I cried in ""When Harry Met Sally..."" . Yes. I cried. In the last scene, when Harry confessed his love to Sally. This scene got me.I rarely see actors that can transmit me so good sensitive feelings, with only using their face expression. Only their eyes. Billy Crystal did this. I almost fell in love. I know it sounds very romantic, bit this film, mostly because of this actor (how he performed) made me fall in love with the character and the film by itself.In other news, the scenes with the couple's that were interviewed about their first meet, was quite cute, funny and original. Also, the secondary characters (Jess and Marie) were also very good. It's so sad that both of them died very young. Rest in peace. Also, if someone loves Christmas, this film is very good option, because it contains Christmas and New Year's Eve.To be honest, the only thing that I didn't liked, was the montage of the film. I found that they were cutting one scene, but the transition to the next scene wasn't smooth. But that's just my personal opinion. The positive aspects about this film are many more.One thing is for sure. I can't forget easily this film. I can't forget the glance of Billy Crystal's character. I just can't. And also the fact of how Harry and Sally met, and many years past and then they were so close, really got me in tears. I find this film so beautiful that I can't not cry. One of my favourite films for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute Fun Romantic Comedy,"They had known eachother for years and were close friends, but they had to discover who they were and could they stay friends with or without sex. Harry, played by Billy Crystal, and Sally, played by Sally Kellerman, were both headstrong and willing to understand eachother.  Even their best friends played by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby were a real match, so Harry and Sally had to learn the hard way.  It took their best friends' marriage plus Harry's willingness to admit he really loved Sally --- and so he proposed marriage on New Year's Eve.  In other words, they were two of a kind.

Intellectual look at when a guy meets a girl,"After spending a road trip together, Harry (Crystal) and Sally (Ryan) find they have little in common. On meeting again in years time, they form a strong friendship.The romantic genre has gone through many changes over the last decade. From the obvious and clichéd Sleepless in Seattle and Love Actually to the heavily slapstick funny films such as Hitch and Just Friends among others. Sadly we aren't seeing enough romantic films that look at issues, opinions and life the way classics such as Rob Reiner's Oscar nominated picture did.This picture is a beautiful piece of film-making. From the funny protagonists to the simple powerful storyline, this is a fine romantic film.Far from a guy likes girl flick, this looks at the intricate ways men and women look at each other. Harry in particular brings up a valid point in that sex will always get in the way of a guy and a girl ever being friends. This concept, represented at a highly inconvenient moment, is incredibly funny and importantly relative.Crystal (The Princess Bride) and Ryan (You've got mail) deliver knockout performances with Ryan in particular very charming. Ryan has created that vulnerable but opinionated persona on screen that many viewers will relate to. And obviously not forgetting that infamous scene in the restaurant. I think we'd all like to have what she's having.The narrative, though always likely, is directed and told in a way that is enjoyable from start to finish. Most modern flicks use that slapstick humour or star quality to create that tension for the guy and the girl to get together but this is an intellectual and diverse approach that can not be faulted.A lot of romances don't know whether to be funny or dramatic but Reiner's picture is a finally balanced flick that gives us plenty of laughs and an equal dose of tension.The setting and music are chosen very well, justifying the moments in perfect sequence.This is a romantic film that betters most modern clichéd romances out there with a slick approach to the world of friendships and relationships.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time,"When harry met sally is a romantic comedy movie directed by rob reiner starring billy crystal and meg ryan. This movie got nominated for original screenplay Oscar and is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest romcoms ever made if not the greatest.The story is about harry and sally meet each other when she gives him a ride to new York. But it didn't work out and then after 5 years they meet again and it didn't work out either, So after another 5 years they bump into each other, however this time he is married and she is related to someone, but they both find themselves single after days, so now they spend time with each other on one condition no physical connection what means no sex cause they are afraid that it will ruin the relationship. Weird isn't it from what I know sex is an essential part of the relationship between men and women some people even think that it's the most important part of the relationship. Well this movie teaches you the opposite of that. We see these two characters passing time and talking to each other, So the movie is just a lot of dialogue between these two. As a result of that the movie recline on the quality of the writing and the acting of course. The movie goes as they go. If they are bad I don't know if we have got a movie let alone a great movie. It reminds me of the before trilogy just two people walking and chatting nothing much of a story. But at this time they talk with each other on a different period of times for a year not for one day so here is the thing I prefer this movie than all of all of the three movies of the before trilogy. Cause in this case we have two incredible characters. Let me explain why they are great, both of them don't know if they need someone to be with in the first place, they aren't so sure in case they need a husband or a wife what should he look like. I am not talking about the look, I am talking about the character they both have different principles which they don't trust them sometimes to make them happy. Another thing they both like each other from the first meeting but somehow they don't want show it especially sally, they are both educated. As a result of that you never hear some cheap dialogue, its always good dialogue without being too much complex so its easy to understand, and the last thing they are very funny and weirdly complex in their emotions, of course all what I have said about the characters needs to be demonstrated by the actors and they performed very well in this regard. Last thing I want add is the editing, you can't believe how good it is. It shows you 6 months of time without feeling like it .plus the most important thing there is scenes where we see them on separate screens in different places, so this helps the comedy and the romance causes it shows how much close their characters are.As a conclusion I think when harry met sally is one of the greatest romantic comedy of all time I wont say it's the greatest cause there is a movie called annie hall which I don't expect any movie to top it anyway.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

And again and again ...,"Love at first sight or does the flame have to actually be set off over several times? There are different ways two individuals fall in love and we get some interviews here that highlight that. I have not researched if the people in this are actually together or if they just retell stories from actual couples. Whatever the case, the case here is you get a really good romantic comedy.And as far as I can tell it all came about the director having issues in his own love life. Now there is something (a lesson) to learn: even when you are down and don't feel good, you can make something productive. Also reassuring to those who may feel neglected or unsure if they'll ever find love.But this is not just a good comedy, it has one of the best known movie scenes. Just as people are aware of the ""Say hello to my little friend"" line, they are aware of the ""I'll have what she's having"" line. And it is uttered by none other than the mother of the director. Now either this was a therapy session or maybe they needed some after this - or they just have one of the loveliest mother-son relationships, that no Psych should question.Really good and ""real"" movie (the dialog may annoy you, some of you, but it is great and on the spot) that does not feel like it has aged.

Adorable Meg Ryan,"Both the leads are endearing and have their moments . Great dialogue even if it's a bit dated. Had to only give it a lower rating because of the cringe scenes with the old actors portraying couples and how they met, that for me, took away from the story.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The epitome of the Yuppie Romantic Comedy,"I really enjoy this movie. It's ""cute"", Meg Ryan is ""cute"", the story is ""cute"". A lot of ""awwwwww"" moments. Little to jar the nerves or expectations. This movie is set solidly in the late 80s early 90s Yuppie era and the symbols are all here. Everyone is highly successful in their chosen fields, they all dress well, look well and share witty repartee at every turn. Yuppie symbols are seen as well, the principles shop at ""The Sharper Image"", drink a lot of coffee and Evian water and get invited to all the best parties. It will rank as a great romantic romantic comedy of the early 90s like ""It Happened One Night"" typified the 1930s, ""It's A Wonderful Like, the 1940s, ""Annie Hall"", the 1970s and so on.The movie looks very nice, the seasons are well represented and color coordinated. The fall and winter scenes are just gorgeous.Recommended if in the mood for love and romance and don't mind a little sentimentality.",,Anonymous,Romance

A passionate film made by passionate filmmakers for passionate film watchers.,"This is a passionate film made by passionate filmmakers for passionate film watchers.  There is no way to adequately express my feelings about this film, but still I can't help but try.  This film is one of the few in recent viewing that I can watch over and over again, it never tires me.  Both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan do a magnificent job of creating believable, accessible, and extremely memorable characters.  Throughout the course of roughly an hour and a half we are granted admission to the evolution of both Harry and Sally and their relationship.  Rob Reiner does an excellent job with an equally excellent script by Nora Ephron, and though he has proven his diversity through the myriad of memorable films he has made two constant and undeniable qualities flow through his body of work; truth and humanity. Love between two people is one of the hardest things to portray on screen, but Reiner and his crew do a seamless job of making it not only believable, but interesting and heart warming with out being overly sentimental.  Some of the greatest moments are also among the quietest and most subtle, allowing the viewer's appreciation to increase with each viewing.  Almost every frame of this film is a thing of beauty and reiterates something that has recently begun to permeate my thoughts and feelings about great films and that is this: while there may be an array of different qualities under the spectrum of great films one common bond that must always exist is passion.  You get the sense that this is a film which everyone working on it not only understood and believed in, but felt the film was so important that they were determined to make it the best they possibly could, and they certainly did.  The most vital quality a film must possess to be great is relevance to the human experience, in a word universality.  When Harry Met Sally possesses this and so much more and it will continue to be universal, accessible, and relevant far beyond its time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can men and women be friends?,"Well, don't pretend to get this question answered. This is - luckily - no serious psychological analysis, this movie is still fresh and full of life after all these years. If there is one big moral behind it, then it is ""don't think about it"" and ""let things come by themselves"". I love this movie, it never gets boring and it has it place in my collection. It is a story about life and the turnarounds love sometimes does... before it goes back. Particularly I like the interviews to the couples during the movie, which makes us understand that... there is no ""wrong"" or ""right"" in relationships. Very good soundtrack, too!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great movie.,"Is there honestly a better Romantic comedy out there than this? So many movies you see are more comedy than there is Romance or any serious plot. This ones hits all the right notes. I think allot of people can relate to this movie, because we see some of ourselves in the characters that are portrayed. Having seen this in the theater when released, it has become one of my favorite movies. Countless great scenes. Even small scenes like when Harry tells his friend Jess about the movers arriving at his place has a combo. of humor but also sadness because Harry knows his marriage is kaput. Sorta the way life is. Crystal has one great one liner after another. And all the actors in this movie are great. Its a ones in a blue moon good movie. And thats what makes it a classic.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Great acting, great dialogs","When Harry met Sally is not just the average romantic comedy as it is often labeled. This movie is, I think, underrated. It has some great dialogs and the acting is very nice as well. Especcially these dialogs make it more then worthwhile, something which cannot be said of most romantic comedies. A very strong point is, that the dialogs make you start thinking. At least, that's what I did when I just saw it. With that, the interaction of love between Crystal and Ryan is worked out very well. The idea that destiny is very important in true love is well worked out, maybe even philosophical idea.When Harry met Sally is simply a classic in its genre.A nice 9 out of ten!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best romantic comedy you are likely to see these days!,"There is such a strange perfection and appeal to this movie it will always remain my favourite modern romantic comedy. For a start it achieves that amazing feat that few Rom-Coms will ever get close to; It is genuinely  and heart warmingly funny and incredibly romantic! The script and characters harken back to the days when movies were so much more wordy and eccentric and both Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal create the perfect chemistry.When Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron got together to make this film their blend of talents really created something special.

The orgasm scene is irresistible. I still roll on the floor of laughter when I see it. Great lines, great music, great actors and a very sweet plot.This movie warms my heart, it makes me believe in romance and that there is hope for obnoxious men. This movie made me attempt to believe that men can grow up. Of course, it is a movie and it could be an exception. The old couples talking was cute but not really necessary even though I understand that it was all building up to the last scene, the movie would not have suffered much without it.This movie is a classic, the Casablanca talk just ads to it's classiness.

Men be like Harry before he met Sally,"I actually liked the film. The dialogue was interesting and I liked Billy Crystal's acting. The first and second half of the film tell two different stories though. I liked the first half of the film because it shows something men today have lost. They've lost their masculine side. The Harry in the first half of the movie is fun, opinionated, doesn't care what he says, and doesn't put women on a pedestal. He's very much in his masculine.The second half of the film tells a story of what men have become today. Emotional, afraid to say anything rational/opinionated, and feminine. I don't know what happened to the Harry from the first half the film. I guess his divorce really whipped the man out of him? He is all feminine, and it was really cringe to watch and see what happened to him.Instead of hitting the gym, finding different women to date or working on himself/finances, we see him depressed over his divorce. Then he starts simping over Sally, who wasn't interested in him to begin with. She was only using him as some emotional tampon. (Sally has a ton of red flags to begin with so I don't know why you would want to date her.) The second half was okay but cringe. I wish Harry had stayed strong. At the very least I interpreted the second half as what men should NOT be doing.I for one would have preferred the scraped ending instead.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unexpectedly original romantic comedy,"The romantic comedy, as a genre, is often regarded as inferior to others, sometimes rightfully. More often than not, rom-coms are full to the brim with tropes, especially the extremely irritating cliché that is ""love at first sight"". This movie tries to subvert this idea, by intercutting scenes with interviews of elderly couples who got married shortly after meeting each other. Harry and Sally, on the other hand, take their time and their love story spans over a decade. As they get to know and understand each other, we do the same and start to root for two realistic characters, instead of witnessing an implausible, preconceived, relationship.As a comedy, this flick also works extremely well. There are iconic one-liners (like the classic ""I'll have what she's having), but it's the witty dialogue that makes this film. In every scene, the movie amuses us and gives us some information about the characters' attitudes towards life and, more specifically, love. Furthermore, the two lead actors, especially Crystal, have great comedic timing, making the movie entertaining, heartwarming and refreshing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

THE Romantic Comedy,"Although romantic comedies were made before ""When Harry Met Sally..."", it was the movie that invented the phrase. The movie is about the long, over more than ten years ( though the movie focuses on the last two years ), relationship between Harry and Sally who first meet on their car pooling trip to New York after graduating from university. It explores the question ""Can men and women really be friends?"". It's a whole lot of fun to watch them find out the answer to that question as well as to illustrate a lot of the differences between men and women in terms of wants and needs in a relationship. If you like romantic comedies, you really have to see the modern one that started them all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant, witty and so modern...","I have watched this movie again, after so many years, in times when my little age did not allow me to get its meaning. Actually, this movie shot in the late 80's undoubtedly proves to be so modern, I don't know whether this is due to its witty dialogues, or simply because man-woman relationships always offer the same issues. Harry likes Sally, Sally likes Harry, probably since from the beginning, but it will take them twelve years to recognize it, they will have to grow up, together, before accepting and declaring this matter of fact. This is in my opinion the most interesting point in the movie: the importance of time, of just waiting until you finally have to realize that what you have been looking for for so many years has been in front of you for such a long time. On the other hand there are Jess and Mary, to remind us that there's nothing wrong in accepting love, who simply recognize their love at first sight and just act and live according to this fact. But there are people like Harry and Sally who fear embracing love, fear happiness, people for whom happiness is a matter of conquest, who need suffering before admitting what seems so clear, and untroubled. Actually, there is no true suffering in the movie, permeated as it is by such witty irony and disguised under funny situations, so that what prevails is a hilarious atmosphere. In the end, we get what we expect, and what is right, and we like it. Billy Cristal and Meg Ryan are wonderfully paired, they convey such tenderness and chemistry, not passion, but that mutual attraction that comes from deep mutual understanding. A feel good movie, well acted, and accompanied by such pleasant music, which delicately underlines situations set in an always wonderful and magic New York, in every season, making one feel like being exactly there....",,Anonymous,Romance
Right Up There As One Of The Best,"Spoilers In the category of Romantic Comedy, most movies do not get to an average above 5 stars. However, this one hit 7.7 stars and that represents the highest rated Romantic Comedy I ever seen here on IMDb. I read the negative reviews and many relate to typical comments regarding the Genre - Romantic Comedy - Predictable, Unreal. I think the Genre of Romantic Comedy will always disappoint some moviegoers. I go into a romantic comedy knowing we will not see a surprise ending and/or a documentary. Also the movie drags at many points because they show all the conflicts that kept Harry and Sally single.That said, I rate this very highly. There are numerous comparisons in this forum to Sleepless in Seattle, but this movie's climax is far stronger then that movie's climax. This movie had a perfect climax, which showcased a crescendo of sound timed with the climax to a story. The constant interview of Harry alone and Sally maybe keeps some guessing about the outcome, but you know you are gonna get the standard Rom-Com climax, anyway. That said, it still was a good thing when it came and the way it came about.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Modern Classic,"What's a perfect comedy? - It should be funny, of course, but it should also be sad at moments, it should be romantic, and it should have something to say about life and people.""When Harry Met Sally..."" has it all: You can roll on the floor laughing, when Sally (Meg Ryan) fakes her orgasm at the restaurant. You can cry, when Harry (Billy Crystal) walks the streets of New York City on New Year's Eve feeling lonely and finally realising that he's in love with Sally. Romance is all around, when the documentary couples tell their stories of how they met. And isn't it true that love and sex always come in the way in a friendly relationship between men and women?This is one of my all time favourite movies.

"MODERN CULTURE CHANGED, THIS IS A ROMANTIC COMEDY CLASSIC","Sort of a follow up of ""Annie Hall."" classic based in New York, also can be used as a holiday film as well a dating film. First, fine directing by Rob Reiner, uses documentary couples which are SO CUTE AND COMICAL as a segue way tothe next segment as story develops. It's mainly the relationship between Harry Burns played by funny Billy Crystal and the intelligent/dizzy beautiful yetversatile Meg Ryan played Sally Albright, a becoming classic actress should get Kathrine Hepburn type scripts made her Best Actress of 20th century. IMHO.Also, as a secondary developing relationship is Jess played by Bruce ""Bruno""Kirby Jr. and Marie played by Carrie Fisher which become best friends withHarry and Sally perspectively, do fine supporting acting roles. I believe the first half of 20th century some movies gave respect of reflecting the culture,whensleeping with your friend then love of your life was taboo, like in ""It Happened One night"" pushing moral envelope was ""An Affair To Remember"" and classicsimilar throwback fine romantic comedy ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Both receivedFAIR ratings ironically. My heartthrob Meg Ryan stars in it, is well becoming a classic actress as well comic/actor Tom Hanks. The moral issue once calledfornication, now is normal lifestyle for most, ""When Harry Mets Sally"" is a classic fairs with ""Annie Hall,"" should be in Top 250 IMDb List. My folks of 1920s stayed with moral traditional role as orthodox catholics, when choosing a lifelongpartner. Religion played significant role from dating to marriage, unlikeHollywood stars past lived like today's standards. Even though influential,Hollywood is not the blame for the moral culture changes, we baby boomersturned away from Orthodox to Reform (Rebellion). Moral issue aside, oneintensely memorable moments, was Sally (Meg Ryan) fake public orgasm in thediner as another patroness sitting by mesmerized,"" I want what she's having."" 11/10 for that segment.

A loving description of the film I was raised on...,"I have seen this movie so many times, I actually know every line by heart. You could say I was raised on it, family gatherings usually amounted to relaxing in the living room in front of the TV, reciting the lines along with Meg Ryan... This film brings you to great laughing sieges, and hides within it wonderful lines that shall stick to your mind, and mix with your  way of talk forever (`You're right, you're right, I know you're right...'). It is directed with great emotional capacity, and written with an innovative sense, a look towards the future. The actors are wonderful, they have great chemistry. This is the best role either of them has ever had. Billy Crystal is a hilarious comedian, and Meg Ryan has a perfect sense of timing. Everybody agrees (for how can you not?) that the `orgasm scene' is boisterously entertaining (did you know it was not written in the script by Nora Ephron, but was Meg Ryan's idea?), and this movie has definitely contributed to the cinema industry. It's first half is brilliant, the conversation in the car on the way to New York is pure comedy  witty, intelligent and fun. The second half of the movie flirts dangerously with the realm of the `lovey-dovey' world, but it manages to escape just on time. Even though it might be less funny, it is essential for the well-being of the movie, and it makes it work.Anyone who has not seen this movie should rush and get it as we speak. This is a real classic  everyone should have it at home, for a rainy day...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
LOVED it!,"This is one of my all-time favorite films. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are magic together, and the two characters they play are so real and tangible.Of course, most of the credit of the film's success go to the two leads of course, but the fine supporting performances from Carrie ""Princess Leia"" Fisher and Bruno Kirby, the warm, funny, charming script by Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner's direction mesh perfectly and create a wonderful film.I can really relate to Harry and Sally's romantic heartaches, and how they cry on each other's shoulders. Also I felt that their gradual attraction was played realistically. The last twenty or so minutes leading up to the big romantic finale will have you both cheering and crying!My favorite line is, after Harry and Sally spot Harry's ex-wife and her new boyfriend Ira while singing in the Sharper Image store, Harry yells: ""Six years later, you find yourself singing ""Surrey With the Fringe On Top"" in front of Ira!!!""Highly recommended to the hopeless romantic, or someone coming off a breakup.

The best romantic comedy you'll ever see,"I never understood women and romantic comedies. I could never see the point of spending two hours of your time to watch a movie about two lovers being forced from each other and striving to reunite. I mean where's the interest in that? I'm not saying that I'm a dumb die-hard that needs action to be satisfied, but I do ask that I be given a valid reason to stick around for the touchy love story.So when I decided to rent 'When Harry Met Sally' you could tell that there was going to be some hesitation involved. It looked like any other majorly cliché chick flick that I had previously wasted hours of patience with. But after reading some of the reviews given to it by various critics I thought to myself ""You know what, maybe this going to be something different, something better"", and as it turns out, it was.When Harry Met Sally is a wonderful relief. I finally found a romantic comedy that I can feel comfortable watching. It's an amusing story about that old question; can men and women be friends? It features one of the best match ups ever assembled on screen and a socially hilarious script by Nora Ephron. It's easily the best romantic comedy ever. Meg Ryan is absolutely beautiful and Billy Crystal nails the role of the obnoxious male friend. Of course I can't forget Rob Reiner's brilliant direction, wait a go Rob. It's a shame he doesn't make more movies like this because it really suits him.

Good film,"Good film. Because the dialog is the best part of the movie, which is witty, piercing and memorable. The cast did a wonderful job in the dialog. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal seemed to be mismatched together at first. But soon you'll find that they are not only making a miraculous harmony but also enhanced the quality of the dialog itself. Billy Crystal especially makes you giggle or laugh with his well-known sense of humor. The supporting cast is also appropriate. In their conversations you hardly find flowery words. They are always dry and blunt, and it makes this movie different from other mainstream sweet romantic comedies. And the screenplay is also good. ""Men and women can never be friends.""

The sexes battle it out,"This film gives a realistic look at sex and relationships. The deli scene was one of the more telling portraits of female duplicity I've seen yet. It pointed out perfectly how astute women are at faking orgasm, which I feel is not a sometime thing but happens on a regular basis. Most men are just like Crystal's character in that their line is, ""women don't fake with me, I could tell if they did"". What arrogance! Women are masters at the art, and a man cannot always tell. They put on an act of ecstasy to either please their partner, or to get something from him, because women basically hate sex. The sex act is the female's most deadly weapon, one that in the end, however, is easily defeated if a man simply uses his head. Which, of course, most males are unable to do - we tend to let the little head do the thinking in such situations. This allows the man to be easily led and manipulated. This wasn't a bad film, a little slow and dull in spots but very lively in others with good performances by all the players.",,Anonymous,Romance

However, the film raises the question, 'Can men and women ever be just friends?'.Personally, I loved this film.

What the Rom-Com genre should have always been,"The romantic comedy genre gets a bad reputation and, lets face it, deservedly so. It isn't easy to find a good rom-com in this day and age but stumbling upon When Harry Met Sally was quite the treat. It's the story of two friends, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan). They are best friends, trying their hardest to keep sex out of the relationship so as not to complicate things. It's a charming story with fun characters and witty dialouge. The film is funny in its own subtle way without the use of stupid humor or sight gags. I had a great time watching this film and it kept me amused and interested the whole way through.I'm a huge Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride, Stand by Me) fan. His style of subtle and intelligent humor is something that you just don't see anymore. When Harry Met Sally is a great example of his comedic style and it never loses its touch throughout the entire film. And while the wit and intelligence of the film remains the same all the way through, it changes its tone and pacing multiple times, making for an intriguing and diversified watch. The creative way in which the story progresses breaks away from the way thousands of other romantic comedies play out, and that makes for something so fresh and original that you can't help but love it.Major kudos also go out to the limited cast of this film. When Harry Met Sally really only comprises of two main characters (Crystal and Ryan) and two supporting characters (Kirby and Fisher). Bruno Kirby (Donnie Brasco, The Basketball Diaries) plays Harry's best guy friend and Carrie Fisher (Star Wars) plays Sally's best girl friend. The interactions between these four characters make some of the most memorable scenes in the film. With such a small group of central characters, each must serve a legitimate and relevant purpose, and they all four go above and beyond in this respect.When Harry Met Sally is a fantastic film that defines what all romantic comedies should be. Its intelligence and wit is something you don't see much anymore, making it a film that stands out among the thousands of others like it.

A true deep friendship between a man and a woman something many seemingly impossible and in the end they prove it is.Another thing that attracted me to this movie except its amicable warmth is that it provides a deep analysis of several relationship aspects from the point of view of the two sexes and it is not for the purpose to create an argument but to establish the truth which is that love is something you cannot control.DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!!!",,Anonymous,Romance
Modern Culture Romantic Comedy Is A Classic,"I commented on this romantic comedy, should be included in Top 250 IMDb list. A definite for as other mentioned for a first date etc.. Do opposites really attract? Fine acting combination of comedian/actor Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally. Fine supporting cast played by Bruce""Bruno"" Kirby Jr. as Jess courting Carrie Fisher as Marie. Rob Reiner director, I believed was clever implemented a cute segue way to next segment of movie, using documentary couples givecute insights to their relationships ,in this case older married couples, small but funny part as Harry and Sally's relationship develop negative and positive. As story moves on, background narratives of Crystal and Ryan voices where's nodialog, their minds speaking adds a flare in my opinion, helps me be in Harry's shoes. Same applies if your a female to Sally's perspective. I know othersmentioned this part but worth repeating since it does not happen in ""real life,"" where Sally is dared by Harry in diner scene publicly faking orgasm, that'salmost the climax of movie no pun intended. Another patroness glued to looking at Sally replies to waiter, ""I'll have what she's having"" may not be verbatim sure was FUNNY. replayed that part over again so good.

"So, this is how it all started","It was about time for me to see this movie. And all the good words are deserved. Too bad it has spawned one of the most predictable, boring, annoying, over repetitive sub-genres.It is evident that the movie draws lot of inspiration from Woody Allen style, but it is more tighten for a wider audience, but luckily not dumbed, like is done these days.So what does this film has that todays don't? It is intelligently, patiently done, not hurrying for the romance or forcing jokes and avoids successfully to be predictable and pathetic. The chemistry works between the leading actors, and the supporting characters are more than decor to fill space. The biggest difference is that it keeps in touch with the reality and drama that makes it more intense.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good comedy,"Good movie to see in the fall. Great shots of new yorkI love romantic comedies that are based on normal lives and not these over-sexed, gross, no-story comedies we keep seeing.I love this movie.

Textbook of 'Friends to Lovers' trope,"Many rom-coms (before and even after 'When Harry Met Sally') drag on their narratives with many 'accidental' mistakes and mismatched timings to express one's feelings. What's the point of all the extra amounts of useless trivia? Do the directors of romance movies think they will contribute to the climax? It does not work that way. Romance or rom-com moviegoers knowingly go into the theater that two protagonists will probably have a happy ending. What determines the success is the chemistry of a couple. 'When Harry Met Sally' has a straightforward plot. Two friends stay friends rather than expressing their love for each other because they do not want to ruin what they already have. Story, very simple and clear. However, their lines are just something. They show how much women and men approach the relationship, love, and sex differently in a very cute and charming way, exposes unique and lovely personalities of the characters, and build the chemistry by how they exchange those lines. It was just so cute to watch total opposite tone of the speech of Harry and Sally and how they complement each other. I want to give a shoutout to a screenwriter and actors who bring iconic Harry and Sally into the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A Unique Romantic Comedy that Stays Fresh After All These Years,","When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant movie with a very well written plot and a talented comedic cast. The movie is a very unique romantic comedy, probably my favourite one because the characters' relationships are so realistic and they behave like real men and women instead of just a cliché romance film couple.The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is outstanding and certainly the best part of this movie, Crystal's character is nothing like any male character you've seen in a romcom before, he says things you'd never expect to hear in a movie. Meg Ryan's character is well developed and not just second best to Crystal's character, they wrote this movie so that both had equal importance and neither had more character development than the other.The movie certainly withstands the test of time and will for years to come because a relationship between a couple has always stayed the same and this is the most grounded towards that relationship. When Harry Met Sally is a great movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy, in my opinion,it's the one best there is.Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet on a road trip to New York, they do not meet each other again until five years later, they keep running into each other and decide to become friends, although they fear they might be more there.Best Performance: Billy Crystal",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dated but greated...( and that's great, not grate)","Okay, so I'm a bit behind the times, but I didn't see this until quite recently - a couple of months ago, in fact.  Until that time, all I knew was the fake-orgasm scene, which I must admit, is my least favourite out of the whole movie.  Other than this, I think Ryan and Crystal work really well together, and the script is well written - enough so to allow the audience to really root for them.  It doesn't rely on big explosions or car chases to entertain the audience, and the inserts of the different elderly couples telling the stories of how they met is really sweet and a great idea. I ties up well, leaving the viewer satisfied as to its conclusion but not taking it so far as to become boring.  A classic, a trend setter, and a great film all round",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

This movie is timeless...,"I love this movie and have seen it more times than I care to admit. It is a movie that one could easily interchange Billy Crystal with Cary Grant and Meg Ryan with Kate Hepburn, change from color to black & white and it wouldn't skip a beat. And no, I don't think these modern actors compare with the past ones, it is the classiness, wit and dialogue of this movie that is the comparison.This movie just feels like home to me for some reason. Billy Crystal did a superb job in this flick as a chauvinistic jerk-love me I'm really funny type of guy and Meg Ryan did very well playing the naive-wait a minute I'll kick your butt with my girl power/or wait, I'm a scared little girl part. Meg did this film right at the perfect moment in not only her career, but the age she was when she did it.....I bring up age because she was right at that point of understanding the world, but still having a distinct sweetness in spite of it.....now she seems like an angry short guy with a really cute nose. Billy did this film right at the point when he understood how to act and hits his part perfect.....seems like an odd pairing these two, but it actually worked perfect. Rob Schneider was perfect directing this film in he put in his genius at the right places and let the actors be themselves in other parts.....Nora Ephron wrote this as well as ""Sleepless In Seattle"" & ""You've Got Mail"" which are both accommodating movies indeed, but When Harry Met Sally is ""The Matrix"" and the other two are .... you get what I mean.Anyhow, you do not have to be a fan of Meg or Billy or Schneider or Nora to even like this movie.....it's the kind of movie that taps you on the shoulder when you're in a daze thinking and makes you feel warm and fuzzy from the touch.Oh, and one other thing.....there are stories told by much older couples about how they met injected throughout the movie that are priceless little gems. Oh, and one more thing......watch for President Gerald Fords' son in the movie as just a side tidbit....hint: he used to be friends with Billys' character. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of the best rom-com-drams,"I think what makes this movie so special is that everyone can relate to this story. It tells that classic story of long time friends who cant seem to accept each other with other people but don't have the guts to make a move on each other. You can tell from the first scene that Harry and Sally both feel some romantic tension between them. Obviously at first they each want different things with a partner. This is shown by their disagreement with the end of Casablanca. I thought that was a clever way of setting up the ending. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have great chemistry throughout. Which is especially impressive because of how many different meetings they have together. Whats a good romance without a few tear jerker moments? Well this movie definitely has a few, as it most likely one of the top love stories in cinematic history.I really liked that they had their friends set up, and then ended up helping get them married. To me that shows the hope for Harry and Sally in the second half of the movie. For some reason Harry and Sally cant accept being together, even though in the first scene Harry states that men and women can never be friends. Rob Reiner directs each character with flaws so that we aren't finding ourselves only rooting for one side. They try to date other people but you can tell that each time, tension rises and all result in break ups.I think my only complaint for the movie would be that it seems like in movies when a fallout in a relationship happens, its always the man who gives in and ends up trying to resolve the situation. They portray the women to be the stubborn ones and wait until the man calls her. Even if thats what happens I would like to see a refreshing take on that. But in a romantic movie you want the ending to be emotionally moving, and this one delivers. Their final scene together is heartwarming and overall pleasing. You really feel you went on this ride with this couple for a few hours so when you get an ending that hits, its extra satisfying.+Billy Crystals rants on relationships+relatable for everyone+an ending that actually delivers-vague male stereotypes9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If it were any more true-to-life, it'd be a documentary","This happens to be my favorite movie of all time.  It is SO realistic. Almost everyone has been in the position of Harry and Sally at one time or another, and it's true--men and women CAN'T be friends.  No matter what anyone says, ""the sex thing always gets in the way"".  This movie probably has more quotable lines than any other.  It is just delightful and far above all the other romantic comedies that have come out since it debuted. The whole cast is just great. Carrie Fisher is hilarious!

Ryan's character was stubborn yet vulnerable, which she communicated quite well. Crystal's comedic timing was pure genius. Ryan and Crystal's on-screen chemistry is the stuff that romantic comedies are made of. This film sparked a series of romantic comedies that have a lasting quality in the late 80's and early 90's(i.e.- Sleepless in Seattle etc.).

When harry Met Sally- Highly Recommended!!,"Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies""When Harry Met Sally..."" is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like ""that's really sweet"". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women.The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!!My Rating - 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Comment Over Friendship,"I watched the movie 5 years after it was released, and I'm glad that I had. I wouldn't have understood a thing I watched it back in my childhood. I can't say that I totally understood it until my 20's since it's a critique for the relations between genders. Lots of analysis's are being made throughout the movie which are pretty accurate for both sides. Funny thing is that there really is no such thing like friendship after sex -or even after breaking up-. Meg Ryan and -especially- Billy Crystal are at the peak of their performances during the movie, and I must say Meg is a little overpowered by Billy's style and talent. Meg keeps a flat line of act but it would be wrong to say that she effected the film in a negative manner. Quite the contrary actually. And the lenses used during the shots, takes the movie one step higher than its competitors. The autumn shots actually shot me more than the movie itself. Totally romance and this movie is one of the best romantic comedy ever shot!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quality,"It now looks pretty old hat, simply because we've now suffered an overdose of romcoms, all cast in the same mould (actually, all cast with the same cast, come to think of it). But this is the first and best of its kind by miles.Marrying Ephron's script with Reiner's light direction is where the film scores over its imitators, along with having Crystal and Ryan appear fresh and untainted by later failures. Ephron clearly used up all her best jokes here and in the first half of Sleepless in Seattle. WHMS really does have a smart line every minute, and not all of them from Crystal (""You made a woman miaow?"").Whether the movie's assertion that men and women can't be friends is outside the scope of this criticism, though the ending suggests otherwise. And while using 'Auld Lang Syne' to underscore the climax stinks of imitation (Waterloo Bridge, anyone?) it still makes me cry every time.On the down side, this film has a lot to answer for. It gave rise to a stream of soppy joke-free 'comedies', all set in a large American city, with an easy listening soundtrack, a strong yet vulnerable male hero, a sassy yet vulnerable female hero, a couple of mad friends and a cameo from a well-known director (usually Reiner himself). Accept no substitutes - this is the 10 out of 10 original.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clever and witty romantic comedy,"This really is a enjoyable witty romantic comedy, from the dialogue to the direction it's all very witty and fun to watch the characters exchange dialogue with each other. This movie starts off with a good amount of impact and for the most part it keeps the impact all the way through it. The relationship this time in this romantic comedy is about two friends one guy and one girl building a relationship by teaching each other about relationship. One from guy's point of view the other from a girl's point of view and it's mostly witty and entertaining to watch these two biker and argue in a mostly friendly manner. Harry Burns(Billy Crystal) just didn't seem like a good match with the beautiful Sally Albright(Meg Ryan) but the chemistry is believable and good to the point it's all mostly passable. Plus it just proves that it's not about all looks when it comes to women. Billy Crystal played the obnoxious and yet likable character really well. The comic relief is also clever and it's a breath of fresh air, it can be enjoyed by almost anyone and has aspects of it that can be discussed with friends after it's finished. Highly recommend this to almost anyone, especially for those that like romantic comedies.8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, serious- Wonderful !","This is easily the best romantic comedy of the last 50 years.  The performances by Ryan and Crystal are the best work they have ever done. Fantastically written by Nora Ephron, and brilliantly directed by Rob Reiner, this film is something that every man and every woman must see.  It attacks an age old dilemma- Can friends become more than friends?  Before marriage, most people have friends that they are secretly, or not so secretly, in love with.  WHMS explores the idea of friends taking a relationship to the next level.With supporting roles from Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, and a soundtrack from Harry Connick, Jr. that could not be better, this is a movie ranks in the top 10 in the JB movie file, among films like ""The Godfather"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  Do not miss this picture.It is- all a once- a great comedy, a fantastic date movie, a terrific 'chick flick', a good movie to cry with and a great movie to laugh with.  This is one of the few films that has it all.  You will find yourself loving and hating and caring about all the characters.  There are scenes that rank among the best in film history- Meg Ryan's fake 'O' scene being the most famous.

"depressingly realistic, but too much fuss about marriage","I loved this movie from the start, and even after the sixth time watching it's still great. The main theme of the movie, Harry's point that men and women can't possibly be friends, is bitter and really a problem. Harry and Sally, who at first are little attracted to each other, develop an intense platonic relationship, but when finally ""the sex part gets in the way"", all seems lost at first.There's one thing that I dislike much about this movie as well as about other stories that tackle the same topic: it's that marriage is depicted as the summit of love. The interludes with couples telling the stories of their relationships and how long they've been married already could be meant ironically since love doesn't always play a great role, but altogether the movie seems to hold that when two people love each other there's only one more thing to be done: get married; instead of just being happy to have found each other and to fit perfectly together.In a way the movie plot both supports Harry's theory and provides a way out: keep away from the other sex, or if you can't, marry the person of your interest. ouarg!But nevertheless: for all its absolutely great dialogues (Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal play their parts very well) it's really worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are wonderful and a pleasure to watch, as they lead a terrific cast including a great performance by Bruno Kirby, who plays Crystal's best friend. Even though the story focuses on a heterosexual couple, its main question can apply to any friendship. It's a light and fun popcorn flick worth watching with your significant other.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Worth a watch, as anticipated","Well worth a watch, as anticipated.'When Harry Met Sally...' is one of those films that I've heard a tonne about but without finding out anything tangible about the plot, the only thing in that regard that I knew was the Katz's Delicatessen location - not even the full scene, just the famous quote (out of context) from Estelle Reiner. Of course as a romcom drama you know mostly what you're gonna get, but this does have more to it in fairness; big fan of the time jumps, e.g.Billy Crystal is great value throughout, amusing and even touching at moments. Same goes for Meg Ryan, naturally, who I know of only by name; I never remember her face for some odd reason. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, meanwhile, make for strong supports to the two leads.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Can men and women be friends?,"I love this movie, and could go about it forever, but to break it down, this film goes through the years showing us the on-off friendship with Harry and Sally. The script is fantastic with so many quotes I can't start to begin. One that always springs to mind 'There's a man staring at you in personal growth' This film had me riveted from beginning to end.

A Smart and Sexy Love Story with a Winning Screenplay...,"Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan shine in the title roles of the 1989 comedy WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...an episodic romantic comedy that follows two lonely souls from a road trip after college graduation over a 10-15 year period where they actually become friends first instead of lovers, even though Harry believes men and women can't be just friends. After their initial parting after the road trip, Harry and Sally ""meet cute"" a couple of times and become friends who see each other through jobs and other relationships. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher lend strong support as their best friends but the real star of this film is the outstanding screenplay by Nora Ephron. The rapid fire dialogue and funny exchanges between Crystal and Ryan seem to roll of their tongues with such ease and I'm sure director Rob Reiner and Crystal had input in what finally ended up on the screen, script wise. All I know was, after seeing the film for the first time, I said to myself, ""This movie should definitely get an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay."" And it did. Sadly, it did not win, but I have found WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...to be one of my favorites...it's part of my collection and I can watch it a million times. How can you get tired of Meg's fake orgasm in the sandwich shop or the game of charades (Baby Fish Mouth!), or Billy and Meg singing ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top"" or the four way telephone scene when Harry and Sally call Jess and Marie?

Meg Ryan has never been better than she is in this and proves that she is a talented comedy actress. Support from Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher is also excellent.

The map of the human heart...,"Love doesn't come in a minute,Sometimes it doesn't come at allI only know that when I'm in itIt isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all.These words, from Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs', seem to me to be a very accurate description of the theme of 'When Harry Met Sally'. This iconic romantic comedy, written by Nora Ephron, is, for me, one of the most insightful comments on the place of love in the post-60s world. It charts the way that acquaintance can turn into friendship and then into love.Harry (Billy Crystal) encounters Sally (Meg Ryan) on a long car journey during which they both seem to decide that the other is obnoxious in one way or another. Their path to love is funny, totally engaging and ultimately unforgettable.One of the greatest - no THE greatest - characteristic of the cinema is its ability to access our deepest emotions. How many times do we weep cathartically in our normal lives - most of us, not many. Yet there are dozens of films that induce just this kind of reaction. How many times do we laugh so much that we ache - very rarely outside a cinema, but often within. How many times are we so scared that we cannot move - almost never in life, but often in the cinema. And these emotions cannot be accessed in the same way through any other art.And there are laughs and tears galore in 'When Harry Met Sally'. Why? Because we really *care* for these kooky characters, and the love that they find has a kind of purity that our loves struggle to emulate.For some people (and I feel sorry for them) films that induce a warm feeling of pleasure are sentimental and worthless. They should avoid this film as it might undermine their sterile cynicism. But if you trust your emotions and regard them as your greatest asset, 'When Harry Met Sally' will be one of the most worthwhile films of the modern era.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Best Romantic Comedy Of All Time,"When I started watching this movie for the first time, I had no expectations at all. After watching the first ten minutes of the movie, I was hooked - like never before.The movie delivers a story about a friendship that through the years grows into something else. Sounds like your typical Rom Com - it isn't. The reason this movie rises above all others is simple. It has the full package. The cast is perfect, the dialogue is funny and razor sharp, the plot is engaging, smart and believable, and it just offers a fresh and endearing story of love.The dialogue is so sharp and the context of the conversations so engaging, it really gets your attention. The movie debates if men and women can have a friendship without any sexual attention from one side or the other. And it really makes you think about it, and that to me is one of the rare treats this film alone offers.When it comes to acting, it is superb. Meg Ryan is perfect as uptight yet endearing young woman and Billy Crystal is beyond words as a witty and cynical man that he in the movie is. He outshines your typical handsome male lead any day. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby are great in supporting roles.Over all this is the most enjoyable movie you ever come across, especially if romantic movies are your cup of coffee(I don't like tea).

And we just wish we met someone who would come to us ""because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.""

Different in all parts, they're trying to find the love of their life, looking for something they already had, without knowing it.

Respect each other,"It's my first time to see the movie and I like it very much. When Harry first met Sally, Harry was attracted by Sally. However, Sally did not like him and even hated him. For such a relationship, or maybe no relationship built between them, you can't imagine they can became lover and eventually getting married. The story was very romantic. When they were friends, they talked everything, they shared, they accepted, understood and respected each other. I think it's very important for creating a harmonize relationship.

Meg Ryan looks just so beautiful. I will say its probably one of the roles people forget Carry fisher did, she might not have been lead but she does a good performance and its not Star Wars.Credit finally should be given to the Director Rob Reiner for putting together such a classic.

Romantic,"Acting captivated me from the first shots. Sally is played by Meg Ryan, the role of Harry is played by Billy Crystal. Meg Ryan looks magical, she has long hair, curled in the fashion of those years. Strict, correct, having her own opinion about everything. Harry is a boring, narcissistic middle-aged man in search of pleasure. Harry's cynicism threw Sally into a quiet horror. It is difficult for her, an overly correct, well-mannered girl, to stay within her perception of the world, he forced her to look at the reasons why men act one way or another in a different way.I love in Meg Ryan her ability to remain an actress, forgetting about how she looks in moments of sadness. As, by the way, in moments of joy. One of the most powerful episodes is Sally exposing most women in the most intimate moments.Interviews of mature couples in front of the camera are expertly woven into the outline of the characters' life stories. It looks very touching and cute. The glances of the spouses with each other, their excitement, the ability to speak sincerely about their feelings cause a reverent attitude to the great feeling that the couple has preserved and carried through their life together. I love these episodes as much as the movie itself.",,Anonymous,Romance
when harry met sally they made a timeless classic,"One of the greater things about this movie is the reality it, at the very least aspires to.  Harry, the leading male is based in no small part on Director Reiner while writer Ephron gives basis for Sally.  Of course, Woody Allen is the king of the genre, but he has one flaw: his relationships are his relationships and while memorable and fun to experience are still his to call his own.  The wonder of When Harry met Sally, besides how wonderful it is, is how generic it is. This could have been any man, any woman. The problems are universal. It was a cornerstone and remains one of the greatest bibles to the relationship, conquering issues and questions no greater than ""can a man and woman just be friends,"" and ""what do we want"" both as humans and individual men and women; a movie which changed the way men and women think, act, and date, to this day. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the perfect pair with chemistry, such chemisry, watching them act is treat enough. But the movie takes the cake and it is sweet. The mixings of Reiner and Academy Award Nominated Ephron cook up a timeless classic. You'll laugh, you may cry, you'll think, hopefully learn something, and laugh again. A-",,Anonymous,Romance

Great movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I think it beautifully addressed the struggles with regards to friendship between a man and a woman.  Can they in fact simply be friends?  This movie is an example of how that could in fact work, but also serves to explain why it could not.I thought the acting in general was okay.  I was not overly impressed with either of the two.  Ryan came of as being sort of an over-actor, with her cute nose-up-in-the-air appeal.  And Crystal just always seems like he is saying too much.  I don't ever see a real change in the characters he plays in each movie.I did, however, appreciate the scenes with the older couples sharing their experiences.  I thought it was sweet and humorous.  These particular scenes fit in well with the rest of the movie.All in all, I thought the movie was entertaining.  I especially enjoyed the end when Crystals character (Harry) explained wanting to begin the rest of his life that day.  The quote was amazing...I just wish I could remember it right now.",,Anonymous,Romance

It is cute, and funny, and clever, and yet its not a complete chick flick. Now, if you're a guy, don't get the guys together and watch this one. But if you're with a girl, or by yourself, this is an excellent choice.I would give more, but everything I could say has already been said.

Not a typical romantic comedy.,"Dylan Shaver - R000119783 Philosophy 201 - Assignment #3Headline: They need to make more films like thisWhen Harry Met Sally Directed by Rob Reiner Starring: Billy Crystal,Meg RyanI am not genetically predisposed to romantic comedies.  I typically find them to be generic, rote and formulaic.  I don't usually have the patience for the same-old same- old boy meets girl, gets, loses, re-gets girl storyline.  So I was surprised when I found myself really enjoy When Harry Met Sally.Since I've been old enough to remember or understand, the romantic comedies I've seen have all been fairly slapstick.  I think the first one I actually paid money to see was Shakespeare in Love, which (while it did win an academy award) I found to be rather contrived and predictable.  Much later came There's Something About Mary where we find Ben Stiller in the most ridiculous and obscure of unfortunate situations.In either case, and across the genre, these films are funny and often sentimental but rarely can Joe Public identify with the main characters.  While certain aspects of the plot or character development may seem somewhat similar, much of the films' humor relies on fantastical situations.By contrast, When Harry Met Sally actually revolved around fairly commonplace situations.  I feel like I could know couples who have gone through the same sort of relationship roller-coaster.Writer Nora Ephron does an excellent job capturing the secret and silent longing felt between the two main characters.  Crystal and Ryan (who play Harry and Sally, respectively) capture the various neuroses that develop between good friends of different sexes.Scenes of the film are separated by asides, seemingly real couples in their old age explaining how they met. This contributes more to surprisingly human feel to what is otherwise large-scale Hollywood production.",,Anonymous,Romance
Uplifting Romantic Comedy For Men AND Women.,"This film features two heavyweights in the comedy genre. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are great together.  Whether or not a film goer appreciates romantic comedy, this one is appealing across the board.We follow Harry and Sally from their college years into their early thirties.  They are good friends, and of course, as one would guess, the question is whether or not a man and woman can be friends. Harry goes through life getting one conquest after another, while Sally is much more conservative and cautious in her relationships.  And as the two go on, they see others fall in love and the two are often left in the dust looking at each other.  Meg is her usual adorable, perky self, and Crystal plays his character very witty and fast.   The characters and story are heartwarming and believable.  It is a happy story that is actually plausible and not a sappy destiny type film. Rob Reiner began a tradition here, using 'standards' for the film's  music. Tracks such as 'It Had To Be You' and 'Let's Call The Whole Thing Off' were brought out for a new generation. Harry Connick Jr. was thrust into the mainstream because of this film, having sung several of the tracks. Director commentary on the DVD version is great and informative.This film is very enjoyable and well made. In the genre of Romantic Comedy, I would safely say this is the best I have seen.  A great rainy day love story that is always uplifting.",,Anonymous,Romance
