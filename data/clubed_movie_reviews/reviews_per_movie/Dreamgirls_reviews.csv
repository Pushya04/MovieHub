An undemanding and thoroughly enjoyable date movie,"A dream date-movie, Dreamgirls offers to fulfil your fantasies and, if this is the type of movie you dream about, maybe it will.A film version based on a stage musical's original book, Dreamgirls scales the octaves of anonymity to eminence for an African-American girl group amid 1960s racial turmoil.Just looking at the publicity photos may have persuaded you that Dreamgirls is a sight for sore eyes. Lavish sets and costumes, fabulous choreography, and the lighting and razzamatazz associated with the best stage musicals, all exploding onto the big screen with a grandeur that can banish thoughts of anything else. Watch it as you melt into the arms of your lover. Two very powerful lead singers (Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson) to amaze you with their vocal ranges, and the sort of blockbuster publicity that makes going to see it almost an obligatory cultural event.Dreamgirls is intense, emotion-laden eye-candy, but will it satisfy your every wish? Curtis Taylor Jr (Jamie Foxx) is a car salesman bursting to get into the music business as a forward-looking manager at a time when the industry is about to change. At a local talent show, he hears the Dreamettes - young, full of ability, but not getting the breaks. He gets them a deal as backing singers for James 'Thunder' Early. Thunder's blend of soul and rock 'n' roll is at its height, but times are a-changin' and soon the girls are re-launched as The Dreams - at the same time as Thunder's career fades. A few jealousies and heave-hoes later, and they rocket to success.Dreamgirls relies on well-established techniques seen in MTV and director-writer Condon's earlier success, Chicago, to ratchet up emotional intensity. A song will start low key in an ordinary setting and modest musical backing, and then segue visually through more extravagant sets until it reaches an emotional climax with full orchestra and bright lights. At times it feels like watching a stage show. The devices are effective but formulaic to the point of being hackneyed. Many of the songs also feel like standard written-for-Broadway numbers, contorted lyrics being used to tell the story and the emotions that the players expect us to share.The story has little substance beyond the songs (and the posturing that goes with them), but this matters little if you want to be entertained in a way that demands no long/deep attention span, or if you want to nip out for more popcorn, or even turn away for a canoodle until the volume tells you to come up for air. The inclusion of many set stage productions as the girl-group tours enables ample opportunity for show-stopping dance sequences, fabulous lighting and costumes to die for.The film showcases two discoveries: one is that Eddie Murphy can work outside of comedy. The other is the remarkable talent of Jennifer Hudson (a competitor from the TV singing contest, American Idol) who demonstrates that she can stop you in your tracks as an actor as well as a singer.But having Hudson and Beyonce together has its problems as well as benefits. Both are remarkable singing divas. This has some relevance to the story since there is a certain rivalry between their characters, but in a movie about a girl-band that is meant to evoke images of groups like the Supremes, they are vocally two divas too many. The large proportion of songs show off their incredible individual vocal talents - but as leads rather than as harmonies. At times, it is maybe like having two high-intensity Aretha Franklins advertising the Dolby-Digital sound dynamics rather than having Ronettes, Stylistics or Supremes soothe the eardrums. The film is about a girl group, yet focuses almost entirely on its two strongest singers. In the absence of a story with depth, characters with substance, or a worthier tribute to an era that had more originality than this big budget production, I longed for a gentle, all-girl ballad.Dreamgirls contains all the talent that money can buy and more. It has more Academy nominations in its year than any other movie, but none of them in the major categories. So sad, but it lacks true greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer's Show!,"You have to put this movie into perspective! I enjoyed it but it was not until later that I realized that it was not that good! It entertains and that is about it! Well some people may say what more do you expect! Well I suppose I wanted the film to be more than it really is. Then again I also wanted the score to be bigger and better than what it was! The story line is OK and does refer to the Supremes story as we all know... However, the music apart from the ""BIG"" number is boring. I bought the CD and played it twice and got bored! I immediately listen to Wicked and what a major difference! Now that is what you call a great score! The greatest thing about this movie is Jennifer Hudson! She is perfect for the part and she does a great job with her acting. Also she gives a great performance of a really great song. Everyone knows she was under pressure to reach the levels of Jennifer Holiday and I think she did a good job. However, its was her acting ability that pulled it off.The other star of this show was Eddie Murphy. He was quite outstanding in this film and his role was almost believable. The problem he had was that he was not given enough time to develop the role...The other huge gap in this film was the relationship that was supposed to exist between Foxx and Hudson. Where was it? I think they could have cut the terrible slushy scenes with Foxx and Knowles and concentrated on the relationship with the other two. Now that would have made the film much more interesting.Ah but we have to have our eye candy Beyonce to sell the film. What a pity any time was spent on her as I must be the only person around who is not bothered if I never saw her again! However, I am certainly going to follow the career of the brilliant Jennifer Hudson! You go girl!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"The year's big ""if""","It's a crowd-pleaser all right, and I usually object to those. But I have to say, this member of the crowd was rather pleased with the film. It's nothing deep, I'll say right off the bat. It's no cinematic masterpiece that will be a beacon for films to come. What it is, however, is an absolute ball. It's the only film I think I've ever seen that really captures the experience of seeing a great musical in the theater. It's fun, it's rousing, and it just made me feel good. The music is outstanding and surprisingly comes off as stuff that might really have been recorded during the eras depicted, with maybe just the right tinge of Broadway to them. The vocal performances are just outstanding. Of course by now everyone knows the standout is Jennifer Hudson, who will be unstoppable at the Oscars this year. Her acting is quite good, but she'll win it for the singing. I would also be perfectly happy to see Eddie Murphy take home a statuette. He's excellent in both comedic and dramatic moments. Much of the rest of the cast is good, too, including Beyoncé Knowles and Anika Noni Rose. The story is of course based on that of the Supremes, and in that way, I felt a little Susan Alexander Kane / Marion Davies situation going on with Deena Jones / Diana Ross. While the Dreams are supposed to be only like the Supremes, the film kind of does imply that Ross was not an extremely talented singer, which is of course patently false. Anyway, small quibble. No, Dreamgirls is no masterpiece, but I like it about as much as I liked Chicago, probably a tad more, and I wouldn't be too ticked off if the Academy went with it for Best Picture. I do prefer it slightly to The Departed. I just don't think Scorsese's fourth best movie about organized crime should be crowned. Definitely recommended, as long as you know what you're getting into.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Overrated,"After all the nominations and wins, my wife and I finally saw this -- I love this era of soul music, so i was really excited about the music. For the most part the music was good...some overblown American Idol theatrics and shrieking instead of singing, but overall good. I was also excited to see the acting...and in the end I wasn't that impressed. Jennifer Hudson seems to be everyones favorite this year, but I didn't think she had to do to much acting...it was good to see a newcomer, so confident in a role -- but in regards to actual nominations, this is probably the last you'll see of her. Eddie Murphy was good in his very small role, I wish that he was given more dialog or more story...if he wins the Oscar, I guess it's the Academy giving him an award for the bulk of his work. But, Hudson clearly shouldn't win...I hope the Academy looks to the Babel nominees, who had to act, not make music videos with emotion! Costumes and make-up were great, Beyonce's role shadowed her real life...in the sense, beautiful woman, good in various forms, singing, dancing, acting...a great product. Not actual a standout in any of them. In the end OK movie, overrated....definitely.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Pfft! I can see why it wasn't nominated for best picture,"I was excited about seeing Dreamgirls, especially after seeing the Oscar nods it got. But I still wasn't too sure about Jennifer Hudson's win, after all, before I saw this film, I saw Babel, and the Hispanic actress who was nominated I felt totally deserved the award. But how can you judge before seeing what Jennifer Hudson's raved about performance was all about. Now I have to start off with that actually this was a good film, but you know what? It was average, nothing thrilling or original came out of it. It's your typical rise and fall story that had nothing special or had no spark. Jennifer's performance was good for a first time, but I still wasn't too thrown over it. The story is just so abused and too used by so many writers.Curtis is looking for a backup group for his famous singer, James Early. He finds the Dreamettes, three beautiful and strong black women, he also becomes involved with one of them. Slowly they rise to the top, but Effie, the girl is involved with is not exactly ""thin"" or that ""appealing"" to a younger crowd, so with her girlfriends in the group, her brother, and her new boyfriend, Curtis, they vote her out of the group and the Dreamettes become huge, but the joke is on Curtis when Effie gets a second chance.The performances were the key that got raved about most in the film, now I have to say that they were good, but honestly, it was nothing beyond good. I don't have anything against Jennifer Hudson, but I am very upset with all the publicity she is getting now for one film and an Oscar that I believe doesn't belong to her, but I know there are some that wouldn't agree with me. Eddie didn't thrill me either, I've actually seen him in better, but I have to admit the only performance I was actually, and surprisingly, impressed with was Beyonce Knowles, she has come a long way. So, I'm not sure if I would recommend this film, if you wanna watch it, go ahead, but don't expect too much.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Michael Jackson Spits,"You have only two first choices in making a movie musical; you can preserve its stage nature, or decide at the first to make a movie, something that has a cinematic sense. I like musical presentation and all; I like theater and the contact of performance. Its all fine, but what really transports me is what I think of as opera in the modern sense. Its that multiple delivery of sense, primarily through sweeping enveloping visual grammar, supplemented by coordinated threads: text, narrative, music, emotional and intellectual.""Moulin Rouge"" is my gold standard, born as a child of film, deeply reflexive. Chicago was less coherent  some of its cinematic collage really was just chop, but even then they eye needs rhythm and ""Chicago"" delivered. That film also had something this has only in certain places: sweat if not blood. We knew that Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are uninteresting people, and the songs manufactured emotionally (as opposed to say, blues songs from someone blue). But we saw them work their guts out.This is an odd, odd thing musically. Start with genuine R&B, sung in Detroit basements and school auditoriums. Now transform that for the market, initially black showgoers. Now transform it again for a similar record-buying public. Again for white recordbuyers (where, incidentally I found myself in the late sixties), and then again for TeeVee watchers (and with added glamor, Las Vegas).Let that steep for fifteen years, all becoming a joke, then transform it again for the Broadway stage. By this time, any performance related to this collection of genres cannot be genuine in any way, merely a commentary. The performers may be black, but its as far removed from what it pretends to be as a scene in this film depicts: a white teen along the lines of Johnny Vee covering a black song. Its not a matter of how good the singer is, even the earnest Hudson who gets the applause here. Its a matter of market forces: art is brought to us by market forces and those forces bend, filter, bleach.Now take that stage show, based on a story about just this: how mass music MUST be untrue  take that stage musical and transform it one more time, and you'll have this. That's six generations from where this music meant something to what it is before it hits our ears. The only thing that can justify this is the full bore experience.The stage show delivered it in spades, because it used extraordinary stagecraft. It was to the stage musical what ""Moulin Rouge"" was to the film musical: the vocabulary stretched to its most colorful (read: moving) excess. Where's that excess here? There are three (three?) moments where a rehearsal sweeps around and you find yourself on stage. Once done well would have been enough, these aren't.One character in this needs to be the white space, the root of the thing in terms of values. Maybe it could have been the avuncular manager (Glover) or the silent Dad, or the child. But no one is given the nail. One song at least needs to be performed as genuine. Yes, Hudson's number brings down the house. But it is so overproduced and overstaged its clear it is merely  dare I say it?  a show by a woman trying hard to have a career, not a woman who actually lives in her song.At least ""Hustle and Flow"" was obviously dishonest.Oh well. Seeing Eddie Murphy do James Brown just before the man is buried meant something to me. Its an homage of sorts.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly campy!,"After all the wonderful things I heard about this movie (the Golden Globes nods, the Oscar buzz) and the fact I'm an American Idol fan as well as a fan of Beyonce, I really wanted to like this movie, but by the time the closing credits rolled I found myself laughing with the rest of the audience about the sheer campiness of this flick. The characters were so clichéd and everything so melodramatic that I can't believe reviews praising this film for its fine acting and originality. By the end it was so over the top that at least the crowd I was with found it hard to take anything seriously. Jennifer Hudson is, of course, the stand out role and she really gives a show-stopping performance at one point that had the audience applauding, but it was her voice that received this reaction. Eddie Murphy was probably the next most interesting character, but nearly everyone else was considered laughable. Beyonce is a dead-ringer for Diana Ross by the end and the girl can sing, but if this is supposed to be Academy Award worthy acting then I must say she did a much better performance in Austin Power's Goldmember.All and all the most overrated movie of the year, I'd wait for it on DVD before paying to see it in the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A great American musical....,"Screened overnite in Australia for critics and industry.Ten minutes into director Bill Condon's adaptation of the hit musical, I whispered to my friend ""There's no way the film can go at this pace for two hours!"" Because up to that point, we had been utterly dazzled by breathtaking staging, impassioned performances and a display of film-making craftsmanship in all its forms (direction, editing, design) that had the packed audience stunned.Well, two hours later, I'd been proved wrong. Condon has created a vivid, emotional spectacle that will dominate the 06/07 Oscar nominations. Dreamgirls is one of the five best movie musicals ever made.There is really nothing new about the storyline - smalltown singers make it big and ride the roller-coaster of fame. But thats what works so well for the film - the great cinematic clichés are embraced and played to the hilt by a creative team, both behind and in front of the camera, that knows what makes a great Hollywood musical.There's not one weak link in the cast. Condon's camera is in love with Beyonce Knowles and she handles the journey from the innocence of the groups early years to the staggering success and fortune of the group at its peak with surprising range. While most singer/actress attempts are failures (Madonna, Whitney, Britney, k.d. lang), Beyonce proves to have genuine talent.Jamie Foxx centres and grounds the film in a less-flashy role but one that is crucial to the films credibility.But there are two standouts. Eddie Murphy as fading star Early has never done better work. And Jennifer Hudson delivers an absolute tour-de-force performance in a role that sees her dominate every scene she is in. Her belting solo number was applauded by the audience (a rare enough occurrence during an industry screening but a moment that was repeated a few times thru the film). Hudson is a lock for the supporting actress Oscar, even this far from the ceremony.Dreamgirls is a better movie in every way than recent award winning musicals Chicago and Moulin Rouge (both of which I am a huge fan). It is a film that tells a classic rags-to-riches story utilising great cinematic technique and bravado. 2006 has offered up some great movie-going experiences for me (Thank You For Smoking, Children Of Men, V For Vendetta, Little Miss Sunshine); for the sheer cinematic thrill it provides, however, Dreamgirls proves to be the best two hours I've spent in a cinema this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Rather hollow musical melodrama,"A trio of glitzy high-wigged divas are taken under by the slick management of Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), gets assigned as backup singers from James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy) and later set free as leads. Owing to her beautiful looks, Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) is deemed more bankable than the ""voice"", Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) and assumes the leading position of the group accordingly, stirring up bitter rivalry in the trio and its behind-the-scenes management.We follow our dreamgirls from age 16 when they are naive pop-stars on the rise to age 26 and over when they are washed-up overpriced divas arguing at Christmas, torn apart by intrigue, romance and prestige. As ""Dreamgirls"" makes the smooth transition from Motown blues to 70's soul to disco, the film makes a transition from charming to decent to tiresome. In short, it is frightfully unwise to stretch a light-hearted glammy musical over 2 hours of screen-time as the amount of likable characters and interesting set-ups wears increasingly thin.Longevity is of course not its chief crux  its characters are. Although Jennifer Hudson is rigorously being lobbied for as 'supporting actress' by studios (and a wise political move it is to ensure accolades), she inhabits something of a lead role in ""Dreamgirls"", perhaps not in direct screen-time (Beyoncé should be crowned the winner here) but in heart and soul. The problem with the character of Effie is that she is an unlikeable fame-hungry diva who spits sass like bullet-fire if she does not get the coveted spotlight. The only likable thing about her emerges distantly over time  the fact that she didn't sell out like the rest. Wow, quite an accomplishment.In spite of this, it should not be a gross overstatement to say that the success of ""Dreamgirls"" rests squarely on the shoulders of Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy is fun, but ultimately forgettable and sparse in presence. Beyoncé is emotionally transparent in her performance, but not not particularly subtle. Jamie Foxx acts with cruel, success-driven intensity, but he is at the mercy of an underwritten character. In short, neither the the acting nor the wide montage of characters are anything to write home about.Onto direction and editing, I must say I was rather impressed by both efforts. Director Bill Condon sews the film together with assured determination, even if it becomes too diluted toward the grand finale. The editing, which is not something I typically bring up or even notice, is beautifully inventive with a narrative structure that seamlessly intercuts future events/scenes in current scenes, such as one of the early sing-and-dancer numbers with James Thunder paralleled by the upcoming scene on the tour bus. I have seen this in films before (""Don't Look Now"", 1973) but it is especially apt in Dreamgirls as the glittery trio cannot quite keep up with their own newfound success.A source of annoyance with the aforementioned song numbers nevertheless becomes apparent. When the musical acts and drama are separated the result is credible, engaging and beautiful. When they are melted together in melodramatic singing showdowns, I shudder. But then, I suppose this is the ""musical"" part of the film. Although there are quite a few goosebumps-inducing sparkly moments on stage in a thick glossy coat of glamour, all the glitz soon becomes nauseating and the musical performances both unremarkable and indistinguishable. The latter is also true for ""Dreamgirls"" as a whole unless paint-by-numbers musicals are your thing.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
What WERE they thinking?,"Yes there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour in, the characters who, until this point, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further in, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of sung-through dialog, then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things, such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used, is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the film is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing out loud. This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Belting Up The Old Story,"The legendary Broadway musical hit the screen, resurrecting the thrill of the original. That, in itself, is a miracle. I suspect that the miracle worker is Bill Condon. The story is told as if it revealed something we've never seen before and his winning innocence triumphs. The casting of Eddie Murphy was a stroke of genius. He unfolds a new inedited face and I predict a new career. The predictability of the tale becomes rewarding rather than annoying and I was surprised and moved all the way through. Jammie Foxx's unsympathetic turn manages to deliver a punch of humanity. Byonce Knowles, Danny Glover and the rest of the cast are a perfect foil for Jennifer Hudson's Cinderella Story. Bravo Mr Condon!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Motown sliced too thin,"Dreamgirls is a filmed musical that by reports stays close to its Broadway source. It provides glitzy entertainment, with a tale of intrigue and manipulation and glamorous song performances featuring increasingly chic hairstyles and slimmer singers, as the central black girl song group based on the Supremes loses its more soulful, plumper member, Effie (American Idol's Jennifer Hudson) along with its bad wigs and moves on to superstardom. Behind them is a promoter who himself achieves mega-bucks status and adopts hipper hairstyles, but not without bending a lot of rules and using a lot of people.It may seem unsporting to say so, but this movie, despite its glitter and entertainment value, leaves an empty feeling. There are major questions about how American musical history gets treated here, for the sake of some fairly unexciting original musical numbers. One basic question is, if Effie was the singer who could move you, how did the group become a hit without her, regardless of the promotion? It's obvious Dremagirls refers to Berry Gordy Jr.'s Motown in its focus on impresario Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx). First this Gordy-surrogate hires a soul singer, James ""Thunder"" Early, persuading a young black girl group, The Dreamettes, to sing backup for him and pushing out the Dreamettes' sedate manager Marty Madison (Danny Glover). Next Taylor promotes the Dreamettes separately and eliminates Effie. He sells out his used car business to buy payola air time for the group's songs.Gordy pushed Florence Ballard out of The Supremes and made the slimmer more homogenized looking Diana Ross the lead singer. But there's an important element missing from the movie: the charisma and magic of Diana Ross. Her stand-in here, Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) just can't come close, so the success of the Dreams (as they're re-christened) without Effie remains a mystery.Berry Gordy was involved in payola and he manipulated his groups. But this story is unfair to Gordy, Motown, and black music. It refers to male singers through a composite of James Brown, Little Richard, et al., represented by Jimmy Early (Eddie Muphy), whose performances are uninvolving mimicry and who dies early (get it) of a drug overdose. Motown's greatest star Michael Jackson gets shrunken to ten seconds of a group mimicking the Jackson Five, not even getting the dancing right and seen only on TV. The many other sensational Motown stars beloved of black and white audiences are forgotten, as is the Disco era, since Diana Ross stand-in Knowles is seen as the only Disco diva in Taylor's stable.Subplots like Effie's affair with Taylor and child by him whom he recognizes later, Early's affair with Dreams member Lorell (Anika Nori Rose), and Deena's attempt to star in a movie as Cleopatra, do nothing to make up for how the plot slights black musical history.Jamie Foxx is uneasy and ill cast as the cruel manipulator, Curtis Taylor. This character gets muddled because as the screenplay makes him more and more evil, Foxx seems to be trying harder and harder to make us like him. Maybe he's trying to show Taylor as more three-dimensional, but the character as written is too cardboard thin for that to work.Sure, Motown groups were packaged, and we don't know how many soul singer' souls were destroyed in the process. But Dreamgirls fails to show how huge Motown was for American culture in general and African American culture in particular in the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties. Gordy's was a big accomplishment, not a narrow con game. What of the ""Motown sound""? There's only one sound here, and it doesn't sound right. The movie makes us long for little clubs with down-dressed performers like Effie as we see her eventually making a partial comeback helped by the faithful Marty Madison. Knowles has one big number, but Hudson soars every time she opens her mouth, even if she can't act. While the big numbers are emotionally empty, the group's composer, Clarance ""C.C."" Brown (Keith Robinson) is moving in his song, ""We'll always be family."" Robinson gives his small role some feeling and intensity.It's hard not to see this as really the story of Effieshe's the only singer we really care about. The audience is electrified by Hudson's farewell song, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" (though it goes on too long and is poorly directed) and can't wait for her to come back on screen. The elaborate production numbers staged with The Dreams are just flash. But the movie doesn't show that Motown performances, with Diana Ross at the center, could be both glitzy and musically exciting, and these forgettable showtunes don't begin to remind us how often songs out of Motown could stay engraved on our hearts and minds forever.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls are anything but!,"First of all, the ads are misleading. This is not a simple rags to riches story drama. This is a big, over the top musical. Lines are often sung instead of spoken, and compared to other musicals of our time, such as Phantom of the Opera, this one unfortunately feels and views as a play; flat and rather amateurish characters and directing made this rather reminiscent of a paltry made-for-TV biography of the Supremes. With a poor semblance of plot, cringe-worthy overacting by all leads at some point and a running time at least a half hour too long, this movie is by far one of the biggest movie disappointments in recent memory. What I will say in praise of this film is that while she's not exactly Oscar-worthy yet; Jennifer Hudson is most definitely one of the best singers that I can recall in recent memory and her performance was the strongest in the film.But what it comes down to is; could I recommend this with a clear conscience?

The pace is slow, terrible character development. The lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone but die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most over rated movie I've seen in my entire life. A complete waist of time and money.

it's about the music - and unfortunately the music sucks,"This is a Broadway musical brought to film, and never rises above that gestalt. That is, if you like the Broadway of its era (and frankly, I don't), you'll like this movie; but if you're looking for a great film, what you have here is basically just an expanded recording of the play.That in itself doesn't sink th film - Chicago was also merely a recording of the Broadway production, really, but I admit the production itself was strong enough to pull that off.But here the problem is unavoidable - great performances, strong characters, interesting story, solid work behind the camera - and the most boring music to spew off a Broadway stage in many a year.If thy were going to do a compressed fantasy history of '60s soul, why did they not get the original music? This stuff is an embarrassing Broadway version of the mediocre soul of the 1970s. Where is the chunk, the drive, the wickedly seductive melodies that made '60s soul popular enough to build legends? At some points in this movie, I expected Spinal Tap to step out and take a bow.With some of the worst songs cut, I could recommend this, but not as it stands now.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

movie musicals for the MTV generation,"After some huge box office flops, (""Mame"", ""Darling Lili"", ""Star"" etc) it began to become clear that the era of the big Hollywood movie musical was over. It took much ingenuity to be able to resuscitate the genre and only on occasion did it work. It would take the likes of a Bob Fosse to create the sensation that was ""Cabaret"" or a Milos Foreman to re-invent ""Hair"". (I personally admire ""Man of La Mancha"" though I know I'm in the minority on this one).Bill Condon's approach to the screen musical in not rooted in the Hollywood tradition but rather in the MTV video clip. It's a valid and legitimate approach since he is aiming at the MTV generation who would have little interest in Broadway musicals adapted for the screen.""Dreamgirls"" has all the hallmarks of the best and worst of MTV. It looks spectacular. It would have to, after all, look and style is everything. Whatever ""Dreamgirls"" may lack it certainly abounds in look and style.The problem is that the MTV viewer is perceived, probably correctly, as having an extremely limited attention span. The scenes in ""Dreamgirls"" are abnormally short. They barely settle in when the camera zaps to yet another brief and perfectly styled scene. The result is that no depth of character is allowed to develop.It will be interesting to see how successful ""Dreamgirls"" proves at the box office. This will determine whether Condon's concept is to be encouraged by the industry. While his concept is valid, one can only hope that it will be one that will become something more than a very extended video clip.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Triumph!!,"What a spectacular movie musical experience! This is one worth waiting in line, if not purchasing advance tickets for. Beautifully realized by writer-director Bill Condon, 'Dreamgirls' brings back thoughts of a few years ago when the movie musical version of 'Chicago' knocked our socks off, and (with the help of the gorgeous 'Moulin Rouge') helped to revive the modern movie musical. The sets, costumes, musical numbers all flow beautifully and make for an incredibly affecting motion picture.As amazing and eye-popping as all of the scene work and musical numbers are, this is, ultimately, a movie rooted in its performances. Jamie Foxx gives further credence to his stature as an incredibly talented musician, and Beyonce Knowles (known for her vocal talents) still manages to impress with her songs and her voice. Not to mention her stunning beauty, as each costume and scene in which she appears seem to top one another in terms of showcasing her incredible beauty. Eddie Murphy blew me away with not only his truly heartfelt performance as Jimmy Early, but his amazing voice and showmanship. What a talent! Anika Noni Rose, who I fell in love with on Broadway in 'Caroline, or Change,' gives her performance as Laurelle soul and a deep, rich vocal styling. But let's face it..we are all going into 'Dreamgirls' wondering if 'American Idol' contestant Jennifer Hudson can pull it off. She has quite a bit to live up to, as Jennifer Holliday's performance as Effie White in the original Broadway production is legendary. Add to that the fact that this is Ms. Hudson movie debut, she must have been feeling a huge weight on her shoulders to do the part, as well as the show, justice. If she isn't able to do anything less than nail the part of Effie, as well as her signature song, 'And I am Telling You,' the whole production, no matter how great the other aspects hold up, runs the risk of crashing loudly. The question on everyone's mind is: Can she do it?Let me just say this... I have never sat in a theater watching a musical where the audience erupted in applause like they would in a Broadway theater after a performer's song. Everyone (and I mean everyone!) was wildly applauding when she struck her last note in 'And I am Telling You.' It was such an intense experience to be a part of. I mean...as I am writing this, I am getting goose bumps. But not only is her singing tremendously effective, but her actual performance is just as good. She brings a vulnerability and an innocence that perhaps would not have come through had the part been given to a more experienced movie performer. Ms. Hudson is nothing short of breathtaking and, even if you are not crazy about the rest of the picture (doubtful), you will almost certainly be amazed by her talent. Just remarkable. This has to be one of the most impressive motion picture debuts in the history of cinema. Even during the closing ""curtain call,"" when Jennifer Hudson's name was shown, there was, again, wild applause. A star has been born!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An all-right movie,"The movie is about a trio of black female soul singers who cross over to the pop charts in the early 1960s, facing their own personal struggles along the way.I read some reviews before I saw the movie. My expectations were lowered by the reviews but the movie surprised me a bit. I am not a big fan of musicals so this review is a bit biased. The movie is good. I feel like it lacks a bit of drama in some parts. In some parts of the movie, it's just music. And in my opinion, that's not as fun.Jennifer Hudson got an oscar for her part in the movie and that is well deserved. Her acting is very good and she plays her role perfectly. Overall the acting is good from most of the actors.I find it hard to see the bad things in the movie when there is a song every 10 minutes. Especially when all the songs are very happy sounding. It's like listening to ""Pumped Up Kicks"". It sounds happy but it's really not.Overall I give the movie a seven. It's good, not great.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Exceptionally Bad Movie,"I just saw DreamGirls, and all I can say is WOW! what an awful film. The movie is a poor attempt at converting an (apparently) successful musical to screen. I spent the majority of the movie hoping the singing would stop at some point so I could enjoy the movie, but it never did. All the songs sounded exactly the same: exceedingly LONG, tired and uninspired, just like the songs you might hear in a high school play. The singers were very talented, but if I wanted to hear really good singers beat their talent to death, I would go to the opera. Also, the songs written for the singers were well below the talent used to deliver them, kind of like using a Ferarri to deliver pizzas. There was a good storyline, but it was hard to focus on in the movie due to the poor acting, and of course, the mass murder of all the key dramatic scenes by characters breaking out into SONG! The movie was supposed to be a drama, but it's just comical and amateurish. Do studios still use screeners? Save your money, pay off your Christmas bills, or go watch 'RAY' on DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wow. And I thought it was going to be just ""okay"".","Fantabulous. Stupendous. I can't even believe it. I've changed my pick for Best Picture this year so many times you'd think I have multiple personalities. But let me tell you it's just been a tremendous year for film. Kudos all around. I tell you none of the BP nominees last year, could compete this year. And I loved Brokeback Mountain and Munich.Dreamgirls is an amazing movie. I know what you're thinking. I didn't believe the hype either. But I saw it today and I actually don't think it's been hyped enough. Everyone deserves to be nominated. But it's just that kind of year, folks. Too many awesome performances not enough nominations. Of course the major buzz has been going to Jennifer Hudson and she does deserve as much praise as she's getting but that's because she's a 15. Everyone else is a 10. So she's better but it's ridiculous how awesome everyone else is. Of course Eddie Murphy's great. He's been in those movies where he plays like 10 fat people, which should have gotten him some recognition all these years, but of course they wouldn't go for that. But now that he's done such a great job here whatever awards he'll get, he'll deserve. And those of us who loved ""Party All the Time"" are definitely not surprised at his vocal prowess. Jamie Foxx is great again you know, but this time he's playing the villain so maybe that's why he's kinda been ignored. Anika Noni Rose. I don't know where she came from but I loved her too. All great voices. All great performances.Beyonce. Okay, I'm not a huge fan. She's talented and I appreciated her acting from Austin Powers. Yeah that sounds weird but you could tell she was comfortable on screen and had a lot of fun. I don't generally like the way she and her contemporaries sing nowadays so I wasn't expecting much either way. I figured she'd be passable. But she did such a great job playing Diana Ross. Everything down to the gestures, and the fact that she wanted to lose weight for this, tells me that she definitely took her job seriously. And it paid off.I think this is rated PG13. I can't remember why. I think there are a few bad words and one quick flash of some drugs. But I wouldn't mind taking a kid to this. Because there is so much more to it that's worth it. In a strange way I thought it would make a great double feature with Happy Feet. So much toe-tapping to be done. People waited in my theater through the credits for Jennifer Hudson's name/image to pop up and they all clapped. That never happens where I live either. Never. And there were little old ladies going ""WOOHOO!"" after a couple of Effie's songs.If you like movies, this year go see everything. But make sure that you save time for this one. You're gonna love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Disappointing,"I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. I mean with the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover... the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed by the finished product. The film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson.Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's performance compels you to pay attention each time she's on screen. Her performance of ""And I Am Telling You"" was the only time that I felt the hype was deserved. You cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. As many reviewers have stated, she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent.Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, cruised through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ""Ray"" performance and Beyonce Knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping, posing and shimmying her way through the movie. Her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film.The movie was too hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's ""heartfelt"" solo to Jamie Foxx) too long.DH -- Vancouver, WA",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Drama,"I was expecting a true story that was going to be touching and all. It was based on the truth, was somewhat touching but was a bit superficial. A bit like a short story book missing flesh. I didn't feel it as real but as a dramatic blacksploitation TV movie. Didn't like most of the songs but loved the actors though.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The screenplay isn't this film's strongest point,"All musicals have a special problem when it comes to storytelling. They use two tracks of communication, drama and music. The writer must let each form do what it does best and then somehow connect them and make them appear to be one line.Dreamgirls has many fine elements, most especially some of its pop songs and a number of dazzling performances. But the screenplay is not its strength. The script is serviceable, allowing the writer to hang the songs on a storyline. But even that breaks down about half way through, so the second half of the movie feels like a concert with too many songs stuffed down our throats.Not surprisingly, the story problems come out of the character setup. In the beginning of the film, Effie is the main character. She is the lead singer and the driving force in the group's desire to reach the top. But the Dreamgirls are quickly taken over by Curtis (Jamie Foxx), who determines all the action steps the group will take. The problem with Curtis as a character is that there is nothing inside. He's not a person, he's a money-making machine. Also, even though he is driving the action, he is the Dreamgirls' main opponent.This kind of character setup isn't a problem as long as Effie is the lead singer of the group. But halfway through the story, she gets tossed out. At this point Dreamgirls essentially ends. But there's still half a movie to go, and the second half feels infinitely longer than the first. Why? Notice the domino effect. Replacing Effie as lead singer is Deena (Beyonce Knowles), who has been chosen because she is so plastic and bland. So she can't carry the second half of the story. That leaves the plot pusher, Curtis, but all of his action steps at this point involve making more money, which is the same story beat. So the story fractures and grinds to a halt. Now the songs have no line to hang on, no emotion to punctuate. No matter how good a song might be on its own, each one feels, at this point in the film, like a big fat blob. I found myself begging the screen, ""Please don't make me sit through another interminable song."" A lot has been made of the writer's attempt to go beyond the personal to the historical and the political. To show the rise of black music during the civil rights era and how black music was then co-opted by the white corporate establishment. I certainly applaud the effort. But the technique isn't there. Again the prime culprit is all those never-ending songs. The writer has no time to develop the complex interconnections between the musical history and the political history. So he relies on the old film chestnut, the montage. This is shorthand writing, and all it does is confirm the simplest stereotypes. In fact, Dreamgirls includes one of the most offensive scenes of the year, when it shows a terrific ""black"" song being stolen and defiled by a truly horrible white pop band that is supposed to stand for all ""white"" music.For me the most interesting element in this movie is one it did not intend. Thematically it paints itself into a corner; it moves logically and inexorably to an indictment of itself. Dreamgirls supposedly shows the history of Motown music, but it doesn't have any Motown songs. It shows the corruption of soul music into generic pap, acceptable to all, and the movie is just another example of that endpoint.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Film a Clef,"There is a French expression, ""roman à clef"" (literally ""novel with a key""), which is used to denote what are ostensibly works of fiction but where the characters are actually disguised versions of real individuals and where the events described are disguised versions of real-life events. Hollywood often does the same sort of thing. ""The Greek Tycoon"", for example, tries desperately if disingenuously to pretend that it is not about Aristotle Onassis and Jacqueline Kennedy, but the only truly fictitious element in the film is the standard disclaimer stating that ""all characters are fictitious"" and that any similarity to real individuals is coincidental.""Dreamgirls "", which tells the story of a female African-American singing trio with a suspicious similarity to The Supremes, can be regarded as another example of a ""film à clef"", although it combines its disguised biographical elements with some genuinely invented material, a mixture of fact and fiction which has become known as ""faction"". I have never seen the Broadway musical on which it is based, but I understand that when it was adapted for the screen some of the details were changed to make the story even closer to that of The Supremes; for example, in the stage show the three girls are from Chicago but in the film they are from Detroit, the hometown of the real Supremes. In the film the group are originally called ""The Dreamettes"", but later change their name to ""The Dreams"", just as The Supremes changed their name from ""The Primettes"". The three individual members are called Effie White (for which read Florence Ballard), Lorrell Robinson (Mary Wilson) and Deena Jones (Diana Ross). The similarity between the names ""Deena"" and ""Diana"" is presumably no accident.In the film Effie is originally the lead singer of ""The Dreamettes"", but she is replaced in that role by the less talented but more attractive Deena; the group's manager Curtis Taylor, Jr (based upon Berry Gordy, Jr.) feels that Deena's slim figure and glamorous looks will make the group more marketable to a mass audience. Deena also replaces Effie as Curtis' lover, even though Effie is pregnant with Curtis' daughter, and goes on to marry him. Effie is sacked from the group and sinks into poverty, while Deena becomes a major star. Her attempts at a comeback are sabotaged by Curtis, who forces Deena to record a cover version of Effie's comeback single and then bribes radio stations to play the cover rather than the original. There are also subplots involving Lorrell's romance with a male soul singer named James ""Thunder"" Early and Effie's songwriter brother ""CC"".Cinematic biographies are not always totally accurate, although the existence of libel laws mean that when they depart from the strict truth they do so in order to whitewash their subjects rather than to blacken them. (""Ray"", for example, plays down the extent of Ray Charles' womanising). The makers of ""faction"", however, are not bound by the same rules; fictitious characters have no right to sue for libel, so if the events and characters depicted in a film can be passed off as fictitious, the film makers are generally safe from any lawsuits. There certainly are a number of differences between the plot of ""Dreamgirls"" and the story of The Supremes. Gordy Berry, for example, did not have a child by Florence Ballard, and was never married to Diana Ross, although he was at one time her lover. There is a happy ending for Effie, although in real life there was no such ending for Ballard, who died at the age of only thirty-two.These differences, however, were never enough to overcome the resemblances between several of the characters and real people. The film could leave viewers with the impression that Berry was unscrupulous in his business affairs (DreamWorks and Paramount were forced to apologise to him for that implication) and that Ross was a talentless performer whose success was mostly down to her looks and to her sleeping with the boss. I am not the world's greatest authority on Motown or on pop music in general, but I know enough to be aware that any such insinuation would be quite baseless.None of the above is to say that ""Dreamgirls"" is a bad film. There is a lot about it that is good; the music will certainly keep any fan of the Motown Sound happy. The plot, of course, is largely one showbiz cliché after another, but there are some good acting performances from the likes of Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy, and a brilliant one from Jennifer Hudson as Effie which won her the 2006 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. (Remarkably, this was her debut film). From an acting point of view this was well-deserved, although I felt that the role of Effie is really a leading one and Hudson should have been nominated in the ""Best Actress"" category. I was less taken with Beyoncé Knowles as Deena; the lovely Beyoncé has the looks of a Hollywood starlet, but on this evidence lacks the screen presence to make her a real star. She might do better to concentrate on her musical career.The film's reliance on real events, while simultaneously pretending to distance itself from them, did, however, leave a slightly bitter aftertaste. The ethics of ""faction"" can be somewhat dubious. I can only hope that, when Beyoncé Knowles is a grande dame of the music industry, some time around the year 2040, she is not confronted with a film which treats the story of her days with Destiny's Child in the same cavalier manner. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Reality Singing Competition Loser Completely & Magnificently Outshines Multi Hundred Million Worth International Entertainment, Fashion, Music, & Sex Icon","Maybe I am a sucker.

Then again, Broadway musicals are nearly always better; it is the original!Maybe I need to get to know my Motown better. I appreciate my soulful tunes from the 60s and 70s, but am admittedly not a sophisticated listener to the genre.Maybe I am supposed to want an intricate plot executed beautifully, rather than a basic story that serves as the vessel to provide the audience with moving performances and songs.Fair enough, this was no ""Chicago""; the balance and pacing could use some editing and I definitely would not recommend this to anyone looking for the magnificently story, but it was definitely better than many of the critics out there are saying.Commendable performances by everyone on the cast. Beyoncé Knowles is Deena Jones, the lead singer for The Dreamettes now The Dreams, Anika Noni Rose as Lorrell Robinson, Sharon Leal plays Michelle Morris, Danny Glover makes an appearance as Marty Madison. Jamie Foxx as the all business before family vilified manager and owner for Rainbow Records, Curtis Taylor. I was notably impressed by Eddie Murphy's performance as music legend and womanizer James Early, especially to see him sing like that! I also really liked lesser known actor Keith Robinson, who plays C C White, songwriting older brother to Effie White. Which brings us to the star of this film. She may not be the star of Curtis Taylor's The Dreams, but she damn sure takes the show anyways. In her Hollywood debut, (Season 3 American Idol seventh place finalist) Jennifer Hudson makes her stage presence known in a dazzling way, winning an Academy Award for Best supporting actress. Well deserved for her singing, in my opinion, but not quite so sure on the acting alone.Maybe I am a sucker for the formulaic lights and special effects.

"Fast-Paced Film, Incredible Score, Truthful Performances, Sumptuos Physical Design-What More Do You Want?","I went to a trade screening of ""Dreamgirls"" a few days ago and from the first seconds of the film, you can tell that you're in for the time of your life. To put it shortly, Bill Condon (director-writer) delivers the goods with this film. It's most definitely the first of its kind. It moves at a rapturous pace that leaves you breathless and delivers performances that are both subtle and fittingly over the top.The movie explains plot holes from the Broadway musical and adds many historical occurrences (Martin Luther King Jr., etc.) that gives the film a much more social awareness. Most of the sung dialogue from the musical is replaced with spoken with the exception of a few scenes. The music itself has always been wonderful, and this able cast performs it spectacularly.The performances are something else. Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murhpy, and Anika Noni Rose will blow you away. Murphy's vocals, though not as strong as his leading ladies, suit his character perfectly and shows a vulnerable side to him towards the end that we never knew he had. Rose makes the transition from a giggly little girl into a full-blossomed woman seamlessly, and Hudson-well, let's just say that any major hype you've heard about her does not do her performance justice. Beyonce Knowles will catch you off guard with her beautifully subtle performance, brilliantly channeling Diana Ross with her musical performances. Jaime Foxx, Keith Robinson, Danny Glover, and Sharon Leal also hand in admirable performances.I could not recommend this film more. It gives hope AGAIN to the movie musical that ""Chicago"" revived and ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Rent"", and ""The Producers"" almost killed. I can't say whether this film will be the next ""Chicago"" (I do foresee MANY Oscar noms, including Best Pic and others), I certainly hope it will be. I dream it will be bigger. It is definitely not the next ""The Producers"". I can say this though: It is the first, and only, ""Dreamgirls"" that we will ever encounter.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Baby... I can't take it no more.,"I'm not certain I should be writing a review of 'Dreamgirls'. Not that there's anything seriously wrong with the film, but I was under the misapprehension that I was watching an interpretation of Diana Ross and the Supremes. In a way it is, but it's now up in the air whether anyone will back the real thing seeing that its 'been done already.' Confused? I certainly was. I was expecting a biopic in the vein of 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line'. What I got was more 'High School Musical.' Now I love a good tune as much as the next guy, particularly if its got a touch of urban soul to it, but when the character breaks out in song in the middle of a dramatic scene with a line such as, 'Ooh, you're gunna love me,' or 'I'm somebody, and nobody's gunna hold me down...,' then I was looking around for the paper bag.Many of the songs are great and I'm sure it was fun on stage, but as the atmosphere had already been established, we had to wait until the song was over before the story could continue. As a piece of celluloid, I found this tedious. The vocals were strong but visually, there was not enough to hold an audience. I will admit that musicals are not really my thing, though I do relish a story that contains great music as in those previously mentioned films.Two actors have been singled out for notice, particularly Jennifer Hudson who has the truth in her eyes and Eddie Murphy, who is also good though I think we're yet to see the best of him. Chances are the Oscar is theirs, (though Jackie Earle Haley deserves it over Murphy for Little Children) but I thought Jamie Foxx and Danny Glover were just as effective. Beyonce Knowles is a little like her character, great visually but a little thin on substance.The screenplay by Bill Condon (Kinsey, Gods & Monsters) hints at so much more, the politics of the African American movement in the sixties, particularly in relation to their role in the music industry, the industry itself, the Watts riots, the price of fame, but just when it gets interesting, Condon forces his actors through yet another tune. Personally I was checking my watch.Perhaps I'm missing the point, but they say the show ain't over till the fat lady sings. In 'Dreamgirls', she didn't sing early enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
What an Awful Movie,"It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood it's all just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content. Yet, this film is overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out. I can't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline. A bunch of songs does not a movie make.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Terrific adaptation that stands on its own.,"I saw a preview screening of Dreamgirls on Nov. 15. and have to say I was pretty blown away by it. I can always tell when a movie really hits me because the thought immediately runs through my head, ""Wow, I can't wait to OWN this on DVD."" Needless to say, Dreamgirls is now at the top of my ""To Buy"" list.I saw the original Michael Bennett production in 1985, a few years into its Broadway run when Jennifer Holliday was no longer in the Effie role. But even without Holliday I found the show and its score to be among Broadway's best. While I certainly hoped this movie would at least give us a respectable representation of what made the Broadway show so thrilling, I must admit I was afraid to get my expectations too high after the recent string of disappointing stage to screen musical transfers - Phantom of the Opera, Rent and The Producers. Yeah, I had heard the buzz was good for Dreamgirls, but, well, you know how that goes. Sometimes the bigger the buzz the flatter it falls.And let's face it. Movie musicals are just flat-out tough to pull off. While I consider the number of truly great movies to be pretty small, the list of truly great movie MUSICALS is even smaller. And the ones that manage to do more than just recreate a literal adaptation of the stage play, truly utilizing the medium of film to create something bold and cinematic are almost non existent: Cabaret, Chicago...maybe one or two others...end of story. Plus, I think it's even more difficult to successfully transfer musicals to film today given modern audiences inability to accept characters ""breaking into song.""So I hope I'm not adding to the already extensive hype when I report that, for me at least, Dreamgirls delivers big time. The film manages to achieve the near impossible task of remaining faithful to it's source material (in fact, several times it gives direct nods to Bennett's brilliant original staging) while utilizing the medium of film to it's fullest, creating something fresh and exciting in its own right.Dreamgirls not only transitions seamlessly between spoken dialog and musical numbers, but redefines musical storytelling by using the musical artifice of ""breaking into song"" carefully and judiciously to punctuate only those moments in the movie when the emotion builds to the point where words can no longer adequately contain it. I can't express strongly enough how impressed I was with the way Bill Condon managed to handle these transitions. Truly masterful. But it's not just the transitions that are handled well. The movie is artfully rendered and exquisitely produced in literally every area with outstanding, heartfelt performances by each and every cast member. And yes, Jennifer Hudson is as good as they say. I can honestly say that there's no way I can imagine this film being done any better.If there's any weak spot in Dreamgirls, it's the dramatic flaws inherent in the piece itself. The second act of the stage play (after ""and I'm telling you I'm not going"") was never quite as dramatically intense or focused as the first. And the movie feels pretty much the same way. But, believe me, this is a minor flaw compared to what's RIGHT about Dreamgirls.Make no mistake. This film is going to be a triumph and earn a place in movie history. Not to mention my DVD library.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The story lines and (especially) the characters spontaneously bursting out in song are pathetic and false.

All That Shines Is Not Glitter and Gold.,"Three young African-American women (Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose) dream of super-stardom via the Motown route of Detroit in the 1960s and amazingly their fantasies of grabbing the brass ring may become reality with the help of a brash car salesman (Jamie Foxx) and a washed-up former headliner (Eddie Murphy). But not all dreams come true the way you wish they would. ""Dreamgirls"" is the would-be charming masterpiece of 2006 that is really overblown and overrated. It is loud, long, not as smart as it thinks it is and just generally under-achieving in most major cinematic areas. Screenwriter/director Bill Condon (best known for ""Gods and Monsters"") tries to hit the enthusiasm of ""Moulin Rouge!"", the style and intelligence of ""Chicago"" and the emotion and depth of ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"". Unfortunately the sound and art direction drown out the performers, the story and the film's helter skelter tone. Hit and miss all the way ""Dreamgirls"" is still a movie with more good than bad, but its red carpet treatment is not completely justified. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Music
What a disappointment,"I loved the film version of Rent. I thought it did pretty much everything right. It opened up the stage musical, it switched it from a sung-through show to a more traditional musical (integrating spoken dialog sequences), and it maintained most of the brilliant original cast). I enjoyed The Producers on screen. Nothing much changed from the stage version and that was quite all right with me.On the other hand, the long-awaited and much lauded Dreamgirls movie has ended up for me a hugely problematic film adaptation.It may be hard for you out there to believe, but this often misguided movie had only a tiny fraction of the impact on me of the colorblind-cast stage performance put on last year by the Los Angeles County High School of the Arts at the Alex Theater in Glendale. THATwas an amazing and unforgettably powerful experience for me. From the opening beats, I was carried away by nonstop music and emotional highs.On the other hand, Dreamgirls (the movie) had only one truly great moment for me and that was sure Oscar nominee and quite possible winner Jennifer Hudson's shattering rendition of And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going. For about 10 minutes, I was torn apart and reduced to tears at what will be remembered as one of the most powerful sequences in film history.But the rest of Dreamgirls only occasionally caught fire.The biggest mistake was to take out so much of the music. Unlike Rent (the movie), which successfully replaced sung dialog with spoken dialog, the first 45 minutes (I repeat 45 minutes) of Dreamgirls is actually a straight drama. Yes, there are songs, but the characters are supposed to be singing--on stage, in the recording studio, in a club, etc. When suddenly, three quarters of an hour into the movie, the actors burst into song (in character) singing Family to each other, it comes out of nowhere, from a different movie, certainly not the ""docudrama with music"" we've been watching up to that time.Of the 20 songs in the film, only about 4 (all of them painfully incongruous) are sung as extensions of the characters. The only reason that Miss Hudson's tour de force character song doesn't fall on its face is in the brilliance of her performance.I didn't really go for the ""historical"" background sequences. I can understand why the filmmakers may have wanted to anchor the film in ""reality,"" but it just didn't work for me, especially (and the New York Times review pointed out) the songs bear no resemblance whatsoever to the music of the era.This brings up another point that really rankled me. I have always felt that equating Deena Jones and The Dreams and Diana Ross and the Supremes was not particularly justified. Enough of the facts were changed in the stage version (and certainly the music wasn't Motown at all) that I always thought that Miss Ross couldn't possibly take offense if she saw the musical.The film is something else indeed. I was flabbergasted at how the filmmakers not just imitated but pretty much copied actual costumes worn by the Supremes (1964-1970), created album covers as identical to the Supremes' actual albums as humanly possible, and even depicted a pseudo Jackson Five lead by a mirror image ""Michael Jackson,"" all of which betrayed an astounding lack of originality. Miss Ross and Mr. Gordy should legitimately be outraged by the way they were ""fictionalized"" in this film.On the positive side, the acting was uniformly excellent. Eddie Murphy gives his best and most dynamic performance in years, Jamie Foxx is suitably seductive and slimy, and Beyonce Knowles is gorgeous and understated (just what the role requires). And much of the film is gorgeous to look at and to listen to. The costumes, makeup, hair...though often too close to ""the original""-- dazzled nonetheless.I've seen Rent the movie twice and will probably watch it again. The Producers...I wouldn't mind a second viewing, though I could take it or leave it. Dreamgirls--once was enough for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer 1 vs. Jennifer 2,"DREAMGIRLS was a dazzling stage musical when it ran in the early '80's. It was a thinly veiled (if veiled at all) decade-long look at the career of Dina Jones and the Dreams, aka Diana Ross and the Supremes. Its strengths were eye-popping stage production, and a passable musical score, ranging from energetic disco to devastating ballads, made legendary by the vocal talents of the cast. OK, let's single out Jennifer Holiday, because she was the reason to see DREAMGIRLS with her tour de force performance.The movie of DREAMGIRLS practically couldn't lose; all it had to do was match the spectacle and emotionality of the stage musical. Sadly, it falls short. Compounding this disappointment is the way it ratchets up the references to Diana Ross and Berry Gordy in a shameless, tacky way. No doubt people were driven in the early Motown years, and egos were created, but to overshadow the accomplishments in order to wallow in tabloidism (the weakest element of the musical), left a bad taste in my mouth. How much did the movie reference Diana? It superimposed the Dreams onto 4 actual album covers of the Supremes. It gave Dina an expletive-filled Diana-Ross-like diva moment with a movie producer, a trait not seen either before or after in this mostly sweet and demure character. And the movie's addition of the Jackson Five counterparts seemed to have a ridiculing edge.What else the movie got wrong was the dazzle and excitement. The costumes and choreography were dull. The stage sets didn't exactly take your breath away. But the big question is: Was Jennifer Hudson the second coming of the original Jennifer? Well, if rangeless belting, without the nuance of J1, is your cup of tea, then J2 is for you.There were a few redeeming moments. The opening scene, backstage at an amateur talent contest, was beautifully shot. Girls in their shimmering gowns glide in and out of light in the backstage darkness, like they were bio-luminescent deep sea fish. The Dreams first performance at the contest gave me an exciting anticipation of what was to come. Beyonce delivers a great vocal on ""Listen"". And Eddie Murphy was terrific as a singer and actor; his scene performing at an all-white nightclub in Miami was a standout.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson,"The movie was excellent. I saw it last night and Jennifer Hudson got plenty of cheers and claps all through out the movie. The whole first half of the movie you forget that Beyonce is even in it. Don't get me wrong she does a great job too. Eddie Murphy was also very spectacular. It was good to see him in a film of this caliber again. There are great songs and the movie is aesthetically beautiful to the eyes. There are a number of great actors and actresses in the movie as well and I hope after their performance in Dreamgirls they get more work in the industry. Jennifer Hudson really shines in this movie, she definitely deserves to win any and all awards she is nominated for. PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hudson is magnificent, but the film is too uneven","For anyone who follows movies and the awards season, Dreamgirls was one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It was the frontrunner for Best Picture from the start, and only continued to pull in steam as Oscar season came closer. While some of that steam has worn off a bit, the film is still one of the frontrunners, and is still pulling in lots of buzz. After an overextended limited theatrical release, the film has finally gone wide, and thus, gave me the opportunity to see it.I was skeptical about the film, not being a huge fan of musicals and all. But surprisingly, it was better than I thought it would be. But even with that statement, I am still a little conflicted about the film as a whole.For the uneducated, the film is based on a popular award-winning musical from 1981. It is fictional, but is based in fact. After narrowly losing a talent contest, the three members of the Dreamettes, Deena (Beyoncé Knowles), Lorell (Anika Noni Rose) and lead singer Effie (Jennifer Hudson), are signed to a contract by Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx). Despite Effie's complaints, they become back-up singers to popular singer Jimmy 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy), and soon after, become their own group. But as the group becomes more famous, relationships begin to dissolve and betrayal and heartbreak begin to become more predominant.The most noteworthy thing about the film is exactly what all the critics have been saying: Hudson's earth-shattering performance as Effie White. Watching her perform made me think the title of the film really should have been A Star is Born, her performance really is that great. Her angry diva-licious role is done with such a high-degree of perfection that it really is hard to believe that all she has done other than this film is American Idol. Her acting chops are well refined, and easily make her the best member of the cast. She brings soul and genuine emotion to her character, and makes the role absolutely unforgettable. Her singing voice is even better, and even stronger than the excellent acting. When she belts out ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" halfway through the film, everything and everyone bows down to her.But this is a large problem for the rest of the film.The first half before the song comes is fast-paced, and practically flies by. Bill Condon and company really immerse you in the action and drama of what is going on, and really churn out an excellent movie. Songs besides Hudson's big number are all catchy and well converted to the screen. The costumes, set designs and choreography are above excellent, and the editing is absolutely wonderful. But after the song, the film just loses any sense of speed it had, and instead, just drags along quite painfully at times. It feels like it just stopped knowing where to focus everything, and just decided to try and concentrate on anything it possibly could. And even then, they miss key plot elements and characters in favour of others that are not so key to the rest of the film. It feels awkward, and having not seen the musical on Broadway, I am unsure if I should blame the source material, or blame Condon's script. Thankfully none of the artistic elements fail (save for the really inane fade outs), but the loss of focus really hurts the movie.Another issue are the leads in the film.Hudson can only do so much, and even with stealing scenes left, right and centre, she cannot hold the weight up of everyone else. Knowles and Foxx, despite being the lead actors, are completely overshadowed by everyone. Their singing is not up to par, their acting (although better than expected) is not up to par, and their hearts just do not seem to be in the film as much as everyone else's. They look like they could have easily been replaced by lesser known stars, and had their roles actually mean something to the film. As it stands, they just look like background characters that are integral to the story, but just do not have the importance that they should.Murphy is disappointing as Early, because despite the critical praise, he is basically playing himself. Early thinks is stubborn, egotistical, and washed up. That is basically the picture the media paints of Murphy, so would you not think he would do well for himself playing a role that is so close to his actual self? Truth be told, he really is not in the movie a whole lengthy amount of time, and does nothing all too fascinating when he is.I actually was a lot more impressed by the underrated Rose and television regular Keith Robinson as lyricist C.C. Robinson. Both are supporting characters, but they command the screen when they are front and centre. Their acting is great, and they really help make their characters stick out. They are nowhere near as strong as Hudson, but their acting helps complement her amazing performance. In a way, they make up for the fumble of the main three, but on the other hand, prove that having a lesser known cast probably could have helped the film be much more powerful. Small roles from Danny Glover and Hinton Battle are also well done (as is an amusing cameo by Jaleel White).When I said I was conflicted, I was not kidding. On one hand, we have a film that has amazing technical feats, a memorable supporting cast and a star-making turn from Hudson. But on the other, the main cast really is subpar, and the film becomes tedious and boring in the second half. If it had stayed consistent, I think I could have justifiably given this film the blessing to win Best Picture. But as it stands, it just does not feel like a worthy winner.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Seriously...Kill me now,"This was longer than the Ten Commandments, All Lord of the Rings and the Matrix Trilogy combined. My oh My, what a nightmare. This is the single biggest over-hype of 2006. THere is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd. Movie Musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer. Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese Water Torture, in the form of endless music montages, shoddy acting, and poor directing choices (Seriously, Mr. Condon, did you HAVE to do the old Billboard countdown shots? It's at #58! No wait, look its rising up the charts and here is the passing Billboard notice to show you again....and again....and again)",2.0,Anonymous,Music
More than your average Razzle Dazzle!,"I was not looking forward to Dreamgirls all that much, it was only after the Oscar nominations, raving reviews and just intriguing trailers that made me realise the movie might just scrape average territory in my book. But as I sat down to watch this movie I actually had no idea how much in love I would get with this movie. You see despite Dreamgirls being your typical showbiz musical, rags to riches story, this movie had something that many musicals and actually many movies lack. It has style, soul and most importantly of all a huge heart. While many musicals go for an all out lavish affair to distract the audience this movie goes for lavish, great directing, great acting and amazing songs. To make the movie even better add two of the greatest performances you will probably find in all of 2007, add onto that a score to die for and your set to watch one of the movies that will undoubtedly feature in my top 10 of 2007.The story for Dreamgirls follows the Dreamettes, a trio of girls who one day dream of hitting the big time and getting their own act. In the Dreamettes there is the beautiful Deena Jones, the middle girl Lorrell Robinson, and finally big busty Effie White. Each of the girls has their own distinct personalities, and combined they are superb singers that just have never had their big break yet. That is until ex-care salesman Curtis Taylor Jr. is able to hitch the girls up alongside James ""The Thunder"" Early and get them to sing backup. They finally get their big break, and despite it being slightly annoying to be singing behind the legendary Jimmy Early they are happy. Then Curtis comes up with a miracle, he is able to get the Dreamettes their own act with Jimmy, only on the condition that Effie is no longer the front singer and that Deena takes her place. Of course this does not go down well, especially since Effie is obviously the most naturally talented of the three despite being the biggest. The Dreamettes go under the new title of the Dreams and they become an overnight sensation. However with fame comes an ultimate price, greed and selfishness. Resulting in the girls bickering, getting their own personal problems and betrayal between everyone. The plot for Dreamgirls as I have previously mentioned is your typical rags to riches tale, and admittedly it is at times very predictable. However where the movies storyline gains its power is in the performances and of course the absolutely stunning songs.The first superb performance I will mention is the leading lady of the movie, the ex-Destiny's Child, the one time Pink Panther eye candy, and now a true actress in her own rite, Beyonce Knowles. Here she is not the best actress in the movie, but what she does display is some amazing talent, talent that after seeing her in Austin Powers and Pink Panther I never dreamt imaginable. Her character Deena isn't the best at first, in fact in comparison to the other characters she seems almost bland. However, its towards the end, right after the middle section actually, when she becomes something of a diva, that the movie really displays her talents. Of course where Beyonce really comes alive is when she is singing, and boy can she sing. When she gets to belt out her main song of the movie, Listen, she really comes to life before your eyes. Of course compared to the likes of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx she loses her power, but when she's on her own you can't help but admire just how far her character has come. However her character is overshadowed by another one of the girls in the movie, that actress is in actual fact a complete newcomer to acting and was once on American Idol! Jennifer Hudson has so far been nominated for Best Supporting Actress Oscar and won numerous awards for her performance, saying she deserves these awards is not giving her justice whatsoever. You see Hudson is amazing in this movie, her character has the best personality, and best lines, but Hudson adds a believability factor to the character that many other actresses might have failed to inspire. Her singing is also several notches better than Beyonce's as well, in fact in the films highlight when she sings ""I'm not going"" is so powerful its unbelievable. As her character develops to the stunningly staged climax you realise just how brilliant Hudson is and how we might have a new actress worthy of a lot of awards on our hands. Other notable performances are for Eddie Murphy, equally deserving the Oscar he's been nominated for, and also Jamie Foxx who is a great villain.So then does Dreamgirls have faults? Well some might argue that its a bit long, some might argue that the movie has too many songs, some might even argue its all a bit too lavish for their liking. I on the other hand was one of the people who merely lapped it all up and loved every single second of it. I will admit though that The middle girl of the Dreams was pretty pointless at times, her relationship with Eddie Murphy's Jimmy is touching, but unfortunately sidelines which made the sudden reintroduction of it quite frustrating. Its not that the girls performance is bad, in fact she's damn good, but she's never given room to really develop as a character in the movie. Apart from that I really can't think of anything to complain about, Dreamgirls in my eyes was a superb example of a stage adaptation and also a musical to be remembered.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not worthy of a Best Picture win , but deserves some recognition in more than one aspect...","I just got back from seeing this, and while I thought the movie itself isn't worthy of a win for Best Picture this year, it deserves some recognition in more than one aspect. Like the supporting cast, which was great. I really liked the movie at the beginning, it had a very behind-the-scenes feel to the music industry and when songs were sung, it was done in a clever way, fast paced, and not in that busting-out-of-nowhere-in-public type singing.Then, thats where the movie fell apart for me. Long glitzy musical numbers that didn't fit the atmosphere of the film's opening. The film just didn't know where it wanted to end up. Is it a flashy musical like Chicago, or music biopic like Ray? In the end, it ends up a bit messy, being more like Chicago, but in a setting that a bit more realistic. Thats not to say that the performances are bad by any of the actors/actresses.The singing, on the other hand, is top notch and so is the music. Eddie Murphy merits at least a nomination, and Hudson is a lock for Best Supporting Actress. Keith Robinson also adds to the already outstanding supporting cast. The two leads were Beyonce and Jaime Foxx, but Foxx stuck out like a sore thumb in some scenes, whereas in Ray and Miami Vice, he played his parts perfectly. Beyonce has her talent for dancing, and has a decent stage presence, but nothing in comparison to Jennifer Hudson's voice. Director Bill Condon sets up some wonderful visuals, although at times the editing was a little poor in minor parts. It also could have used a little trimming, maybe by 15-20 minutes, in my opinion. I saw it with my girlfriend, who loves musicals, and she loved this movie. I, on the other hand, thought it was just okay. So I guess in the end, your love of this film could depend on what you're into nowadays.GRADE: B-",,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining Movie - Jennifer Hudson kills,"I liked this movie. Jennifer Hudson absolutely stole this movie -- every scene she was in -- with brilliant acting and incomparable singing. She was wonderful!!! Eddie Murphy was great too, we have never seen him like this, gritty, vulnerable, needy. Jamie Foxx was just OK. Hudson and Murphy deserve their rave reviews. But, I can't understand why Beyonce Knowles is nominated for a Golden Globe. When she wasn't singing she was out of her league. Her acting was wooden and painful to watch. Especially a scene at the end with Jamie Foxx's character where she couldn't muster a tear. You get the sense she has never had any painful dark place to draw tears from. She might get the Globe because the Foreign Press are enamored by her beauty but then again they gave one to that great actress Madonna, didn't they?

"""We are a Family"" For  perhaps ""One night Only""....","DREAMGIRLS lights up the house when Jennifer Hudson is on screen and her performance is totally mesmerizing with a talent and a screen presence that is beyond ""American Idol"". However, when she is not on the screen, the film becomes just another musical of R and B, with Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx brilliant in their parts, but never as electrifying as when Jennifer Hudson is in the scene. Her voice, her command of her role is one that demands all the Kudos which Ms.Hudson is receiving.The costumes, sets and music are wonderful, and the mixing of the story with the destruction of ""Motown"" on the screen brings back a haunting feeling of the desperation of the '60's as did BOBBY with Kennedy's death and the waste-less war which cost so many lives in Vietnam.What makes DREAMGIRLS work is the chemistry between the young women in the cast and their beauty and talent. However, without Jennifer Hudson, DREAMGIRLS would have been just another musical. But it is her being cast in this film is which makes DREAMGIRLS truly a film worth seeing. I can hardly wait until Oscar night to see this remarkably talented young woman, Jennifer Hudson, hold that gold figure in her hand.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls,"Please note : This film has just won 3 Golden Globes - including Best Musical/Comedy 2006. Please also note : This film has been nominated for 8 Oscars. Hence: Some people must love it!Based on the highly successful 1981 Broadway musical, Dreamgirls tells the story of an Afro-American all-girl soul group - the Dreamettes - who hook up with Curtis Taylor Jnr, a Cadillac salesman in the early sixties. The ambitious Taylor becomes their manager and through his Rainbow Records gradually manipulates them into becoming the highest selling female group in the US, through methods that are highly dubious. Needless to say, the storyline pretty much mirrors the careers of the Supremes, Diana Ross, and their manager Berry Gordy Jnr (the founder of Tamla Motown Records, and who also married Ross along the way).** 3 things to like about Dreamgirls 1. Eddie Murphy in the role of R&B star James 'Thunder' Early. In a career move reminiscent of John Travolta's performance in Pulp Fiction, Murphy proves not only he can act, but boy can he move! Channelling James Brown, Jackie Wilson, and Marvin Gaye, Murphy is the film's surprise hit, and heart of the film's best songs. 2. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson (ex-American Idol finalist) in her performance as Effie White - the original lead singer of the Dreamettes - dumped along the way by Curtis as part of an image change for the group. Big woman and a fabulous voice - Beyonce Knowles pales alongside her. 3. The production design and style in recreating the US pop music industry. The 60's R&B concerts and the sequences where The Dreamgirls (and leader Deena Jones) are performing hit after hit in the seventies are flawlessly staged and look a million dollars.** 3 things not to like about Dreamgirls 1. Jamie Foxx is surprisingly bland as the morally challenged manager Curtis Taylor Jnr. After his Oscar-winning role as Ray Charles in Ray! I would have expected a scenery-chewing performance in this role. Not so - Foxx gives off such a laid-back vibe that he seems inconsequential to much of the action. 2. Beyonce Knowles in the Diana Ross-type role of Deena Jones. Knowles lost weight to play this role, and it seems to have affected her energy level. She also seems a bystander to much of the film. 3. The original songs, written for the stage musical and film, that mimic the Tamla Motown sound. Nothing holds a candle to the original Supremes classics of the era. The material suffers from having to move the plot forward through the lyric content.Summary : Dreamgirls is worth seeing for Eddie Murphy alone, but is vastly overrated as a film musical.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Dream-Musical to revive the Genre!!,"The pumped up beats, the glamorous outfits, and that Motown sound - YEAH! Something which the film industry's been waiting for since Chicago won a Best Picture Nod at the Oscars in 2002.The casting is pitch-perfect. Jennifer Hudson is astounding, which keeps you wondering about her departure from American Idol due to insufficient voting??!! That voice, and those emotions pave the way for Oscar glory. Beyonce Knowles, though many critics have credited her as the weakest link in the movie, is far from being weak. Her radiant-glamour and her 20lbs less voluptuous figure, shine whilst ""the Dreams"" are on stage. She is far from being the weakest link. As Deena Jones, Beyonce has the voice, experience, looks and talent. Eddie Murphy actually acts, and ""NO!"" -he does not over-act, play multiple characters, or provides unneeded humor- there is a vein of emotions displayed vividly in his character -James ""Thunder"" Early - from his love between his wife and back-up singer, drug addiction, and winding career. Its too bad, it took Murphy this long to realise his capability and potential in a significant contribution to the film industry. Jamie Foxx - is easily the weakest link. His performance is insipid and it seems like he has been pasted in the scenes to give them attitude and ego-ism. Though its a very Jamie Foxx character, and is pretty much Curtis Taylor Jr. Jamie Foxx's on-screen presence and performance was not good enough. Anika Noni-Rose did not receive the acclaim she deserved. Sure she is the least known in the cast, but her portrayal of Lorell was spot-on, and was as powerful as Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson's performances. Her voice was amazing, and I hope this movie rockets her career.The music especially the additional songs, gave this movie the final touches. Amazingly directed by Bill Condon, this is one movie, that lived up to its hype. Loved every bit of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Looks good, but where's the depth?","As a rule I cannot tolerate musicals. I find it kind of embarrassing and painful when people sing instead of speak.I was disappointed they went that route with Dreamgirls. I adored Diana Ross and the Supremes growing up and I never really did know what happened to Florence Ballard. Too bad they did not take advantage of the opportunity to get some hot Motown music back into our techno lives...anyway Jennifer Hudson was the only one to evoke any feelings in this whole movie - especially with her solo about 'you gonna love me' - the movie was really well produced, but lacked emotional depth, with the exception of Jennifer Hudson. She really did rock the screen - acting and singing - and I totally agree she deserves the G/G award for this. Eddie Murphy was convincing as a sleazy egomaniac, and Beyonce, well she is so totally gorgeous but lacking in emotional depth. I think she was worried about JH stealing the limelight right from the beginning, her acting was so tense! Anyhow, this movie does not merit any big time awards, it was adequate, polished and without Jennifer Hudson to add major depth, soul and all out singing style, this movie would have sunk totally.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing this film after all the hype in the press and a film with so many awards/nominations must be worth seeing right? Well, maybe i should have waited to rent this one. It starts out promising, great cast, brilliant costumes/make up and a feeling that the film will take you on a journey.However, half-way through, it struck me that this film could not make up its mind whether it was a musical or a movie. The singing seemed to be confined to the performances of the artists in the film in the first half, but confusingly this all changed when in the second half they burst in to song at any interval. In my opinion it seemed like it was embarrassed to be a musical.Many of the songs were similar and went on for far too long. The 'argument song' in the middle (you'll know which i mean) was verging on embarrassing. It left me sat in the theatre cringing, squirming and begging it to end.It's not all doom and gloom though. The film re-found its feet finally, towards the end.In short I felt the film was good to start, stalled in the middle and went on to a good end.

Dreamgirls in Charlotte - Screening,"Saw the preview last night of Dreamgirls in Charlotte, NC. First off I have to say that it is a great interpretation of the stage play. I thought that the script had really fleshed out the show and brought to life ideas that were only briefly touched upon. All of the characters were much more believable on screen, and the added songs really fit in with the rest of the score. The greatest triumph of this movie has to be Jennifer Hudson as Effie. She is truly a star. After she sang, And Im Telling You, the whole audience burst into applause. It was truly magical. I turned to the friend who went with me and said...she definitely will be nominated if not win the Oscar!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Over-hyped,"One time front runner for many Oscars disappointed me. Sure the music is great as are most of the performances, but in making the Broadway show into something for the screen something was lost. Its clear how the show would play on stage and you understand how ""I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" brings down the house and makes those who sing it a star, but the mix of song and reality is an odd mix the movie never fully over comes. Is it a show or real? The movie never fully blurs the line so it never worked for me like in Chicago, or in the misfire adaptation of Rent. The performances are good, but limited by the source material. I also have to be a nay sayer to Jennifer Hudson's role as Effie. She do have pipes and she sells the songs, but there is an intensity thats missing. On a stage she could sell it but on the big screen its clear that she's play acting. I think she should not have gotten an Oscar, nor do I think the movie should as well....Its good, but not great",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Nowhere NEAR Oscar-worthy,"I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was REALLY underimpressed. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics. Except for Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair. Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!Now, the first half hour was good, but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages. Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film. And the ""rise to the top"" portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many sound-alike tunes.Condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I'd expected they would. Each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people ""singing"" AT each other. And the way they shot Hudson's big ""love me"" number was criminal! Condon just shot her stomping around the stage--no drama at all! God it sucked!AND note to all involved--that ""sing-talking dialog"" stuff might work on stage, but it DOES NOT WORK IN MOVIES (see embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom). All that ""I'll teeeell youuuu something Efff-ieeee!"" crap should have been left on the editing room floor. Those aren't ""songs.""Again, the film--except for Eddie Murphy's amazing performance--was nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this film! I wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre-release ""one to beat"" Oscar buzz? As a whole this film was, except for Eddie, NOWHERE NEAR an Oscar caliber movie!

A different perspective,"All though I've been to a couple of musicals, I wouldn't call myself someone who is deeply immersed into that particular culture. As for the hype about the Jennifer Hudson's debut and all that stuff, I was living in a cave. I understand now that ""Dreamgirls"" was a popular and influential stage-play that paid tribute to many Motown icons. My criticisms of the film are usually instantly refuted by the fact that this is a musical or that it was referencing the original source material. For all films, I don't pay attention to those specific details, I look at how the film translates to screen. With ""Dreamgirls"", I found many themes bewildering, and I do indeed enjoy many other screen-adapted musicals. I guess I can say that I wasn't prepared for Hudson's mental breakdown...I mean spectacular singing monologue. While the audience gazed in amazement as Hudson sang vocal acrobatics, I wasn't convinced by her situation. Sure the singing was nice, I thought the songs could have been better (they don't measure up to the Motown classics), but that shouldn't be the only thing of quality in the film. I found the characters very undeveloped and the story was clichéd to no end. I wouldn't condemn a film for being clichéd if it brought an extra something to the table, but I just couldn't connect with the story. I found the pacing to be too erratic. The film delivered one song after the next and involved such forced emotion and drama I was taken aback. Due to this, the big anticipated highlights of the film don't seem warranted.There are some highlights. Eddie Murphy delivers an interesting and humorous performance; it may be the best of his career. Hudson succeeds in vocal execution more than her acting, but she delivers an acceptable performance. We get the expected performance from Beyonce who generally plays herself. The set designs and costumes were excellent, of course. The movie was typical crowd-pleasing Hollywood with no soul or real depth, at least for me. A fun ride for obviously a lot of people, but marginal for myself and certainly undeserving of the heaps of hype.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"A fun, technically accomplished, lavish musical with enough soul to prevent you from getting the blues.","""Music is supposed to sell"" claims Jamie Foxx's dead-faced music producer when staring in the face of the physically unappealing but vocally rip-roaring Effie White. Such is the power of Jennifer Hudson's voice box, it is staggering to learn that she only finished 8th or 9th in American Pop Idol or whatever that show is called. And it is Hudson, despite the effortless screen presences of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx, and the incredible singing talents of Beyonce Knowles - who walks away with both the acting and singing accolades from Dreamgirls - picking up a handsome Oscar-nom in the process.Generally regarded as being inspired by the story of Diana Ross & The Supremes, Dreamgirls tells the tale of three girls who, after getting the gig of backup-singers to ageing, alcohol-friendly soul-singer Jimmy Early (Murphy, back on form), go through the trials and tribulations of becoming famous. The head of the trio is Effie White, a voluptuous and vocally bombastic singer who, after dating slimy producer Curtis Taylor Jr. (Foxx) is shafted as lead-singer in favour of the much more eye-friendly (but vocally bland) Deena Jones (Knowles). As the trio aim to become commercially successful without the aid of Early, Effie's bitterness towards both being shafted and her two-timing producer boyfriend, catches up with her. She finds herself out of the group, and out of a record deal, replaced with another thin, vocally-unremarkable singer, as the group continue their success without her.There is a moment in Dreamgirls where Curtis Taylor actually sits his wife Deena down and tells her that the reason he chose her to sing lead was because ""her voice has no personality"". Whilst all of us in the real world know this not to be the case, it is interesting that Dreamgirls addresses the issue of the blandification of black music in order to appeal to a broad audience. As Deena Jones, the star and headliner of the group, Beyonce Knowles delivers a mannered performance that, although clearly showing that she is not a great actress, is full of energy and conviction. Jennifer Hudson's performance, however, is what gives this film its edge. We all knew Beyonce could sing, but by god can Hudson belt out a number or two.With this film's typically accomplished technical achievements, it has a wonderfully colourful milieu, the cinematography capturing the mise-en-scene of the 60s and 70s wonderfully. Everything from the hairdos to the outfits, and the music itself fits the era it represents.If I have a criticism of Dreamgirls - it is perhaps that, at the heart, this is still a musical - albeit not a great one. If you are familiar with the music of the Supremes, you may find the musical numbers in Bill Condon's film a little underwhelming, or even uninspiring. Eddie Murphy doesn't have the greatest voice in the world, but he performs his passable lyrics with enough verve to get you in the mood for all his wiggling - but none of the songs are well written, nor will they stay with you like Caberet (1972) or Evita (1995). Part-attack on the commercialisation of heartfelt soul-singing, Dreamgirls for the most part remains a fun, technically accomplished, lavish musical with enough soul to prevent you from getting the blues.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson saves this weak Broadway show,"Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is a hustler car salesman who weasel his way into managing the naive Dreamettes; Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose). They start singing backup for James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy) who is a womanizing James Brown type. Then Curtis schemes and hustle his way into a record empire.The production feels very Broadway. The songs are not always good. The best thing in the movie is the performance of Jennifer Hudson as the brassy Effie White. Eddie Murphy does good dramatic work in support. Without the break out performance of Hudson, this is just a show tune Broadway show with big singing voices. She puts in a powerful performance, and it would have been great to see an Effie White movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
DREAMGIRLS : A Movie Musical To Re-Ignite The Genre With It's Soaring Energy...,"DREAMGIRLSFirstly, it would be unfair to review a film like DREAMGIRLS without acknowledging some of it's many flaws. After a year of hype, DREAMGIRLS proves a slight disappointment in terms of emotional gravitas & depth. When a film is hyped for an entire year as the front-runner for the Academy Award, film-goers have every right to go into the film expecting fully-developed characters, rich emotion, & detailed storytelling. However, film-goers be warned... you aren't bound to get what you expect. DREAMGIRLS is rather shallow in terms of character development & genuine plot. However, if you go in expecting the film to be a stunning spectacle of entertainment & fun, you will not be disappointed.Whatever DREAMGIRLS may lack in terms of complexity, it makes up for with sheer energy & relentless commitment to entertain its audience. The admittedly thin story revolves around the discovery & rising stardom of a trio of young women from Detroit; Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) & Effie White (Jennifer Hudson). After meeting manager Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) at an amateur night, the girls find themselves on tour with one of the country's leading African-American entertainers named Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy). As they tour the country, Curtis romances the girl's lead singer Effie White & slowly develops the girls as a solo act named the Dreams.However, once the Dreams are ready to cross-over on their own, the dynamic changes completely & the happy rise to stardom becomes troublesome. In order to market the group to white audiences, Curtis replaces Effie with Deena as lead singer, causing a rift in the group dynamic which leads to Effie's retaliation & inevitable dismissal from the group. While the first half of the film focuses on the rise to stardom, the second half focuses on the continued stardom of Deena, who is now married to Curtis, & the struggle of Effie to make it on her own. As is clear from the plot description, the actual twists & turns of the plot are rather complex... but the depth with which they are examined is very lacking.Nonetheless, what makes DREAMGIRLS one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences of the year is the sheer energy & talent of it's inarguably incredible cast. From the very first notes, it is clear that DREAMGIRLS is a return to the grandest of musical formats. Bill Condon has decided not to hold back in any way. The costumes, the lighting, the music, & the choreography are so ""in your face"" incredible that once this movie gets going the audience can't slow down. Bill Condon does a decent job of incorporating some racial tones into the film with the Detroit Riots and ""I Have A Dream"".. but these racial elements can't eclipse the glitz & glamor that makes DREAMGIRLS what it is.No review of DREAMGIRLS would be complete without acknowledging the contributions of it's incredibly talented cast. Jamie Foxx in the role of conniving businessman Curtis Taylor Jr. brings a subtlety to the screen that is almost off-putting at first when you consider how flashy his performances usually are. However, Foxx's subtle sliminess makes the slow revelation that Curtis is a man virtually devoid of emotion all the more unsettling. Meanwhile, Beyonce Knowles as front-woman Deena Jones is certainly the most beautiful screen presence to reach the silver screen in years. But it would be an understatement to simply acknowledge Beyonce's beauty, as she manages to travel leaps & bounds above her previous screen efforts. On the page, Deena is an incredibly underdeveloped character, but in the few moments of depth we see in Deena, it is clear that the script short-changed Beyonce's potential here.Eddie Murphy is a sheer joy in one of his best roles, & he exhibits a singing voice that sounds like it was plucked straight out of Motown's heyday. Again, like Deena Jones, Jimmy Early is rather underdeveloped on paper with a drug addiction that seems more like a plot contrivance than a genuine character flaw... but Eddie Murphy gives the sub-plot more resonance than one would expect from the script. His relationship with Lorrell (played by a delightful Anika Noni Rose) is surprisingly the most well developed romantic pairing in the film.Finally, one can't possibly review DREAMGIRLS without acknowledging the fact that this will go down in history as the moment the world was truly introduced to the talents of Jennifer Hudson. As the most crucial role of the film, Effie White is the most emotionally rich character in the entire piece, while also being a scene stealer both vocally & attitude-wise. Hudson delivers on all levels, especially in the vocal department. If she does not go on to be a significant force in the music industry, it only goes to show that the industry sometimes has no clue what to do with genuine talent. In the acting department, Hudson doesn't shine quite as strongly as she does vocally... but for a reality star's film debut this is a transcendent performance richly deserving of the awards attention she has received.Overall, one might ask why a film like DREAMGIRLS, with it's numerous flaws and shortcomings is still ranked with a 10 by myself. Personally, I think sometimes a film does not have to be graded simply on it's depth & complexity. There's a place in this world for movies that soar as sheer entertainment just as much as there is a place for heavy, dramatic pieces. DREAMGIRLS isn't the type of film that will change your life or reach it's audience on a deep level. However, it is the type of film I could watch over & over on DVD & still not absorb every detail. DREAMGIRLS might not be the ""Best"" motion picture of the year, but it certainly is the most entertaining motion picture I've seen in years.... A ...",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is a mess.,"Well, let's start with what's good -- the film is well photographed and the era is skillfully recreated.Beyond that, ""Dreamgirls"" is a mess and a bore.The writers foist upon us one puzzling dramatic scene after another. The ""characters"" are poorly motivated, under-developed cardboard cut-outs. The characterizations are inconsistent and have no souls; they serve merely as coat racks upon which the show hangs it songs. The motivations are so ineptly fleshed out that we the audience have nobody to honestly root for. Perhaps in an attempt to provide SOME sort of honest dramatic conflict, the film (poorly) utilizes footage of actual 1960's racial conflicts. These moments succeed only in revealing the artificiality of the plot structure.This puts a special burden on the music. Unfortunately, with only a couple of exceptions, the songs are duds -- as mediocre as they are forgettable. And without a decent script's proper character motivation, the performers sing the tripe in such an overwrought manner that we the audience must wonder if, rather than singing, they really ought to just seek some counseling.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Reflections,"This is film version of the Broadway musical that ran for almost four years beginning in 1981 and won six Tony Awards in 1982. It's loosely based on Motown founder Berry Gordy and The Supremes but not quite. More like some parallel universe. Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is the Berry Gordy-type character who discovers three talented young singers out of Detroit's housing projects called The Dreamettes, Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) and turns them into pop friendly glamor queens The Dreams as his ticket to his own dream to build a record empire and take race record black artists into mainstream and cross-over from R&B to the top 40 pop charts. It's a good ensemble cast with Jennifer Hudson in her Academy Award nominated film debut. James Thunder Early (Eddie Murphy) is a composite character that is part Motown artists Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin with a little James Brown and Otis Redding thrown in. Marty Madison (Danny Glover) is Early's manager. C.C. White (Keith Robinson) is Effie's songwriting brother and is a composite of Holland-Dozier-Holland with a little bit of Smokey Robinson thrown in. Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal) is a Rainbow Records staffer that becomes on of The Dreams. Eddie Murphy is also Academy Award nominated as Best Supporting Actor but it's not much of a stretch and despite him being a soul singer here you just can't seem to get past Eddie Murphy being Eddie Murphy. Jamie Foxx just goes through the motions in his role as the megalomaniac record producer and it makes you wonder why he even accepted the role. Danny Glover is always good but like his character he doesn't have a whole lot to do here. Beyoncé Knowles is one dimensional except for when she's singing. Anika Noni Rose is good and gives a lively performance. Keith Robinson is robotic. Jennifer Hudson is the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress but I wouldn't count on it. Her singing voice is so over-the-top and overbearing that after one solo performance it grows pretty tiresome. Bill Condon adapted Tom Eyen's play for the film and also directs. It's well directed as a musical to film but it's a weak script. Virginia Katz does a good job as Editor and veteran cinematographer Tobias Schliessler delivers some beautiful photography. the film has a beautiful look and great sets and production director John Myhre and set decorator Nancy Haigh have been nominated for an Academy Award for Art Direction. The costumes from the early sixties to the disco era are fantastic and a real trip down memory lane and has earned Sharen Davis an Academy Award nomination for Costume Design. The sound mixing has also garnered an Academy Award nomination. One of the problems with this film is the music itself. Despite being a popular Broadway show from 21-26 years ago there are no songs that have become part of the American songbook. Most popular musicals have one or more songs that become cover version classics of recording artists and have instant recall to the audience. Dreamgirls had none. Four additional songs were written for this movie and three of those are among the five songs up for the Oscar for Best Song. One of those will likely win but I don't see any of them being a hit by other artists in years to come. Despite trying to capture Motown the music ends up being average show tunes. Chorographer Fatima Robinson adapted to the screen the work of Michael Bennett from the stage play and also doubles as one of the Stepp Sisters on screen. This film could win two Oscars for art direction and costumes. Hudson will likely get it a third statuette and one of the songs unless they cancel each other out will probably earn it a fourth Award. It's a good film but more visually rewarding than musically rewarding. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What if Chicago were about Chicago?,"The main problem with this picture is that it tries to be about the music business instead of focusing on the people who sing. That's why the original Broadway effort worked well and this movie adaptation doesn't. This can not be an indictment of Berry Gordy Jr. and Motown and also be about people achieving their dreams.Two easy choices from the musical, but not in the movie I think makes my case. When we hear Curtis sing ""When I First Saw You"", we don't hear the duet with Deena where we find she's not a pretty innocent. When we hear Clarence sing to Effie ""I Miss You, Old Friend"", we don't hear the duet with Effie where Clarence wins her over with the fact he's changing and so is she.All told, I gave this a 6 because I liked the original music and it reminded me of an excellent musical called ""Dreamgirls"". This gets a 4 for character development and a 2 for factual context. Motown's contribution to American life was far greater then this film implies. Payola was not as important as this film implies.Finally, anyone who saw or heard Jennifer Holliday as Effie can not possibly believe that Jennifer Hudson brings anything new to the role. Perhaps better editing would have overcome the lack of physical presence on songs like ""And I Telling You, I'm Not Going"", too much arm fluttering.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not a ""must see"" movie","The early part of this movie contained music representing the outgrowth from the early days of Rhythm and Blues. It was exceptionally good!The rest of the movie moved into the realm of pop music. It was somewhat boring and lacking in innovation as is the pop music of most eras.The sets and costumes were well done, particularly for the female singers.In the second half many of the actors lines were sung (as in recitative). This did not enhance the movie.Eddie Murphy was very effective as a vocalist/entertainer. Jennifer Hudson's singing was excellent, plus she is a very beautiful woman to look at. Jamie Foxx had very little singing parts but did a beautiful solo in the second half of the movie. His song was the musical highlight of the movie for me.In general, the acting and the vocal skills were excellent, but much of the lyrics and music were not.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"dreamgirls, a MUSICAL","dreamgirls is by every standard and regulation, a musical. If this is not of your taste, then the movie MAY not be to your liking, however you should not rule it out by just knowing this one simple fact. Yes, the movie portrays the struggle of African-American entertainers during this era as well as personal struggles that happen between all of us, of all races, but it does so in the form of a musical. (for those of you who don't know, a musical can consist of characters singing to each other to express dialog, songs that tell a story and do not necessarily rhyme, and people breaking out in song for no apparent reason) you don't have to like the music to enjoy the context of the movie and the message it portrays. My personal opinion is that this movie was extraordinarily beautiful, and having also seen the Broadway production, it was an even better rendition of the story. I'm not sure how good it would be without vocal powerhouses Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce' Knowles, but the story and the musical performances were filled with emotion and soul which is exactly what the movie is trying to send across to it's audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
First grade garbage,Indeed this movie is a howler.The first half is mildly enjoyable but from then on the movie descends into repetitive nonsense and serves as nothing more than a vehicle for Beyonce's mutual admiration society. Furthermore the music deteriorates to the extent that most of the singing in the second half resembles a cat being strangled.Eddie Murphy remains the only redeeming factor throughout the movie.Jamie Foxx gets too xxs as fail marks.Lacking in any meaningful plot whatsoever.Why does Hollywood bother spending money making such movies?

"Unbearable, embarrassing shlock","It's hard to find enough bad things to say about this ""movie."" As everyone knows, there's only one reason to see it: American ""Idol's"" Jennifer Hudson. She is spectacular, though she sticks out like a sore butt. Like her talented and capable co-stars, especially Eddie Murphy, she is mired in a pretentious, overlong, shallow, predictable, inept, amateurish script and saddled with a director who might as well have submitted this as a 7th grade school project using the latest free editing software. The movie is lifted from the show; no attempts to make it cinematic were made other than to use old news footage and every editing and directing cliché you can imagine. Songs are seen both as staged performances and as impromptu on-the spot dramatic statements within-the-film. The music, though although everyone must have known this, is unforgivably boring, repetitive, hokey, Broadway Deli Cheesecake, screamy garbage, and is an insult to everything that Motown, Diana Ross, the Supremes, Berry Gordy, James Brown and everyone else who lifted music out of the kitschy crap celebrated in this film (with one or two weak exceptions)tried to do. Bill Condon should be banned from Hollywood forever; the writers of Dreamgirls should be boiled in a vat of collard greens.The cinematography is non-existenct, as if the lens were filtered through the girls' outrageous, oily wigs.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer and Eddie steal the show.  Beyonce ... not bad.,"Real quick ...I meant to write this review after seeing the movie during the first week. But, it looks like many of you feel the same as me, so I'll add my two cents and make it quick.The film is very good, and it makes you feel good to see it. Jennifer Hudson did Jennifer Hoilday proud. (She just won the Golden Globe for it. Well deserved.) Eddie Murphy is fantastic as James ""Thunder"" Early. I couldn't help but to be reminded of his James Brown imitations on SNL (and of his song ""My Girl Wants to Pary All The Time""). He continues to show how talented he is. Even though he's not a singer, his performance is spot on for the film.Beyonce wasn't bad. Her acting was a little flat at times, but she shined when she was on stage, as always. She's not an actress, but she held her own. Still, she got lost sometimes with Jennifer and Eddie doing such stand-out jobs.I wasn't sure how the play would translate to film. I saw the play, and I greatly enjoyed the film.",,Anonymous,Music
Oscars?  I hope not!,"Good movie, excellent singing, decent acting (for the most part) but Oscar winning? I doubt that, except for the music/score/etc, which are all very worthy of Oscars. If this wins many other Oscars, particularly for any of the major acting awards, I'd be quite surprised and would say it was a pretty poor year for acting! OK, I need 10 lines on here so what else can I say? Eddie was great! Jennifer sang wonderfully and her acting was much better than could have been expected!I'm sure it was discussed on here already but why did a movie about a certain era and aspect of the music industry (containing several songs in the 1st 1/3 of the film but not REALLY a ""musical"") suddenly turn into a ""musical"" about 1/3 of the way into the movie? I thought that was unusual.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Overproduced and Under-Exciting,"Dreamgirls disappoints, especially when you consider its source and the talent involved. Bill Condon has directed some very direct, honest pictures that surprise with their humanity and creativity. This movie, though direct in the sense that it does not surprise, delivers very little in terms of authentic human emotion or unexpected character dynamics. Though both Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson deserve the attention they are getting for their supporting roles, neither of the leads show much energy on screen. Their lack of buoyancy, along with the generally overproduced and under-exciting music, left me feeling bored and a little trapped, invested as I was in both the supporting characters.

Jennifer Hudsons voice was awesome and totally blew Beyonce away deserving her Oscar win for this performance. Eddie Murphy & Jamie Fox also supply some slick performances especially Eddie as as James Thunder Early.

Hot Tub!  Burn My Toe ...,"Greetings again from the darkness. Despite this being a massive hunk of Hollywood cheese and mostly fictitious re-telling of the Motown backroom, this one is a bit of fun with a couple of outstanding vocal performances along the way.The basic story revolves around the beginning of group similar to the Supremes and the slick production of Berry Gordy's Motown and the packaging of this mainstream black girl band so that white audiences would buy in. Part of this packaging involved the promotion to front and center of the more beautiful, charismatic (and whiter) Beyonce (Deean) over the more talented Jennifer Hudson (Effe). Not too subtle in the similarities to the real Supremes, but it is fun to watch Beyonce evolve into the diva (even though the excess of Diana Ross is downplayed). Jamie Foxx doesn't really capture the charm and sleaze necessary for his role ... we never really see why these artists trust him in the first place.Eddie Murphy steals his scenes as James ""Thunder"" Early (a slightly toned down James Brown) and he brings some much needed levity to the film when it gets a little too self-indulgent. Other nice supporting work by Danny Glover, Keith Robinson and the ""Boston Public"" duo of Sharon Leal and Loretta Devine.Make no mistake, this is Jennifer Hudson's film. She has two blow-the-doors-off songs, especially ""And I'M Telling You I'm Not Going"". Should be nominated for best song. Ms. Hudson is an amazing singer, but has a ways to go in the acting dept. Luckily the quasi-musical approach makes it easier on her.The film probably has a couple too many musical numbers and some run a bit long. Because of this, the story suffers a bit. It is, however, definitely worth seeing for the Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce vocals.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic missing,"I was quite sure I would like this movie. But I did not. What we get is the story of a sixties girl group based loosely on the career of the Supremes. Excellent. There is only one mayor problem with this. The music just does not work. The Supremes had a couple of wonderful hits and we get nothing of it. What an incredible idea to let someone write some songs and trying to make us believe that these were number 1 hits in the 60s. It is just ridiculous. Hudson who plays the fat girl with the great voice that has to leave, does have a nice voice and even some kind of charisma. What she does not have is even one song that is worth listening. Same for Beyoncé. She is certainly beautiful and her voice is okay. But she is not allowed to sing let's say ""Stop in the Name of Love."" So compared to say Ray, this is a tremendous let down. There was something like Motown Magic. This has nothing of it at least not as far as the music is concerned. I liked the costumes and the dancing and the nice 70s wallpapers but that is not enough.Eddie Murphy is allowed for about 30 seconds to put on a straight face. Also he plays a drug addict.

I was sure that there's no way it would compare to what I saw in the theater that day. I was wrong. Although I do appreciate Beyoncé's gift of a role in this movie, they made it seem like she was the star, and the movie was about her, but it wasn't. This was a movie about Effie White and her naïveté, even though she was a very strong character right from the jump.

Even in the context of that genre Dreamgirls doesn't make the grade because it has an instantly forgettable soundtrack.I think Dreamgirls was supposed to be a parody of those old movies, but none of the critics got it because they are all too young to have seen them. They are not classics. Dreamgirls takes itself very seriously with not one moment of humor. Therein lies the parody -- nobody took those old rock n roll movies seriously.As those old rock 'n roll movies demonstrated, transferring great stage numbers straight to film with twinkie filling between the numbers does not make a great movie.My nomination for the most over-hyped movie of 2006 goes to ...",1.0,Anonymous,Music

It wouldn't had feel too honest.It was good to see Eddie Murphy back in which would be another of the redeeming factors of Dreamgirls.Dreamgirls is a good movie but is no Chicago.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Dreamgirls Good Enough, Jennifer Hudson Even Better","Let me be honest, here: I'm not a particularly big fan of movie musicals, and I don't like Motown music. The good news about Dreamgirls is that the Motown sound was far from prevalent. The bad news is that I still don't like movie musicals. But that doesn't mean I don't have anything good to say about this particular musical!In the 1960's, a certain theater in downtown Detroit was holding an amateur night. Among those vying for the chance a win would represent are a trio of young girls who call themselves the Dreamettes. Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) and Lorell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) act as back-up singers to the powerfully voiced Effie White (Jennifer Hudson, the former American Idol contestant in her acting debut). Unfortunately, the contest is fixed so despite their well-received performance, the girls don't win.The contest does result, however, in the Dreamettes' ability to capitalize on the fact that the current back-up singers for James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy) have quit in a huff over the bad behavior of the boss. Erstwhile manager wanna-be Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx) suggests that the Dreamettes fill in. Effie's not keen on the idea of singing back-up for anybody, but the girls recognize that this is likely their big break and, with support from Effie's songwriting brother C.C. (Keith Robinson), they take the job.Early's manager, Marty Madison (Danny Glover), is less than thrilled that somebody else is infringing on what should be his territory. Taylor, though, has matters well in hand. The used car salesman liquidates his entire inventory to collect enough cash to pay DJs to play some of Early's songs. In short order, Early is getting airplay, and Madison is out of the picture. But Taylor isn't done yet! He sees the Dreamettes as a group in and of themselves. He suggests they call themselves the Dreamgirls.Taylor also has one more suggestion: He wants the beautiful Deena to sing lead, and the more talented but less attractive Effie to continue being a back-up singer. It's a tough sell, but Effie eventually agrees and the trio is soon on the way to the top. But on their way there, the women fight; engage in ill-advised love affairs; suffer rude awakenings; and lose the desire for their dream even as it's coming true. Meanwhile, oblivious to all but money (Taylor) and fame (Early), the main men in their lives push the girls harder and harder until something's finally got to give.Jamie Foxx is no slouch as either an actor or singer and he does just fine as Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé Knowles is a pleasant surprise who embarrasses no one. She has a particularly notable moment as she sings the song ""Listen"" to the husband who won't (Knowles wrote the song, and has received a number of award nominations for it). Keith Robinson, Sharon Leal, Anika Noni Rose, and Danny Glover (who doesn't sing, thank God) are also good. But as repeated awards nominations tell you, the real stars of Dreamgirls are Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson.Eddie Murphy takes on the persona of Jimmy Early and rides it all the way to the top. His musical performances are top notch; his acting is perfectly pitched to be arrogant or self-destructive, fragile or very much the man in charge by turns. There are people who call this a comeback for Murphy and, though I'm not so sure he ever really left, I understand exactly what they're saying and they're right: Murphy is proving in Dreamgirls that he can rise to great heights to do real justice to such a part.For her part, Jennifer Hudson quite literally owns her role as Effie White. Not only does she have the considerable musical ability needed, but also the acting skills to truly appear vulnerable one minute and then, with visibly growing confidence, triumphant later on. Her defeats are devastating, and her every mannerism shows it; her highs are stellar, and we see all that, too. Consider everything you've heard about Hudson's rendition of the show's most famous tune, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Leaving."" Consider the myriad superlatives used by critics and audiences, virtually without exception, everywhere. And then consider this: She's even better than that. I was (and trust me, this doesn't happen often) emotionally overwhelmed and completely awed by Ms. Hudson's performance.Director and writer Bill Condon did a credible job of both (he also adapted Chicago for the big screen, and previously directed such well-received efforts as Kinsey and Gods and Monsters). In fact, there was only one moment that seemed more stage-like than screen worthy, and that frankly takes some doing. The sets were perfect, and the costuming  covering the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's  was spot on.In fact, the only thing I didn't like about Dreamgirls is that it's a musical. But that's just me. If you like musicals, you'll like this one. And if you appreciate good performances, there are several here that will keep you happy. My single best reason for you to see this movie, though, is to give you the chance to get in on a little piece of Hollywood history: there's a star being born right before your eyes in Dreamgirls, and her name is Jennifer Hudson. It's worth the price of the ticket and then some for that indelible moment alone.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Dreamgirls is rated PG-13 for ""language, some sexuality, and drug content."" That's probably about right, but parents also need to know that there's adultery, gambling, sleazy deals, bribery, and other unsavory activities depicted as well. If you don't particularly care to have your child see that sort of thing, then Dreamgirls probably isn't the movie for them. With that caveat, I think Dreamgirls is fine for girls (boys won't much like it) of about 14 and up as well as for most adults.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls,"Dream Girls The thing that attracted me about ""Dream Girls"" were not the three protagonist, nor Jamie Foxx or Eddie Murphy, but through it tailors it looked to me that it was an all black movie, which is rare to see and not many of such genre are made.This musical is the story of three girls  Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose who have dreams to make it big as a group and how they are picked up by a musical business tycoon Jamie Foxx to work with Eddie Murphy's troop, and how there is a split among these girls  because Jennifer who is a lead singer is sidelined for the beautiful Beyonce to appeal and sell the music. Many of these stories run parallel to each other, with rise and fall in their relationships, ups and downs in their careers. The tragedy of Jennifer Hudson's life was shown very touchingly. She loves singing but is neglected in utter poverty. In the end Jennifer gets to chance to sing as a lead singer and the dream girls fulfill their life long dream by getting together.All the actors have acted well. But two persons who steal the show are Jennifer Hudson  who portrays the range of emotions naturally - betrayal, anger, jealousy, sadness, happiness  and Jamie Foxx as a money minded business person, whose interest in life never ascends above measuring things only by money.The integration of musical score and the moving storyline is crafted beautifully and none of the songs jars our senses, but I especially got appreciative of the western classical score and the emotions depicted through them.Overall a different movie and a good movie too!

A Musical Joy,"A hugely enjoyable screen musical telling the story of the rise of all female, all black singing trio, ""The Dreamgirls"". An affectionate pastiche of the story of the ""Supremes"", a stellar cast portrays several characters contemporary to that era. For Berry Gordy see James Foxx, for Diana Ross see Beyonce Knowles, for James Brown see Eddy Murphy and for an Etta James / Florence Ballard/ Aretha Franklin composite see Jennifer Hudson. Director William Condon was shrewdly picked acknowledging his previous success as the writer for screen musical success ""Chicago"".An overwhelmingly black cast tells the story, set in Detroit, in two acts. Pre 1970 as the Dreamgirls struggle to make it, and post 1970, when the pitfalls of stardom bite. Adapted from the musical which was ""sung through"", this version is predominantly spoken with the original songs as stand-alone pieces. The songs themselves are superb, penned by Henry Krieger, predominantly with Tom Eyen. They effectively recall the sounds , songs, and themes of the time whilst updating the arrangements to resonate with a more contemporary idea of R&B. And all this is played out against a backdrop of Race Riots and racism.Danny Glover is wonderful as the manager who gets the group noticed only to be out hustled by smooth talking James Foxx as Curtis Taylor Jnr. But it is Jenifer Hudson as Effie White who steals the show. Her raw talent has to defer to the svelte good looks of Beyonce's Deena Jones, and her portrayal of the angst of first losing lead vocal, then her place in the band and her livelihood is compelling.Although the social context of this story is well made, it is the music and performances which dominate. Anyone with a love of the Motown / Philly sounds will love this.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Good Review From a Caucasian Gay Man,"First and foremost I have seen a lot of musicals in my life the ones I did not like the most we're mostly ones from the 40s and 50s.this movie cannot be compared to any other musical as it is the most original story and musical of its time.Though it is a TV adaptation of an old musical it is still a groundbreaking movie for many reasons.The music has a lovely old school r&b and funk sound with some amazing vocal artist who are actually actresses that nobody truly would have guessed could sing as well as they do.The story speaks of sisterhood betrayal love and a true undertone of how racism many singers of that day. Not only do I feel changed after seeing this as in the sense of understanding a different perspective of African American musician struggles from a time I was not born.I had no idea Eddie Murphy could sing so well. Beyonce shines with her vocal ability showing a side of her I've never known not even in Carmen a hip hopera. and the new Jennifer Hudson steals the stage with an amazing vocal talent and stage presence unlike any seen prior to this. the songs are beautiful unique and have a wonderful style in the instrumentation and the vocal presentation the lyrics may not be phenomenal but the Deliverance is.Unlike a lot of other musicals that choreography is settle because in the African American culture never does anyone have to compensate with choreography when the vocal ability outshines even the best choreography
this movie has rhythm and soul and a unique representation of a subtle true many have forgotten today.I encourage every person to see this movie who is a musical lover. Honestly I believe a lot of people don't like this movie because of racism. I personally know that a lot of racism exist today and though I'm not African American I was born in the ghetto and all my friends were I am also gay and it would discrimination feels like there is no reason to give this movie a 1 out of 10 I've seen way worse movies in this I give it a 10 out of 10 it deserves it this is not bias.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Strongly Cast Musical Strikes sour note,"I was extremely disappointed by Bill Condon's ""Dreamgirls"" which is being hyped as one of the year's best pictures. It is not, not even by a long shot.Dreamgirls starts out promising setting up numerous well defined characters and it very effectively places the story in the late 1950's. Period detail is amazing and at about the one hour mark the film looks destined for greatness.Then the cast starts singing.And singing.To make matters worse the songs are atrocious; one wonders if they are intended as camp or satire. If they be satire they go on far too long, if they are supposed to be the real thing then someone has a warped sense of humor or simply don't care that the audiences has to watch on as the film self destructs in the final act.The subject matter could have made a great film. Unfortunately by fictionalizing the account they rob the story of any authenticity. Very strong performances by Eddie Murphy and Jamie Fox simply languish before the entire ensemble cast folds up and dies.Why the film has received such rave notices is beyond me. Perhaps it is the sheer storytelling audacity in presenting a film that grows less realistic with the passage of each scene (Kind of like Olivier's Henry V in reverse)or it may be the fine cast. Most likely it is that these critics don't have an ear for music as these banal songs would be booed off the stage of even American Idol (as one of the actresses apparently was.)That should tell you something.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A Star is Born: Jennifer Hudson; And God bless Bill Condon,"If you want to see a movie that will lift your heart up and make you leave the theatre with a spring in your step, go see ""Dreamgirls."" Jennifer Hudson steals the show. That has to be said above all else. She is simply magical in this film. It's almost as if it was made for her. The girl can ACT, too. Her singing is sublime. What more can you say? She deserves an Oscar for this performance.Also terrific are Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Danny Glover, and Beyonce Knowles. Each if perfect in his or her role. I never knew Eddie Murphy could act THIS well, even though I always loved him. And while I have grown accustomed to Jamie Foxx being perfect at all he does, he showed great depth in this performance, showing how a good man could be drawn into becoming something he probably didn't mean to become. Danny Glover was just beautiful and perfect in his role. And I have to add that it was a delight to see Ken Page playing Max Washington. I had not seen Ken Page since ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" in which he was also brilliant. I wish we would see more of him in movies because he is a jewel.The performances are all perfection, but as was the case with the movie ""Chicago,"" we know that we have Bill Condon to thank for those spectacular performances coming together so effectively. Bill Condon is truly a genius, and if he doesn't win the Best Director Oscar this year, it will be a gross injustice. I can't wait to see what he makes for us to see next! Bravo! to everyone associated with this magnificent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Windbag of Forgotten Baggage,"The Dreamgirls machine is in full swing now that its won the Golden Globe. ""I'm sure it'll be advertised in 10 seconds""...that from a winning speech. And its so damn true. Good God, there is no shame with this crap. Beyonce sucked, Eddie Murphey was great and Jennifer Hudson has a voice. But the best in Musical/Comedy? I think not. The thing is a massive hype machine, sure to suck out all of the air, energy, life and imagination of what a musical can be. This massive hunk of crap is nothing but that. Crap. It is salvaged by Hudson's voice and Murphey's commitment.Other than that it is crap. Crap I wouldn't wish on any memory of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Liza Minelli, Dorothy Dandridge, Barbra Streisand, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Judy Garland, et. al.The vehicle is a Vespa when it should have been a Mercedes.

Eddie Murphy Sings!!!!!,"As a ""baby boomer"" and fan of the ""Supremes"", how could I not like a movie not-so-loosely based on the fantastic trio from the 60s. The ""Motown-type"" soundtrack was great, as was the casting and acting, especially Eddie Murphy who put his ""grinning Cheshire cat"" acting style on hold long enough to portray a very believable ""James Brown-type"" character. He richly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Newcomer and Golden Globe winner Jennifer Hudson can really wail in the R&B style of Aretha Franklin, and the make-up artists actually had her more attractive at the beginning of the film than co-star Beyonce. Ahhh. Beyonce. Absolutely one of the most breathtakingly beautiful women that I've ever seen...and she can sing and act. The only negative comment that I can make about this otherwise superb film is the editing. When the semi-documentary turned into a semi-musical with the actors singing their lines, many of the scenes with both Hudson and Beyonce went much too long and way too loud, as these ladies of superior lungs literally blew out my eardrums with prolonged singing/screaming, literally forcing me to stick my fingers in my ears to protect my hearing. But other than this slight inconvenience, the movie is a solid 9, and most will agree that it should have gotten the Best Picture nod along with its eight other Oscar nominations.",,Anonymous,Music
Would be Better on Stage,"I am a fan of the musical genre so I am always extremely excited when modern Hollywood attempts to make one, as musicals have become very scarce in American movies. When I heard about Dreamgirls I thought it was the perfect launching vehicle for Beyonce Knowles into films that achieve some critical acclaim as oppose to the endless boring date/comedies she has been churning out. Dreamgirls was a vibrant colorful movie that had a strong soap opera quality. The story was the basic framework of any movie about Hollywood hopefuls, friends sell out and use each other and forget about the artistry of their craft in order to become successful. I don't mind a movie having a generic storyline that one can figure out in the first twenty minutes as long as the film tries new and entertaining tools to bring new life to an old tale (much like Singin In the Rain). Unfortunately Dreamgirls did not, it never took a risk anywhere and never took a step above being a B movie. Jamie Foxx (The snake of a Manager) and Jennifer Hudson (The Forgotten Friend) steal the show but their characters feel more like stage characters then movie characters. Eddie Murphy is tremendous as a James Brown sort of performer who develops life ending drug habit but absolutely gets robbed of camera time and development, why did they kill of the most interesting character in the show half way through the movie. The biggest problem with Dreamgirls is that none of the songs were memorable, if your going to make a musical I have to at least remember one of the songs, I just saw the movie and I can' remember one except Jennifer Hudson's ""your gonna love me"" which isn't an original song. Dreamgirls did look great though as Bill Condon did a very nice job and the performances and outfits put me right into that time period. It also showed some promise for the career of Beyonce Knowles.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
An Enjoyable Musical Film,"I am not particularly a fan of this genre of music. However, I didn't have much problem sitting through this film. The story doesn't have anything much but the way it is presented is interesting enough to capture my attention. Jennifer Hudson is particularly good. At first I thought that she must be someone famous but then in the end I found that she's a new actress and I was like ""Wow!"" That scene when she sings ""I Am Telling You"" is very heart wrenching. I don't like this type of music but still I find this one very soulful,very expressing. I can feel that she sings what's in her heart.The rest of the cast did great job, too: Jamie Fox, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce, etc. And I love the song that Beyonce sings in the final part of the film (Listen To My Heart or something like that, sorry I forgot) The sight and sound is gorgeous as it should be.Although it's not a movie that I would like to keep for future watch,I like it much better than ""Hairspray"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Hard to say...,"When Stanley Kubrick was busy with his sex-exploring film ""Eyes Wide Shut"", people expected a blazing erotic passion throughout the film. When the film turned out to be a slow exploration of themes concerning sex, the audiences were frustrated, and liked it less as a result of it not being what was expected.I never entirely understood why this was so, but now I get it. This is my opinion on ""Dreamgirls"". I was expecting something like ""Ray""; an almost-accurate portrayal of the Supremes. What I saw was a fictionalized musical. Don't get me wrong, I liked Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson in this film, and they both deserved their nominations (Which is far more than I can say about Alan Arkin's win). The music was very well done, and the cutthroat music business run by Jamie Foxx' character was cleverly done.Due to my realization at it not being what I had thought it was, I watched the film with a bit of a biased look. The music was well done, but I didn't like it when the beginnings of some songs were portrayed as conversation. It frustrated me a bit, but I have no bad opinion about either Hudson's or Murphy's singing, the latter of which surprised me.Do not go into this film expecting a historical account like ""Ray""; expect something more along the lines of ""Fiddler on the Roof""; a musical set in a past era of troubles and mistrust.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly original!,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. The only reason I went to see it is b/c we got free preview tickets - I wouldn't have chosen to see it at the theater otherwise. I mean, how many times can you see Dreamgirls in a lifetime? But it was 100% worth it. I am tough on films, and even tougher on films with all-black casts, but this one did not disappoint. From the costumes, to the makeup, lighting, scene changes, dialogue, etc. it was all top notch. I got totally wrapped up into a story I already knew like the back of my hand. Several people in our theater audience stood up to applaud Jennifer Hudson's performance. This movie is one that you aren't quite ready to ever see end. Of all the performers, Jamie Fox seemed to be the one weak link. In several scenes he seemed to be waiting on a cue from someone offstage.

close,"this was generally a well mounted production but i came away feeling that it was good when it could have been great some of the music was regrettably lame film isn't Broadway and i think such things should be taken into consideration but for every song that made me cringe there were at least two that sold me beyond that, the major fault i found with the film was the cutting and camera movements in the musical sequences abundant cutting can help a scene's rhythm and feeling but my main feeling with musicals is that this rhythm and vivacity should be communicated by the performances the camera should be a passive observer this sort of cutting is better suited to music videos which only have a few minutes to leave their mark in a feature length film, it can be tiresome jennifer hudson's performance for her big song is everything it needs to be without however many cuts there are in the sequence the amount of camera movement also deemphasized movements that would have been more impressive had they not been lost in a sea of mobile framing (the arcing motion that leaves the dreams in a silhouette against an adoring audience)i'm not saying that there should be no cutting or movement in a musical sequence, but as these techniques are employed in this film, they distract from the real stars the cast was solid all around and the film's strongest asset hudson and murphy both dynamitei totally bought beyonce foxx made an excellent slimeball without completely abandoning our sympathy supporting players distinct, developed, fun and likable it's the sort of story that's been told a million times that's why i feel a story isn't necessarily as important as how its told the material here felt like it was exciting and important to all involved but it didn't entirely escape the clichés of its trappings, which i acknowledge is a tall orderi respected the film in general more than i liked it but keep trying Hollywood you might just make another real musical yet",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant talent wasted,"I can't believe that so much acting and singing talent went into making this dud. No amount of vocal gymnastics (and Dreamgirls is full of it, to the point that it becomes meaningless) could have brought off the film's tiresome succession of plastic, mass-produced songs with corny lyrics and barely a hint of the Motown sound. And no amount of skilled acting could have made anything out of the film's lifeless script and flimsy story line.Interestingly, one scene parallels what the film as a whole does: Edie Murphy has his new song stolen by the white recording industry, which sanitises it and removes all traces of soul from it to make it acceptable to the mainstream teenage audience of the day. This is exactly what Dreamgirls has done with the black music culture of the '60s and the Motown sound.The result is a film that's an emotional flat liner with characters and situations you simply don't care about. The filmmakers did do some good work, though, in recreating the look of the period.There was some really great music being made back then, but from this film you'd never guess it.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Also all this film does is show hundreds of montages of the girls doing well etc.. with some music playing in the background, I don't understand where the narrative enjoyment comes from, please Bill I want to see more about Martin Luther King and the Black revolution, not those crappy little girls singing again. I've had enough of films being rated on the marketing of the celebrities in it,not the quality of the film, who incidentally cannot act.

Terrific craft in service of a story I don't quite swallow,"This is an impressive film. The skill the filmmakers and virtually all of the performers put into the sprawling ensemble piece are all uniformly excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of watching the film -- especially the top-notch staging of the musical numbers and the way they were woven into the narrative more or less seamlessly.But half an hour after I left the theater, I didn't really care much about anyone. I had been properly and ably manipulated in the service of good entertainment -- but I hadn't truly been moved. I think the problem is two-fold:The film and it's source material can't decide how much of a musical/operetta it wants to be. Are we supposed to buy the characters breaking into song off stage even though it doesn't start to happen until halfway through? It feels like hedging bets rather than a strong choice.The second problem is that the characters are largely two-dimensional. The weakest link is the nemesis, the music producer. He has all the power in the story but you never know why. You can't admire his grit and acumen because it's never on display. And you can't condemn him as bad guy because he seems more a soulless cad than as someone with a truly tragic flaw. In other words, you don't really give a damn about him and you wonder why everyone else does.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"some things made it worth seeing, but I am just not a fan of musicals","Before you read the rest of this review, you should know that I have never really liked musicals (except for the Beatles' movies and ""West Side Story""). Therefore, if you really like musicals, you might as well just stop reading my review and find a review by a fan of musicals. But if you choose to learn what I think of ""Dreamgirls"", then here's what I say. While the movie does a good job in looking at some of the things involving the music of the era - such as white people co-opting black music and sanitizing it - I just don't believe in telling true stories as musicals. It gets a little tiresome to have a song every couple of minutes, even if the songs express people's frustration.Granted, the movie is not a zero. Far from it. The cast members all do quite well. Probably best of all is Jennifer Hudson. Her character is the type with whom you don't want to mess (and her Oscar win was the perfect spit in the face to ""American Idol""). Beyonce Knowles, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover also do well, but this is really Jennifer Hudson's movie.Still, this is not one that I would recommend above most others.

Dreamgirls,"Jennifer Hudson is simply superb in this musical roller-coaster of a film. She is ""Effie"" whom, along with ""Deena"" (Beyoncé Knowles) and ""Lorrell"" (Anika Noni Rose), form a trio of singers aspiring to fame and fortune. Along the way, they encounter the usual suite of difficulties - bigotry, racism and misogyny as well as having to deal with their own personal rivalries. They are signed by Detroit used car salesman ""Curtis"" (Jamie Foxx) to back his established, womanising, star ""James Early"" (Eddie Murphy) and soon their star seems fixed. That is, until ""Curtis"" decides to dispense with the services of the temperamental ""Effie"" and with those of ""Early"" as he sees his vision for these talented and enigmatic women really take off. At times, it does stray a little too close to domestic melodrama, but for the most part this is a cracking story of how these women prove their own mettle. They regale against the male-dominated music business; increasingly try to assert themselves not just in the industry but with their management but, towards the end, with there own personal relationships before a powerful and vindicating denouement. Henry Kriegen and Tom Eyon have written some strong and powerful lyrics for the ladies to belt out with aplomb, particularly the title song, ""It's All Over"" and the show stopping ""One Night Only"". The production detail, photography and general pace of the film really do make for an an engaging watch; the performances are vibrant and frequently the emotion they generate is compelling to watch. Foxx is not the best, to be fair - especially when he bursts into song, but Murphy fares a bit better on that front and all told, this is an entertaining look at just how these women took on and defeated a system and a society that was stacked against them from the start.

"Dance, Sing & Perform!","A film like 'Dreamgirls' can either make you feel bored or it can make you grove to it's glory. The history and evolution of American R&B music during the 1960s and 1970s, through the eyes of a Detroit, Michigan girl group known as ""The Dreams"" and their manipulative record executive, has nicely come alive on Screen.Director Bill Condon gets it right, as he directs this Out-and-Out Musical with energy. However, the over-dose of Songs & Lack of Drama at times might make you feel slightly dull. But the actual minus point in this actually well-made film, comes in it's running time.

Nonetheless, the striking performances, the energetic direction, and wonderful music remain with you more than it's flaws.Each song has a feel to it, though the songs run-in as a 129 minute long melody, they manage to remain with you. Performance-Wise: Eddie Murphy is Awesome. He truly delivers his finest performance here. Jennifer Hudson's Oscar-Winning performance seems justified, as she gets it right. Beyoncé Knowles is good and sizzles in each song gracefully. Jamie Foxx is earnest. Anika Noni Rose does a sincere job. Danny Glover is fine.

The World of Showbiz.,"'Dreamgirls' is a blues infused musical drama that was so believable, it felt like I was watching a documentary.The film follows the careers of singers Deena (Beyonce), Effie (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose) - collectively 'The Dreamettes', and later 'The Dreams'. When they fail to win a local talent competition, manager Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) decides to give them a chance to perform by hiring them to do the backing vocals for established singer Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy). Soon their careers take off to unimaginable heights.But with fame and fortune comes many challenges, and the film explores the fab and the drab of the music industry as it was back in the 60's. Jennifer Hudson did a fantastic job as Effie. There's one scene in particular where her vocals blew me away. This scene was vocally and visually stunning!I must confess to not being a big fan of Jamie Foxx, but I thought he was rather good and well suited in the role of musical mogul Curtis Taylor. Eddie Murphy was energetic and likable as always.'Dreamgirls' boasts wonderful costumes, excellent editing, a good script, well performed musical numbers, and loads of humour and drama.

OK but long,"A superb cast with Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, and of course the Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson make Dreamgirls a musical drama worth watching.

The payola aspect of the radio industry is well known and is a part of the early success of many musical acts just starting out. It is not sugar coated here. The back stabbing and wheeling and dealing are all included in Dreamgirls. The major problem is that at over two hours it drags a bit. The huge number of actors is overwhelming and tiring. The music is good and the leads are interesting enough for a thumbs up.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Apart from some great performances, not incredibly special","Dreamgirls is the perfect example of a film where people just didn't make enough decisions going into and thus provided little to no cohesion throughout. While there are some fantastic performances and some great songs, as a film Dreamgirls is nothing noteworthy.The film follows three girls from 1960's Detroit as they make a name for themselves in the music industry, first as backups to a well known soul singer, then as a group in their own right. Along the way they face the difficulties of white musicians taking their material to make a hit for themselves, a radio industry that only played music when bribed and the cynical nature of the modern music industry where image counts more than sheer talent.In terms of making a good snapshot of what the music industry was like at the time, Dreamgirls succeeds on many levels. Unfortunately, while the storyline is interesting, it is simply not presented very well. The writing is lackluster at best, and the direction is often aimless and unfocused. In fact, the ending is incredibly weak and terribly directed. What was clear of Jamie Foxx's character's predicament at the end is pushed to ridiculous lengths as if director Bill Condon thought the audience would be too stupid to figure it out.The most notable element of this is the fact that in the beginning of the film, the only music was that of the performers while on stage. Then about 1/3 of the way, characters started to sing their dialog. And once it seems like the director has settled on this, in the last third he cuts it down so that only certain lines are sung. It is as if he didn't really know what he wanted to do going into the film and then experimented with different concepts at different times of the movie. Thus, as a musical it fails, and as a talkie with musical sequences it is confusing.However, the real strength of the film is the performances which make the film worth watching. While this was certainly billed as Beyonce Knowles' breakout film, the film clearly belongs to Jennifer Hudson whose incredible vocal range -- on full display in this film -- is matched only by her dramatic skills. She certainly deserved her Oscar as she completely owns this film from beginning to end. The real story is Eddie Murphy, whose performance in this film reminded me of the dramatic breakout of Bill Murray in Lost In Translation. Murphy has never been so powerful in a role and his presence is a blessing for this film.All in all, Dreamgirls is a case of 'what could have been' more than anything. With jarring inconsistencies throughout and very weak direction, it does not stand up as a great film in any regards save the incendiary performances. Jennifer Hudson has guaranteed herself a long career with what is certainly the standout debut of recent years and Eddie Murphy has proved beyond any degree of doubt that he is more than the funny-man. However, the performances do not do enough to save what is ultimately a letdown of a film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Music Compromised,"28 December 2006. The best musical since Chicago won its Oscar, Dreamgirls fails to capture its full potential due to its cinematic approach to its excellent material. The direction of this movie was confusing and this resulted in a question as to whether this movie was a drama with music or really a musical. An overly ambitious project, there were too many characters to focus on adequately and many of the needed dramatic, continuity was lost among the many subplots going on. Many stand alone musical numbers really hit the charts and Jennifer Hudson shown well as a soloist actress/singer. Courageously, both Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx took parts of less than musical heroes while the female roles seemed to be underdeveloped. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Dream BIG,"Dreamgirls is a great movie, with a killer soundtrack, an ensemble cast of talented actors and an impressive production design that makes you dive into the vibe the movie gives.As much as I don't like Musicals (again, except for The Blues Brothers. West Side Story is also great but has it's own downs). I gotta give praises to Dreamgirls for all the sayings above. The only complaint I have is that just like any other musical, the characters don't know when to shut up and stop singing. Every 5 to 10 minutes there must be someone to sing or dance.Based on the Broadway musical and the musical group 'Diana Ross and The Supremes.' The film follows the tale of A trio of Black female soul singers rising to fame and facing personal struggles. I do love stories that tell 'The Rise and Fall of ...' yet this film actually ends on a happy note which I'm also glad for.The whole production design and sets as I mentioned are fantastic, really colorful and impressive. The transition between scenes from a simple practice of the trio to a live performance is so clean and superb. The Hairstyling for Deena Jones (Beyonce) is great and fits her well with every outfit design.The cast of actors is amazing and each one gives 100% of a performance, Jamie Foxx portrays a villain unlike any other could have. Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson are Top Tier, both their performances are filled with emotion and enthusiasm. Hudson deserved her academy award and Beyonce's performance of the song 'Listen' is powerful. In Addition, her resemblance in the film to Diana Ross is shockingly good.To me, the real surprise was Eddie Murphy. His performance as James 'Thunder' Early is hilarious and surprisingly touching. Sure, his character cheats on everyone and uses drugs, yet something about him is vulnerable and I enjoyed watching Murphy take on a serious role. He should have won the academy award for Best Supporting Actor in 2006 if it wasn't for Alan Arkin in 'Little Miss Sunshine'.Although, Being a Scorsese fanatic, I probably would have given my vote to Mark Wahlberg in 'The Departed'.Overall I enjoyed this film and loved it's great soundtrack, the whole vibe and music from the 60s and 70s must have persuaded me but I mostly enjoyed the story and characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson Is Wonderful,"I love DreamGirls but I felt that Jennifer Hudson should have been nominated for best actress instead of Beyonce . I know this is based on popularity . Everyone in the movie theaters have been standing up for Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy performances not Beyonce . Beyonce was not the best actress in that movie and it is shame that Jannifer Hudson has to take a lesser win .I saw that movie twice and each time I was moved by Jennifer Hudson and her singing and acting . She played a strong character that has not been seen on the big screen in a while . She had the most dramatic change because to be in character she needed to pack on 20 pounds for her role . She played a character that the everyday woman could relate with on a daily basis . She played a character that did not meet the society body image of beauty which happens all the time in the entertainment industry . The nominations that are coming out for this movie is playing that same stereotype that Beyonce is the most gorgeous actress with out strong acting talent but we are going to still give her a best actress nomination and give Jennifer Hudson the supporting role but was the strongest actress with acting and singing skills . When will society change? From my reviews of the audience they were raving for Jennifer Hudson , Eddie Murphy , and Jamie Fox .",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I suspect the show is better,"Heavy going, soapy and convoluted pseudo-biopic that seems trapped in some sad limbo between straight movie and an actual musical.It has its moments and there's a lot of rich personality in this story of plucky musicians rising from rags to riches but it never feels like more than a fantasy. Eddie Murphy just steals the show and the whole plot is not particularly enjoyable to follow or remember and it just seems to be ticking boxes. I can't help but feel it would have worked better as a TV show, not that I would have stuck with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved it,"""I am tough on films, and even tougher on films with all-black casts, but this one did not disappoint."" Does this reviewer have any idea what a racist they are? I am stunned by statements like this one.The film is brilliant, start to finish. Jennifer Hudson was perfection as an understated Effie. Jamie Foxx was quite good... I never saw him waiting for a cue. Eddie Murphy was a surprise-- I've never been a huge fan of his but his Jimmy was excellent. Beyonce was the weak link in my opinion... she's gorgeous and of course she's a fantastic singer. But her acting was uneven.This is Jennifer Hudson's movie, and she deserves a leading actress nomination.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Effective,"A highly effective facade of one of the most fascinating girl groups to come out of Motor City. This movie has great musical numbers. A love triangle. Some fantastic performances that span decades. Rollicking music. It moves fast and hard, and those who suffer attention deficit, you won't even realize you've moved on to the next era, less you blink. This movie is tops. A fine production that takes a stage play and makes it cinematic (which are often disastrous).I did have a single issue though, some of the music...sounds very much like a orchestrated or ""fake"" version of what is presumably the song they are mimicking. Some of the tunes will be VERY familiar. Specifically a segment where this bizarro version of the Jackson 5 do a number for t.v. It's somewhat unsettling. Like when they make up fake NFL teams for a football movie. Just feels a little off.Otherwise, a solid musical movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sooooooooooooo bad it was funny!,"Soooooooooooo disappointing, and yet funny, for all the wrong reasons. If you hated Evita, you'll know what I'm talking about! This movie was so bad that every time they started to sing dialogue - particularly in the highly dramatic moments - most of the audience broke into fits of laughter! It got to the point where the audience was groaning 'no more singing' in unison and others started ringing their friends on their mobiles to listen to the audience cracking up... Have no idea where they tested this - but it seriously needed a lot of editing (it could have been a great movie). With the exception of the songs at the start of the movie, most of the songs sounded the same. At one point a character complains that they're 'taking the soul out of my music man' - what soul? Most of the songs sounded like really, really, really bad 80s crap - and yet it was meant to be set in the 60s & 70s. Even when standing in line for the loo after the movie, everybody was laughing at how bad the film was. How this was even nominated for an award I'll never know! I love a good musical - but this isn't one of them! Did someone say 'Howard the Duck'?",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Fantastic,"The movie is long...the third act lingers and the dialogue gets stale. But by the time we arrive here we have already become attached to the lives and story of these folks. There is not one weak performance..there are several standouts.

I cannot for the life of me remember cheering halfway through a musical number, not on Broadway..and certainly not in a movie theater. But I did, and you will...and at the end of the movie you will clap loudest for her, but only after doing so for all the other actors that made this a truly memorable experience.

"Great Music, obviously","Musical biopics are hard to make because so often there is a lack of good story structure, since it's real and it spans many years.

"Practically ""The Effie White Story""","Maybe because of this heightened hype and expectation, the movie turned out to be a disappointment of sorts. I was able to hear the movie soundtrack way before the movie was shown. I was surprised that all the big songs (""And I Am Telling You"", ""I Am Changing"" and ""One Night Only"") are by one singer only, Jennifer Hudson. And she was nominated and won for Bet Supporting Actress! Upon watching the movie, Jennifer Hudson's Effie White is practically the lead character in Dreamgirls in terms of her story arc. She could have won based solely on her powerful ""And I Am Telling You"" number.The actual Dreams songs were forgettable and bland, nothing like the classic songs of the Supremes (the supposed inspiration for this musical). When you watch the movie, you will understand that this was indeed the intention of their manager Curtis Taylor, Jr. (underplayed by Jamie Foxx) to have cute pop confections that could cross over to the white audience. In fact, Deena Jones (Beyonce) was chosen as lead singer because of the commonplace quality of her voice, as well as her beauty (showcased to the hilt with close-ups).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A good musical ...,"This was a reasonably good movie, but it's probably much better live on stage. The music, story and characters were kind of interesting, but for me, not significantly so.Basically, this story of a fictional R&B girl group of the 1960s. We see their start and progression in the music industry over time. There are clear allusions to actual groups (most notably the Supremes) and the evolution of the music industry.The movie was interesting, but I'm not sure what I got out of it. There was nothing really new and the story was sometimes confusing; it jumps forward in time without any warning, and you just have to figure that out each time.Even though I think the movie was only marginally good, it clearly appealed to many other people. My recommendation is to watch the trailer and if it looks worthwhile - you'll probably like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Good Musical,"A trio of black female soul singers cross over to the pop charts in the early 1960s, facing their own personal struggles along the way.Apparently this was a Broadway musical first. I never saw that, but I can see it working very well in that medium. But it also works as a view of history through the 1960s, showing how black artists had to struggle. (As one character points out, ""Hound Dog"" was not a big hit until Elvis Presley took it.) There was certainly a difference between what was expected from black and white stars.This also works as sort of a build-up to the documentary ""20 Feet From Stardom"". How many great singers were stuck doing nothing more than backup for other singers or bands?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Grammy-worthy music,"Maybe the best music quality of any movie I have seen. Every soundtrack can put its name on the billboard top 50. All the songs perfectly fit to the story as well. And the vocals.. OMG. What a casting! Beyonce, Hudson, Broadway star Anika Noni Rose, Foxx, and Murphy.. They are 'known' for their vocal talents. It's a also great mix of established actors and newcomers. The acting of Hudson and Beyonce is a pleasant surprise. Stage settings and costumes really bring out the atmosphere of 60s. Some of the covers of 'The Supreme' are spotted, and through the costume of Beyonce, I can see the glimpse of Diana Ross. An art director really put his or her effort to reflect vibrant colors and glamour in 60s.Of course, people praise the music because its extraordinariness is obvious. However, the story development is flavorful as well. The formation, conflict, and disbandment of 'The Supreme', the history of Motown Records, the relationship between music industry and the race, the decline of Detroit in 60s and 70s... There are so many things to pick up on, but the movie never distracts from the main story line, Effie, Deena, and 'Dreams', keeping it all neat.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Hype Works! Excessively Overrated Movie Screams: 'Wait for the DVD!',"A brief comment on Bill Condon's ""Dreamgirls"":The Hollywood Hype Machine has won. With over 100 comments just 4 days after the film's opening, I normally wouldn't care about adding my own. But it's very alarming to see how excessively overrated this movie is. It has a few entertaining moments and one amazing vocal number at best so I seriously question the multiple nominations and critical praises piled on it. Sure, the Golden Globes isn't really Cannes or the New York Film Critics but as the supposed predictor of that American institution called the Oscars it leaves a big question mark on its credibility as an award-giving body. Could it be that some got too carried away by Jennifer Hudson's Cinderella story? Hudson's (as Effie White) number ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" is monumental, earth-shattering, but the rest of the movie is so mediocre even this level of greatness barely makes it enough reason to watch the movie. Some of the songs are downright cheesy (in a bad waya very bad cringe-worthy way, esp. that horrible 'family' song). Hudson is an amazing singer and I've been a fan since ""American Idol"", too, but does her acting deserve a nomination? A showcase role plus an amazing singer doesn't equal good acting. By 'showcase role' I mean it's good for showing off 'acting' but when you take a close look at it, it's but a 2-dimensional prototype, a caricature: the wronged, occasionally 'crazy', strong black woman. It's not that often we see minority actors shine in big budget Hollywood. Can we at least be original? Charismatic Eddie Murphy, handsome leading man type Keith Robinson, and, yes, even that eye candy named Beyonce occasionally make this film tolerable but there's so much empty hype to swallow neither these three nor Hudson can save it. Don't believe the Publicity Machine, this film doesn't even make it as a good popcorn movie. ""Dreamgirls"" is middle-of-the-road, likable in parts at best, but ultimately a good example of an over-promoted Hollywood product which doesn't deliver as promised.

Nice musical...,"""Dreamgirls"" is a nice musical movie in which we are back in 1960's where we have a trio of black female soul singers who are trying really hard to succeed. Also we get into their lives and in their relationships.I pretty liked this movie even though I do not like musicals because of the cast and their interpretations. Jamie Foxx who played as Curtis Taylor Junior was for one more time magnificent such Eddie Murphy who played as James 'Thunder' Early was. I liked also the interpretations of Jennifer Hudson (won the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role), about Beyoncé Knowles I have to say that was not as good as I hoped to but it was OK. One more thing that I liked in this movie was the costumes of the actors and of course the music.Finally I have to say that ""Dreamgirls"" is a good musical movie and a simple one. If you are a fan of musicals then I believe that you will love it, if you are not then it would be something different but nice.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Bad music combined with relentless clichés,"A musical about rhythm and blues with no rhythm and blues. Dreamgirls had one song in it - the same pathetic - not funky - tuneless and grooveless schmaltz from beginning to end, and it was forgettably derivative. Actually, it would have been an improvement if you could actually recognize it as derivative. The music was as soulless as the ""white"" versions of R & B the movie was trying to parody. It would make Berry Gordy or James Brown cringe to have someone think this pap was in any way representative of what they were doing. Awful stuff.Piled on top of soulless characters and relentless cliché, and then extended for at least an hour (or was it five) beyond what anyone could possibly sit still for - it made for a pretty tedious evening.A lot of talent was wasted putting this mess together...",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoy!,"To compete at all with Moulin Rouge or Chicago, a musical in film must be robust and unique with actors beautiful and talented. Dreamgirls is a lively staging of the famous Broadway musical about three gifted girls who make it big with the help of a sometimes ruthless manager.Could be the Supremes or the Pips, but these actresses carry plenty of their own charisma, especially the American Idol graduate, Jennifer Hudson,as Effie, who belts gospel and pop with equal measures of lustiness and soul, a combination of Ella Fitzgerald and Barbra Streisand.For the male leads, Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is a believable manager, but Eddie Murphy steals the show as aging pop star James ""Thunder"" Early, slightly less manic than the late James Brown but maybe not less ruthless. Taylor morphs James Early and the Dreamettes from R&B into pop and the wealth that attends to the wider audience appeal. Although he changes the big-boned lead from Effie to the whiter,slimmer Deena (Beyonce), and marries Deena, the successful triumvirate struggles with their wealth and loss of the robust Effie, who suffers most of all.It's all the stuff of American popular glory and tragedy, but entertaining beyond the clichés and hyped-up show stopping songs such as ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,"" ""One Night Only,"" ""When I First Saw You,"" and ""Cadillac Car.""It's glitz and superficiality with a heavy dose of melodrama, but it is as American as that Caddy.

pretty good songs with just OK plot,"This movie was fairly good. It certainly isn't the best musically to come along in the past several years. For starters, it sorely lacks a little comedy. And I didn't think any of the characters were that great; I didn't want to root for any of them. I thought Jennifer Hudson sang the 2 best songs in the film. I really liked changing. I thought it was weird how most of the time the songs were part of the music act, then they would start having the characters sing as they were talking to each other and arguing. It seemed out of place. Beyonce Knowles wasn't anything great. She sure doesn't capture the screen like a leading lady should. Even though Eddy Murphy was over the top, he probably did the best acting.FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing, just not as good as Chicago or Mulin Rouge.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Overlong with some lack of drama in the story, but the soundtrack and performances are incredible","Dreamgirls drew me in for my love of musicals, a good cast and a promising director. And I personally found it a decent film. Perfect? No. Terrible? Again, no.It is overlong, with some scenes in the middle that drag and some that have a lack of drama to them. The quality of the script is also uneven, with some funny, touching and witty parts, and then some that feel forced and underdeveloped.However, while Dreamgirls is not as strong an overall film as Gods and Monsters and Kinsey, Bill Condon brings a lot of energy into his direction. The beginning of the film is interesting and well paced and the finale is even better.Visually, it is a very beautiful-looking film, with glossy (but not too much) production values and good editing.The soundtrack is simply incredible, there is lots of it and all of it is memorable and worthwhile, especially Jennifer Hudson's numbers. Beyoncé's Listen is also well worth a mention, what a powerful and meaningful song that is. And what can I say about the performances. Hudson proves she can act as well as sing, Beyonce sizzles, Jamie Foxx is suitably earnest and Anika Noni Rose is believable with a character that grows throughout the film.Eddie Murphy was a revelation. I have very rarely if at all have seen this softer side to him, but looking at him here you wouldn't know that. True, his singing while far from bad is not as good compared to Hudson and Beyonce, but you don't mind when his acting is as good as it is.Overall, I liked it even with its imperfections. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The cast are undeniably talented - the acting is authentic, the vocals are powerful and the performances are riveting.

"A Good Film, But too Many Songs!!!","Going into ""Dreamgirls"" I didn't know what to expect. It has a great cast, great production design, a decent plot,good singers, and only one really major problem. There are too many flashy musical numbers.""Dreamgirls"" is all about Motown music. It's very flashy, very over-the-top, and very much over-filled with crowd-pleasing moments. The movie has a lot of deep themes about racism, weight problems, and drug abuse. The problem is, the movie is coated with so much glamor and glitz that these ideas can't really shine through as well as they should.The songs in the movie are very numerous, popping up almost every other second. Some of them are fitting and fun, especially the Jennifer Hudson songs. However, there are a lot of random musical numbers that occur in the middle of conversations. There are also some that seem like out-of-place sickly sweet show-tunes. What saves this film from being destroyed by these ridiculous and lengthy numbers is the star-studded cast.Jennifer Hudson is lovable, sassy, powerful, and heart-driven as Effie White. Her rendition of ""And I am Telling..."" is breath-taking. A lot of the people in the theater where I saw the movie were bawling their heads off. Hudson's performance is nicely complimented by Eddie Murphy's over-the-top rendition of Jimmy Early. He should've nabbed the Oscar for his great singing and dancing,as well of his showing of Early's darker side.The funny thing about the acting in this movie is that the two main supporting roles (Murphy and Hudson) overshadow the two leading roles (Foxx and Beyonce). Jamie and Beyonce are both good, but they're acting as overall shallow characters, and have no real connection. Still, this is part of a major theme in the film, and their restrained performances do make sense.Overall, ""DreamGirls"" is no ""Chicago"", but it is a well-acted and fun piece of work.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

The Supremes and much of Motown was working-class excellence, music that would last 50 years and never go stale.Beyonce?

Jennifer Hudson is a great performer, but her talent is wasted on this insipid musical pablum. The second greatest weakness of the movie is the plot, which is practically non-existent.

"""Dreamgirls"" - Music & lyrics","I don't normally like musicals and as such, went into ""Dreamgirls"" thinking it was a fictional take on the real-life rise of soul singer Diana Ross and her former song-group The Supremes, except that it had singer Beyonce' Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose in the parts, and show business talents like Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy were there to keep everybody in line. It's a fairly good take on the crossover of black artists into the white mainstream music scene the mid-20th century, when music was still segregated. I thought it was going to be a biopic (sort of), with no music and song performances (well occasionally, like stuff we see on stage, rather than just random musical numbers). I can honestly say that ""Dreamgirls"" is probably one of the first musicals I can actually sit through, which is good. I must say that the actresses (especially Knowles as Deena Jones and Hudson as Effie) project their voices flawlessly, and their performances work. I can lastly say that writer/director Bill Condon has done a good job of adapting Tom Eyen's original Broadway hit for the screen. But like I said earlier, I don't normally like musicals but this one was pretty good, with good music and music numbers, and a production that also captured the rise of black music and its crossing over into the white mainstream.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Saturday afternoon musical spectacular,"In many ways I wish more time had been written over the story (it is a bit like a trailing story rolling through the lives of these 3/4 female singers). Also, the way the words of the songs they performed reflected so closely the situation in the film made it a bit cheesy and there was a period in the middle where there were just too many songs sung about what was happening, such that I was about to stop watching. In some ways I wish this had been done with similar songs, but not as a musical.The singing doesn't really reflect the period (more like beyoncé style ballads) however, this film has a lot of positive aspects..I absolutely hate Eddy Murphy and actively avoid all films he is in, but on this occasion I felt he was very good and filled the role perfectly. Jennifer Hudson is one of my favourite actresses, and she didn't disappoint, and she sung some stunning songs. Indeed, you really get your money's worth when it comes to the number of songs, and despite not having the most profound lyrics, some are very touching and make up for the weak depth of the story (and this weird superficial reference to the civil rights movement and I think Vietnam, but it never really became part of the film).It is maybe targeted at 18-25 year old women, especially beyoncé fans, who will love this film. As a 42 year old man, despite being bored in parts, and despite the above criticisms, and despite the fact that I will forget the film by tomorrow, at the end I can say I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and it was a real Saturday afternoon pleasure.

More than a musical and less than an opera,"This is more than a musical and less than an opera. Since most—that is a HUGE part—of it is related through music rather than dialogue, I don't know what category to place it in. Perhaps that fact alone is what makes me feel ambivalent about it. So, let's just call it a new sub-genre of musically related story telling..It basically relates the story of Motown from the early 60s through the mid-70s (with a slight bit on the disco craze of that period). When I stop to think of it, the story of Motown is not only important to America's Musical and Performing Arts history, it is also highly entertaining in this format.The story is told through several interacting sub-stories with at least three great male stars: Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, and Danny Glover. Foxx plays the heavy as he lures in talented young girls and then controls their careers and their lives by making them perform his way--in his media and venue, and with his choice of songs. Further, he can not only make them stars but he can break them too. While Foxx plays the heavy (Satan figure), Danny Glover plays the old-man-with-a-big-heart role (the angel figure). Glover's character helps them start their careers; picks them up when they are down; and tries to get them together or make a comeback. Finally, Eddie Murphy plays the role of the Jester. He is a lovable fool who doesn't seem to know his talent or its limitations. He also doesn't know himself too well either.The four 'Dreamgirls' all have different stories in the movie. Although I am not familiar with them as actresses, they are all great singers. Of course, all eyes this year are on newcomer, Jenifer Hudson, for her role as Effie White. Still, Beyoncé Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, and Sharon Leal are great as the other three dreamgirls.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Delightful numbers, Hudson, Murphy excellent","After you cut through the electrifying songs and dazzling choreography in Bill Condon's story of a Detroit girl band struggling to succeed in the sixties and seventies, you're left with a fairly typical rise-and-fall story, but because of the powerful performances turned in by the phenomenal Jennifer Hudson (who won an Oscar) and the dynamic Eddie Murphy (who was nominated for one), the movie rises above typical showbiz biopics, even the fake ones.The Dreamettes are Effie (Hudson), a bombastic diva with a strong voice; Deena (Beyonce Knowles), a willowy, softer touch; and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), the youngest of the bunch. They're not succeeding on the local talent-show circuit, so they hook up with the famed James ""Thunder"" Early (Murphy) to perform as his backup singers, which doesn't sit too well with Effie. They're coached along by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), who attempts to mold them into crossover artists, leaving the placid world of the R&B charts behind for the bigger fame and fortune of the nationwide pop charts.Naturally, as some stars rise, others must fall. Early's great, and wildly charismatic, but he's not always what Curtis wants in a star who can appeal to a wide audience. Sowing the seeds of his own destruction, Jimmy falls prey to the usual pitfalls of stardom - money, drugs, and the knowledge that he's no longer the man of the moment. Meanwhile, the Dreamettes are persevering, first as his backup trio and then on their own, conquering what was somewhat deprecatingly called the chitlin circuit. Curtis has grander plans, though; he wants his charges to eventually play Miami, a place far away from Detroit, a place where, as Curtis tells Jimmy, they won't even let black people wait on tables. (Remember, this is in the early sixties.) The movie is based on a Broadway musical, so the songs and choreography - all wonderful - are derived directly from the stage presentation; this may seem a little strange, because given the setting (Motown in the sixties), it seems like there should be bona fide R&B hits coming at you, although admittedly a lot of the songs do sound similar to chart-toppers from that time. In fact, the fashion styles and the songs remind you very strongly of some (figurative) heavyweights in the field at that time: Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross. (It's been said that the Dreamgirls were supposed to be The Supremes, but the movie was merely inspired by the real-life Supremes, which explains why there aren't more real-life names bandied about in the movie; it's not biographical story.) There's no question that Hudson, in her first role, and Murphy, the longtime comedy-film veteran, truly sparkle in their roles and were each deservedly nominated for Academy Awards (Hudson won; Murphy lost to Alan Arkin). As for Hudson - she can SING. I mean, she belts out the tunes with a fantastic mixture of passion, guts, and anger, as best befitting her largely (no pun intended) unhappy character, Effie. And when you watch Murphy, you completely forget he once recorded a song called ""(My Girl Wants to) Party All the Time,"" and the singer he most reminds you of is James Brown. He's spectacular.Not so spectacular was Foxx as Curtis Taylor; he was far too low key and, well, morose. He's somewhat believable in turning from a naif in the music world to a cutthroat businessman, but he lacks the screen presence - the panache - to really pull it off. Denzel Washington was reportedly offered the role but declined on the grounds that he can't sing - although I'm sure dubbing wouldn't have made a huge difference.Still, it's not much to carp about. The songs are perfect, and the final number is a huge showstopper that'll leave you clapping for more.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Vibrant, intense, colorful.","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I decided to see this movie. I knew it was a musical but I honestly thought it was based on the life of the Supremes, a group of American soul singers. Is not true. The film is based on a Broadway musical that portrays the rise of a group of singers that was inspired by the Supremes. Perhaps that is why the film immediately lost some points for me. But that does not mean that the film is bad! On the contrary, it has immense quality.Being a musical film, music is at the center of everything. The film has a vast soundtrack and the songs follow one after another for more than two hours in length, as if it were an Italian opera. The production spared no effort in this field, making the most of the powerful set of voices that it enlisted for the film. Beyoncé, for her fame and solid career as a pop singer, is probably the most resonant name on the poster, but I personally thought that Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy were perfectly capable of matching and accompanying her. Murphy was, by the way, surprising because his musical side is not something that stood out in my eyes until I saw this film. Some of the songs are in the ear and are truly memorable, as is the case with ""Listen"", ""Move"" and ""Patience"".Bill Condon ensured an efficient and capable direction, but not always without blemish. To begin with, the film is a little too long for the story that it tells and drags on several times. I also felt that Condon sometimes sacrificed the script at the expense of the visuals and music. This is always a mistake, in my opinion. It is useless for a film to look beautiful and have beautiful music if the story is not solid and, in fact, with so much music it was difficult to follow the plot and there are moments when it seems to stumble, being overshadowed by music and visual brightness. There are still some parts of the plot that sound bad or have been frankly underdeveloped.The cast is notable and full of heavyweights. I already talked a little about them but I will mention a few things again: Beyoncé sang wonderfully and proved to be solid enough as an actress when she wants to; Eddie Murphy surprised by showing his musical side, but also maintained a very strong dramatic interpretation. Being used to seeing him in comic roles, it was really interesting to see him work here. Jamie Foxx is good but I think he had little screen time to show everything he is worth. Anika Noni Rose had a discreet and slow start but was given more time and material to show value as the film evolved. Finally, we have to give a standing ovation to the devastating Jennifer Hudson. If Beyoncé was graceful when singing, Hudson showed power. What voice! And what a great actress! Her performance is truly, in itself, a reason to see this film.Technically, I would positively highlight the excellent sets and costumes, which were able to take advantage of and bring to the cinema the glamor and brilliance of the musical world of the 50s and 60s. Cinematography also helped, with the bet on vibrant colors and fast filming, which seems to be able to keep up with the songs. Of course, in deeper or more reflective moments, cinematography changes radically, with a bet on deeper colors and a more calming look. But these are not new, they are cinematographic techniques that have always been used.The film was acclaimed when it came out and received immense nominations for the Oscars and Golden Globes that, of course, did not translate into automatic prizes. Hudson really deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and the overall quality of the film guaranteed the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing. It also received several nominations for Best Original Song, and I still don't understand how it lost that statuette for a documentary where the strong point is far from music and the winning song, despite being very good, it doesn't seem as good or rich as any of the nominated outputs of this film.Intense, vibrant, with a powerful set of voices, songs and interpretations, this film is unavoidable for musical lovers and is worth it for its overall quality, despite not being free from flaws or problems. Personally, and despite feeling a little disappointed in my expectations since I expected a story based on a real music group, I believe it was worth it and that I was able to enjoy the best that this film has to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Who's great idea was this?,"Tired of Beyonce, was this a 60's movie or a 2000 movie? or am I confused? I liked this movie when it was called ""Cinderella"" or was it, ""Grease""? or was it ""Pretty Woman""? or was it ""9 to 5""? I can't remember, but I sure can remember the pain and agony I felt for the first few hours of this movie. Oscars, Golden Globes? Ridiculous! I was waiting for Eddie Murphy to sing his hit, ""Party all the time"". Unfortunately, all the songs he sang were worse. At least lip readers would have no problem following Beyonce's over-enunciation of the English language. Next time, let's not recycle the same actors and actresses, let's get a few new faces in there. Jamie Foxx, you've hit your limit.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
greatest movie i've seen in ages,"to start off this movie is great. the start is a little slow. but when it gets going it is a masterpiece. the songs are great and while there is plenty of them they compliment and help tell the story. acting was great, beyonce and jennifer give very strong performances and pretty much carry the movie. the setting of 1950 detroit was a great setting in showing the contrast between the famous and rich to the streets were it is a totally down trodden, while the whole story also shows the attitude's of the 50's were native Americans are treated as lesser beings than white people, in that there music isn't widely released, and the work it took for the dreams to finally get famous. all in all this movie is a great piece of entertainment and the movie will stay with you long after it is finished.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What do the critics see that I don't?,"I took my wife and daughter to see this movie and we all agreed that it was one of the worst movies we have seen in years? This so called musical, sounds like they are singing the same song over and over! Jennifer Hudson, & Eddie Murphy are very good, but Jamie Foxx & Beyoncé are totally wasted. It is hard to come up with a lot of positives for this movie, and as my late grandmother used to say - if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all! With those words of wisdom in mind I'll just say the following -If you like hearing the same song over, and over, and over, then you will just love this movie. If not, save your money!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Does what it set out to do, but didn't let us know ahead of time","The latest musical to woo Hollywood came as this soul singing period piece, based off a Broadway production chronicling a decade of conflict revolving around these three ""Dreamgirls"" and their management. Judged strictly on the strength of this film being classified as a musical, the rambunctiously long parade still gets a passing grade. At times these songs feel unwarranted, excessive, repetitious and showy, but there is still no denying the laborious arrangements behind them to guide this trio along with audience delight. Possibly the true underdogs in this project (all music composed and played by band The Underdogs), these heavily crafted showpieces may reek of excessive production, but are one of the only things that maintain interest the whole way through.Another credit to the Dreamgirls success story, primarily responsible for crafting this illusion of seeming better then it actually is, belongs to adapter/director Bill Condon, definitely in over his head with pulling off the project with complete respectability, but nevertheless guiding the proceedings with an impressively skilled hand. It is his eye that makes so much of the glitzy treatment present here not seem trashy, his pace that keeps things fun, even when they are not. I applaud artists who like to immerse themselves into completely opposite works (as Condon's progression from Kinsey would indicate) but it is clear that a theater rendition on top of his Hollywood treatment makes for an empty gesture when it comes to the important element of character development here. Focus on so many shiny vocal routines leaves little time to have these figures become realized, leaving viewers with a barrage of sing-along material in place of the actual drama these lyrics are signifying.Which makes it hard to praise Dreamgirls as the rightly praised, reasonably well made music film it is; simple mis-marketing did not make most people aware that instead of this being a film with music, it is a musical with film. At times it felt the entire project was confused about this identity crises, awkwardly sliding in and out of melodic passages with no real intuition guiding the rhythm... And then there are brave exceptions to that rule, primarily shown in some of Jennifer Hudson's more powerful moments. The former, and bitter, American Idol contestant surprised all by stealing away everyones thunder with her diva-like antics and piercing vocals. There are a few instances in which she is shown literally ripping out her soul via the singing form, which truly does make for the few touching moments that outweigh a lot of hit and miss material, but her Oscar nomination and subsequent win only goes to show how desperate Hollywood is for genuine emotion. Hudson may bring an authenticity and undeniable soulfulness to the role, but to grace her with acting accolades sends out the wrong message to all those invested in the craft. Regardless of that irrelative rant, all those in favor of the next power-pumped shot of hummable celluloid say I to Dreamgirls, but if you are expecting this music to be a framing around which the story is told, you got it backwards.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The only problem is the music,"I saw this movie because I'm a Motown fan. I really enjoyed Mary Wilson's book about her life as a Supreme, which served as the inspiration for the title of this film and the Broadway musical. And, without being a true account of the Motown story, Dreamgirls really offers a lot of nice little references to the history of the famous label. (Jolly Jenkins! The record sleeves! Jimmy's woolen cap!) It's a dazzling movie, and especially in the first part, it captures the spirit and the energy of the period. The only problem I had with the movie was the music. Visually the whole film is in sixties and seventies style, even in the tiniest details. But musically it's very far removed from the chirpy, smooth Motown sound. In fact, the big band arrangements and the scream 'n' holler ballads from Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles are the complete opposite of everything Berry Gordy stood for. He made black pop tunes, no heartfelt r 'n' b. In most of his tunes, it was all about the rhythm and the melody, not about the lyrics or the emotion. It's a pity that there is not a trace of the famous Motown sound to be found in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

sad excuse for a musical-movie,"I am a huge musical nerd, i live and breath in my show tunes. when ever i visit NYC i always go see a show, and i love preforming in shows full of dancing and singing. i also love seeing movies like RENT, Chicago, or the Producers, which were fantastic musical movies. Dreamgirls on the other hand was a huge thumbs down in my book as far as musical movies go. i was very exited to see it, due to the fact that i am a theater nerd, and that there was so much talk about how great of a movie it was. it was all i could do to keep my eyes open, or for laughing at some parts that were supposed to be serous. it was like one long really bad music video that was totally predictable. Jennifer Hudson is a singer, not and actress, i think that fact that she won the Oscar is a shame because she was terrible (i've studied acting for a very long time, so i think i would know) i didn't believe a word that she said, her singing was great i will give her that, but god she needs some more training before her next movie. i will go as far as to say this may be her the last movie she will ever do. i am a huge Beyonce fan, however her performance was a let down for me, because i felt like she played herself in the movie, however playing oneself might be the biggest acting challenge any actor will ever do. i also didn't believe her performance. all in all i want my $8 and 3 hrs of my life back from having to sit through that, there were points when i wanted to get up and leave. i have never seen the show its self, however the movie does not make me wish i could go see it, or do it ever in my life as an actress. i think Jennifer Hudson's Oscar should be taken away and given to little miss sunshine, because the girl is 10 years old and i have watched her movie about 5 times because she is amazing!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
ROBBED!  Dreamgirls not nominated for Best Picture?,"How can Dreamgirls not be nominated for Best Picture? This movie is the BEST musical I've ever seen period and definitely (even after seeing ALL of the movies that WERE nominated this year)was more than deserving of at LEAST a nod! How can this film be any less worthy than Chicago, winner of best picture, when Dreamgirls offers so much more as a whole and has been just as equally acclaimed? Prior to the announcement of this year's nominees, it was thought by most to be a sure nominee and most likely the winner of the award and here's why: Dreamgirls is more than a just a musical. The cast is absolutely flawless, from the lead roles down to the smallest supporting part. We see these actors, all in roles they were born to play, in what will be the defining moments of their careers. Jennifer Hudson's debut alone has blown ALL other vocal performances in film to date away with her astounding and passionate portrayal of Efie. With the same intensity, Eddie Murphy redefines his 25+ year career as the hilarious & larger than life James ""Thunder"" Early. The direction/cinematography is visually breathtaking and it's originality from beginning to end offers so much more that you're used to getting for a $9.00 movie ticket.I have never been a film critic nor have I worked in film. However, you don't have to be in the industry to know that this year the Academy has made a SERIOUS mistake in its over site of Dreamgirls. With or without the golden trophy, it has already won best picture for its total package of movie greatness: its music, its drama, its direction & of course, its SOUL!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"I may have left early, but please someone kill my memory","Dreamgirls. From the title of the film, the actors and actresses involved and the heavy marketing, you would think this film would be at lest half decent if not more. That is exactly what I thought, but then I went to see it in the cinema. This film turned out to be a huge disappointment. It has got to be one of the worst, or the worst film I've ever seen. Lets go through it proper. The acting was average, nothing special, but the singing was good, but the storyline, the reason behind the singing and the songs sang it self was utter crap.The storyline, (if you even call it one), was pointless and not convincing. The amount of times they sing and the songs they sing, was also pointless and not convincing. I love musicals, but that was until I saw this film. The film not only lacks the features in acting, singing and the storyline, it does not grab the person into the film and makes them want to watch it. Half hour into the film, I finished my popcorn and there was nothing left for me to do cause watching the film didn't count as a worthwhile activity as it does not take you into the film, it instead shows the layer of the story. I was falling asleep during the film, (which was a day time showing), and I decided to leave about half hour to an hour left of the film to see. And why, read above and look at my vote, its absolutely awful. I've still got painful memories of this film. Someone, please kill them.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Music with motion in a fairytale without message,"I got disappointed... all those compliments for this film made me go and see it and i believe it is not worth them. you've still have to see it to witness all the cinematic tricks. Actually they were the things that moved and make me like this film. Camera moves perfectly and is synchronized with the music and so the motion of actors is. It is the best feature in the movie. You may not like the music of 60s but it catches and is a perfect backup for the plot, though some dialogs changed to singing gets irritating in a little while (some people in laughed every time they started) you can still be amazed by how those dialogs are bonded with singing are used to transfer them to concerts and stuff. talking about the plot it is actually a bit boring, because everyone knows that there is a lot of unfairness in entertainment business and that usually fame doesn't last forever. The story felt a bit boring and from my point of view made some weak points in the film. To conclude you really have to see it, but you should expect such a good view as it was announced. Don't listen to all that promotion, just go there and enjoy the music, camera movement, the way the episodes are connected and some good performance by our beloved Hollywood stars. 7 out of 10 just for that i don't believe it is going to become golden classics.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A true Dreamgirl come true,"I wish I had seen this on the big screen as im sure it would have been an amazing feeling to be in awe along with everyone else in the theater of the Divine Jennifer Hudson. The story about an all girl group that start off as backup singers and then come into their own only to succumb to jealousies and betrayal which finally leads to one of them being kicked out is the platform for the sensational rise and explosion of a star being born. Hudson's first rate performance proved America booted her off American Idol to fast and Simon Cowl does't know diddly. The movie itself did not fulfill me as I felt key important elements were not dealt with like showing how the friendship began for the girls and more insight to the relationship of Effie and her brother as well which would have given the act of betrayal from the people in Effie's life more punch. Although the scenes where Effie's forced to step out from the front of the group and then where they push her out completely are haunting as they seem to be almost similar with the only difference being in on scene they are expressing their love for Effie and the next their kicking her out in the streets. Beyonce does an amazing job of channeling Diana Ross while on stage performing and she deserved more props than she got for the role. Another overlooked great performance is that of Anika Noni Rose as lorell who stood her own among the rest of the cast. Jamie Foxx gave an understated performance which I found believable. Eddie Murphy also gave a great performance whose impact and appreciation may have been lost due to Eddie's past comedic roles where he basically did the same kind of voice and facial expressions he used here for the Character of Jimmy. I felt this was a strong performance by Eddie especially the scenes where he didn't say a word and his face said it all. It would have been nice to see him win the Academy Award. But there is no denying that Jennifer Hudon overshadows all these Hollywood heavies in this movie with her knockout performance as Effie White. She owns every scene she is in. The part given more meaning for those of us who saw her through the ""Idol"" drama where she was accused of not having the ""Depth"" to compete. Well, after I first heard her sing on Idol I too believed she did not belong there....She belonged in a higher place....her voice was a force of nature. Her talent was bigger than IDOL.

Backstage to Integrated,"There are, or perhaps rather were, two main types of musicals--backstage and integrated--and once for the most part they were segregated. ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927), say, being distinct from ""The Love Parade"" (1929). The latter fantasy or fairy tale where song and dance are part of the off-stage in-film reality and may be what most think of when they think of a musical (e.g. ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""West Side Story"" (1961), ""The Lion King"" (1994)). The former grounds song and dance in realism by putting a show on stage for the surrogate audience in film as well as the real one outside it and has since been largely relegated to biopics of people in the music business. Largely, though, show musicals have become indistinct from fairy-tale ones. ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) to ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001), ""Chicago"" (2002), ""La La Land"" (2017) and this movie, ""Dreamgirls."" I bring this up because the distinction and lack thereof between the subgenres seems to be employed here to intriguingly jarring effect.It literally begins backstage. Characters only sing and dance on stage to an on-screen audience, or later one via TV and song recording. Being a fictionalized biopic (or film à clef) of The Supremes and Motown records and starring singers not known for acting, Beyoncé and, especially, Jennifer Hudson making her movie debut, as well as actors like the delightful Eddie Murphy or Danny Glover not known for singing, one might think ""Dreamgirls"" would continue as a backstage musical. But, then, Jaimie Foxx comes into the picture advocating crossover appeal. It's him singing while walking through an alley during a montage where ""Dreamgirls"" rather suddenly goes in an integrated direction.The intriguing parallel here is that the musical becomes integrated around the same time that the business of music in the movie becomes racially integrated, of black singers appealing to white audiences. Soon enough, Beyoncé and J. Hud are yelling at each other lyrically even when not performing a show. Interesting, too, that the characters portrayed by Glover and Murphy, the latter of whom does sing on stage, neither quite succeed in crossing over to white audiences and don't join in the integrated musical numbers. I'm rating ""Dreamgirls"" highly because I find this conceptually interesting even though it's not especially effective. There's a reason musicals such as ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""La La Land"" began with gaudy numbers full of singing-and-dancing extras; it acclimated the real audience to the unreal nature of the picture.""Dreamgirls"" demonstrates what a difficult transition it is from backstage to integrated otherwise. It's jarring the way distinctions between the drama of movies and characters and the emotional appeals of music and singers is ignored. One may see the differences in subgenres from the beginning. Beyond the now-notorious blackface scene, ""The Jazz Singer"" was about weighty issues of culture and race in show business, of a Jewish singer's conflict with religious tradition and a new sound in the secular music business. We get something similar early on with race relations in ""Dreamgirls,"" from MLK to the Detroit riot. In an integrated musical such as ""The Love Parade,"" on the other hand, the conflict tends to require simplification, so it becomes a battle of the sexes and, with so much lyrical dueling, one between singing styles. Maurice Chevalier's crooning versus Jeanette MacDonald's operatics then; Knowles's beauty and Hudson's belting here.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"DREAMGIRLS (Bill Condon, 2006) ***","Adapted from a Broadway show but with additional numbers written specifically for the film, this is a rare and brave attempt at an all-black musical. While it was surprising to have GODS AND MONSTERS (1998)'s Bill Condon at the helm, it is confidently made and the musical numbers are energetically staged. Interestingly, the songs aren't just performances by the central group or their irreverent front-man but, at particularly dramatic moments, also serve as a commentary on the narrative itself.While I don't feel that the kind of music involved here can sustain a film of this length (unlike, say, a rock opera) and the second half is incredibly maudlin, the film succeeds by virtue of its meticulous recreation of an era (the hairstyles are fairly hilarious though) and its sounds, and the sheer force of the acting ensemble. Of these, the most acclaimed have deservedly been Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson: the former clearly delivers his best-ever performance as a James Brown-like R&B singer (not that it was hard for him to top his work in the films he's been making for the past 20 years!) but he only really shines in his character's last number, where he goes on stage drunk and embarrasses himself in front of live and TV audiences; in hindsight, his storming off of the Academy Awards ceremony for failing to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar was an infantile gesture. As for Jennifer Hudson, prior to watching the film I was skeptical about how deserving she really was of all the accolades her role garnered but, actually, her performance is the best and most heartfelt in the film and she manages to steal all the scenes she's in from under the noses of her more seasoned colleagues.Having said all that, however, where the film falls is in the blandness and predictability of the narrative: there was no way the Beyonce' character was not going to be boosted to diva status, no way Eddie Murphy was not going to fall for one of the Dreamettes, no way he was not going to end up dead, no way his manager (played by Danny Glover) was not going to be pushed by the wayside, etc. The ""reunion"" happy ending, too, is something of a cop-out because the film, after exposing the underbelly of the music industry, steers clear of addressing how this will eventually affect the fate of its protagonists.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Hudson Deserved Her Awards,"Musicals aren't really my thing. Many feel forced as the cast breaks out into song at the most bizarre of times. Cheesy is perhaps the best descriptor, but occasionally I enjoy a good toe-tapping flick if it's done right. And DREAMGIRLS is definitely done right. It certainly ranks up there with MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO as one of the more recently successful musical films, it too being a period piece (covering the late 50s through the early 70s).Acting in these style of films tends to lend itself more to dance moves than actual roleplaying of characters, but there are two highly mentionable performances in Dreamgirls: first time actress Jennifer Hudson of American Idol fame, and a major comeback role for Eddie Murphy. Hudson took home Best Actress trophies from The Golden Globes, The BAFTAs, The Screen Actors Guild and The Oscars for her portrayal of Effie White, the powerful and ultimately embittered lead singer for The Dreamettes. Eddie Murphy as James ""Thunder"" Early is surprisingly excellent, perhaps helping wash away the stains of DADDY DAYCARE and THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH from his more recent, acting, downward spiral. Murphy can sing alongside Hudson and Beyonce and hold his own, too.The added entertaining fact about Dreamgirls is that there's an actual story behind the music, making this film much more watchable than many musicals which rely solely on their high notes rather than acting skill. This story is firmly entrenched in the early music industry as a ""white-washed"" form of entertainment, separating it from ""black music""...until Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx, JARHEAD), a car salesman in search of more, jumps into the music biz and launches his own record label (Rainbow Records). Foxx's Taylor character is another smashing success for him in that he makes this man both lovable and despised as he turns from caring manager to control freak.Likewise, Murphy's Early character is someone who's moral ground we're never quite sure of. He's a married man with womanizing tendencies, but he's also a musical purist, trying to create sounds that are true to him while at the same time dismantling what he once was (a great, yet small, singing sensation). His fall from grace hits the viewer hard as heroin, time, and his own industry begin taking their toll. But veterans Murphy and Foxx can't hold a candle to newcomer Hudson's performance. She is the crux that holds the entire production together, and she does so with power, grace and a great emotional range. The ending is sure to choke-up many viewers.The only complaint I can lodge against the entire film was within one small section where Effie (Hudson) breaks out into a long chorus about being wronged by Foxx and the other Dreamettes. This seemed rather awkward and I would've liked to have seen this acted out in dialogue rather than burst into song.Still, this is a powerful musical film that deserves much praise ...and has rightfully gotten it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not worth it,"The movie was over-hyped and severely overrated by the critics. Their are other movie-musicals that have done this 100X better. The only person that did a good job and made the film enjoyable was Jennifer Hudson. Jaime Foxx comes off just as arrogant in the movies as he is in real life, and Eddie Murphy just goes to over the top with his performance. And Beyonce is by far the weakest part of this cast. Her acting inexperience really shows, and all the parts that she tried to act serious, were just terrible. The only other thing thats good in this movie besides Jennifer Hudson is maybe the Music and even those are only second rate songs compared to actual Supreme and James Brown songs. Do yourself a favor and do not get tricked into seeing this movie like, wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it. This movie is not going to be remembered as a classic, its gonna be remembered as another ""How Green Was My Valley"", because their are just so many other good movies out this year.

Terrible,"I would cringe every time Jennifer Hudson opened her mouth. It would have been better if they spoke instead of singing every word in the movie. Everyone in the audience i seen it with was laughing so hard because we all wanted it to stop. At one point someone said ""get off"". I have never seen anyone do that besides in movies.it was definitely a night to remember. And i definitely wont be seeing that one again. I didn't understand why Beyonce was nominated for Best Actress at the Golden Globes. The poor girl never had a chance. I understand they might have thought Jennifer Hudson had a better shot at winning in the supporting actress category but she was definitely the leading actress in the film. I thought Jamie Foxx was better then Eddie Murphy also but i guess thats just my opinion.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful,"I read a lot of the reviews from people who hated this movie because there was too much singing in it. Am I stupid or did I read that wrong. Wait a minute - maybe there is too much singing in this movie - I wonder why - Oh Yeah - It's a musical - Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Come on people - I'm sure everyone has heard this story already - every knows the story line behind this movie - it's based on the book that was turned into a musical on Broadway. Lots of singing and dancing. Give me a break.. I hope you people were not going hoping to see gunfire and buildings blowing up. If you want to see that - go to another movie.Anyway - I thought this movie was fantastic. Wonderful storyline, wonderful singing and dancing and ended on a good note.Now - for Jennifer Hudson - my God. ""And I am Telling you, I'm Not Going"" It made me weep and the goose bumps were up and down my arms and my neck. I purchased this movie from BB so I could see it as many times as I wanted. I had to back it up a couple of times just to hear her sing it again and again. Powerful and Heartful - no wonder she won an Oscar. Ms. Hudson blew me away with her voice and of course her acting. Spot on.I saw the original play on Broadway with Jennifer Holiday and Ms. Hudson reminded me a Ms. Holiday. Both powerful voices and acting abilities.See it. You will not be disappointed.

Hudson's Character Spoiled The Film,"One person - not entirely, but mainly - ruined this movie: Jennifer Hudson. Her character, ""Effie White,"" is loud, abrasive, offensive, vain, jealous, shallow, shrill, etc., etc. That woman is entertaining?! I don't think so!Hudson may have had the undisputed best voice in the film but that doesn't mean she's good to watch. The same applies for another of the singing trio that is featured in this movie: Anika Noni Rose whose ""Lorrell Robinson"" was annoyingly juvenile. Listening to an 18-year- old pontificate about how ""she's a woman now"" when she has the maturity of an eight-year- old is not entertaining. Only Beyonce Knowles as ""Deena Jones"" was a good person to watch, and not because of her beauty but her character was mature.Of the men, Eddie Murphy stood out as ""James 'Thunder' Early"" and I can see why he won acclaim for his performance. He was really fun to watch and hear. His singing stunned me. Just when I thought his career was in the dumper, he gives us this performance. Jamie Foxx and Danny Glover were both fine.I'm not surprised the screenwriter here was the same guy who did ""Chicago."" Both films had tons of glitz, glamor but an extremely annoying character were ruined both films. For ""Chicago,"" it was Rene Zellweger, here it's Hudson.Both films both dazzled and disgusted me. The music was decent and certainly plentiful, and that's no complaint. The music and the colorful visuals were the highlight of the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Everyone calm down!,"Dreamgirls is neither the knockout sensation the large majority are claiming, nor the disaster and failure that the rest declare.It is a very good enjoyable movie, with a lot of great scenes, superb performances and singing by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, certainly a decent realization of the show and then some.But it does lack depth and a certain cutting edge, and the rest of the performances are rather bland. We certainly don't get a real feel to Motown here. Most of all it is no way in the same class as Chicago, a flawless movie, but still way above the mediocre.I guess that comes to a B+ rating for me. Do we have to be so polarized in everything???",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Love Motown - Avoid This...,"..as the cast burst into their 14th song in quick succession the UK cinema audience I sat with was laughing...The problem with this film is that it did not get Diana Ross and Berry Gordy on board to help writing the script and to sanction the use of the Motown back catalogue, and some of the Supremes greatest classics. Dreamgirls is a film about the Supremes and Motown - without any of the classic Motown songs. Which is like going for a swim in a puddle.Don't get me wrong - some of the songs are punchy and the cinematography is great, however the script misfires by being almost entirely sung and glued together by some truly awful ballads. These ballads warble into each other in a Mariah Carey (esque) way that had the UK audience at first cringing and then walking out of the cinema in their droves.Eddie Murphy's charisma comes across, but unfortunately he is let down by the laughable way that the Tom Eyen & Bill Condon script (which is loosely based on ex supreme singer Mary Wilson's book ""Dreamgirl"") tries to combine Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye into one character (Which is frankly an insult to these outstanding artists). He is an actor, not a magician.If you look at this film outside of its Motown context, what might work well on Broadway does not really translate to the Big Screen. At first the film is promising, some good songs are punctuated with interesting characters. After half an hour the films artistic direction takes a turn for the worse and the plot lines become entirely sung. At this point the film starts loosing it. The 5 minute, 6 way sung argument is just a flawed concept, and is perhaps one of the worst moments in the history of cinema. It just doesn't work on any level. It makes the audience uncomfortable. At this point people started walking out... A stronger director would have reworked this and could have saved this film.The bottom line is - if your going to tell this story - tell it right and use the right music. Don't try and cobble together a script from 4 different stories that would merit a film on there own. Fortunately one good thing may come of the back of ""Dreamgirls"" success. Artists like the Jackson 5 are looking to put their own stories into West End end theatres. Has this film really got 8 Oscar nominations?",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Film doesn't get any better,"Operatic in scope, depth, music and color, and a good deal livelier and more interesting than most of the grand operas I like. A newcomer named Jennifer Hudson is absolutely stunning as a singer and as a performer. She comes close to stealing the whole show. I was in love with the Supremes from their first appearance, and the movie borough some nostalgia despite the fact there was not a single song from the original Supremes. On the contrary, the lyrics and music are fitted almost seamlessly into the story line, as it is supposed to be in grand opera (but isn't, always). I don't think film gets any better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Stop! In the name of... music.""","If anything proves the old adage ""They don't make 'em like they used to"" it's the recent (and I can't write this word without an industrial-scale vat of sarcasm) 'musical' called 'Dreamgirls'.Starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles and Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is adapted from the highly successful stage musical which is loosely based on the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes and the rise and fall of the Motown record label. The mettle of any musical is tested by the quality of its soundtrack so on that basis Dreamgirls is probably the worst musical I've seen since Moulin Rouge. It's only about half way though the film when, on the way to a fight in an alleyway that one of the characters suddenly bursts into song and we realise that we're watching a musical at all. Up until then it's merely a bad film about the music industry with badder songs (badder in the 'not good sense' as opposed to the James Brown sense) The 'I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' sequence is more than aptly named - I thought I was going to die of old age before it ended. In fact it's probably still going on somewhere. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson, who apparently won herself in an American television contest, steals a show which really isn't worth having. Beyoncé does little more than give 'gorgeous lessons' to all and sundry while Eddie Murphy's much lauded performance is merely adequate. The only oasis in this cinematic desert is the Op-art sets and Beyoncé's 60's/70's Ross-esquire costumes.Dreamgirls is further evidence that the medium of the musical appears to be an idiom of the past. Unlike the last great film musical Grease (1978), Dreamgirls' editing suggests that none of the dancers are capable of a complete uninterrupted routine and if the songs here were truly of the standard that Motown were putting out they would never have been heard beyond the confines of Berry Gordy's bedroom. Surely Motown, arguably the most important record label in the history of recorded sound, deserves a better tribute that this. No siree-bop, they don't make 'em like they used to. Next time you're in the mood for a truly great musical, with great songs and brilliantly choreographed dance spectacle and you're all Gene Kelly'd out - see James Cagney's little known 1933 classic Footlight Parade' you'll be singing 'Shanghai Lil' for days",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The best movie of 2006!,"The plot of Dreamgirls, Bill Condon's new musical has been crowned ""The best movie of the year"" by many critics. The hype started early in 2006. But the plot had that ""been there, done that"" feel to it. The plot isn't what makes Dreamgirls, it's the aesthetics.Months ago, in talks about the movie, people said things that are probably true (""Beyonce can't act!"") and things that we would have to see to believe (""Jennifer Hudson CAN act!"")And after seeing this terrific film, I can say that both of these things are true.Dreamgirls provides everything that you could want from a musical - danceable musical numbers, thick and layered characters, beautiful costumes, sumptuous set design, but with all of this razzle-dazzle, you cannot help but focus on the movie's shortcomings. But I had a very hard time finding problems with this movie. I thought that the ending was a little bit weak. However, Condon stuffs a lot into the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. The plot has been done before, but never to this extent. Condon wrote ""Chicago"", but this is his turn to write and direct a musical of his own, and possibly get his own Best Director Oscar. But the best thing about the movie is American Idol's reject Jennifer Hudson. The girl has it all. She sings her ass off, and she also gets the chance to flex her acting muscle, and she performs the role of sassy, under-appreciated diva Effie to a T. I think that she couldn't have been any better. In my theatre, people went wild after the legendary ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" number. And during the Curtain Call, when her name was shown, my audience went wild. This is the birth of a very big star. I wish only the best for her. And there is simply no justice in the world if she doesn't win that Best Supporting Actress Oscar.And, people keep whining about Beyonce being ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE in this movie, however, I thought she did well, but the character she plays, Deena Jones is a little bit unlikable, but Beyonce can't quite keep up with Hudson. She isn't terrific, but she's not a failure either. And, the 'Dreamgirl' that you hear nobody talking about is Anika Noni Rose, who plays Lorelle. She is very funny, and even though she even has one solo song in the movie, she does that perfectly. There's not enough of her in this movie.So in conclusion, you need to see Dreamgirls. It is best experienced with a large audience, because in the showings that I saw it in, the audience went crazy with applause after almost every production number. So, even if it's going out of your way, go see it. You won't be disappointed, trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Really let down.,"I was really let down by this movie. After everything we had heard, my wife and I were expecting it to be really great.The acting was great. The story itself was interesting; obviously loosely modeled on Barry Gordy and The Supremes and a few other R&B stories from back in the day.But... it just didn't hang together well for me. The film doesn't seem to know what kind of film it is. At times, it seems to want to be a ""realistic"" film like a ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" or a ""Buddy Holly Story"" but then at other times, it tries to be a musical like a ""Chicago"" or ""Rent."" For me, it starts off like a realistic film and it was jarring to me when people started breaking out in song for no reason 15-20 minutes into the film. It totally knocked me out of the movie. It seems to switch back and forth between types of films almost willy-nilly.Now, I went into this not knowing that it had been a Broadway musical. My wife knew and she found it disturbing also.She also didn't like the fact that there was very little that was humorous or fun in the movie. The movie seems to get darker and darker as it goes on and there's no let-up. I hadn't noticed that till she mentioned it.I would have given this a much lower score if it hadn't been for the acting. (I also didn't particularly like the songs or the way the music was presented. But I'm a songwriter so I might be a bit overly critical on that issue.)",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"A bit overrated, but hugely entertaining and stylish","Based on the famous Broadway musical, Dreamgirls was meant to be an Oscar-stealing picture, like 2002's Chicago. Instead, it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture of 2006, making it the film to receive the most nominations (8) except for the ""big"" one. Now, does this mean Dreamgirls isn't worth watching? Certainly not. While it's true that other films are much better (The Departed, Babel, United 93 and several others), this ambitious flick is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, and won't disappoint fans of the genre. In fact, the story it tells is so captivating it might even seduce viewers who aren't particularly fond of musicals.Set in the '60s, Dreamgirls is a classic ""a star is born"" tale, as it shows us the troubled rise to fame of a female singing trio, the Dreamettes. When we first see them, they participate in a contest looking for young talents. Obviously, they lose, but soon enough a ""guardian angel"" shows up. His name is Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), and having realized those girls are pretty good, he decides to give them a chance by changing their name (from now on, they're the Dreams) and having them sing alongside the experienced, incredibly popular James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy). Happiness isn't meant to last, though: problems begin when Curtis announces lead singer Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) will be sidelined in favor of the less talented, but better-looking Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles). It's the old rules of celebrity: you don't have to be good at what you do, you have to look fabulous on camera.In his exploration of the darker side of show business, director Bill Condon (who also wrote the aforementioned Chicago) benefits from the fact that he knows how to use the camera to make every single stage-originated scene look breathlessly cinematic: from brilliant editing to sublime cinematography, every element makes sure Dreamgirls is an unforgettable experience, visually speaking. If the film has flaws, and it does, it's related to Condon's decision to leave Hudson and Murphy out of most of the film's second half. The former, making her motion picture debut, is nothing short of mesmerizing, stealing all scenes from her co-stars; Murphy, on the other hand, is at the peak of his career here, delivering a performance that's both wildly entertaining and stunningly vulnerable. It's a shame two performers that brilliant (and Oscar-worthy) are denied more screen time as the movie progresses (especially considering Foxx's semi-villainous turn lacks that extra something that would enable him to carry most of the picture). It is also vaguely annoying that, being this an all-black musical, Condon feels compelled to insert one or two hugely clichéd ""white people stole our music"" moments.So, is Dreamgirls a masterpiece? Not really. Okay, but is it good enough to justify (most of) the hype surrounding it? Yes, it certainly is.7,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Two hours and fifteen minutes of Beyonce promotion,"I felt like I was one of the lucky ones to get invited to the screening of Dreamgirls because it's due to release over here in the Netherlands on February 22nd, 2007 and I saw it yesterday (December 20th, 2006).I have to say I'm not much of a musical fan but after I saw the trailer on the Internet a while back the movie actually triggered me to want to see it. As a kid I saw Grease several times, great movie.. but this isn't.It's two hours and fifteen minutes of Beyonce promotion, who seems to get whiter (make up) by the day. The movie has a very thin storyline which we all saw before in numerous other movies. It's funny to see Eddie Murphy using his well known 'James Brown' SNL imitation voice, and yes the man can sing. But to conclude it was torture, especially Jennifer Hudson's voice.. it's beautiful and all but just TOO MUCH! I left the cinema with ringing ears, I'm serious.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson,"I have never seen an audience spontaneously rise as one and madly applaud a song in the middle of a movie. I got goosebumps. Then she kept having killer songs over and over again for the rest of the movie.. Jennifer Hudson was my pick for American Idol from the very beginning and now she shows that she can not only belt out a song, but make you feel it and feel her pain. An amazing performance! Beyonce was good, but she's been doing this for a while. It takes a lot of guts as a brand new actress to act with Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy. Also, I bought the soundtrack last week and it is great as well. There are many songs that I have been listening to over and over, but nothing as much as her showstopper - and seeing her perform it is totally different than seeing a concert performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An OK film for me,"There is no denying that everybody in this film worked hard playing their parts. I can also see that the filmmaker behind it is good-intentioned. But at the end, this is just another (albeit high-end) product of Hollywood banality. Firstly, just like 95% of Hollywood products today, it is a recycling of old, tested, material, in this case a theatrical production of the same name. No originality. Secondly, the filmmaker, typical of creativity-challenged Hollywood type, just cannot resist using gimmicks -- Eddy Murphy singing, Beyonce acting, etc. They tried hard, but do we have such a shortage of singing and acting talents that we must use these two? As it turned out, the best performances in the film were not by those famous ones but by no-names such as Hudson. These are exactly the reasons that the quality of Hollywood movies goes down while their costs constantly go up.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I Loved It.,"Dreamgirls was an amazing movie. I love the way the music was used with dialogue. Sometimes it felt a little cheesy, but only for a second, when it got into the music it was really well done. The plot was done very well too. The acting was great and Jennifer Hudson did well in her role as well as with her singing, she is one of the best breakthrough actresses in a while, and she brings along with her a powerful, chilling voice. Beyonce had everything together, her moves were on cue and everything she did was well executed. I also loved Eddie Murphy's role. Jamie Foxx did another great performance where he was so in character that you would forget that it was him. There were so many good moments to the movie, and it mirrored events that actually happened at that time but mixed it up a little bit. Dreamgirls is definitely a must see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Overlong, old-fashioned, boring","Like many others, I was fooled by the rave reviews and claims that this was even better than ""Chicago"". It was not. Actually, I had no idea that the musical the film is based on has been around for so long. I wonder how it managed, because there is not a single memorable song in the whole show. As somebody else remarked, the movie starts quite well, with some decent R&B songs, but quickly turns into a series of pop songs of very mediocre quality, which sound one very much like the other (i.e. second-rate). A professional movie critic hailed the central song, titled something like ""I am not leaving"" as a sort of masterpiece, but I was just looking forward for Ms. Hudson to shut her mouth, as she seemed to go on forever screaming at the top of her lungs. Very old-style Broadway showbiz. The sort of singing style I am uncomfortable with.Besides, if you want to believe the movie actually has a plot, this scene was quite nonsensical, as every other member of the cast had made it clear she had to go, so she sounded a bit dim-witted, insisting about something that was already decided. I also think it makes a big difference to watch this movie outside the States. Americans may be intrigued by the pop and movie stars personalities crowding the movie. I just wanted to enjoy a good musical, without particularly caring about any big name attached to it (also because they are not so big in Europe). I was bored by the songs (too many) and the plot is so simplistic that it turned into one of those ""so-bad-it-makes-me-laugh"" kind of experiences.Eddie Murphy was embarrassing, posing as Little Richard or whomever, and any other character so two-dimensional that it was impossible to care about whatever was going on.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
This is one of those movies that you will love to see again & again,"(Synopsis) During the late 1960's and early 70's, three friends from Detroit, Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), form an R&B act called 'The Dreamettes'. The women compete in a local talent contest where they are discovered by Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a ruthless talent manager who offers them a job to be the backup singers for headliner James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy). They take the job and soon find out that Curtis has now taken over their lives. Their first professional show is at the Apollo Theatre in New York City. Effie's brother, C.C. White (Keith Robinson) is a talented songwriter who begins to write songs for Early and the group. Using the talents of C.C., Curtis decides to change their style from R&B music to Pop music and to go out on their own. Curtis also moves the beautiful Deena to the lead singer spot and moves Effie to backup. Now called 'The Dreams,' they become a worldwide success with Deena as the lead singer. However, in time the three women realize that life is not all about fame and fortune. The moral of this story is that family and friends are the most important aspect of life.(My Comment) The movie is an adaptation from an original Broadway musical. The story line is based along the life of Diana Ross and the Supremes. This movie is a musical, and everyone sings. Jamie Foxx will definitely earn an Oscar nomination for playing the part of Curtis Taylor, Jr. I was very surprised at the excellent singing capability of Eddie Murphy. And of course the three women were excellent in the show. I loved the singing voice of Jennifer Hudson. The music will make you tap your feet during most of the movie. The story shows you what it takes to become a singing star. You will understand that you must step all over your friends to make it to the top in show business. In spite of this, the music and story will entertain you and make this one of those movies that you will love to see again. (DreamWorks, Run time 2:10, Rated PG-13)(10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Dreamgirls is fantastic,"A star is born with the release of 'Dreamgirls', and her name is Jennifer Hudson. With a performance about as good as one can hope, combined with dazzling music numbers and excellent direction, 'Dreamgirls' is one of the year's very best. For those who were skeptical over the film's glowing praise, believe that Bill Condon's film will make you want to stand up and clap 'till your hands are red and sore. It not only stands as a terrific and entertaining production, but a vastly important film that helps define an era.'Dreamgirls' shows us the rise to fame, and the fall from grace. How a star is born, and how a star is broken. The 1960s are still young, and the music of Motown is quickly riding up the charts. For Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose), and lead singer Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), the Dreamettes have been waiting for their big break for years. And thanks to music executive Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) and the musical talent of James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy), their wish will soon be granted. Yet when Effie is unwillingly moved to backup vocals to better the group's image just as they're about to break out onto the music scene, it will eventually lead to her being ousted from the group and replaced. Renamed Deena and the Dreams, their soulful talent will be met with a frenzy of fame that results in hit after hit. But all that is well does not always end well, and these Dreamgirls still have a rocky road ahead of them and a thing or two to learn.The third season of American Idol first exposed Jennifer Hudson and her voice to America for all to hear, but a voting controversy one week led to her early exit. Fans of the show knew Miss Hudson wouldn't be gone for long, but who would have thought it would be under such awesome conditions. As Hudson stands alone on stage and belts out 'And I Tell You I'm Not Going' with all her heart and soul, she single-handedly gives birth to one of the greatest, most awe-inspiring and chill-inducing moments in cinema history. And as the audience in my theater broke out into immediate applause, I knew, Hudson has just sealed her Oscar victory, and it couldn't be more deserving. What an amazing talent that lights up the screen, stealing every scene she appears in. You done good, Jennifer. You done good.Despite Hudson's show-stopping performance, 'Dreamgirls' is not short on talent. Beyoncé gives her best performance to date, starring as the lead singer in the trio that experiences the ups and downs of fame over the years. Comparisons, anyone? And though their performances don't live up to the women, the film's men - headed by Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy - still deliver notable performances. Nobody can touch the soulful beauty and voice of Hudson, but together 'Dreamgirls' offers up one of the year's best ensemble casts.Without skipping a note, 'Dreamgirls' captures the essence of Motown and carries itself through the '60s and into the funky '70s. It successfully addresses the civil rights struggle and downside of Hollywood all through the celebration of music. And even through the film's remarkable and catchy musical numbers, Condon - who in addition to directing also wrote the film's script - does not fail to tell a dazzling and compelling story that transcends the typical musical genre. It's a wonderfully dynamic picture that carries itself with dignity and grace, with great cinematography and costume design, and doesn't lose points with a story that's been told before in varying forms. Because ultimately, the film's heart shines bright for all to see, and that's not something that happens on accident.When the envelope is unsealed and the Oscar for Best Picture is awarded, do not be surprised if 'Dreamgirls' is met with a rapturous applause. It's the film to beat this year, as this flashy spectacle sings its way to the top. It's the definition of Oscar bait, but none moreso than Jennifer Hudson, who better be making room on her mantle for the many awards sure to come her way. Bill Condon masterfully crafts this beautiful extravaganza that must be experienced by all, for none are immune to its inspiring wonder.

He started to date Effie they had a good little relationship for some time.Curtiz made Deena lead singer of the group, Effie was jealous, thinking her man was like this skinnier girl with this pretty voice. He was starting to think Effie was gaining to much weight. He wrote a song for the Dream Girls called "" Heavy "" he was talking about Effie, when they first start dating he knew she was big. she was gaining so much weight because she was pregnant. In the middle of the ""Heavy"" studio session, she was singing over the other girls staring at Curtiz with hate in her eyes. she ran out of the session. Effie didn't know why she was feeling so sick and going through this depression. she took a break from the group to figure herself out. Curtis found him another girl to replace Effie. She was another skinny girl Sharon playing as ""Michelle"". She was already in uniform ready to perform. Curtis did Effie so wrong. Kicked her out of the group and broke up with her,left her for Deena and left her with a baby. This movie will have you dancing, it will make you cry, and you will Not stop singing. I know this movie whole script everything is a song. Very good movie & will teach you don't need anybody to be successful. This movie doesn't Bor you at all. With some funny scenes, It's almost like real life how it was in the 90s back when the had the Candy paint automobiles. I would recommend Everybody to look at this movie. we can sing along together. Once you start watching this movie, you aren't going to be able to take yourself away from looking at it. Once you learn the songs you have no choice but to learn the whole movie script as well. Great Movie All About A DREAM.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't Go See It For Beyonce,"This movie was very good and well worth the wait! I am not a fan of anyone in particular of this movie, but everyone did a fine job acting wise....except for one person. Beyonce, for the most part, was mediocre at best. If any fans of hers are going to see the movie because she is in it, please don't. Her voice is lovely and she is a stunner in this film, but she overacts in certain parts of the movie that actually left me embarrassed for her. That is the only complaint I have with the movie. Now Jennifer Hudson was awesome and brought me to tears with every song she belted out. And Eddie Murphy was quite the clown. This movie is definitely a must see, but not if you are only going to see it for Beyonce.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing!,"Not only is this film now a Golden Globe winner for Best Picture--Musical or Comedy, but it is a beautiful motion picture with wonderful performances. Beyonce is wonderful; Jennifer Hudson is wonderful; Eddie Murphy is wonderful. The art direction is beautiful as well as the cinematography and costumes. It's well-directed and written by the wonderful Bill Condon, who, in theater-goers eyes, had his work cut out for him. It took a lot of work to match up to the late, great Michael Bennett, but he does a wonderful job. Jennifer Hudson though, in my opinion, gives the greatest performance as the diva Effie White. She would do anything to be in the spotlight. Her rendition of ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" had everyone in the theater clapping. The way she sings, acts, and even shoots looks is 100% Effie White.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Lots of potential but fails to reach it,"Starts out really good but falls apart about 1 hour into it. It turns into a Beyonce Knowles vehicle but she can't carry the load. Beautiful as she is they even managed to ruin that. Next it turns into a black angst vehicle...""the white man has us down so lets beat each other up and that will help."" Very disappointing. When they start singing to each other turn it off and go do something else. Otherwise you'll start to ask yourself ""when does this get over"" and when it does finally get over you'll just feel worn out.I love this genre... the costumes, the music, the times, but this just left me twitchin' How sad",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Horrible,"I had high hopes for this, but damn is it horrible. I loved the original Dreamgirls with Jennifer Holliday but the film version is a travesty for anyone even slightly familiar with the original. I can't see how this movie gets any acclaim at all except from hype and people who spent their money and don't want to think they've been ripped off: well, they have been! And where did the movie makers find Jennifer Hudson? What a loser! To hear her massacre the songs by wailing them out in a level bellow instead of applying things like intonation and feeling -- she can't act worth spit either. And it may not be kind to say it but her character Effie is supposed to be 'full-figured', not a total blimp! Eddie Murphy's James Brown shtick is OK but not enough to save this glitzy pile of trash which is taking the place of the movie that should have been made of the play Dreamgirls -- a movie that would have engaged your feelings instead of just your eyes. Avoid this bomb; buy the original Broadway CD.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamy,"The best movie based on a Broadway musical since ""Cabaret,"" ""Dreamgirls"" is simply dreamy. It's about the Rise and Fall of the Rainbow Records Empire (a fictionalized Motown), spanning the 1960s and '70s. The central drama involves the girl group, The Dreams, and the lives of its singers: Deena, Effie and Lorrell.As Effie, Jennifer Hudson virtually steals the movie in the Jennifer Holiday stage role, making the show-stopper, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" her own. The number is the most eloquent, heart-wrenching nervous breakdown ever filmed and it signals the beginning of the end of Rainbow Records.Written and directed by Bill Condon from a book and lyrics by Tom Eyen, music by Henry Krieger, the play's underlying gay sensibility remains intact. The Dreams are a mythical Supremes-like group (with a touch of Ronnie and Phil Spector thrown in as the marriage of Deena to Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx)), and their saga is nothing short of fabulous. The songs are mostly strong, though in the style of show tunes more than pop. They include new material from Krieger, including ""Listen,"" Beyonce Knowles' big number. The film's look is rich and color-drenched, the emotions are big and the story a quickly moving epic, all with show costumes and wigs galore.Like Condon's ""Gods and Monsters"", which was a point-perfect film treatment of Christopher Bramm's novel, ""Father of Frankenstein,"" the choices made in the screen adaption of ""Dreamgirls"" are flawless. The sense of racial bigotry and strife surrounding the characters during turbulent times is definitely more strongly developed and powerfully portrayed in this movie.It is doubtful you would leave this film emotionally untouched or aesthetically unimpressed.p.s.: Eddie Murphy's performance and singing herein was a total revelation to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"The epitome of an ""Overhyped"" movie","I went to see this movie as part of my annual vow to see as many of the Oscar nominations as possible, and this, more than any previous hiccups, reminded me of just how misguided that vow can be.Before I begin my rant about everything that's wrong with it, let's just say that I think the Oscar nomination committee scored an absolute bloody home run with this one. Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy are clear standouts here, the former in particular delivering an extremely gutsy performance, and I think she will win - not only because she's very good but also because Oscars so frequently seem to go to actresses who deliver one great performance but are destined never to do anything worthwhile again (That is, of course, an appalling generalisation but I can list quite a few examples from the past). Also, the music is great although I have a couple of misgivings which I will go into later.But the Best Picture ""snub"" which is gathering so much publicity was an absolute triumph of seeing through the bull and it's been a long time since I've been so satisfied with such a decision. In essence, Dreamgirls is nothing except a cheap excuse to throw together a sequence of impressive musical numbers with a connecting storyline which is little more than a bunch of glib, trashy soap opera episodes.But what makes Dreamgirls such a terrible cancer on the bowel of the musical genre is that, unlike other recent films like it (I'm comparing it particularly here with Chicago, Ray, and Walk the Line) it never seems to be going anywhere. Chicago, you've got a murder trial to look forward to; Ray and Walk the Line you've got the guilt of a childhood tragedy and a powerful addiction to overcome. Dreamgirls, by stark comparison, features a mess of characters, none of whom are dealt with in depth, and a similar mess of conflicts, while never making it clear exactly where the conflicts lie, who they're between or exactly why the audience is supposed to care whether they go one way or the other.The film's biggest weakness is hence its narrative. By the end of the narrative, the conflicts and characters converge, but for the middle hour and a half I felt like it was stumbling blindly from one song to the next, never sure of what it's doing. The fact that it all makes sense and there is resolution at the end does not excuse the clumsy route it takes to get there. Basically, we have a beginning, and we have an ending, while the intervening two hours are just a blur out the window as we speed by (while listening to some great soul music through the car stereo, as it were).Its other major weakness is that, as hard as it tries, the film can't justify its own mishmash style. Firstly, it thinks it is a story about a rise to stardom and the bumpy road along the way. Therefore, it mingles the action of the film with interspersed live performances of songs that have a particularly relevance to that particular chapter of the performer's life. However, given that the songs featured here don't actually exist outside the film, any poignancy seems a bit ambitious when you compare it with far more successful moments in Walk the Line: the performances of ""Ring of Fire"" and ""Walk the Line"" spring to mind. Secondly, Dreamgirls thinks it is a musical and therefore, episodic dialogue can be sung, rather than spoken. I can't speak for anybody else watching the film but the scenes where this happened seemed actually very silly to me. Firstly, given that for the majority of the film, the action is spoken while the songs are performances both within and without this fictional world, it frankly seems unnecessary, particularly given their attempt to use the technique I just mentioned of 'fitting' a song to the narrative. Secondly, unlike the great old musicals of the fifties and sixties, by the time one of these scenes appears, the film has become far too grounded in reality for any suspension of disbelief to occur. Thus it is left wanting one of the crucial elements that made the old musicals work, while the other crucial element - namely, spectacular choreography - is also absent, unless you consider six people walking in time to music around a stage spectacular. It essentially tries to blend the biographical style of Ray and Walk the Line with the twee style of - say - Singin' in the Rain. Ambitious though it is, it certainly doesn't work. It's either realism in musical form or its 'a musical', it shouldn't be both and I think this is a good example of how a film also ""can't"" be both.Therefore, having outlined Dreamgirls' major shortcomings, I could almost forgive it, except for one final problem, and that is, it is BORING. At the risk of colouring the rest of my review, I am compelled to say that I haven't been so tempted to walk out on a movie since I was stupid enough to see Scooby-Doo back in 2002. As I've said, the songs are good but they're only good aurally: there's nothing to entertain the eye and certainly nothing to entertain the mind while they're happening. As I've said, this film is nothing more than an excuse to put these songs on the screen. Fortunately, Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson were able to find the opportunity to act herein and save it from being an atrocious waste of effort.In summary, all I can say is, buy the soundtrack if you're that interested. The extra money is worth the tedium you'll save yourself.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Dazzling Broadway Hit Becomes Top-Notch Cinematic Entertainment with a Superb Cast,"Like many others, I vividly recall how Jennifer Holliday sent shivers down my neck when she ripped through her defiant anthem, ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"", in the original Broadway production nearly a quarter century ago. It is the kind of transcendent moment in the theater that had exponentially raised my anticipation of the much-delayed 2006 screen adaptation. The great news is that director/screenwriter Bill Condon has pulled together a top-notch entertainment piece full of ceaseless energy and eye-filling dazzle. Even if the narrative deficiencies of Tom Eyen's original musical have not been resolved here, Condon compensates by bringing more historical context to the story and making even more pointed references to the characters' real-life counterparts. More importantly, he recognizes that the episodic human drama really takes a back seat to the early Motown-to-disco musical pastiche brought forth by Henry Krieger's sturdy, crescendo-heavy score and Eyen's constantly engaging lyrics.The time-spanning plot focuses on a girl group in Detroit, three childhood friends - vocal powerhouse Effie backed up by good-girl Deena and chatty Lorrell  who are together known as the Dreamettes. Showing promise but failing to win a local amateur contest, they are corralled by smooth-talking Cadillac huckster Curtis Taylor to sing back-up for local R&B star James Thunder Early. They become a hit on the chitlin' circuit, but Taylor wants broader fame. Along with Effie's ambitious, soft-spoken songwriting brother C.C., Taylor launches a new label, Rainbow Records, right out of his car dealership. They record a song that starts to move on the charts but not before it is lifted by a white group in an antiseptic cover version. Taylor turns to payola to ensure Early and the Dreamettes achieve pop success on their own. He also tries to tone down Early for white audiences and makeover the girls into the Dreams. The latter strategy means pushing Effie into the background and Deena upfront, a move that causes friction and resentment in spite of the group's burgeoning success. Eventually, Effie's diva behavior gets her kicked out of the Dreams, and Early's star fades into addiction and irrelevance. Meanwhile, Taylor has built a media empire with plans to make Deena a movie star. His Svengali-level of control reaches a breaking point when he takes back a song C.C. wrote for Effie's resuscitating solo career in order to make it a disco hit for the Dreams.It's most fortunate that casting is exemplary here because that could have easily been the film's downfall. Even though it is an ensemble piece, the lion's share of the press has been going to Jennifer Hudson's blazing debut performance as Effie. Standing in the shadow of the startlingly overwhelming Jennifer Holliday is no picnic, but with her zaftig figure and huge voice, Hudson effortlessly captures the character's sassy self-confidence and eventual emotional deconstruction. Musically, she clearly has the vocal chops and technique to nail all of Effie's numbers, especially ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"", the film's crowning moment. As Early, Eddie Murphy finally has a role that takes advantage of his gift for mimicry (this time an amalgam of Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson and James Brown  who sadly just died this morning), adds darker colors and textures to his established screen persona and dares him to try singing again. The result is nothing short of a revelation.As Deena, the obvious Diana Ross doppelganger, Beyoncé Knowles manages to hold her own, even though her character has not been sharpened into a stronger personality. A stunning woman by anyone's measure, she manages to capture her progenitor's breathy, slinky singing style, while lending a naturalistic quality to her portrayal. She has one shining musical moment, a new song called ""Listen"", though ironically, her powerful vocal delivery seems at odds with Deena's supposedly limited talents. With the unenviable task of playing Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like figure of Machiavellian villainy, Jaime Foxx begins solid even as the character becomes more cardboard as the story progresses. With a beautifully soulful voice of her own, Anika Noni Rose shines as Lorrell moving fluidly from ditzy back-up singer to resigned mistress. Keith Robinson also displays a fine voice and brings gravitas to his subtle performance as C.C, while Danny Glover provides his welcome seasoned presence as Early's manager, Marty.There are several moments that are plain wonderful. One in particular is when Early starts to rehearse the Dreamettes on ""Fake Your Way to the Top"", and as he gyrates, it turns into the actual stage show. Another is the near-operatic histrionics on ""It's All Over"" when most of the principals take flashy, fiery turns to illuminate the story's turning point. I like some of the movie's more overt send-ups like Early wearing Marvin Gaye's knit cap as he sings his civil rights-themed ballad, ""Patience"", or when Deena comes floating down the theater aisles blowing air kisses just like Diana Ross at the Motown reunion concert. All the production values are first-class from Tobias A. Schliessler's dazzling, color-saturated cinematography to Sharen Davis' va-va-voom costumes to Virginia Katz's kinetic film editing to John Myhre's evocative production design which includes recreations of the 1967 Detroit riots. Despite a smattering of weakly contrived dramatic moments in the second half, this is knockout entertainment for anyone who enjoys the musical genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
i fell asleep during it!,Let's just say I fell asleep during this movie. They broke into song like every minute. If your the kind of person who can't stand that my advice is not to see it! They even have conversations in song! How pathetic can you get? I don't understand how they got this golden globe award this was the worst movie I have ever seen! This movie was a disgrace to all man kind. There was HARDLY a plot to this movie. And it's just weird how a young girl could be kissing Eddy Murphey(?) that kind of strange. I know this movie is rated pg-13 but the drug use in this movie is a bad influence of the young youth of the world watching this movie. Too many of the characters smoke as well and that's just gross.

Too much dreaming for these girls.,"Devoid of a truly engaging story, this glitter filled showbiz epic fails to achieve the same kind of witty, intelligent song to dialogue transitions that its inspiration, Rob Marshall's Chicago did so invitingly. Advertised as a dry drama about the music industry, Dreamgirls launches into long, tedious songs that not only lack any kind of re-playability, but can't hold a candle to instant Motown classics they aspire to be like.Dreamgirls takes the rags to riches story, removes the focus away from the characters, and spends too much time with the overplayed, loud and often obnoxious at times singing. Much of the character development happens off-screen including almost all of the love scenes, leaving us with merely the aftermath of each situation and completely neglecting the build-up. Director Bill Condon has managed to breathe life into a shallow story about a group, basically The Supremes, where the characters transitions into song are clunky and uninvited, leaving a bad after-taste.The film illustrates the interior workings of the music industry with scenes that are hackneyed and drained of life, and in the end, fails to gratify in any department. Dreamgirls proposes that the only way for the African American community to break into an industry is by selling out their roots, and modifying or morphing into what the white man wants to see or hear. Throughout the entirety of the film, the characters sell out their funky soul roots, for a mellower and easier listening routine, appeasing the white record producers and listeners. There was no point in the film where the characters were being creative for the sake of art, instead they were creating for monetary gratification.The cast not to blame, all of them bringing together some of the best talent in Hollywood. Eddie Murphy finally gets a chance to shine beyond his comedic blunders of the late 90's and does it like a crystal. There are many characters in Dreamgirls that are overly neglected, only to be brought in and out of the film for dramatic effect. In the case of the main group, one member replaces another, which leads to a series of revelations. The drama and character development take a backseat to the singing, dancing and dazzling costume design. Unfortunately this makes Dreamgirls just that, a disengaging spectacle that is given a smidgen of credibility by its cast. By the 50 minute mark, there should be many people questioning this movie's intentions, and wondering whether an early exit would be appropriate.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Extraordinary fabulous!!! What a masterpiece!!!,"The best musical film ever and this is my new best favourite.I'm not a fan of musical films which tends to have empy contents with extreme slow tempo.
However this one, all the songs were expression of strong emotion, not singing for the sake of performing. We feel the passion for music, courage and individual lives through music.Musical films are typically veeery simple and have extremely straight forward storyline. Dreamgirls can said to be modern film interm of plot as there are little swists keeping us well attracted.That feeling when unbelievable things are happening with speed, the rush of adrenaline into big stages, just imagining how far can be reached... We build trust towards each charactors..then they betray us... Yet heartful and fully satisfying.Sad to know there are lots of critics and haters.... They must have expected car chasings and gun fights. This film is a true musical!!! Amazing masterpiece couldnt be done any better !!!!!

I like Motown music and jazz and i love the blues, but this film does nothing for the genre. Some of the on stage performances are good but it is repeated far too often and i just wanted the songs to hurry up and finish.

What a dream!,"A musical based (very loosely) on Diana Ross and the Supremes. It starts in Detroit in the early 60s when a black, all-girl trio sing at amateur night. They're called the Dreamettes (Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce Knowles and Anika Noni Rose). A sleazy manager (Jamie Foxx) hires them as backup singers for James early (Eddie Murphy). Eventually they get their chance at stardom but Hudson is told that Knowles will be the lead singer...and the band falls apart.The melodramatics are totally predictable and there's some so-so acting (Murphy and Foxx walk through their roles) but the three leading ladies keep this on track and the musical numbers crackle with energy and fire. All three can sing beautifully and dance too. When they're on stage the movie leaps to life. Even if the songs are just OK their performances lift them up. After the show-stopping ""I Tell You I'm Not Going"" belted out by Hudson the film does sort of meander and get oh so predictable but I still loved this.As I said the acting is OK by the guys--the ladies hold this together. Rose doesn't have much to do but she's full of life and energy; Knowles can really belt out the songs and is a VERY good actress but this is Hudson's movie--and she knows it. She's just a mountain of strength and her voice is just beyond belief. She DOES stop the movie with ""I Tell You..."" My silent audience applauded out loud when she finished. Whenever she's on screen you can't take your eyes off her.I have only one real complaint--the musical numbers are shot with that annoying MTV style--cutting to a different angle endless times during the performances. There's some nice choreography going on during the numbers--when you can see it. All they should have done was plant the camera and let the ladies and their magic carry the numbers through. Still I can live with that.I give it a 9 only because of the editing and the predictable melodrama--but I still recommend this. A really good musical.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Saw it on Broadway. Liked this better,"The Broadway ""Dreamgirls"" quickly became a legend because of 1) Michael Bennett's awesome staging, 2) Jennifer Holliday's high-voltage turn as Effie, and 3) a (somewhat unwarranted) rave Frank Rich review in the Times. It can't honestly be said that the writing was first-rate, either the score (an uneasy fusion of Motown and showtune, with heavyhanded near-rhymes) or the book (melodramatic and not always absolutely logical). Well, Bill Condon's film version doesn't repair any of these flaws, but it's sensational entertainment. What a production design! A dazzling display of location and soundstage settings, with costumes so precise and smartly satirical that you always know exactly what year you're in. A couple of transitions from dialog to song and back are a little uncomfortable (this is generally the hardest thing to get right in adapting a stage musical to the screen), but most are fine, and a couple of segues -- like the one of Eddie Murphy's James Early teaching the Dreamettes a song to their actual onstage performance -- are seamlessly brilliant. As one who normally loathes Murphy, I thought him both touching and dynamic as this James Brown-like icon. And everything you've heard about Jennifer Hudson is true. It's a starmaking performance, rather like Streisand's debut in ""Funny Girl"" in intensity and virtuosity; she also acts, and her facial expressions and body language are as persuasive as her vocal prowess. Plus, she's an attractive full-figured gal, which makes her romance with Curtis (a too-understated Jamie Foxx) more convincing than it was on stage. Anika Noni Rose is a charming Lorrell, and Beyonce Knowles does Diana Ross to perfection. But the real star of the picture, if you ask me, Hudson aside, is Bill Condon. He knows how to rethink stage properties in cinematic turns and pump up the excitement to almost live-Broadway fever pitch. You could rightly accuse ""Dreamgirls"" of glossing over some of the finer points of social history it covers, and maybe even triteness, but it's one of the two or three best times I've had at the movies this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamqueers,"Dreamgirls is the Hollywood musical genre at it's best, although, in truth, I feel strange saying that since I could never sit through a Hollywood musical without feeling completely sick. At six years old, I watched Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and fainted midway through, tumbling off the arm of the sofa and onto the floor of the den  much to the consternation of my siblings and parents. I believe that at that instant, they knew I was gay. I mean, what other little boy faints because he is visually overwhelmed? It happened one other time when I was 15 years old on a school trip to Paris. Upon walking into the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, my lips became suddenly numb, my head felt as though it were detached from my shoulders, the room spun and I buckled. A handsome security guard, understanding perfectly that I was ""un peu fragile"", gallantly carried me outside, where the intelligently contrived visual disarray of Andre le Notre's English Gardens seemed to revive me. In the film Dreamgirls, Jennifer Hudson as the character Effie, is a force of nature. When she belted out ""that"" song, everyone in the movie theatre, including myself, ""witnessed"" as though we were attending a revival meeting - and rightly so. Ms. Hudson puts her own, unique stamp on it and let me say one thing for the record, the bitch can sing. She has got the Aretha thing happening for real, and must be cast as the lead in her life story when the time comes. She's a good actress too, unafraid of the camera, with a husky laugh and excellent comic timing. I'm telling you children, a star is born!The movie and the Broadway play are however, major revisionist history as any Supremes buff knows. Ms. Ross was not nearly so kind to Florence Ballard, the Supreme who inspired the Effie character. Flo died in an SRO hotel in skanky ass Detroit City while living on welfare. Ms. Ross re-released many of the original Supremes songs under her own label, many years after she divorced Barry Gordy, and she never paid one penny in royalties to Florence or Cindy Birdsong, the other Supremes. She knew very well that they did not have the financial wherewithal to battle her in court. It stands as one of the most ruthless, heartless scandals in pop music history. Further, the crook had the unmitigated gall to attend Flo's funeral, uninvited, and was booed by the crowd of 3,000 mourners who lined Woodward Avenue, Detroit's main thoroughfare. Then, as if attending, uninvited, wasn't enough of a stab wound, ""Call Me Miss Ross"" walked straight up the center aisle and sat in the front pew of the church next to Flo's grieving family. Quelle Sangfroid!!! She is the Gordon Gecko of Motown.The funeral services were presided over by Reverend C.L. Franklin, Aretha's father! Children, it was a pop culture, Afro-American, Kodak moment the likes of which we shall not see again.Now, for the record, let me qualify this next paragraph by saying that I am not, and never have been a Broadway queen. Similar to Hollywood musicals, I despise the manipulative and maudlin machinations of the Great White Way, although, admittedly, many of the songs are hum-worthy, especially while vacuuming. I lived in New York for 20 years and saw, against my will or better judgment, exactly 3 Broadway plays:1. The Fifth of July because I had a perverse desire to see the lead actor, Richard Thomas, who played John Boy Walton on the television show ""The Waltons"". Never mind that I actually watched The Waltons on television - that in itself is frighteningly suspect. I needed to be sure he was a real human being, not an alien visitor, as my highly credible older sister so often stated. His co-star was an actress named Swoozie Kurtz, and I thought the name was so ridiculously pretentious that I had to put a face to it. The play was abysmal and I am not yet convinced of John Boy's human credentials.2. 42nd Street because I was volunteering for an AIDS organization who were given a boatload of free, seat filler tickets to pass out liberally. That tawdry spectacle gave me a horrific migraine that persists to this day. I left at intermission.3. Dreamgirls, because my friend Ross Laycock insisted on taking me and paid for the ticket, all the while raving about the voice of a newcomer named Jennifer Holliday. Again, I was mostly bored except for those few brief moments.Broadway is visual fast food. It provides a teaser of stimulation to briefly satisfy an intangible, but very profound need, let's call it hunger or loneliness or longing or boredom. It serves a dollop of emotional nutrition - just enough to get you through two hours of razzmatazz, hustled out of the theatre and into a cab. As the cab speeds downtown, you snap to and are left wondering what the hell happened to your IQ level, your hearing, your wallet and your waistline. Only five days later, as you vacuum and find yourself humming a vaguely familiar, but indelible ditty do you break out into a cold sweat and realize that you've been bamboozled.When I witnessed the original Jennifer (Holliday) play Effie on Broadway (1982) and sing ""And I am telling you, I'm not going"", she was crying and sweating so hard I thought she was going to have a heart attack. Kind of frightening, but that, to my dismay, is the image looped forever in my mind. I remember thinking (all 21 years of me), that my ears could not really be hearing what I thought I was hearing, because there was no way that any human being could have such vocal power. I still don't believe she was real. I think of her like Catholicism. The only things plausible are the miracles.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson deserves an Oscar & I did not like her on American Idol,"Everyone except for Jamie Fox stepped up their game for this movie. Yes even Beyonce. Forget her attempts before to being a good character actress which she failed miserably. This movie she takes her time and stretches the emotions for our viewing pleasure. Though, Beyonce got top billing in this movie. Jennifer Hudson is the movie without her we would have screenshots and a video or two. Jennifer's acting debut leaves you with your chin on the floor and a tissue in your hand. Many wonderful singers have tried but no one absolutely no one has been able to match Jennifer Holiday's original recording ""I'm not going"" with the same passion and pain until this movie. Jennifer Hudson hit every note with the emotion this is her last breath and you will hear her. Bravo. Bravo. She deserves every complement, praise and high five.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Extremely entertaining film.,"I go to movies to be entertained. I will say right up front I am not a huge fan of movies that try to instruct or educate me (unless they are very very subtle). I want to leave the real world behind for a couple of hours and leave the theater feeling like I got my eight bucks worth.This movie is great. If you like a good story, good acting, and FANTASTIC music, you will love it. If you wont take my word for it, allow me to submit 3 pieces of evidence: 1. This movie was interrupted by applause twice. I live in Arkansas. We don't applaud in movies but we did in this one.2. This movie is very long. My soft drink was VERY large. I never left my seat. It was just too good to not endure some discomfort to see entirely.3. As we exited the theater my wife turned to me and said, ""I would like to see that again"" I can think of no other movie made in the last 15 years that she said that about.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Just my thoughts on the film. Jennifer vs. Beyoncé,"I must say this was a must see movie. To me Jennifer Hudson did her thang in this film. Whoever told Beyoncé she was the star of that movie. Was straight up wrong for that. I have read the book of Dreamgirls and it is clear to me, that Effie White was the main character in that book. Jennifer Hudson sang that song ""And I Am Telling U"". Matter of fact she did all them songs. After each song she sang there was wild applause in the movie theater. That began chills up my arms. No one clapped like that after Deena (Beyoncé) sang. To me Ms. Hudson was the lead actress. Beyoncé just need to give movies up. The girl can sing, don't get me wrong. But, acting is just not her thang.Jamie Fox was also good in the movie. He had that character down to a tee. The cockiness, attitude, arrogance, and all that he did was the bomb. Eddie Murphey was the bomb as well. But, that singing......did not work for me. Others may have liked it. Now don't get me wrong I love me some Eddie. But, he just can't do the singing thing. Also the other actors and actress did a good job. I mean I just loved the movie. I can't wait until it come out on DVD. But when I seen Beyoncé was getting all that attention before the movie hit theaters. I just knew she was going too be the bomb. Now I know who the real star is. MS. JENNIFER HUDSON...................",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Poor soundtrack,"To be fair regarding the soundtrack, there are few musicals where every, or almost every, song is memorable. Offhand, I can think of one: Grease. I remember every single one of them, can hum them, sing them, know the words. Could I say this about Dreamgirls right now, an hour after watching it? No. I had seen it once before, years ago, and remembered it favourably and mistakenly. I realise now I remembered it favourably for the fewer than a handful of songs that I consider great. You know the ones.The performances were fine although the storyline was pretty shallow, as was Effie. Was she supposed to be likeable?Throughout the movie the emphasis was on Hudson's character having the best voice. Not in my view. Ok, Hudson can hit all the notes and then some but she seems to shout her way through every song whereas Beyonce does not.Aaah, well, anyway. Not the best musical - and I admit I am not a fan of musicals - but it has its moments.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Boring,Like watching Star Search where they go for applause by screaming a few notes. SCREAM ..... Talk.....SCREAM ..... Talk About half way thru my ears were ringing from Hudson's screaming every song but still had another hour to go. Please stop my ears are bleeding. The show tunes were so bad and boring......not one song made me want to sing along or even tap my foot. Motown fans should run away from this film. I guess I was expecting a Motown story but got Broadway. But if your a Broadway musical fan you would enjoy this. If you watch this at home turn the volume down and put on some Motwn tunes. Guess I need to do a little more research into a movie before I watch it. I fell for the hype and all I can say is I couldn't wait for it to end.,3.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Blockbuster Musical ... Except for the Music (Oops!),"Let's start with what's good. First and foremost, the performances are terrific, especially those by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, both of whom deserve their likely Oscar noms for supporting roles. The first half of the story is way too predictable to be anything more than decent, but there are some nice turns (not quite twists) in the third act and it ends up quite satisfying as drama. And finally, of course, it looks great.So what's wrong? Three things, all having to do with the music. (Note: I've been a music critic for thirty-five years, far longer than I've been a film buff.)First, filmed musicals have essentially two choices. On one hand, they can show us a world where people sometimes break spontaneously into song and are accompanied by unseen musicians, and do so without explanation or apology. Or they can go post-modern on us and give us a rationale for this preposterous phenomenon, as was done so brilliantly in CHICAGO and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER's ""Once More With Feeling."" The riskiest thing you can do is hedge your bet midway. Which is exactly what DREAMGIRLS does. Because it's a musical about musicians, half the musical numbers are simply songs being performed by the characters. Others are old-fashioned now-I'm-going-to-sing-instead-of-talk numbers, and some are hybrids, songs performed by the characters with snippets of I'm-singing-not-talking inserted via montage. Now, director / screenwriter Bill Condon wrote CHICAGO, so I'm sure that this inconsistent approach was intentional and was an attempt to expand the vocabulary of filmed musicals. Some may find that it works. It didn't for me; I was frequently taken out of the story by it.Second, any movie about the making of music has the chance to delight us by faithfully capturing the music-making process, by letting us watch as music is created, learned, refined, perfected. We got some of that in RAY and WALK THE LINE (and any movie based, however loosely, on the story of the Supremes and Motown Records invites that comparison) and a ton of it in HUSTLE AND FLOW. Here? Nothing, nada, zilch. There's not one moment where you say, oh, wow, that's how musicians do it, that's where music comes from. In that regard, it might as well have been a movie about three young black woman insurance underwriters.Finally -- and I've saved the biggest for last -- the music itself is thuddingly mediocre, standard Broadway pap with a thick R&B veneer. And the arrangements and production are simply awful, bearing no relationship at all to the actual pop Motown style. The Supremes' songs had swing, they had subtlety, the vocals weren't overwhelmed at every turn by blaring horn fanfares. The overproduction here is relentless, reaching its zenith during Hudson's final number, where we continue to hear the soulless fifty-piece orchestra obliterate the nuances out of the song even as we're watching Hudson perform it in a nightclub backed by a small combo!I know a lot of people will love this movie despite the huge musical shortcomings. For them, I pose this question: how insanely great would this movie had been if all the songs were as great as ""Where Did Our Love Go,"" ""Come See About Me,"" ""Back in My Arms Again,"" ""You Can't Hurry Love,"" etc. etc., etc.? The gulf between the music we're hearing and the actual music of the era portrayed is immense and staggering.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Ben's Movie Reviews,"Dreamgirls (2006) **** Beyonce, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose Dir. Bill CondenI have two words to say about this film: Dreamgirls Rocks! It is one of the most spectacular films playing this year. One of the most amazing things happened when the picture finished and the credits rolledthe audience applauded. I have never in my time seen an audience applaud the screen, and to top it off they applauded the star of the evening Jennifer Hudson who gives a powerhouse performance as Effie White, the headstrong singer who wants to be the star but gets nothing for her hard efforts.It's the story of dreams, hope and song as we follow three friends: Effie, Deena Jones, and Loreen, who get whisked away to be backup singers for James T. Early (superbly played by Eddie Murphy) and soon the dreams begin, with Curtis Taylor (Fox) at the helm treating the music business like a used car salesman. The team gets raves and soon Deena becomes the lead singer as she is what the public wants to see. This sparks off a feud with Deena, Curtis and Effie. Curtis leaves Effie for Deena, and Effie departs to find something better in life. Deena Jones becomes the biggest hit since the telephone and the struggles with fame and her love life. Curtis becomes so involved with the fame and money that he forgets those who got him to where he is today. He gets caught up in a scandal and corruption that Deena leaves and the Dreams give their final performance.The film is based on the 1981 hit Broadway Show starring legends Jennifer Holliday, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Loretta Devine (who has a small cameo). Now it commands the big screen with solid performances from all especially Beyonce who gives a terrific performance and her vocals hit home, even the new song ""Listen"" is perfect and she really gets to show her stuff. Eddie Murphy scores one of his best performances ever as James T. Early, he rips your heart when he finally comes to realize that he made a mistake and there is no going back, I see Oscar Nomination in his future and possibly a win. Anika Noni Rose who is no stranger to Broadway, she won a Tony Award for Caroline or Change, and here she has a small but memorable role and I was very grateful she got to sing. Jamie Foxx seemed a bit uncomfortable at the beginning of the film but soon warms up and gets better as the film progresses.The biggest thrill of the evening was the bravura performance by Jennifer Hudson who commands the screen and gives one of the greatest performances of the year. She gives everything into her role and sends shivers down your spine with her heart wrenching songs ""And I am Telling You, I'm Not Going"" and ""I am Changing"". I heard sighs and cries in the audience, and yes I even had tears down my face during ""And I am Telling You"". I definitely see the possibility of an Oscar win in her future and she most definitely deserves it.Bill Condon should be commended and does a terrific job bringing this to the big screen, he hits all the right notes, it isn't as flashy as Chicago was, but I think it's a tad bit better as you actually get to see the performances in action. I do hope he gets nominated for an Oscar as he was viciously snubbed at the Golden Globes. I say everyone should see this film; it is not to be missed. I place this as one of the best films of 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The 'whitest' movie ever to have a 'black' cast.,"Dreamgirls is a painful, spiteful, hateful parody of 'black' performers and music from the US in the 60's/70's. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film contains any real music from the period- it does not! The successful US musical theatre exists to please a middle-class white audience that takes pride in how strongly it despises the musical outlets that helped the commercial success of the various modern 'black' musical forms. Only when one of these forms has become so established that it can be seen as 'quaint' and 'harmless' will it be blandly repackaged for the amusement of this audience.Dreamgirls (the movie) is designed to be a commercial clunker, stuffed with household names to have maximum mainstream appeal. Danny Glover is, as one might expect, awful beyond belief. Foxx has a bland, and entirely unremarkable role. Murphy represents one of the worst acts of miscasting I have ever seen, and insults the memory of ever great 'black' male singer from the period, with his watered down 'Saturday Night Live' antics.The female actors get to play nothing but tedious third rate clichés. Three are simply required to look tall, slim and pretty, while the fourth, Hudson, gets to play the 'fat' lady who screeches loudly at various times during the movie, enabling the whitebread-targetted audience to imagine they are back at the opera. While all four are supposed to be playing 'sexy' singers, Condon couldn't get female sexuality on film save his life.There is no real story of substance. Sickeningly, the theme of 'black' musicians being locked out of the mainstream music biz is raised, when this film, Dreamworks produced, actually locks out any and all genuine 'black' music, while mocking it at the same time.The film clearly had obscene amounts of money available to create 'no expense spared' production values that substituted for any creative thinking. Indeed, Condon is never happier then when illustrating how much he was able to spend. The end result gives some fleeting shots of technical excellence, and a lot of useless, overly familiar, flashy editing clichés. The film has no heart, and never could have given the source material, so Condon attempts to distract from this with every visual gimmick he can think of.If you love music, genuine sexy performances, and directing that required the use of real imagination, and not merely a very fat wallet, go rent Idlewild, a musical film that doesn't just have a 'black' cast fronting for an all 'white' production, but actually has 'black' talent behind the camera, including director and authors of the musical numbers. Idlewild made my heart soar. Dreamgirls made me sick to the pit of my stomach.Of course, disgracefully Dreamgirls will be competing for 'oscars' whereas Idlewild won't even get a mention. All of you that claim to like Dreamgirls should think long and hard on this fact, for it speaks of a very unpleasant truth.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Simply put. The BEST musical I have seen.,"I am not into musicals, never have been, and thought never would be. But, after seeing this film, I am a convert.This is the best musical adaptation ever made. The direction, screen adaptation of the original Broadway musical, acting and story and penultimate.The central character in the film is Effie, played by Jennifer Hudson, an ex-American Idol contestant.This is Jennifer Hudson's screen debut as an actress and a singer. When she sang, 'And I Tell You I'm Not Leaving', she brought me to an exalted, sobbing state that I have never encountered in any musical.Jennifer Hudson, has been rumored to be nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar. She should not be nominated for a Supporting role, but, should be nominated in the 'Lead Actress' category, and she would win.All the other actors in this film performed miraculously in superior roles.I will be buying this classic only to reminisce about an Americal Idol contestant making it to the top and still waiting for a phone call from Simon Cowel, who quote, said on Americal Idol, ""You are out of your league"".",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls is a Nightmare,"Dreamgirls is absolutely Horrible. It's much worse than the worst movie I've seen in a long time...It's the Motown version of ""Grease""... Dreamgirls is not only a total waste of talent and hype(save for Eddie Murphy, who was great)..It's also a complete waste of anyone's time and money. I only wish that I could have the hour back that I wasted squirming in my seat. (My girlfriend and I walked out w/ an hour and 10 minutes left in the film) The story line is so utterly boring, a watered down version of Barry Gordy and Diana Ross...the character development is totally weak...Every song sounded incessantly the same...The cheesy musical/west side story-ish outbursts were enough to drive anyone mad. I would say that Dreamgirls is a good example of what's wrong with entertainment today...How pop culture celebrates, elevates, and encourages mediocrity...However, sadly, this movie falls way short of mediocre. It's totally pathetic. If you like Jamie Foxx, then go see the movie ""Ray"" again. If you Like Eddie Murphy, then re-visit ""Trading Places"" or ""Coming to America"". If you like Beyonce, go buy one of her CDs...But whatever you do, Do NOT see Dreamgirls.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The mind-blowing movie event of 2006!!,"I went last Friday to watch DREAMGIRLS at the movies, as it just got released in my country. With all the hype, the talk, and the repetitive watchings of the clips on YouTube, I gave myself the mission of watching the film against all odds. And I gotta admit: THIS IS, HANDS DOWN, THE UNDENIABLE MIND-BLOWING MOVIE EVENT OF THE YEAR!! Oh, Lord!! Forget any popcorn-friendly actionneer or comedy you had seen throughout the year, either at your local theater or taken right from your nearest video rental shelf!! No sir!! This is the real thing!! I mean, don't take me wrong. This year was thankfully packed with all sorts of well-made cinematic products, but the year got rightfully topped by the release of this delicious, enthralling musical. So was the experience, that I thought it was an exaggeration from many people when they said they found themselves cheering and clapping at some of the musical numbers, specially the aforementioned trademark one (sorry, no spoilers, go see it or ask around if you wanna know!!), but then it also happened to me. I was clapping in tears of joy and excitement, as if I was in a live Broadway show!! The premise is basic stuff: A group of young girls who want to get a break on showbiz, break that comes up in the form of an ambitious promoter who lands them on a coveted singing position with a decadent, yet über-charismatic performer; the success falls on their feet and they escalate positions; but then, treason and deception come along, everything takes a sour turn, and then, the feel-good ending. It's all slightly predictable, yet the premise is not (or it doesn't intend to be) the strong point of the movie. Not at all. It's all the other components.Writer/director Bill Condon (who also wrote CHICAGO, another delightful entry to the revival of the musical genre), does nothing short of an artistic and technical masterpiece. The production design, the costumes, the colorful cinematography, the tight-paced editing,... it's all high art. And he does justice to the storyline (originally based on a Broadway play), by effectively intertwining the drama with some very effectively-executed musical numbers in between.Then, there are the performances: Jamie Foxx executes quite effectively his villainish number of the ambitious promoter with aplomb and conviction; you will root for him and hate him all at once. Beyoncé finally turns in a decent and VERY REAL performance, portraying the member of the group that grows to become a living icon of the moment, but with sensibility. Eddie Murphy will leave many jaw-dropped with his turn of the multi-layered and energetic singer Jimmy Early, who turns out to be like an onion: if you peel back his main layer of pure joy and charisma and dig into him, you will see that his inside hides a very vulnerable and moody character longing for something more, yet neglected on the way. Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, they all give effective turns.But, take my word for it. Although everyone is more than watchable, the real reason to sit through the 130 minutes of the movie, is JENNIFER HUDSON. Come out of nowhere (with the possible exception of American Idol), this extremely talented newcomer explodes into the scene with roaring energy, making every single one of her scenes completely her own, and singing like there's no tomorrow. When you watch her here, you will understand why all the Oscar buzz over her. So is the case, that the movie suffers a little whenever she is not on, although it never falls apart.In all, give yourself the chance to watch this champion of a movie, and you won't regret it. If you love musicals, this is the thing to watch. And even, if you aren't, you would have to be extremely insensitive not to give DREAMGIRLS the credit it deserves, as a mind-blowing cinematic event. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"a disappointment, even if my expectations weren't high to begin with","I should say it up front, I don't dislike the R&B of the period, as is given tribute via Dreamgirls. I liked hearing the harmonies of groups like the Supremes or other soul groups (I'm assuming Eddie Murphy's performance is inspired by a mix of James Brown and Otis Redding, or others I can't think of right now). I never heard of Dreamgirls before the movie came out. I decided against seeing the movie in the theaters, not because of any outright bias against the actors or the potential of the songs, but because of the trailer. Sometimes a theatrical trailer can sort of spell out, boldly, what the big picture will be. It was something that didn't appeal to me most of all because of the absolute, dreadful appearance of safe, conventional appeal. One might think the director of challenging efforts like Gods and Monsters and Kinsey might try and make a musical with more verve, more soul, more ""UMPH"", if that's the word. And as a director, Condon did pretty much meet that expectation.What I didn't expect, and what ended up annoying me about Dreamgirls, is how much the performances, with maybe the slightest exception, fell flat on itself. It's a subjective thing, of course; there's been praise to the sky for the work that Jennifer Hudson and others in the film have done in presenting the usual rags-to-riches-then-some-more-trials-and-tribulations musical story. Which is nothing I can really blame anyone on, as the film does appeal for a core audience that can't get enough of BIG vocals, BIG numbers, FLASHY personalities that pop and go into the, well, expected for 2-dimensional parts (if that). But, for the life of me, I could not stand most of the characters, or the actors playing them, in Dreamgirls.Jennifer Hudson has been praised most of all, given accolades as a new rising star following her stint on American Idol, and with vocals that, basically, go to a vocal *volume* that is impressive. But volume alone does not a good musical performance make! I never believed her as Effie, not once, except as, in a way, like some big near parody of one of these bigger-than-life and bigger-than-Pete's-sake-ego black women who are so stubborn that it's about as hard as hell to have any sympathy. The character of Effie is meant as the pivotal one, the one whom has the BIG personality, and ends up making a BIG mistake. But Hudson can't fill the shoes, as she just doesn't have the acting talent for it. She was chose for her singing skills, which for her means to belt out every number like she has to reach even the little guy in the back row in Giants Stadium. Aside from the fact, like everyone else, she has to sing such songs that have only so minimal a range with lyrics and tone (the most prominent number, in the 'break-up' scene in the middle of the film, stops the film in its tracks, and not in a good way). I'm in the minority, but she's one of the worst things about Dreamgirls.But on the flip-side, there's another actor, Jamie Foxx, who despite his actual talents, both at acting and as Ray showed singing, is probably just as ineffectual and, dare I say it in his own way, dull in the part of the domineering manager of the Dreamgirls. There's practically no range for this character for Foxx to play in, and has for 2/3 of the film the exact look on his face, as, through also fault in the script, goes through the motions as with every other bio-pic of a star group of the past. Only the ending tries to give any dimension, which by the end is far too late and even awkward. Beyonce and the other actress do maybe a little better, which is to say they're adequate in the parts. Only Eddie Murphy, who in a sense is just playing a sort of abstracted version of his egocentric self from many other movies he's been in (and better ones, ala Bowfinger, also speaking of himself in the third person), and for his musical numbers does add a bit of a lift to the proceedings. I almost expected from some of the early Murphy/Lightning scenes that the movie wouldn't be very much special, but at least could be easily watchable.Not a chance; as much as I would want to admire a movie with soul about the soul era's glory of the 60s and 70s, it lacks the passion that could make it a real contender in a time with so few musicals. The trailer also tempts that this will have some strong dramatic direction. Here, too, Condon falters where there needs to be a stronger vision, and he doesn't pull it off (the montages, for example, of the rising star variety for the Dreamgirls in the mid 60s, feels as shallow and empty as anything I could imagine in a summer blockbuster). Now, a lot of people will like this movie, a lot. Maybe I'm just not entirely in the demographic. But Dreamgirls, for me, makes a fatal flaw for a movie musical- the fun and spirit and melding of what works on the stage to the screen clicks off, and the chance for the unexpected is null and void. It made me feel depressed in its lack of respect for the viewer overwhelmed with clichés.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Real Dream,"As can be confirmed by the nominations, ""Dreamgirls"" is a real dream of a film. Condon has directed a masterpiece of musical art that can compete with the best. Jamie Foxx underplays well as Curtis Taylor, Jr. His character is consistent throughout the film, and his singing abilities have already be shown in his prior work. Beyonce Knowles plays Deena Jones, and she too is perfect in her part. Her stage presence is beautifully displayed in this great example of her profound talents. Eddie Murphy deserves every bit of his nomination for best supporting actor by the Academy. He delivers a powerful performance as James ""Thunder"" Early who has a premature demise due to drugs. Danny Glover also underplays his character of Marty Madison in a way that keeps him believable and sincere. The shockingly, pleasing performance was delivered by Jennifer Hudson. Her singing is superior, and her performance is one that no serious lover of musicals should miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enjoy the first 20 minutes, then get on with your life","The first few songs in Dreamgirls are infectious, and the characters we meet in the first 20 minutes or so of the movie show promise. But as soon as the cast starts singing dialogue to each other instead of just performing Motown-type hits, run for the concession stand. Most of the musical numbers are painfully long after that and bring the plot screeching to a halt to make a point (and make it again and again, verse after verse, until you want to scream ""We get it already!""). I spent the last 20 minutes praying for the movie to end, and many in the theater were laughing at the movie instead of with it during that stretch.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Fantastic,"This movie is the best picture of 2006. The Academy has blown it again as it wasn't even nominated in that category. Musical films don't get better than this.As for performances, Eddie Murphy is fantastic in this movie. It is his best role in many years of films & he shows excellent range & sings well to. Danny Glover is excellent too.As for the Dream Girls- Jennifer Hudson is great. Beyonce is very good also. In fact, none of the women have anything to be ashamed of. The musical performances in the film get better with each one & the finale even tops all the previous songs.The story is perhaps a parallel to the Supremes but there are enough differences to tell you they are not the same. In fact, the story line is well written & plays out very well. The film has a great pace.This is an even better Musical Film than Rent was a few years ago. After seeing this, I can't believe it is not up for best picture, & can only lead me to one question - Is the Academy racist? There is no good reason this film wasn't nominated.Once you see it, you will know I mean it, a flat out great film. Hopefully the academy will give it some acting & music awards, but they missed the boat on the award it truly deserves- best picture of 2006 - without any doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Stunning,"I found this film absolutely amazing, it was visually superb and the acting and singing were fantastic. The songs where brilliantly written, and sung beautifully. Jennifer Hudson was, well i don't know what right word to use her performance was unbelievable and she certainly showed us why she got the part, she completely out shone the rest of the cast. Beyonce Knowles was fabulous as Deena and performed brilliantly, Anika Noi Rose was brilliant as Lorell she gave us some funny moments, and has an amazingly strong voice for someone so small.Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover and Keith Robinson were brilliant as the main men, their acting was fantastic as was their singing. I am forgetting Sharon Leal as Michelle she didn't have a massive roll but i thought she performed really well.I could watch this movie over and over and not get bored, i would completely recommend this movie to watch.

Dreamgirls is such a Dream....,"From Academy Award winning director, Bill Condon comes the adaptation of the Tony Award winning musical, Dreamgirls, that inspired a generation. The adaptation stars Grammy winner Beyonce Knowles, comedy stars Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy, and American Idol 3rd Season 7th place contestant Jennifer Hudson in her screen debut.The film tells the story of three diva wannabe's (Knowles, Hudson, Anika Noni Rose) and their rise to fame and decline of humanity. Bill Condon does the film much justice keeping the energy alive from beginning to end. Jamie Foxx plays ""Curtis Taylor"" manager of the group who starts rattling the cage of friendship, vanity, and esteem. Foxx who since his Oscar winning role in Ray has been trying to take on more serious demanding roles and personally, it's hard for me to take him seriously as an actor. He is the weakest link of the cast but does a decent job with his villain character. His musical numbers do fall a bit flat on the emotional level and have no memorabilia for the viewer post-film.Beyonce Knowles completely surprises in her role of ""Deena Jones,"" a pretty face but second in the talent department. Knowles brings a great humanity to her role and truly shines in the musical number ""Listen"" which she co-wrote. While Knowles isn't at the top of some casting directors lists, she does have some talent and could become a serious actress in the future. While being campaigned as a lead performance for Oscars, she is undoubtedly supporting. Some could even go as far as call this an ensemble piece but the show and film is completely about ""The Dreams"" lead/former lead singer ""Effie White"" played amazingly and beautifully by Jennifer Hudson.Hudson engages herself in the role and while the role demands a great voice for her show-topping number ""And I'm Telling You,"" the acting aspects never fall short. ""Effie"" makes the viewer nervous in her angry rants, and sympathetic in her breakdown scenes. How can she be supporting when it's all about ""Effie?"" I guess the Academy didn't want to deny her or Helen Mirren an Oscar, which I guess is fair.Eddie Murphy is still as funny and charming as ever and gives his best performance in years. While his ""Jimmy 'Thunder' Early"" is completely rapturous and appraisable, Murphy sneaks up on the audience with a groundbreaking performance that shatters the viewer. We never knew Murphy had it in him. His screen chemistry with Anika Noni Rose is the great parts of the film for him especially with ""Lorell Loves Jimmy,"" brief and simply powerful.The rest of the cast, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson, and Sharon Leal give good performances but all with very limited screen time. The champion of the film besides Hudson is Director, Bill Condon who finds such passion in this project. He is amazing in his choices of scenes and cinematography along with never leaving the source material and not copycatting.Dreamgirls is a sensational picture and wonderful musical-cinema experience. It's a dream come true indeed.Grade: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Really, Really Bad (I Mean, Really)","What?....What did you say?....Sorry, I'm having a little trouble hearing you....I think all of the caterwauling in this movie gave me permanent hearing loss.......I'm suing Bill Condon.....Either the stage version of ""Dreamgirls"" sucked royally and they made a very faithful (and sucky) film version of it, or the team responsible for transferring the stage hit to screen totally butchered what was at one time a good thing. I doubt I'll ever know, because having sat through this mess once, almost nothing could induce me to come within 10 miles of anything remotely ""Dreamgirls""-related in future.Beyonce Knowles looks gorgeous but completely fades into the background as the lead singer in a black trio loosely based on the Supremes. The group's manager, played with a mumble and a sneer by Jamie Foxx, wants to bring black music to a mainstream white audience, but instead sells out to the man and makes the black performers and the music they sing progressively whiter. One of the trio, Effie, doesn't fit into this scheme. She's too black, too loud, too....er, everything, so she's booted. But never fear, Beyonce sees the error of her ways, makes up with Effie and gives Foxx a what for. This whiff of a plot plays out over two hours, all of it whirling by in a nauseating barrage of images and songs that all sound the same, making one wonder if Bill Condon was trying to break some kind of record for how fast he can make a movie plot move.Someone needs to tell Condon that simply making a film move fast does not make it inherently interesting. Indeed, ""Dreamgirls"" is a leaden bore, and what little plot there is is ridiculously hard to follow, because scenes just charge from one to another seemingly at random, songs bleed into one another, and whole decades flash by during montages that don't clearly indicate how much time is supposed to be passing. Jennifer Hudson, who received idolatrous praise for this movie, gives a one-note performance as big-mouthed Effie. I think she was meant to be endearing and spunky, but instead she's aggravating as hell. She sings every song at the same ear-splitting volume, and gives no indication that she's taken the time to understand the words she's singing. It doesn't really matter though, as the songs here do nothing to further the plot, and don't match the characters that sing them. The only songs I remotely liked were ""Love You I Do,"" one of the handful written directly for the film, and the pseudo-rap song that Eddie Murphy's character sings at one point (which ends with him dropping his pants!). Effie's big number, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,"" is intolerable and actually laughable. Beyonce's big number, ""Listen,"" recreates the sound of a pussycat being slowly squeezed through a meat grinder.Speaking of Eddie Murphy, he's the only thing that makes ""Dreamgirls"" watchable, and that's really only because he spends all of his screen time doing his Little Richard impression from Saturday Night Live (""I'm getting' in the hot tub!""). Everything else about this movie is a total disaster.Grade: D-",2.0,Anonymous,Music
wonderful musical drama - Hudson is sensational,"After reviewing the Oscar nominations and seeing that this 2006 musical drama based upon the lives of three soulful singers was up for 8 Oscars, including actor (Murphy, Beverly Hills) and actress (Hudson) for supporting roles, I knew this film was a must see, and I'm glad I went to see it.Juxtaposed are three zeitgeistian stars, Knowles more known for her music than her acting presently, Hudson for her voice and surely also a new star on the rise in Anika Noni Rose, all starring as three female singers looking to make it to fame and fortune.The film is inspirational for those wanting and thinking of the fame route and through controversial issues such as bribery, stealing, law bending activities the film achieves realism to demonstrate the road is difficult, but achievable.I found this film particularly interesting through Jennifer Hudson's powerful character. Hudson deserves her Oscar nomination for best actress in a supporting role as she performed magnificently as the singer who was under the most pressure which is further emphasised towards the end of the film, which is extremely moving and very powerful, showing the bad times as well as the good times for the singer.The story is well written and captures audience interest right from the very beginning. However there are many scenes which you wish would just end and many songs failed to capture the essence of the time. But more often than not, the songs were sensational and really captured the essence of the 60's and 70's.The songs make this film what it is. I was particularly moved by Hudson whose powerful voice was captivating and moving in the difficult scenes of the film. Beyonce to also emphasises why she is a famous female singer with many group and solo songs to show her beauty and power against the odds.It's a slow moving film, captured with amazing songs and a well written plot. Though feeling some scenes were perhaps unrealistic in context the film definitely conforms to the musical drama genre and is a must see for song lovers and passionate people.worth seeing",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It was OK,"I was interested in seeing Jennifer Hudson, who is from Chicago, and thought the story line would be interesting, but in truth, I was kind of bored. The songs weren't very good, (I can't even remember them - they were all sort of the same) and then the characters kept singing even when they should have been talking. I wished they would stop singing and get on with it. If I want to hear an entire story in song, I go to the opera - which, ironically, is what I had originally planned to see the night I saw this movie! I was impressed with Jennifer Hudson's talent, but otherwise I found myself squirming in my seat and looking at my watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Incredibly Bad,"This movie sucked so much. I am so amazed that 22% of people watching this gave the movie a 10 - were they just sucked in by the fact that it got Oscar nominations (somehow)?Absolutely nothing of any kind of talent in this movie. John Glover was ordinary, as were all the other actors in this film, including Eddie Murphy, who I always thought was talented before, but he only gave a glimpse when he sang his final song before being sacked by his manager. The Singing was horrible, there were no lessons in life or moral to the story, no need for any thought on the behalf of the viewer, nothing.Worst movie seen in years, 2 hours of my life wasted!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
'Show-buster' and painful mirror for characters and.....actors.,"DG's strength lies first and foremost in the 'sparkling' enthusiasm of the entire production-team!!But there is more. And it pinches...First, there is the star Beyoncé. She is at the top of the list of actors, but it is Jennifer Hudson who should be standing there, story-wise but also musically she completely overshadows Beyoncé. With 'Listen' the latter shows how great her talent is, but in my opinion Jennifer Hudson is the one who has the total rawness of human existence in her voice and expresses it in sound.
Beyoncé sings about it, Jennifer is it.
What a performer!
The class of Beyoncé, however, is that she obviously takes on this role and thereby willingly steps back for Jennifer's talent. That requires a class of an artist. With this Beyoncé deserves the stage that she has today.Secondly there is poor Eddie Murphy, the fantastic stand-up talent, who once made the mistake of becoming an actor. He can act, but is legendary bad at attracting productions that facilitate his talent.
But Dreamgirls is an exeption!. Murphy breaks free and puts down a layered figure like he never did and probably never will do again.
However - and how harsh - he plays a character that resembles...himself; the talent without steadfastness. Prey to the randomness of others.
Murphy plays murphy....
And i am moved...Dramgirls is not the best musical film, but it is one of those exceptional extrovert show busters, in which a small, fragile story is hidden about film characters and... actors.
The stars in this film are bigger than big, but they have confrontational positions in this movie ....Dreamgirls is a bustling show and a painful mirror at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"The more you see it, the better it gets","Jennifer Hudson is sensational and spectacular. You will come away wanting to hear her sing, And I am telling you, over and over again. In my opinion she does a better job than Jennifer Holiday. Eddie Murphy's musical performances are great. He shows diversity exhibiting a number of music personalities from the past in each of his musical performances. Beyonce is beautiful in her various photo shots. Jamie Foxx is convincingly ruthless and mean. Danny Glover delivers as usual. The young man who plays Jennifer Hudson's brother is also very good. The movie loses points for not being well directed. There were a couple of scenes that weren't transitioned well, the director just faded to black and opened with the new scene. The story fell down in other places because of the directing as well. This would have gotten a rating of 10 if it had been better directed. But the overall movie is good and gets better if you see it more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Where Did All the Good Music Go?,"I had viewed this movie because of all of the praises I had read on this site. It began and I settled down to watch a movie with a lot of the Motown sound. Unfortunately, and I have lived through the sound, there wasn't any in this movie. But I may be wrong because I finally turned it off after the first hour. I just kept waiting for some good music but got pabulum. This is the same situation as listening to modern pop music- it is empty and eminently forgettable for the most part. I guess it is just like the songs jazz artists still sing today - those composed in the 30's and 40's, so that the music today is facile when you have lived through Motown and the great rock of the 60's and 70's. Both the jazz songs and great rock stand the test of time. What will the young people of today listen to when they are in their 60's? I doubt it will be the nonsense being sung today.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A composite retrospective on the music of Soul and Motown,"This is a large, beautiful movie that stays true to its roots. Based on the book and lyrics written by Tom Eyen, the movie is an adaptation of the musical play of the same name that debuted in 1981.Condon dedicates the movie to the director-choreographer of the play, Michael Bennett, who died in 1987 of AIDS complications. He keeps the spirit of Bennet's creation intact with a bold, insightful, entertaining gem of a movie with dynamite acting and musical performances.The story is about three young women, a composite of the Supremes and Aretha FranklinBeyonce (~Diana), Anika, and the American Idol finalist, Jennifer Hudson (~Aretha) who as the Dreamettes meet up with a young promoter, Curtisa Barry Gordy Jr. surrogate played by Jamie Foxxat a Detroit theater in the early 1960s.Initially performing backup with James Early (a combo of Jackie Wilson and James Brown, and others, played by Eddie Murphy), Curtis turns the Dreamettes into the Dreamgirls and promotes their considerable talents all the way to the top of the musical world. The sets of Detroit and environs, LA, and other entertainment venues are uncannily realistic.The movie makes unsubtle commentary on the cuthroat nature of the music business and the racism back in the day that enabled popular white singer labels to steal the music of rising black bands. But the main thrust is the pure singing joy of Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and especially Jennifer Hudson who plays the brassy, complex, moody Effie....For the remainder of my review and other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Review,"Featuring Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx, Dreamgirls is a thinly veiled re-telling of The Supremes story, following the fortunes, friendships and loves of Detroit trio The Dreamettes. Despite a particularly memorable performance from the Oscar winning Jennifer Hudson as Effie, the film remains mediocre in its superficial depiction of the dynamics within the group's protagonists. Frustrating and inexplicable musical outbursts only add to an already disjointed storyline. However, for lovers of the original Broadway production and for its sheer musical energy - this is one to watch only with diluted expectations.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I watched this at home and walked out,The storyline has been told so many times it was like watching a rerun and at times the singing was like listening to cats trapped in a bag. I had to turn the sound down and eventually walked out of my own home to escape. Beyoncé always sounds like she's singing the same song over and over again without originality and Jennifer Hudson seems like she's trying too hard to sound like those that came before her and misses big. On the other hand Jamie Foxx and Keith Robinson's singing was very easy on the ears and authentic.... I've seen worse acting. All in all it's not a movie that I'd ever watch again.,2.0,Anonymous,Music
A Nutshell Review: Dreamgirls,"Dreamgirls had garnered 8 nominations in the upcoming Academy Awards, but somehow missed out on all the main categories like Picture, Director, and the Actor and Actress nominations. Based on the Broadway musical, with new songs added for the movie (3 of which are in the running for Best Song), it tells of a group of singers' meteoric rise in the music industry in the 60s, and on their trials and tribulation which plague any successful singing group.If the previous years had musical dramas like Ray and Walk the Line taking their fair share of honors, then this year it's expected that Dreamgirls follow the same formula and footsteps, only that instead of actors, this movie boasts two actual singers in its lineup, one an American Idol reject, Jennifer Hudson, and the other, bone-fide singing sensation Beyonce Knowles, who finally is casted in a movie which allowed her to show off her performing chops, rather than just her body in Austin Powers: Goldmember, or a dumb downed singer role in Pink Panther. Reported rivalry between the two? I'm not sure why the fuss, but clearly, Knowles had taken a back seat and the movie actually allowed ample screen time, and singing time, for Hudson to shine.While Knowles' performance is way polished, and her fans eager for her character to take the limelight, it doesn't happen until almost an hour into the movie, during which she happily sings as one of the dream triplets. Hudson on the other hand, put up a more heartfelt performance in a role which had a little more depth, and I'm of the opinion that her Oscar for supporting actress, is almost signed, sealed and delivered. One thing to note though if you're watching this movie in a theatre equipped with a decent sound system, listen out (!) for Hudson's eardrum busting vocals.Rounding up the star studded cast are veterans like Danny Glover, and two comedians turned serious performers Eddie Murphy (whose Norbit opens soon), and Jamie Foxx. Murphy stars as Jimmy Early, a successful singer in the small time circuit, who seems contended with his comfort zone, and Foxx, in a meatier role, as Curtis Taylor Jr, a car salesman who, in his discovery of the Dreamers and his wheelings and dealings, built up a music empire of his own. I thought Foxx's character was villainous in a certain way, a man blinded by success and becoming one of his own pet peeves. And yes, everyone in this movie sings. Eddie Murphy's performance is almost always full of energy, but fans of Foxx, don't count on him singing too much though, since he's already done his fair bit with Ray.Dreamgirls is a musical, so expect characters to break out in a song or two, or at times just a line or two. I didn't expect it to happen the way it did though, and was slightly taken aback when songs get interjected into dialogue, so you'll have to remind yourself it's a musical and it's perfectly normal. Loosely based on the Supremes' rise to fame, it tells of the prejudice and dirty tricks employed to get your way to the fame game. Having a good voice and nifty performances don't just cut it, you'll need a manager who's just as sly and cunning to work your way to the big league.And at times, talent gives way to how the business want things to be done. In the name of record selling and profits, you give what audiences want, compromising craft if you have to. Otherwise you'll have to be prepared to ship out. And it is during their climb to fame, that each character have to face up to changes, whether they like it or not, including replacing leads, or changing styles. You'll see how fame and fortune can corrupt, how envy and jealousy get in the way of something good, and wonder if being unscrupulous is the only way to survive.Besides the business aspect, love and relationships also complicate matters, with perceived love triangles and breakups amongst the team causing more harm than good. And a common theme running throughout is just how much you'd love somebody, whether as a person, or a product that you can milk for profits.Great costumes, great singing, great songs, great stage performances and a star cast, Dreamgirls has all the ingredients to what makes a successful musical movie. One thing to note though, I thought the end credits contained a nice touch with its showing of clips relating to what the crew did for the movie. You don't see that kind of a presentation too often.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Ugh,"Worst musical ever! And I've seen 'Hairspray' (the musical, not the fabulous John Waters movie, that is). There was nothing redeeming about this crapathon. Jennifer Hudson is clearly a terrible actress, and can't even manage to lipsync right half the time. Eddie Murphy was OK and everything, but no better than Richard Gere in Chicago, meaning, mediocre at best. And Beyonce always sucks. I can't believe there was ever even a rumor that this would be nominated for an Oscar. It deserves only to be forgotten. Bill Condon did a lousy job, even with the paper-thin script he had to work with. The screenplay was the worst part, though...it seemed like the characters had nothing to talk about except the boring plot points and romantic dramas that were dull and unoriginal. And I haven't even gotten to the songs. My dog could write better songs. Lame! Do yourself a favor and rent a real musical instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"So real, vivid and powerful !!!","It's based on a Broadway musical. The story is about a trio of female African American singers who want to be a star and their producer who used to be a car dealer. It's set in Detroit in the 1960s, when the civil right movement just started.At the time, it was very difficult for black artists to step to the nationwide stardom because white people took over like plagiarizing songs of black people who were popular in the black's music charts.The main actor was Jamie Foxx and he acted a bad person who is ambitious and cold like ""business is business"".The main actress was Beyonce and she was pretty and she sang R&B songs. Her voice was very high and light.I applaud the supporting actress, Jennifer Hudson. She acted a fat and not good-looking singer who has amazing talents of singing but her position as a lead vocal was replaced by another member (Beyonce) for less physical attractions. She sang soul music. Her voice was low and heavy and very powerful. Her songs touched me.Characters conveyed their emotions by singing. I like ""Listen"" by Beyonce and ""One night Only"" by Jennifer the best. I had listened to the music on the official cite of Dreamgirls before I went to the movie, but their songs heard in the movie theater were much better than those. They were so real, vivid and powerful. I bought the soundtrack after I saw this movie and am listening to it, but it's not worth for what I heard in the movie theater. I really recommend watching this film at the movie theater. Don't miss it.It was an amazing movie and the music was great.

All you have to do is dream!!,"Dreamgirls Director: Bill CondonAll you have to do is dream? I definitely wish it was that easy! This double threat ensemble proved that fulfilling their dreams were not as simple as the song ""Dreamgirls"" suggested. This film was the bittersweet musical/drama/comedy of the characters reaching their dreams in the entertainment business. Although the film follows the pattern of The Five Heartbeats, where everyone had their eyes set on one prize, Dreamgirls interestingly individualizes the characters' dreams to add complexity in song, to the traditional rags to riches story.Effie's (Jennifer Hudson) dream is to be a first class diva (and absolutely not a back-up singer). Yet, Effie's lover and the group's manager, Curtis Taylor's(Jamie Fox) dream is to be a successful businessman no matter what the cost may be. He even goes as far as putting Effie on the back burner, and gives a backup singer Deena ( Beyonce Knowles) the lead because of her cross-over qualities. All Deena is striving for is to be taking seriously. Once they have left their door opening act, Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy) that is when the drama begins!Dreamgirls is a film that displays the traditional story of the early R&B days of the 1960s moving well into the 1970s. During the sixties the colors of the backgrounds and costumes were soft and simple. This helped the contrast along when the seventies hit with sharp, bold, and defining colors. What also helped the decade change run smoothly along was the Detroit riot scene. This scene shows a clever way to set the transition from one decade to another, and a clue of what was to come. The balance of drama and comedy gives you a realistic yet objective view of the struggles and triumphs of the Dreamgirls.The musical aspect was done with precise that moved the story right along, without wanting to fast forward the musical numbers anticipating to get back to the jest of the movie. The music also enhanced the emotional value of the film as well.Even if your dream has been deferred, this film will make you proud that you ever had a dream at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Terribly Disappointing,"Dreamgirls has some wonderful things in it -- a wonderful debut by Jennifer Hudson, a dynamite performance by Eddie Murphy, some wonderful musical numbers and great singing but it simply doesn't hang together as a movie. The story and narrative are constantly getting lost and the most consistent emotion I felt while viewing was boredom.The editing of this movie is strange and distracting -- a reaction shot of Jamie Foxx seems to cut off his response to other actors, a shot of swiveling hips in a musical number seems out of place, dramatic scenes are brought to a dead stop by images which don't seem to belong.While Hudson and Murphy shine, Jamie Foxx playing the Barry Gordy roll seems out of place, mugging his way through a roll that calls for subtlety. Keith Robinson is a disaster as the songwriter C.C. White, leaving no imprint on the role whatsoever.I have to put the blame for this disaster on writer/director Bill Condon. The adaptation from the stage version just isn't successful and the acting is so inconsistent one can only look to the director for its failure. Dreamgirls is worth seeing, at least on video, for some wonderful songs. But if you're looking for a satisfying movie experience, give this one a miss.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Oscars for SURE!!!!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in many years. Some of the casting was a little weak - Eddie Murphy????? - but the characters pulled the show off.The performance by Jennifer Hudson was AMAZING!!! I can't believe that (as I hear it) Jamie Foxx was pushing Fantasia Barrino for the role. I'm not an AI fan and only heard of FB after she won the title, and had NEVER heard Jennifer until this movie. Fantasia has a good voice, no doubt, but she can't touch Ms. Hudson. If this show doesn't get at least nominated for several Oscars, I'd be very surprised.Beyonce was a decent choice for her role, but her character was just overwhelmed by Jennifer Hudson. I've never heard of the other woman who was an original member of the group, but she played her part extremely well.

I Haven't come down from it yet!,"Simply put, this is not a movie, this is an emotional experience! Like most of the audiences who have seen it in theaters, I participated in giving this a standing ovation! I won't retread the plot here which, as everybody knows, is based on the Florence Ballard/Diana Ross/Berry Gordy triangle (Diana Ross quipped on Good Morning America on Jan 16, 2007 that ""she might see this with her lawyer""-while wishing the cast well- and Jennifer Hudson dedicated her DESERVED Golden Globe award to Florence Ballard).Hardcore R&B fans may recognize events from the lives of James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Ike Turner in Eddie Murphy's ""James Thunder Early."" But overall, this film does what the best of films do. It takes the human condition and articulates it in a way that people can relate to and touches the heart, speaking for people who experience things but cannot articulate it for themselves. I know now how 1939 audiences felt after seeing GONE WITH THE WIND! Many people, myself included, will CAMP OUT at Wal-Mart and Target with CASH IN HAND when the DVD comes out.

Dream Fails,"Caught a minute or two of this on HBO when I was flipping about channels and it sounded catchy so thought I'd check it out. Well, that's a thing I watched.Didn't like it. It feels like a play trying really hard to be a musical and it just doesn't work for me. People start randomly singing at other people and I'm just like ""Do they hear that too? Cause they're playing it awfully cool just having someone belt it out at them."" That's possibly my biggest problem with this, it's so much a play that it feels like it forgets to movie sometimes and because of that it feels incomplete and disjointedly slapped together.That sadly leads into the performances too. The only one that really sings to me (get it? Sings? Cause it's a musical? Hilarious right?) was Eddie Murphy of all people. How pathetic is that? I mean, I do think he's actually really good here but he's upstaging Beyonce, Hudson, Foxx... He should not be the best part of this. Aside from him though I think the casting director was more interested in names than in actually filling the roll. I don't buy this shy, bashful, second fiddle Beyonce for one damn second. Foxx is just missing a big, twirly mustache and he's basically Snively Whiplash from Looney Toons and Hudson's insecurities and whatever else she's dealing with here never feels genuine either.Oh, the third member of the Dreams is actually pretty good too but since she's an afterthought in the movie figured I'd treat her the same way here.This is just bad. It's all the bad things about musicals put to one movie. It makes no sense and yet is somehow also remarkably predictable from start to finish. It's so all over the place that it never has the chance to really make any of these relationships feel real. Murphy is the best part of the movie to me and honestly you could drop his character and this would probably be better because we could focus on our intrepid trio.Don't watch this. If anything, go look up the musical numbers on YouTube and then just be done with it, don't let them suck you into thinking this thing is any good.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

As someone who found the film adaptations of Phantom and Rent very disappointing, I was relieved and pleased that Dreamgirls turned out well.

Dreamgirls,"Last night I saw Dreamgirls.What a movie I had chills when Effie sang.The audience broke into applause three times.Jennifer Hudson was absolutely perfect for the role of Effie.I don't watch Idol so I was not familiar with her or her beautiful voice.I don't know how she lost but lack of talent could not have been the reason that's for sure.I can't wait for the Oscar nominations to be announced. This movie has the potential to have the whole cast nominated.Now,Eddie Murphy he almost stole the whole movie.I loved Eddie when he was young and so funny.Beverly Hills Cop,Trading Places,48 Hours.He could do no wrong but I'll give it to him he was very young for so much fame.I loved him on Saturday Night Live hands down he was the funniest guy alive in my eyes.Then came Raw and I was done with Eddie.As a female I was so repulsed by that movie I never paid a penny at the show to ever see him again.It looks like age has brought him around to the talent he was long ago.His part in this movie I think will do for him what From Here to Eternity did for Sinatra.He's back and I feel will win an Oscar for this performance.Beyonce was good too shes got the looks,body and I will say she showed some acting ability.Jaime Foxx is the man as far as I'm concerned I love him.Good guy,bad guy,funny guy,singing guy he has hit his stride.Hell I loved him on In Living Color but never dreamed he had this kind of talent.There was only one part of the movie that I wasn't thrilled with.The few parts they sang the dialog.I'm not big on that format at all.It kind of made the dialog unimportant which was not the case.I loved the movie Jennifer Hudson can act.I think Broadway may end up her home she was terrific.Thank God somebody had the guts to make the movie.I wish I had seen the play on Broadway but I was not that lucky.I really enjoyed the songs and the singing.I wasn't sure who Keith Robinson was but I enjoyed his performance also.I saw Chicago at the movies and I think this blew it away on every level and that was best picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson saves this movie!,"What a pity. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie since it was advertised last Christmas. To say that i was disappointed was an understatement.Okay, let me say first that I didn't think it was terrible. The production values are extremely high and the performances are fine although there isn't much for the main leads to do except occasionally sing. Jamie Foxx plays it cool throughout and isn't stretched at all, while Beyonce, who is, without doubt a stunning lady, is left with virtually nothing to do except wear a variety of costumes and is even only given one solo song, Listen.So it is left to Eddie Murphy, who is perfect as the cocky, arrogant showman who believes that he invented everything in the music industry. He gets to sing, he gets to strut and he finally gets to act. For so long now he has been left in the wilderness with crappy family comedies that are not funny, so it's nice to see him getting another chance. Just don't blow it this time.The film, however, belongs to Jennifer Hudson. This newcomer, who came fifth in American Idol, puts everybody around her to shame. She is polished, alive and lights up the screen every time she appears. And when she sings the show stopping I Am Telling You I'm Not Going, I was reduced to tears. That girl can sing.And that's where the problem lies. Once you have been engulfed by that musical masterpiece, there's nowhere else for the film to go. So instead it drags its feet, and we have another 40 minutes to bare where, frankly, nothing much happens.We have seen these bands rise to stardom movies so often that it doesn't introduce anything new. We know that it will all end up okay. We know that Jamie Foxx's character will end up being the loser. We've been here so many times before. The other problem is there are far too many songs. This isn't suppose to be a rock opera, this is a musical, and yet we get snippets of songs that have do nothing to help progress the slim plot. Songs are suppose to help the plot along, not place in there for the sake of it, which some of the numbers feel like.The final act reads like a by-the-book soap opera, with various personal problems arising that will eventually end with a feel-good finale and the come-uppance of the Foxx character (not giving anything away there).If you do decide to see this, go for Jennifer Hudson and that amazing song. Otherwise, my advice is wait for the DVD or TV screenings. You won't feel as cheated then.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
What a feast for your ears!,"Showbiz is spectacular. Showbiz is shallow. Showbiz is ruthless.Not since the first Blues Brothers have I enjoyed a film about The Music so much. It's the Soul, R'n'B version of it but different, too.Where the Blues Brothers had car chases and explosions, Dreamgirls has spectacular costumes, performing shows, even hairdos spanning more than 3 decades. From the 1950s to the 1970s it is all there, both in the fashion and in the music.Surprising musical performances both by known actors (Eddie Murphy) and unknown actresses, with Jennifer Hudson giving a stunning performance as an Aretha Franklin type persona.The plot is nothing remarkable. It is the story of a trio of girls from humble beginnings trying to become music stars. But it is not the dialogue that progresses the story, it is the music. Starting from 1950s Soul and culminating to 1970s disco. It is a feast for your ears.If you even remotely like music, you will undoubtedly enjoy this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Embarrassingly Bad, The Worst Film I Saw in '06","This movie is all flash and no soul. The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers, but these numbers often didn't connect with the film and felt like stand-alone music videos. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you, every single one sounds like its coming from a studio, essentially sucking all the life from the songs. Off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry, ""strong"" (she's stubborn and selfish) black woman we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth to her character, nor any of the other female leads. Though I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's character faces hardship because of her weight, it is really her own refusal to do what's best for the team that lands her in trouble, making the end of the film totally meaningless. Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she put forth emotion (though it was often misplaced, but this was the writer/director's fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with an arc, and he did a fine job, but still not Oscar worthy. The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth into, no drama or heart, or even laughs. The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one; the number when Hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long-winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a Family Guy skit. The movie has no idea what it's about, and I felt insulted by the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and really is the worst film I saw in '06, and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"As Good As ""West Side Story""","While we were watching Dreamgirls we couldn't help but be reminded of West Side Story. Dreamgirls has that type of impact on viewers. Wonderful Miss Hudson. In a nut shell that just about says it all. This lady just doesn't have a set of pipes she has a voice that will bring you out of your seat. I thought that I grew up listening to Great Singers, and I was right, up and until I watched Dreamgirls and heard Miss Hudson sing: She's Great. The story line in this movie moves along at a good clip, but the singing by Miss Hudson pushes this movie over the Top. Just one more point to Miss Hudson's singing ability and that is when she sings you understand that the song matters most to her. Eddie always brings more to a movie than what anyone expects. In this movie he was at the TOP of his game. All of the acting in this movie was Great and I could just go on and on, but I will spare you. When you go see this movie you will leave the theater feeling bewildered as to how people can sing to that high of a level. Folks this is the best entertaining movie that I have seen to date. Everyone that had a part in the making of this film had their heart in the right place. Movies like this don't just get made by luck. Regards, HK",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fake Motown Sound Really Hurts.,"There are some good performances here, notably Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson, but unfortunately the music sounds like the kind of fake Motown that might have been played on an episode of 'Laverne and Shirley.' The dancing and costumes were good, but they made me wish that I was hearing The Temptations or the real Diana Ross and the Supremes. With all the money and talent at their disposal, I don't know why they settled for music with such a cheesy, fake sound to it. In 'Ray,' and 'Walk the Line,' you have musically based movies that have people impersonating iconic singers and the folks who made those movies strove to get the sound right. Also, 'Dreamgirls' was overlong.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Flawless,"In one of my film editing classes in college, the teacher assigned everyone to bring in a movie and show a scene with great editing. I brought in my well-worn DVD copy of Dreamgirls, and played the ""Steppin' to the Bad Side"" musical number for the class. The teacher was so impressed, we spent the entire class period discussing the film and never ended up getting to anyone else's assignment. From a technical standpoint, this film is absolutely flawless. Bill Condon, the screenwriter who famously turned the lackluster Broadway script of Chicago on its ear and made a cinematic masterpiece, adapted and directed Dreamgirls. Every time I watch either of his musicals, I'm in awe of his talent.Back in the 1950s and 1960s, musical numbers were usually filmed in a closeup so the audience could pay attention to the song. Modern audiences wouldn't stand for that anymore, and Condon created a style that was both inventive and captivating. All but one musical number splices footage of the performance with other scenes that both advance the story and have relevance to the lyrics. The opening number ""I'm Lookin' for Something"" features both an onstage performance and the introduction of the main characters, who are each looking for something. Eddie Murphy is looking for new backup singers, Jamie Foxx is looking to become an agent, the three Dreamettes are looking for each other backstage. Isn't that brilliant?The editing, completely in tune with Condon's vision, is phenomenal. The end credits feature a wonderful montage reminding the audience of all the different camera angles involved in many of the musical numbers. Virginia Katz certainly had her hands full with so much footage, and every second of every minute is a joy to watch. The arrangements of the songs, as well as the performance of the musicians, is top-notch. Some musicals are really only fun to listen to when you're also watching the movie, but I own the 2-disc CD soundtrack, and it's always a treat. Sharen Davis, rewarded by an Oscar nomination for her costume design, produced a variety of beautiful costumes that took the audience down memory lane of the 1960s and 1970s. To reiterate, the technical aspects of this film are flawless.In front of the camera is great, too! Bill Condon certainly got the best performances out of his actors. Pretty much everyone in the cast was praised, with one exception. Beyonce's beauty and powerful delivery of ""Listen"" was highly touted. Jennifer Hudson's showstopping number reduced everyone to tears. Eddie Murphy's Oscar loss to Alan Arkin was called ridiculous. Jamie Foxx was complimented for having the presence to stand up against all his star-power costars. Keith Robinson was called a promising new star. Danny Glover added sentimentality to the cast, and it was cute to give Loretta Devine a song, since she originated the role of Lorelle on Broadway. All these accolades were true, but who was missing from the praise? Anika Noni Rose. Yes, she gained fame later for voicing the first black Disney princess, but why didn't she get her due for this film? With the exception of the one showstopping song, Rose arguably had the hardest role to play.She has to be the innocent, giggly girl in the beginning of the movie who shrieks and squeals when in the presence of a famous R&B singer. She's pretty much ignored by her friends and has to downplay her importance of the singing trio, just to make Jennifer Hudson's character feel better. She gets seduced and enters into a serious affair with a married man. As the years pass, she's the only one of the three women who shows that the bloom is truly off the rose. Singing is just singing, fame isn't as important as it used to be, the famous star she once idolized is just a man with problems, and she didn't get what she wanted out of life - and she conveys all this while staying in the background of every scene. If Hudson's big song hadn't existed, Rose should have won the Oscar for Supporting Actress.Three new songs were written for the film (one for each girl): Jennifer Hudson sang the sweet ""I Love You I Do"", Anika Noni Rose and Eddie Murphy sang the 1970s message song ""Patience"", and Beyoncé got to belt out her self-discovery in ""Listen"". If you can't sing every song, new or original, by heart, it's time you watched Dreamgirls again. If you somehow missed it when it came out in the theaters, and never thought to rent it, just save yourself some time and buy a copy. It's fantastic.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Depending on your propensity of dizziness, this movie might not be your friend. There are lots of quick cuts during the dance numbers, and a frequent full circle camera movement that showcases the singers, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I thought it was a good movie but overrated,"Dreamgirls was highly promoted and sold on hype. I found it lacking in substance and lackluster in musical scoring.A definite criticism is the character of Barry Gordy - one of the great businessmen of the century, and a black businessman at that. He had to be marginalized and to a real extinct demonized. WHAT A SHAME. Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Keith Robinson all had to show their personal flaws with few redeeming qualities.Kudos for Eddie Murphy he will surely win the Oscar as so many black actors before him who have to follow in lock step with the Hollywood version of the evil or corrupt black male role",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointingly lame,"Wow, how bland and uninteresting was that? I wanted to like this movie but I never found myself caring about any of the characters, believing in the story, or enjoying any of the songs, even though this is (loosely) based on the lives and music of some of the great Motown artists of the 60's and 70's. The day after I saw this movie I couldn't recall one song that stood out. Actually, I couldn't even recall one song. That's pretty bad considering this is a musical.I found this movie reminded me of the 'The Five Heartbeats', a smaller production yet far superior in terms of character development, story pacing, and music. I haven't seen this movie in a long time and yet I can still remember the main song.A few alternatives much more engaging and/or enjoyable (in no particular order): Chicago, Ray, A Hard Day's Night, Singing in the Rain, Sound of Music, West Side Story, The Commitments, Moulin Rouge, Walk The Line, The Phantom of the Opera.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Superb Movie Experience,"A wonderful movie. Saw it in Houston and our audience, too, clapped during Hudson's ""I'm Not Going"". That was unexpected and the first time I have ever experienced that in a movie. I, too, got chill bumps during this song. I'm not sure Jennifer Hudon deserves an Oscar for acting, but certainly for best song in a musical. The costumes were also great and the staging was fantastic. Makes me wonder if there are any places (other than Broadway) that actually do that kind of stuff.Eddie Murphy was also great and I am glad to see he finally made another decent move. In fact all the cast were excellent. It makes musicals like the Producer's seem amateurish in comparison. Money certainly well spent. I will definitely see this move again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Totally Overrated and extremely repetitive...oh yeah and Boring!,"I don't know what the fuss is about this film. (I despised ""Chicago"") I especially don't understand how Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for her work. Granted she did make Beyonce look very bad, but c'mon an Oscar for this? She held her own OK, but Oscar worthy, not even close! If it weren't for the pretty decent singing and the excellent songs, and the fact that it is loosely based on ""The Supremes,"" this never would have been made. This was pretty much a waste of time, and unless you love musicals and don't care about the poor acting, (Eddie Murphy was pretty good, Jamie Foxx was totally miscast here, Danny Glover's character was totally wasted which was a shame) Do not believe all the hype. I hate it when people will love something just because they loved it in it's previous incarnation. (This based on a Broadway musical.) You have to judge it for what it is now, which was a very poor film. Don't waste your time or just watch Eddie Murphys scenes, and listen to some of the pretty much excellent music. I think a 4/10 is pretty generous of a score too. Out of 4 stars, I would give this 1 1/2 out of 4 it's that poor.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

I rooted for her on American Idol, and was disappointed when she didn't win, but this is much better!

A Mostly Miserable Time,"I really like Motown music, the Supremes and musicals so I was looking forward to watching this film but sadly I am very disappointed. On the whole this is not a good movie and I would not recommend viewing it. While there is good production values this film lacks any heart, depth, and joy. It is hardly entertaining and is mostly a miserable mess. Most of the characters are awful and too thinly drawn, I couldn't even tell you all the girls names after viewing it. Beyonce maybe comes out best here, but she is hardly in it and is barely developed, so she is more eye and ear candy than anything. A very disappointing film, don't be fooled by the glowing reviews as I was. And I did not like Jennifer Hudson's performance either nor her singing which was more shouting and yelling than singing. My rating of this film 3/10. I know not everything in life is good times, but I really expected to see a little more charm, levity, and vivacity from a musical film. And I second another reviewer's comment about seeing a musical with the actual songs of the Supremes.

I especially liked the 2 actresses who were the back up singers, I think they were very good even though they might not get as much attention as Jennifer Hudson or Beyonce.

"Gobble, gobble...","...as in this is an outright turkey. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to choose what to criticize. First, let me say I had some hope in its early stages: the music was nice 'n' rough like early Motown, the energy was palpable, and it looked like some interesting characterizations might develop. Within the first half hour, all that potential had dissipated into lame ballads that sounded more 80s/90s than 60s (was Diane Warren around then?); the energy went flaccid with poor direction; and only Eddie Murphy as James Thunder Early managed to bring complexity, interest, and soul to his character. It would have been wise to expand Murphy's screen time so we viewers could be rewarded, at least a little, for showing up. Murphy's look when a male actor faintly tried to dissuade him from hitting the hard drugs was almost worth the price of admission. A performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.For all the talent and time dedicated to singing, many of the vocalizations fell flat. I mostly blame the director who had almost all his singers start at a full-out volume instead of building their songs. Even the talented Miss Hudson suffered from this approach, thus causing substantial suffering to this listener's ears. And what was the waiting around forever to interject singing as part of the action/dialogue?!!? If a director is determined to use that fairly standard musical technique, then he/she better establish that approach much, much earlier than in Dreamgirls. Whadda bust, whadda waste.Finally (though there is much more fodder for dissection), even if the storyline was very accurate in its Supremes depiction (as Mary Wilson says), it was rarely presented in an interesting way by the director. Condon seemed more interesting in placing Beyonce in as many different looks as possible. She did look good, too - which brings me to the only consistently wonderful part of this film: the look (not the camera work, which was ho-hum), but the make up and the costumes. Those artists nailed it, accurately depicting the stylings of the 60s & 70s. Going' out on a good word....",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Bad voice synchronisation but worth seeing,"The movie was well acted. I hadn't seen the Broadway play so I can't compare. The actors were well chosen. Congrats to Eddie Murphy. I don't think all the awards nominations were deserved though but I'll reserve my final decision once I have seen all nominated roles. One thing that bothered me was the synchronisation of the voices. While in Chicago you could think that the actors were actually singing their songs in character rather than doing lip-sync, in Dreamgirls, it is clear that the songs were pre-recorded. I hope editing and sound aren't nominated for awards!!! I know it has been said before but the storyline looks very familiar to the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes, was the scrip for Dreamgirls art imitating life? Or was it simply vivid imagination?",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I just don't get it,"After watching ""Dreamgirls"" I just don't get all the raving this movie is receiving. I did think it was an interesting exercise in style, but nothing more. And it's OK, really; I didn't mind its cliché-driven plot very much: it's a pop musical, so it's supposed to be lavish, loud, fast-paced,outrageously stylish and inconsequential like a music video. And for all the money that's been put out, they sure did a darn good job. The songs were good enough, the production was first-rate, the costumes were dazzling and the music performances were mostly enjoyable.What I'm still trying to figure out is why all the fuss about the so-called groundbreaking performances of Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy. I was shocked that this movie even got nominated for its acting since there wasn't a single moment of substantial acting in the entire film - which was no surprise, really. Murphy, when not singing, was being the same old Murphy. Nothing new, certainly nothing Oscar-worthy.And what about Hudson!? Saying she's overrated is understating it. As I said before: there are NO characters in the movie with more density than a cardboard figure. They're just underwritten and are passable as we are completely stupefied by the beautifully staged music numbers and snapping our fingers to the catchy songs. Hudson's character is no exception - plus, she's a stubborn bitch who deserved to be punished for her hateful diva behavior. How am I supposed to sympathize with that? Why these people decided to promote her in the movie is beyond me. All of a sudden she's the star and we're to bear her high-pitched screeching for over two hours. And I was worrying about Beyonce who politely stepped into the background, accepting the shallowness of her character - I actually enjoyed her restraint participation. ""And I'm telling you"" was a monstrosity and after that I was praying to God that she wasn't going to open her mouth for the remaining of the movie. That WASN'T acting; it was hardly singing. To put emotion into a tune doesn't necessarily mean to distort it into screaming and grunting. And THAT was supposed to be the showstopper, the reason why Hudson got her Oscar when she was up against people like Cate Blanchett and Adriana Bazarra? It's a mockery and I just don't get it. Anyway, she's being much acclaimed now, but time will tell...",4.0,Anonymous,Music

It captures none of the essence of the 1960s...is overwrought and over-extended in the bargain,"Tom Eyen's stage musical becomes super-slick and commercialized tale of stardom for three black female singers from Detroit. Director Bill Condon, who also did the adaptation, relies greatly on whiplash editing to move his narrative along (and to get easy laughs and applause from his audience), though he fumbles the integration of music and conversation in key scenes while quickly losing believability in his characters. Taking place in the early 1960s, the film offers not a breath of realistic nostalgia--it's all been processed and punched-up to look like a modernized view of the past. Better 'inspired by' than actually based upon the career of Diana Ross and the Supremes, the story holds attention for about one-third of the way. Yet, with supporting characters either falling by the wayside or disappearing altogether--and snatches of romantic interplay caught on the fly--we never get truly involved in the lives of these people; the thin writing leaves them two-dimensional, and the occasionally poor lip-synching to the music-tracks separates us from the drama. Not much in ""Dreamgirls"" feels heartfelt, however those simply wanting a roller-coaster ride of emotions, fashions, and song will no doubt enjoy it. Still, the film doesn't leave much of an impression behind. Like a glossy advertisement, it comes and goes painlessly. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Her voice is so flawless and perfect...just so incredible. WHY DIDN'T SHE WIN American IDOL??? What's wrong with people??? Are they mental or what? But Beyoncé sings really good to, and when we were leaving the theatre her song ""Irreplaceable"" was on the radio and we blasted it and danced around the car. This movie will give you such a good and happy feeling once you have completed it. Believe me - it's definitely worth your time!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Fandabydozy,"Dreamgirls is fab. A movie with everything from good script, super directing and editing, top music, sweet singing, great sets and fine fine performances. Thoroughly enjoyable for me and I can't see anyone not enjoying it to a fair degree. Eddie Murphy is quite brilliant and Jennifer Hudson's voice...it does get the hairs on your neck to stand up at times. I think we all know the basic storyline by now so won't comment on that except to say that it is a very good example of it's genre. I agree with a previous poster that Chicago was also excellent but Dreamgirls just shades it for me. Agree with GG awards for Sacha Cohen, Helen Mirren, Jennifer Hudson....a good year for her then... and of course Martin Scorcese. He is The Man. Hope The Departed gets the best movie at the Oscars. I have Dreamgirls on DVD as well as Flags of our Fathers, The Departed, Babel, The Queen, Borat, Casino Royale, Apocalypto, Blood Diamond, The Last King of Scotland, Night at the Museum...(not had time to see the last two yet)....oh the list goes on. All good quality and less than a $1 each. I do love China.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Overlong, Oversung","For the first hour or so of Dreamgirls one could assume that this film was less of a musical and more of a musical biopic, perhaps along the lines of the excellent 'Walk the Line'. However, i'm sorry to say that it soon degenerated into mindless slush. The long road to boredom began when the characters began to sing the dialogue. This quickly became repetitive with each song lasting at least five minutes with only a short gap between them. Perhaps i am just not a musical person, although i have to say i enjoyed films such as Grease and the phantom of the opera. The songs in these, although long, at least did not repeat the main lines about 30 times. The songs that were perhaps exceptions to this were several of those sung on stage, as a proper performance. 'Dreamgirls' and 'Cadillac Car'were mildly enjoyable but i found 'Listen' the most moving.Overall Dreamgirls raised my hopes, but then sent them plummeting downhill - stay for the first hour, you can probably guess the rest.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Well Done- Yes, Well Done!","A great time at the movies- one of the best times I've had all year. And not only that, this is also just a great movie. Something about it brings you in right from the start and never lets you go. You don't want to be let go. In fact, you're sad when it's over.This is the story of three girls who join together to form a singing trio. They are hired backstage at a talent contest when the legendary singer James ""Thunder"" Early's back-up singers run out on him. From there, their street-smart and tricking manager moves them further and further up the ladder of success- unfortunately, there's pain and heartbreak along the way. Their manager will stop at nothing to bring them and himself glory, and the consequences are somewhat less than a dream. This amazing story spawned what is truly the best picture of the year.The music is one of the main reasons. There's something about sitting down in a theater and watching a great musical that still takes your breath away. And this is definitely a good musical. The only thing that could have been better as far as the music goes, is they could have put more of the characters singing to one another from the beginning. The first time it happens, it seems kind of unnatural. But from then on you embrace it lovingly. Great songs handled excellently by the performers.And the performances, the performances!!! Beautiful work by pretty much the whole cast. Beyonce gives the best performance of her career as the girl who ends up singing lead for the trio. However, the stand-out performers easily are Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy portrays the aging singer Early who ends up giving up a lot of what he believes in for success. He struggles with doing what his soul tells him to do, and what his manager says. His final scene got the whole audience cheering and applauding in my theater. And Jennifer Hudson- well let's just say she deserves every single bit of praise she's gotten. She'll blow you away.As the movie ended, after a moment of awkward silence, I began to clap- and then the entire theater gladly joined in. It went on for some time. Everyone was cheering. The movie is that good. Go see it!!! It is as good as it gets. Truly, a dream come true! 9/10 stars, and it deserves every one!Jay Addison",8.0,Anonymous,Music
What a slow movie!,"Musical numbers were done well enough...Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy greatly exceeded my expectations. I guess I just don't get Beyonce...pretty girl but not that exceptional in either looks or ability in my opinion. She can sing a nice ballad but was truly second fiddle to Ms. Hudson...what a set of pipes. I felt the plot dragged after the first hour and the anticipation level dropped to almost nil. Was anyone surprised with the death of Eddie Murphy's character, or the comeback of Jennifer's? Very predictable and just mediocre in it's entertainment ability. I've never seen a segment of American Idol and assume one of the big draws for those fans was interest in seeing Ms. Hudson's debut after being voted off. This was an outstanding break for a talented young lady, but other than that, I don't feel the movie will have much lasting appeal.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Rave Review And A Brief Complaint!!,"First of all, this movie can be described in two words: simply spectacular. First with ""Chicago"" and ""The Producers,"" the rise and success of ""Dreamgirls"" affirms that we are seeing the revival of the ""great Hollywood musical"" and I think it's just fantastic. I could go and on about how great this movie is, how phenomenal the music is, how well the script is crafted, how brave a white director is to take on (and succeed at) telling a story that is part of the African-American journey in the history of the music industry. I could continue applauding the actors for stepping up to the plate to tell what is essentially, a true story without commenting on their characters during their performances. I am so pleased that the excellence of this cinematic experience is being recognized by multiple nominations for multiple awards. But most of all, I am outraged. Absolutely outraged that Jennifer Hudson is nominated for a Golden Globe as Best SUPPORTING Actress. It is intolerable. Ms. Hudson was virtually the entire movie. Her presence is unlike any other I have seen. It is rare that a newcomer can outshine, let alone hold her own while sharing the screen with an Academy award-winner and a pop-singing favorite. And never, in all my years of going to the movies, has an entire audience erupted in applause in the middle of a film as they did after ""And I Am Telling You I Am Not Going."" Ms. Hudson's nomination is well-deserved, it is simply in the wrong category. She ought not only be nominated, but should WIN the award for Best Actress.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Supremes deserve a lot better,"The Supremes deserve a lot better.Dreamgirls is largely based on the story of The Supremes, the ground-breaking Motown group. However, the movie does them no justice. All the music in the movie was written especially for the movie. So you don't have any recognisable 60s songs. Plus, the songs are quite dull and don't really capture the sound of the 60s or of Motown.Throw in a rather linear script and unimaginative direction and the movie is nothing special. Plus, in a movie filled with musical performances, the director has random music-instead-of-acting scenes, like in a musical. It just seemed like overkill and totally unnecessary.Decent performances though. Eddie Murphy got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Not sure she deserved it though - she was good, but not THAT good. Then again, there wasn't much competition in that category in 2007.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Golden Globe Winner,"Although Little Miss Sunshine was probably a slightly better movie in 2006, this musical deserves all the praise it is receiving as it delivers a great cinematic experience. Beyonce's worthy performance showed range but didn't get her a win in both her nomination for best song and best actress. Eddie Murphy WAS soul and was extremely believable and charismatically eclectic in his role that won him a Golden Globe. Hands down one of the best performance in film this year, it reminds me a bit of the immersion into the character of Ray that Jamie Fox did a few years back. Jamie is great here too and breathes the business-mindedness of his role. A central character to the movie that is a great contrast to the beautiful & creative aspects of art. And art it is. The songs, the acting, the editing, directing & the story all mesh together to give us a fantastic voyage into the world of stardom. Being a musical, the actors sometimes break out in songs, but they are always welcomed and never feel forced. Almost perfect, a few moments of the films could have been slightly fine-tuned with perhaps an extra take or a change of camera angle, but the movie basically carries well from start to finish.The music is great and the way it is incorporated in the movie works very well, allowing also for the fact they they are singers. This works better than say Oscar-winner Chicago which was a darker, different type of musical. Dreamgirls is light-hearted fun, but the depth of creative efforts from everyone involves is exemplary.The other big Globe winner is of course Jennifer Hudson, who had a real life similar ascension to stardom in American Idol (which I don't watch and did not even know she was in until after I saw the movie). She does provide both the VOICE of the movie and the fresh-eyed emotional acting that justifies her big win. She seems to be perfectly soothed for the role and it was a great choice to get her involved. The casting was in fact dead on for all the parts. This movie set the bar higher for musicals and movies in general with a keen eye for storytelling across eras, fame and personal tribulations.Go see Dreamgirls. Go be impressed.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm just sorry.,"I hate to seem like a snob, but I really misjudged this movie.I really did try to watch and enjoy this movie all the way through, but with all the singing, it played out more like an operetta than a musical... not that there's anything wrong with that, but I expected more.There was less dialog than I thought there would be, and that really bothered me.Also, this seemed reminiscent of a Supremes biopic. It would have done better if it were a little more original.I just have to apologize for what I'm about to do.I'm sorry, but this movie is hit with a 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I loved this film!,"Prior to viewing this movie I was only aware that it was loosely based on the story of the Supremes. I refused to read any reviews because I just wanted to enjoy the film. The buzz was that Jennifer Hudson stole the show. Listen folks! She is the show! The story is centered around Effie White and the group. She and Jamie Foxx are the lead characters. I was so impressed by Jennifer Hudson's singing that I walked out of the theater and walked to the nearest CD-selling store and bought the soundtrack! I cannot wait for Hudson's first album! Wow! Oh, Eddie Murphy stands out! We all know that he has a decent singing voice, he really shines in this film! His character is fun and believable and there is one scene where his facial expression speaks volumes! LOVED IT! If you like Motown, R&B you'll love this!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Bland....very very bland,"Slightly pointless filming of 'not a very good musical to begin with'. Every thing about this film is distinctly lacking in vision and imagination... It plods merrily away for many hours and you are numbed into submission by it's blandness and the sporadic nature of it being a 'musical'.No.. I've changed my mind. This is an awful awful film and i'm so glad i didn't have to pay to see it. It so boring.. rather like this review..the same thing over and over and over again relentlessly forcing to hear how long and loud the actresses can belt those top notes... yes you can sing, well done... but please PLEASE stop.... but it doesn't and rather like the never ending car chase in Terminator 3.. it still goes on and on and on and on and on..and finally when you think it's going to stop, people randomly burst into song in real life (yes i know it's a musical.. but it's set itself up as a review rather than a musical) it makes no sense and the story (aparently there is one) is rubbish.and still it goes on and on and on.. and the belting gets louder and louder and louder and the melismatic phrasing in the 'tunes' gets more and more elaborate.. and then heads explode and Diana Ross makes a special guest appearance to re-enforce that this is NOT a story about her.

Hudson is perfect,"I just have to say that I just saw the film, ready to be disappointed by all the hype behind Hudson, and couldn't have been more wrong. Jennifer Hudson was perfect in this film, she sounds like a young Aretha Franklin and gave me chills. At the end of the film, when they show all the characters and end with ""and introducing Jennifer Hudson"", the audience applauded and you just knew this girl was a star. This film was so so good. I think that from the very way that the film opened, it fast paced music, one was never able to be bored. It was so fast and so emotional and so visually stunning and it sounded amazing. This film is the best musical I can recall in awhile making Chicago pale in comparison. I am very very excited for all of the upcoming success for this film, for Jennifer Hudson especially, and for the entire cast of Dreamgirls. Watch this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"phenomenal acting, bad movie","i went in to this movie, i am sorry to say, with a closed mind. i figured it would be lame and boring and horrible all around, a complete waste of my time. i was proved wrong and right.first, the acting was Phenomenal. especially Jennifer Hudson, who had never acted or practiced very much before. Jamie foxx was also wonderful. The scripting was very good. there was no lame dialogue or cheesy or corny parts in the movie.but i thought it didn't accomplish what is was intended to do. it was supposed to show how harsh the music business is and how hard it is to become famous and get on the pop charts. The girls get on the pop charts very easily and it doesn't really show how harsh the music industry is. also, it was supposed to show the start of Motown. it didn't have anything to do with Motown except for one two minute scene with a song of the Jackson brothers. and last, they ruined the musical part of it. considering this was originally a Broadway musical, it should of had more scenes were instead of talking they sang. but the only parts like that were when they were performing, or fighting with each other.personally i think you should go see this movie just to see the phenomenal new actor Jennifer Hudson, and listen to the singing (even though it is not my kind of music, it was great singing). so, enjoy",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Just like a dream,"A few short years ago, a little musical called CHICAGO came along and set the new standard for the modern movie musical. Picking up where CABARET left off fifteen or so years earlier, CHICAGO featured quick-paced editing that compartmentalized and sexualized many a shake and just as many a gyration. Its polished glitz and glamour announced the second coming of a genre that had been struggling for years. Long gone were the days of showcasing talent, leaving composition and aesthetic to bring up the rear. From now on, talent would be constructed to work with the visuals, allowing the musical genre to appeal to a generation that can't hold its focus longer than the time it takes to execute a four-step combination. The bar had been raised and no film has come close to CHICAGO's caliber since, until now. Following 1960's girl group, The Dreams, from their humble beginnings to their ultimate dissolution, DREAMGIRLS brings the musical back to the multiplex with a brand new R&B groove to back it up. Director Bill Condon hopes DREAMGIRLS will follow in CHICAGO's successful footwork all the way to solid box-office gold and with it, he throws his hat into the Oscar race one more time (following moderately successful bids with GODS AND MONSTERS and KINSEY). What all this repackaging suggests though is that a musical is a naturally difficult sell and though DREAMGIRLS had me bopping along, rootin' for the girls and crying out loud, it never let me forget how much it was trying to get me to like it.Condon paints a colorful scene, rich with deep blues and golds but all his aesthetic work is overshadowed by the brazen performances of his exuberant cast. Much has been said already but everything you've heard is actually true. As James Early, a womanizing, coke- snorting master of funk, Eddie Murphy is sneaky and sleazy and enjoying every minute of it. His descent from fame weathers his face but his spark always manages to find its way through the funk that finds itself watered down through the years. In many ways, Murphy's career mirrors Early's so the applause echoes both on and off screen. With Murphy showing new life later in his career, Beyonce Knowles shows a promise I had not expected so early in hers, if at all. Months of acting classes were a great investment for Knowles. As Deena Jones, Knowles transitions from a naïve girl hoping to succeed into a grown woman at the forefront of a groundbreaking female trio struggling to take back some control over her life, which has been directed entirely by the recording industry. It might not sound like a stretch for Knowles given her experience with Destiny's Child but her performance as Jones shows both vulnerability and desire. Perhaps her most impressive feat is scaling back her trademark vocals to play someone who supposedly has no colour in her voice. And then there is Jennifer Hudson, this year's breakout star. Your eye is instantly drawn to her and you wait for her to show you what she's got. When she does, you'll see why everyone is talking. Hudson's voice is so powerful and exudes so much character and emotion that it brought me to tears more than once. Hudson's Effie White gets all the best songs and the best trajectory as well but if Hudson didn't own every aspect of this character's fragile ego as it crumbles and falls hard, no one would care about this movie. That only leaves Jamie Foxx as Dreams manager, Curtis Taylor JR. You haven't heard much about Foxx but that's probably because he underplays the role so much that he ends up leaving no mark at all.The musical is not always simply song and dance; the musical can also be meaningful. DREAMGIRLS has plenty to say and it says it directly and without shame. The bulk of its malice is pointed straight at the music industry. The first point of its one-two punch assault is in regards to the treatment of artists in the industry. Deena replaces Effie as lead singer of The Dreams because there is more chance for The Dreams to crossover with a smoother, more accessible (read, more white, but more on that later) sound and the group gets no say. One artist will rerecord another's song and usurp all of their radio play if the label executives say so. The girls eventually lose all say over what they want to do with their own lives for the sake of their careers. In Deena's case, this is even more abusive as her manager, Taylor, is also her husband. The second punch attacks the industry for its whitening of soul music. Often, the songs that were being rerecorded were being done so by white recording artists with more popular appeal. This is what made The Dreams so important. They were able to crossover from the R&B stations to the pop stations. While the industry was exploiting their artists and exploiting an entire race, these same black artists managed to make their own inroads towards fighting racism by appealing to white listeners who were forced to face images they were not willing to before. That's the healing property of music, I suppose.DREAMGIRLS is not simply a monumental musical but it is a mammoth film. It is grand in scope and large in life. Though it stumbles at times, its soul is infectious and its satisfaction is sweet. Mr. Condon, you needn't have tried so hard. I would have liked you just the same.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Emperer Has No Clothes,"He's as naked as naked can be. This Emperer, otherwise known as ""Dreamgirls"", seems to have cast some sort of tasteless spell over it's subjects. However, I am not afraid. I'll say it: over-wrought, over-acted, over-sung and over-done. Although Jennifer Hudson has an incredible voice and displays some fine acting chops for her first time out, her vein-popping, red-faced, my-head-might-explode version of ""I am telling you"" made us worry for her safety. Even the quiet, retrospective songs in this movie we're sung at such a deafening decibel and with all the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Sometimes less is more and that's something this movie forgot about. I was amazed at the 2 hour run-time because it felt like 4. Eddie Murphy is entertaining and plays the only character with any depth at all. Beyonce is breath-takingly gorgeous and I spent the last half of the movie just admiring the costumes and how great her make-up was. Yikes! If this is the lead Oscar contender - I'm worried and sad. Please don't believe the hype. If you must see it - rent it. Or better yet, wait until it's on the stage again because that's where this type of show belongs. Certainly not on the big screen. It came across as cheesy and campy - and not in a good way.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Okay, but not all that.","Dreamgirls is a decent movie musical far above such recent efforts such as PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and RENT. The over the top praise is a little annoying, however. Bill Condon directs the film as if he has never been to a concert. Why were the Dreams always singing in nightclubs that seem to seat about 200? In some of their numbers they are singing without any microphones or amplification while on stage. What was up with the ""One Night Only"" number? Where were they? Studio 54? And what's with all the chorus boys in leather? Some great performances here - in fact all of them with the exception of Jamie Fox who just seems bored. What we don't get in this film is any sense of the world outside the sound stage in which the movie was filmed. It sort of reminded me of the 60's camp classic VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in that respect.Also, too many close ups - especially during Beyonce's superfluous I-can-sing-as-good-as Jennifer-Hudson number ""Listen""",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Musical should have.... GOOD MUSIC,"Wow, what a concept. I like musicals, so I generally have no problem with lots of music in a film. I also enjoy all genres of music. But all of these songs sounded the same; and the lyrics were just awful. At one point I thought a song was purposely bad for some plot purpose, but, no, that would be too intelligent and complex.The plot was predictable and meaningless. Cheaply produced television has more dramatic tension. The director/writers/whoever simply do not do enough to involve the audience into the characters. Also, as has been mentioned, there was no character development. The song numbers were WAY to long, especially since the music was so bad, and much too frequent. Every time I thought the film would settle into a bit of acting to move the story along, they would start singing AGAIN! Plus, the songs contributed nothing to the the story or the characters, simply repeating ad nauseam what had already been stated in ONE line of dialogue.There was no historic context either, as noted by others; i.e. absence of microphones on a 1960's stage, almost no changes in clothing over time, music all sounding the same. Some of the stuff they tried to insert was implausible: like they would schedule a recording session *during* the summer '67 Detroit riots??? Even if the studio hadn't been destroyed, normal people would have stayed home.And don't get me started on the choreography. What choreography, you ask? Exactly. Compare this film to Chicago and you realize how Dreamgirls is the deformed alien freakoid of all musicals ever filmed.Oh, and my feminist rant: That stupid photo shoot montage? a blatant opportunity for the males in the audience to drool over Beyonce.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Below Average,"I gave this movie a 4 out of 10, because it wasn't good or horrible. Its one of those weird movies where in spite of having EVERYTHING going for it it messes everything up. I mean this film was basically GUARANTEED a best picture nomination if it just would prove to be BEARABLE and it couldn't even come across in that manner.The problem in my opinion is Jennifer Hudson, all due respect to her accomplishments on American Idol (ive never watched the show) but shes not a good actress. In this movie we are meant to believe that she is the better singer than Beyonce but since Beyonce is more attractive shes gonna get the front stage. OK heres the problem, I like Beyonce I believe she is extremely talented and certainly more talented than Hudson, so when they try to tell me that Hudson is the better singer I just don't buy it.Also there's this thing where they try to turn Jamie Foxx into a villain, that doesn't come across well at all. First off Foxx's character basically puts up ALL his money to get this group going and all Hudson can do is hate him for ""holding her back"" or whatever. Welcome to reality, thats business, if someone pays for you to become famous, and continues to pay for everything they USUALLY have some say in how the groups functions.Now the good parts, basically every scene with Beyonce is great, she saves the movie (or at least saves it as much as she can). Shes the reason this film gets a 4 out of 10 and not a zero out of 10. Jamie Foxx is also great in his role, he isn't given much to chew on but he still delivers the goods. As for Eddie Murphy, he was alright, it was an average performance, personally I think if anything he should have been nominated for his performance in Shrek rather than in this film.Jennifer Hudson - ruins film Beyonce - salvages what is left and makes it great Foxx - delivers the goods even with this crappy role Murphy - lukewarmHow would this film have gone if Rob Marshall had directed it?",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy Steal The Show","DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 and was in the running for a film version long, long before it closed in 1985. Very loosely based on the lives and career of The Supremes, it told the story of a black girl group whose cross-over from ""race records"" to the pop charts fuel the success of an increasingly cut-throat recording mogul--and find the price of fame and fortune in the recording industry too high for their liking. While it borrows a great deal from numerous music personalities and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, DREAMGIRLS is essentially a riff on the career of The Supremes and the group's relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy.The Supremes were originally created by Florence Ballard, a powerhouse vocalist who worked with Diana Ross and Mary Wilson as back up singers. Berry sought a group that could cross over into the pop charts and reformulated the line-up, moving the prettier Diana Ross to lead--and ultimately dismissing Ballard from the group entirely, replacing her with Cindy Birdsong. After the music industry turned its back on Ballard, she declined in alcoholism and poverty and died at age 32. She is widely regarded as one of the great tragic figures on the long list of American rock and roll casualties.When DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 critics praised its powerhouse performances and its dazzling staging--but were somewhat less favorable toward its script and score, noting that the characters were one-note and with one or two exceptions that the score was neither memorable nor able to capture the sharply crafted pop hooks of the Motown style it tried to mimic. Even so, the play ran five years, and over the years numerous studios, producers, directors, and stars have took a crack at bringing it to the screen--something that didn't happen until 2006. And once more critics praised its powerhouse performances and dazzling staging--and were considerably less enthusiastic about its script and score.The great flaw in DREAMGIRLS is that, while it centers on the story of Florence Ballard, neither the stage nor screen version actually has the nerve to play it out: it, the rivalry between Ballard and Ross, and the brutalities of the music business are actually somewhat underplayed in an effort to place every character in a softer light. As for the music, the score does include the stunning ""I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,"" but the original criticism stands: although pleasant enough, the songs are not particularly memorable and they do indeed lack the sharp, slick edges of the Motown sound that inspired them.Like many another period film, the look is not really accurate: instead of accurately depicting the 1960s and 1970s it is that era as seen through a modern filter, the 1960s and 1970s as we tend to recall them rather than as they actually were. Even so, there is plenty of visual splash; the costumes, the concert stagings, and the overall art design is quite fine, and you never actually question accuracy while it unfolds before. And then there are the performances.With the exception Jamie Foxx, who seems slightly miscast in the role of music manager and producer Curtis Taylor, DREAMGIRLS is filled with memorable performances. Although she does not imitate Diana Ross per se, Beyonce Knowles captures Ross' look and sense of style remarkably well; Danny Glover offers a memorable turn as agent Marty Madison; and overall the supporting cast is quite fine. But the big noises her are Eddie Murphy as James Early, a role based on several singers of the era but most particularly on James Brown, and Jennifer Hudson as Effy White, the role based on Florence Ballard.Murphy's film career has been very up and down over the years, ranging from the popular 48 HOURS to the disastrous HARLEM NIGHTS, and he is at present best known for such mild comedies as DR. DOOLITTLE and NORBIT. He typically plays himself--but DREAMGIRLS puts him on the acting map in a serious way. Not only does he does he offer an extraordinary bit of work as the flamboyant but self-destructive R&B singer, he tears strips off his musical numbers. Prior to her appearance in DREAMGIRLS, Jennifer Hudson was best know as an also-ran on television's American Idol, which entirely failed to anticipate the depths of her vocal talents and acting skill. DREAMGIRLS, however, exploited what television missed--and while it is technically a supporting role, Hudson's Effie White is the glue that holds the whole thing together. It is easily the most remarkable screen debut since Barbra Striesand's 1968 FUNNY GIRL.DREAMGIRLS is not a ""perfect"" film, much less a ""great"" musical. As previously noted, the script is a bit weak and the music slightly below expectations, and when all is said and done it's a bit too glossy for its own good. But it is easy on the eyes, the cast is solid, and you'll never be less than amazed by Murphy and Hudson. The one-disk DVD offers extended scenes but little else; if you are a hardcore fan you'll no doubt want to go with the double disk special edition.

Wasn't what I expected,"I saw the movie a week ago. The movie started out a bit interesting. Eddie Murphy played James Thunder, which was a great character for him to play. Him and Anika parts were more interesting. Murphy was very funny and entertaining. The movie kept shifting to one person to another, with missing details. Jennifer Hudson played her part well, being sat aside because she wasn't attractive enough to sing the lead. Her voice was amazing. She sung with much feeling. Beyonce's acting was poorly delivered, her singing was okay. I particularly enjoyed more of the music and a few laughs from Eddie's characters, than anything else.

Best Film of 2006... Hands down!,"On the silver screen some 20 years since its Broadway debut, Dreamgirls is nothing short of spectacular. The large star studded cast included Grammy winner Beyonce Knowles, Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, legendary comedian Eddie Murphy and American Idol hopeful Jennifer Hudson. Dreamgirls is a story of three hopefuls getting their big break and the hardships that coincided with their stardom. Although she has top billing in the musical, Beyonce is triumphed over the acting and vocal performance of Jennifer Hudson. Hudson, who just came off a Golden Globe win, could be well on her way to an Oscar with her performance. Eddie Murphy's portrayal of James 'Thunder' Early was not too different from any other role he has done with the exception of his more dramatic side. But nonetheless, Eddie was great. The music was incredible and with great presenting, a nod to the Ziegfeld Theater in NY, made you feel as if you were watching the actual Broadway performance. To wrap things up, Dreamgirls was one of the best films that I've ever spent my money on or experienced in theaters and is the best film of 2006. And one more thing, Jennifer Hudson is well deserving of an Oscar trophy.Dreamgirls - **** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Music
in musicals we are supposed to enjoy the...,"music! i'm sorry but besides 'Effy White's' comeback song the music was really not something special.i was never a big musical's fan and i went to watch 'dreamgirls' only because someone invited me and i had no choice but to say yes.in any case i was thinking that its a nice movie i'm about to watch after all the awards and the Oscar nominations it got.the movie basically tells us about the start of the time of the real show business where the good singer is left behind and the beautiful one rises up.the film in general is not that bad, the screenplay is OK, Eddy Murphy's acting is really good and the cinematography was beautiful.but the music, the music is really disappointing, it starts and ends at the wrong time.at one point where the characters moved to singing from talking i had some people sitting next to me that started to laugh, the timing they changed from talking to singing simply wasn't good.but the worst is yet to come, sitting in the theater for about two hours i got to a point where i was really expecting for it to end but when it did it still wasn't time for me to go, the theater forces you to stay for the credits that are supposed to be special in a way.for someone that didn't enjoy the film it was the thing that made it easy for me to decide that the film is bad.i really hope that the next musical Hollywood will give us wont be as disappointing as 'dreamgirls' and that only the music in it will be enough for me to enjoy it, just as it is supposed to be in musicals.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm in love,"I am in love with this movie. From the characters to the songs to the fact that everyone used their own voices. It was awesome. The songs were great. The visualizations and wardrobe were great. This is what a musical should be! I can't remember the last time I was able to go to a movie and see this much good African American talent in one amazing film! I've seen it twice and i will definitely buy the DVD.If you're thinking about seeing this movie, but you don't really like musicals, don't worry. Most of the songs are done as performances, so it's not like people are singing conversations.Plus, the songs are good. As a matter of fact, some of them have even been released as R&B singles.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A Must See Movie!!,"I've seen Dreamgirls twice already and may go back a third time. It is an excellent movie with an outstanding cast and a phenomenal musical score! Dreamgirls opened my eyes about how the music industry handled artists and their songs. In my opinion I think the movie was loosely based on the Supremes. I say this only because I know a little history behind the Supremes and there is a definite similarity there. I was very surprised that Dreamgirls was not nominated for ""Best Picture"" but then again, who can figure out how they do their nominating. Eight nominations are great honors for this movie. Congratulations to Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy on their Best Supporting Actor nominations. They were both wonderful!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy: Reasons to See This Mediocre Costume-Fest,"""Dreamgirls"" has more puffy, shiny, macramed, and sequined 1960s costumes than a Barbie doll, but costume changes do not a movie make.""Dreamgirls""' construction is muddled. Scenes seem thrown together after being mixed up in a Cuisinart. Direction is clumsy. Jennifer Hudson's big number, ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,"" is undercut by poor placement of her on the screen.The script is only so-so, and Jamie Foxx, in a key role, is very badly cast. He's supposed to be a mover and shaker, a natural born leader. He just never comes across that way. In a key scene, he tells a vulnerable performer that that performer's voice is no good. That scene should cut right through the viewer. Instead, I sat there consciously thinking, ""I'm supposed to be moved by this, and nothing is happening."" The music? Look -- ""The Big Chill"" is a better musical depicting the power of the Motown sound than ""Dreamgirls."" You can't hear a Motown song without wanting to sing along, and maybe getting up and dance along. The music here is so-so at best, a terrible slight to Motown, which deserved so much better.You might want to see the movie, anyway. One reason: Jennifer Hudson. She's amazing. That she's never been in a movie before, and yet she is the most charismatic figure on screen, speaks volumes about Hollywood's inability to see and nurture talent in a woman who weighs more than 98 pounds.Hudson is beautiful. I don't care how much she weighs; Hudson outshines the much thinner Beyonce Knowles.Beyonce Knowles is beautiful, too, of course, and looks, convincingly, like Diana Ross. Like Ross, Knowles' non-distinctive face proves a perfect canvas for men's fantasies.But Hudson's voice is grand. I hope we'll see her again -- but given how the world treats plump women, I'm afraid we won't. So, see her here while you can.And ... Eddie Murphy. Murphy plays a non-comedic role, and his is the best male performance in the movie. In one scene, Murphy's character receives very bad news. He decides to do something self-destructive. Someone else tries to intervene. Murphy gives the other actor a look of such resignation and despair that I wished for ten more non-comedic performances out of Murphy, ASAP.As for the big message of the movie - that African American women had to slim down, look almost white, and sing ""white"" in order to be successful, I have a question. What about Tina Turner, Ella Fitzgerald, and Aretha Franklin? What about women like Bonnie Raitt and Joss Stone who strive to create a sound that has been associated with black women? Too, the movie makes passing reference to Elvis Presley and John F. Kennedy. These references are highly ironic, and yet the movie never seems to realize why. To gain the presidency, Kennedy had to publicly deny that his Catholicism would ever affect his politics. He had to lose some of his ethnicity in order to be successful. Elvis Presley was a hillbilly who became a lacquered, drugged up action figure in Las Vegas. He, too, had to change for success.If the movie had developed that theme more -- that all of us, of all ethnicities, are invited to sell out to fit in and make it -- the movie could have been more interesting.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
What an AMAZING film!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have really started to get into the whole adapted from Broadway thing we had RENT which is one of my favourite films EVER! But with Dreamgirls its different it's really hard to explain i was overcome with loads of different emotions (e.g. Happy, sad, angry) it is like a whirlwind roller-coaster of emotions and they are all present in the movie. Beyonce is amazing as always and then you have Jennifer Hudson OMG what a surprise she has an incredible voice! Eddie Murphy really surprised me! Jamie Foxx is incredible. The way the film is made with such beauty and dedication from the actors, I say make more movie's like this!! go and see for yourself!! When the soundtrack comes out i am going to buy it! if i had to sum this film in one word it would be ASTRONOMICAL!! I think this film will be the best movie of 2007 in the UK!

I went in with low expectations...,"Frankly, I'm not a fan of R&B music, but I decided to give this movie a shot since it generated so much buzz and my wife wanted to see it. I thought I'd doze off.

It is deeply engaging, the performances are top notch, and of course, just like everyone says, watching Jen Hudson seemed like the birth of a true star, it sent chills down my spine! She MUST get the Oscar, and today after watching the movie it is sad to see it was not nominated for Best Picture, it is without a doubt one of the top 5 of last year. (Chicago was better than Dreamgirls!?!?!?). I rarely comment on IMDb, but I was so moved by this movie that I had to write a review.

"This movie was ""Da Bomb""!","DREAMGIRLS is the dazzling 2006 film version of the Broadway musical that traces the meteoric rise of a girls singing trio throughout the 60's and 70's which most people believe is a thinly disguised version of the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. This glittering film version is the story of Deena, Effie, and Laurelle, a trio known as the Dreamettes who are discovered at a talent contest by a slick music promoter-wanna-be named Curtis Taylor Jr. Curtis gets the Dreamettes a job as backup singers for a singer named James ""Thunder"" Early, a lounge lizard whose talent seems to be outweighed by his ego, his womanizing and his partying. Early and the Dreamettes achieve a modicum of success when Curtis makes the key decision to make the girls their own act , change their name to the Dreams, and having Deena sing the lead instead of Effie because, even though Effie is the one with the amazing pipes, Deena is thin and beautiful and will look better on album covers and it is this critical move that changes the lives of all the characters involved forever. This musical made a star out of Jennifer Holliday, who originated the role of Effie on Broadway and it has now done the same for American IDOL-cast-off Jennifer Hudson, who dominates the screen as Effie, in one of the most electrifying film debuts ever captured on film. Hudson is a revelation in this role and completely dominates the proceedings with her powerhouse performance that rivets you to the screen in the musical and non-musical sequences. Hudson is, of course, a powerhouse vocalist and her performance of the show's best song, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" is, arguably, the greatest musical number ever presented in a movie. I was in tears halfway through it and when I saw the film, the audience applauded at the end of the number, something you don't see in movie theaters very often. Hudson's astonishing film debut won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Eddie Murphy also received his first Oscar nomination for his performance as James Early, a bombastic and hard-driving performer, who seems to be patterned after the late James Brown. Murphy seems to be having a ball here, creating a character who is alternately endearing and tragic. Murphy also proves to be an accomplished vocalist, making his musical numbers come vividly to life here. Jamie Foxx scores in the unsympathetic role of Curtis, the slimy promoter who never is completely honest about his third rate status in this business and never doubts any of the lousy, life-altering decisions he makes for James and the girls. The only weak spot in the film for me is the performance by Beyonce in the pivotal role of Deena, the reluctant star who turns self-assured Diva as the years pass by. In a role clearly patterned after Diana Ross, Beyonce definitely looks the part. The camera loves her and she looks stunning spread across a 40-foot screen, but the girl is no actress. This film features Oscar worthy art and costume design. The costumes in particular are stunning, perfectly recalling the look of 60's Motown and the score wonderfully recalls the Motown sound. Surprisingly, the weakest musical moments are two songs that were written especially for the movie, ""Patience"" is a lame duet sung by Jimmy and Laurelle (Anoka Noni Rose) that just slows the movie down and ""Listen"" seems to have been inserted just to give Beyonce's character a solo. These are minor infractions though...DREAMGIRLS is a rock solid adaptation of a Broadway musical that will have you laughing, cheering, crying, singing, and looking forward to seeing it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Overrated.  Just did not appeal to me.,"There was a lot of buzz surrounding Dreamgirls and it looked like a very appealing movie. After 20 minutes I was dismayed at how overrated the movie was. It just was not my cup of tea. I could not go any further as I had lost all interest in Dreamgirls and decided to skip the remainder of the movie.The cast looked really good on paper with Jennifer Hudson, Beyoncé Knowles, Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy who earned himself an Academy Award nomination. Maybe if I sat down and saw the movie again someday I will change my tune but until then I felt like I was not interested in this movie.Sorry to all you fans out there, but I thought Dreamgirls was boring and was nothing special.2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Wonderful Film,"I've gone to the movies about a dozen or so times, and I've only come out of the theaters liking maybe four of the films I've seen. And this is one of them. This movie is superb in so many ways, I loved almost everything about it. The movie is based around the Supremes, Barry Gordy, and basically all big singers of the Motown era. There was a few flaws in the film, nothing technical, more historical, other then that though, the film was a great movie, with wonderful casting. Most musicals have two good songs, maybe three, but the rest are just annoying and fillers, but in Dream Girls, every song is heartfelt and done well. My only problem with the what the critics are saying is Beyonce does a fantastic job, and she shines in this film, and I'm not saying agree with that part, but they're taking the spot light away from the real and talented actress Jeniffer Hudson, who I think deserves a best actress nominee, because she held that roll more than anyone else in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Jennifer Hudson is outstanding,The movie is excellent. I saw the first one when I was younger and hated all the singing. Now that I am older and wiser I realize what an excellent script it is. I believe Beyonce's name is used to get the younger generation into the seats. Her role is so trivial that she should have her name removed from the marque and Ms Husdon's name should be in lights. She did an outstanding job and if not given an Oscar or some other award Hollywood is sincerely corrupt. I honestly forgot it was a movie and not the Broadway play. If the curtains had closed from time to time it would have been just like the Broadway play. Eddie Murphy does a nice job as well. He stays true to character. Jamie Fox portrays his character well indeed. However; Jennifer Hudson is definitely the star of the show.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Starts good, gets worse, in the end terrible","This movie starts good with excellent recreations of 60s soul. You think you are in for the time of your life. But a bit into the movie, when we reach the late 60s, this musical loses touch with the history of the American soul music it aims to portrait. Song after song, the music turns worse and worse, and at the same time the movie gets worse too, losing itself in sentimental junk. Now, we all know soul music in real life also turned worse. It never got the force back that it had in the mid and early 60s, and much 70s soul was bland and terrible, though not as terrible as what counts as mainstream ""r&B"" these days. But there was good 70s soul too, and let's not forget funk. This movie forgets it. After the fairly adequate and great display of 60s soul styles in the beginning, the rest of the music is antiseptic, orchestrated Broadway fake-soul ballads of the worst type. The mood of the last half of the movie is a long-winded 'the good days are gone' melodrama of seriously bad quality. My advice: look a the first twenty or so minutes, then forget about it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

My husband enjoyed it too--a musical at that. Beyonce, although upstaged by Jennifer Hudson was so versatile--she never really looked the same (except beautiful). All the Dreamgirls were great singers. The movie was also true to it's 60's period details with great costumes and sets.

Definitely a must see but I am surprised by the hype,"I finally got a chance to see Dreamgirls this weekend and I must say that it was a good movie but really not worth all the hype. I love musicals. And i really wish there would be more made.Singing in the Rain is one of my favorite musicals turned into a movie.This movie was okay. But to me it was more like a movie mixed with a music concert. I didn't care for the full on performances. It made me feel like i was watching someone at a concert. One or two full songs is all i could handle. The parts that were musical like, to me, were the scenes that were songs depicting dialogue - Family, It's over, And i'm telling you, and Listen. You got to feel the character's emotions. Which is the best thing about a musical.As for the Actors, I pick the worst and the best:Not a fan of Eddie's performance. He was decent but not worth the hype. To me he didn't add much more to the character than he would from any of his other roles. Sidebar of what i'm talking about. I was listening to an online music site and this song came on and i was like, what the heck is Donkey from Skrek singing about. I clicked on the box to see what the name of the song was and sure enough it one of the songs from this soundtrack. oye!For a first timer, Jennifer was great. You believed her struggle. She fell flat a few times in her delivery of some of the lines but overall she did an EXCELLENT job portraying Effie. And we can't deny that she SANG her butt off.There really needs to be more movies that show entertainers. Performers that can do more than deliver lines. Adding Singing & Dancing to the mix (depending on what story you're trying to tell) is always refreshing!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
It's Jennifer's Movie,"If only I had seen the Broadway show I would be able to compare Hudson to Holliday, but I didn't so all I can say is Jennifer Hudson owns the movie and is the heart and soul of the story. Certainly ""Effie"" is the heart and soul, but Jennifer as Effie is superb. In the theater this morning, there was applause after each of her numbers, as well as when her name rolled on the credits. Wow.I'm an ""AI"" fan, so have been pleased to see the successes of past winners and finalists pile up this year, but Jennifer Hudson's film debut as Effie White will be the most memorable success of all. The question shouldn't be will she get nominated for an Oscar, but what could she possibly do to follow this after she wins? I think Best Actress would be better suited to the part, but Best Supporting Actress is probably more attainable on an ""introducing...."" role.Eddie Murphy's portrayal of Jimmy was also a star turn. I started out watching Eddie Murphy acting, but he disappeared into the part and really was Jimmy Thunder Early. Dancing, singing, arrogant banter and all, he should also earn a nomination from the Academy.Outstanding singing done by all the cast members and Beyonce' (and I don't know if there is a human more gorgeous)was delightful as well, especially in the early scenes as a young and innocent hopeful. She, Anika Noni Rose and Sharon Leal were beautiful, harmonious and believable.Speaking of Sharons... Sharen Davis did a superb job with the costumes and should get her nod, as well. Keith Robinson as CC....there are just too many heartfelt and winning performances to name. GO see it!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Stinks. Loud. Obnoxious.,"If you love loud, shrieking noise, this is for you. It's obnoxious, unrealistic, nothing at all like and an insult to the '60s Girl Groups.Expected to see the Supremes, enjoy their songs. Instead, it's a bunch of broads shrieking in the 'new' cacophonous style, as if to prove that loud noise and singing are the same thing.At least I had the laptop to read while others watched this dog's breakfast.Go ahead, call me an insensitive, uncultured, boor. You think I care? I don't. It is what it is. Were it up to me, I'd use the DVD for a mini Frisbee, or maybe scrape up dog droppings with it.Would rather listen to a V-8 engine with the oil drained out, slowly grind itself to metal shavings than this dissonance.The story line is almost as interesting as watching a dog throw up it's breakfast.

It was awful,"What is up with you people? I thought it was awful. It was a Broadway Musical trying to fit in a cinema screen, unfortunately , it didn't work quite well, even though i believe it would be amazing to watch it live in theatre, i thought it lost all the magic as a movie. Many performances was quite poor especially those with Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx.. Beyonce does not even do that much singing, it is mainly Jennifer Hudson and yes She does have a powerful voice but songs were poorly dubbed. There is not that much of a Story line either, The film maybe slightly related to Diana Ross and The Supremes but again not accurately. It was more covering of a time when Motown was at the top of its golden years. I thought there were bits that were even cringe worthy like the Jackson 5 lookalikes were hideous.

"If I'm Lying, I'm Dying. Brilliant Performance by Jennifer Hudson","Dreamgirls is by every standard and regulation, a musical. If this is not of your taste, then the movie MAY not be to your liking, however you should not rule it out by just knowing this one simple fact. Yes, the movie portrays the struggle of African-American entertainers during this era as well as personal struggles that happen between all of us, of all races, but it does so in the form of a musical. (for those of you who don't know, a musical can consist of characters singing to each other to express dialog, songs that tell a story and do not necessarily rhyme, and people breaking out in song for no apparent reason) you don't have to like the music to enjoy the context of the movie and the message it portrays. My personal opinion is that this movie was extraordinarily beautiful, and having also seen the Broadway production, it was an even better rendition of the story. I'm not sure how good it would be without vocal powerhouses Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce' Knowles, but the story and the musical performances were filled with emotion and soul which is exactly what the movie is trying to send across to it's audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An iconic era in soul music shows us that all that glitters is not gold,"Dreamgirls seems like a winner from any angle you look at it from. Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy in a film directed by Oscar winning writer Bill Condon about the rise and demise of splendorous R&B group The Supremes. In fact the film does look quite pretty at times plus plenty of toe-tapping, dreamy musical numbers that electrify your senses. The success of Chicago 5 years ago has revitalised the popularity and appeal of stage to film musicals. Combining so catchy tunes and spectacular glim and glamour, audiences find it hard to resist the genre. Add the overwhelming buzz on it's run to the Oscars and you have a sure fire hit.The film is a roman à clef about the onset and heyday of Motown and in particular one of the most popular R&B groups, The Supremes. We witness their ascent to fame, the divisions between the manager's wants and public tastes and their struggle to remain in vogue in a changing world of popular music.Condon helms the film with the all-star cast fully showcasing the razzle-dazzle and enchantment of the songs and glittery costumes and wigs. He brings a confident assurance to the film's success, previously winning an Oscar for his writing and being nominated for the best picture winning Chicago.However something must have gone wrong in Dreamgirls because it's efforts are incredibly disappointing. His directing fails to light any spark or interest in the characters, and the musical numbers are directed with laziness and indifference. More shocking is his writing, which is mediocre and abysmal. There are so many clichéd moments that made me cringe and cry out in frustration including some very cheesy dialogue and awkward moments in the second half involving the gratuitous worship of Beyonce. The acting (especially from big-name stars Beyonce and Foxx) is for the most part uninspired and forced.The buzz about Hudson and Murphy is well deserved with Hudson stealing every scene she's in from *all* the other actors. She easily topples all the others when she sings, overpowering them in volume, timbre and tenderness. And is completely natural. You can see that her acting is not as smooth as more experienced actors, but she remains very impressive considering this is her first acting role. Along with Murphy, she is the only one in the film who is truly acting, and not just imitating. Murphy downplays his role as the big musical attraction of the film, breaking away from his comedy star persona. He brings verve and exhilaration in his racier moments to affecting poignancy in his more tender moments. Foxx seems overtly smug and suffers from from bad writing of the ""bad-guy"" syndrome. While Beyonce is admirable, she's such a dull character not helped by her acting talents.The songs in the film keep you bopping along throughout but the pace lags especially during the second half and here it descends into shallow melodrama and clichéd soapy writing. As avid lover of musicals, I thought the numbers were a delight but the lyrics lacked the sharpness and wit akin to say Rodgers and Hammerstein, or more relevantly Chicago and The Producers. I will admit that it's not really the fault of the film, but the numbers were actually a bit shallow and trivial to the theme of the film. Now I don't really have a problem with dubbing - and I understand that it helps to refine the sound on the film track - especially if it sounds reasonable and looks realistic, but sometimes it became too conspicuous and I felt discredited some of the film's integrity.It was actually interesting to notice that as Hudson is the newcomer in the film she is not mentioned on first billing in the credits and publicity. But her role in the film actually becomes the lead as she upstages the other characters and is recognised as the best singer of the Dreams. Plus she eventually becomes central and pivotal to the outcome of the Dreams' career by the film's end. Also interesting was the (coincidental) connection between Beyonce's character and her real life struggles of being an overproduced, over-hyped and marketed mediocre singer. Is it too much of a a stretch to suggest this is how it plays out in real life?Dreamgirls should have been so much better. Considering the hype leading into it's preliminary screenings and pre-emptive Oscar buzz, its astonishing to see how it has all fallen apart now. The lackluster and uninspired direction, combined with the cheesy and juvenile writing ultimately sink this ship. Even with it's high production values and saving graces from Hudson and Murphy, the film fails to impress. It is hard to resist the comparison with it's contemporary Oscar compatriot Chicago as they both were heavily gunning for Oscar glory and share the same writer. But where Dreamgirls fizzles and Chicago shines is in the slick costumes and art direction, sharp and satirical direction, murderous critique of society and a persuasive and meaty storyline. In Dreamgirls, I was entertained for the most part, but even more, I found myself bored and disappointed by what could have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Watch this for Jennifer,"So I am late to the party on this one. Full disclosure: I do not like musicals. They're just not my favorite genre. All that s-i-n-g-i-n-g. People don't burst into song in real life, which is why I prefer dramas.So 14 years later, Dreamgirls is on HBO and I think, what the hell. I had missed the first hour but Dreamgirls is that kind of movie: you can miss the first hour and pick it up where it is. We all know the story: based on the story of the greatest girl group of all time, The Supremes, and their Svengali, Berry Gordy.I tune in around the time that Effie, played to utter perfection by Jennifer Hudson, is late for rehearsals and is being told that she is being let go from the group. More singing ensues. And then Jennifer sings The Song, ""And I'm Telling You"".We all know the story about Jennifer Hudson. Feels like it's passed into legend. To say her career story is serendipitous is being redundant. But watch her as she stands there and belts out a full throttle, shot across the universe and back again that even Michael Bennett, the original writer of Dreamgirls, heard from his place among the angels.Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and Beyonce are cardboard cutouts, more or less. The sets and costumes are over the top in a desperate attempt to capture the era. I didn't buy it for a second. Beyonce's face is splashed across the latter half of the film in various poses and photography, a la ""Miss Ross"". To say she has no range is like saying the sky is blue. It's that evident. Never for one moment did I believe her as anything other than Beyonce, rather than the character, Deena.I can only imagine what thoughts flew through Beyonce's mind as she watched Jennifer Hudson, a complete unknown at the time, steal every moment of every frame she was in. Hudson devoured the film; you could not take your eyes off her when she was on screen. One can even say she was born to play this part, especially given the serendipitous journey she took to get to that place. And I was happy to see that the film stayed fairly close to the original play. Watch this for Jennifer Hudson's breakout performance and nothing else.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Its superb,I think this film is amazing it is really helping to put musical films back on the map Jennifer Hudson will get an Oscar for sure! brookleys.info http://brookleys.info. This film will be a real hit with families as well as all generations. it is great to see Eddie Murphy taking a more serious role as he obviously has the ability to play roles which require a much more serious actor. Beyonce was fantastic but I am sure she is not best pleased about being upstaged by Jenifer Hudson but what a performance an amazing singer and good actress I am sure will be seeing much more of her in the years to come! The whole cast was picked perfectly and now Jamie Foxx has another classic under his belt.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
"More like ""ScreamGirls""","I didn't enjoy this film very much. For one thing, it was like an awkward musical---every time the actors had to break into song, they looked very unsure of themselves. The songs seemed to start very unevenly; not like other musicals, like ""Grease"" and ""Mary Poppins"" where the songs immediately start & fit with the situation. All of the actors COMPLETELY over-sang their parts; all they did was scream. And might I add that, interestingly enough, there weren't any white people in the film--- except when they portrayed the white citizens as stealing their songs and re-making them as boring. The character Effie is quite irritating; she ""blames the world"" for all her problems, especially when her friend Deena (Beyonce Knowles) gets the part for lead singer. Can't say I'd recommend this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Hudson lifts musical to greatness,"If the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences--the folks behind the Oscars--gave an MVP award, this year's would go to Jennifer Hudson in ""Dreamgirls"". She is going to be largely responsible for the film's sizable box office--particularly for a musical--and the love come awards season. This film belongs to her and when she is on screen she makes everyone look better--much like perennial NBA MVP Steve Nash. Will her follow-up projects be as outstanding? Who cares. With her performance of ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" she has earned her spot in Academy Awards montages for decades to come.""Dreamgirls"" looks amazing, sounds incredible, and has long been a dream project for producer David Geffen. And yet, the film's story often lacks punch. Its story will be immediately be familiar to anyone who has ever watched an episode of ""Behind the Music"". The story follows girl group the Dreamettes as they crossover from R+B success to pop radio while Berry Gordy-like producer Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jaime Foxx) reaps the financial windfall. As the Dreamettes court suburban radio listeners, they have to sacrifice their R+B roots and become more bland in appearance and sound. This leads to a power struggle between diva Effie (Jennifer Hudson) and Taylor.The film doesn't hold many surprises and therefore has trouble sustaining its running time. Beyonce Knowles, playing Dreamettes member Deena Jones, has to do a good bit of the dramatic heavy lifting and is only passable. We understand that the character's malleability and blandness makes her ideal for the pre-fab made for pop radio hits Taylor wants to produce, but this fact also makes her a less than mesmerizing lead. I suspect that this problem has more to do with the script than Knowles performance.And yet, the movie is a must-see. Hudson is a revelation as is Eddie Murphy as the soul singer James Thunder Early. If both don't receive Oscar nominations, it will be a shock. I think critics may be tempted to overpraise the film because good musicals are so rare. And many film fans love the sheer escape and unabashed joy of the musical.The movie definitely has third act problems, but when it succeeds, it soars. One of the year's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Oscar For Sure,"Well it's that time of year again for Hollywood to go all sincere and provide earnest performances, inspirational stories and the usual Oscar bait. Dreamgirls certainly ticks all the boxes necessary and for the first hour it provides a lot more. The opening is superb and draws you in straight away and all the Dreamgirls are charismatic and likable, Murphy is superb as Jimmy Early, Foxx as the devious manager and Glover as an old school promoter also play their part. But after a bright and breezy 40 mins the film starts to drag, issues are skipped over. Race issues are touched upon, the tangle of relationships of the girls is also given a bit of time but nothing seems to come into focus. Add to this what is meant to be a rousing conclusion and I cant help but think that Dreamgirls is a plastic Oscar product.Having said that the songs are superb and all performed extremely well and anyone into the Motown sound will get a kick out of spotting the sound a likes. But for a film that focuses on singers with real soul its a quality surprisingly lacking in the film itself.6/10 - Probably an Oscar winner but in a few years it will be long forgotten.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
DREAMGIRLS is how you turn a Broadway musical into a very good film!,"Twentyfive years ago I had the great pleasure of seeing two of the most powerful stage performances in the same day. I went to a matinée of NINE with the amazing Raul Julia, that evening I saw Jennifer Holiday in Micheal Bennett's DREAMGIRLS. This was a week before the Tony's and I was in musical theatre heaven! I also thought, at the time neither film would ever make it to the screen...well not as they were envisioned for the stage.Twenty five years later director Bill Condom sends a long overdue dream of a valentine to Micheal Bennet with his very original adaptation of DREAMGIRLS. OK, I'm with the crowers about Jennifer Hudson's performance but the film goes beyond her greatness. I actually loved Eddie Murphy, an actor I've despised since he was on SNL. Beyonce Knowles is beautiful and get this, she can act...she is a movie star.I hope all the hype won't hurt it for the major Oscar nominations.After failures like THE PRODUCERS, ANNIE and A CHORUS LINE I'm very happy that somebody got it right.DREAMGIRLS creator Micheal Bennett would be proud!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls Rocks!,"This movie was awesome. Jennifer Hudson was absolutely amazing. In my humble opinion, she put Beyonce to shame. Although Beyonce was good, Jennifer lit up the screen. Her rendition of ""And I'm Telling You"" was probably the highlight of the movie for me. This movie is a must see and will definitely be added to my DVD collection as soon as it's out! I was however disappointed to see that it wasn't showing in all theaters. There were several theaters that it was not showing at. We had to drive almost two hours to see it. And we have two movie theaters in my town that have at least 10 screens in each. Neither one of them had the movie. I was very disappointed to see that.Why is that I wonder? Does the mainstream not want the movie to do well because the entire cast is African-American? What's up?",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I enjoyed this movie,"I went to see Dream Girls with my daughter, my sister and my niece. We had a wonderful time. The music was inspiring. I can't wait to get the CD. When Jennifer Hudson sung "" And I am telling you. The whole audience clapped. It took my breath away. All of the music was touching. The acting was great also. You could feel the emotions.After it was over we just sat there watching the credits and talking about how much we loved the movie. They really captured the era. The clothes the hair styles. All the women were beautiful. The men were so handsome. And the voices were excellent. I came home and called my friends and told them how much I enjoyed the whole movie. My husband did not go with us. I think I will return with him to see it again. It was a clean movie. There was the suggestion of sex and drugs but it was done so tastefully that I think it is a great movie for all ages. I hope to see more movie of this caliber. I went online tonight to express my opinion of this movie. Everyone who loves music should see it. they will be happy they did.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Mediocre copy of (better) movies that have come before it.,"I had reservations about this movie from the time that I first saw it advertised. It struck me that with so many movies already made about the African American community's struggle to make it as entertainers around the period in question, there could be nothing new to add. Eg, RAY, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, etc. Although the latter is about Jerry Lee Lewis it covered the African American issues of the period too. So...I avoided seeing Dream Girls at the cinema. I recently had the opportunity to view the movie on DVD and my fears were realised. The thing that makes the other movies I have mentioned interesting is that they give you insight into the actual lives and struggles of real people. The music in these movies consisted of real hits that add the power of nostalgia for the viewer. These missing elements from Dream Girls make it boring and insipid. It feels like a carbon copy of a story that you already know. If you want to see interesting movies set in the context of the beginnings of African American influence on popular music try the movies I've mentioned. Dream Girls is just a mediocre copy that misses the mark by miles.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Take Hudson Out and it's a Decent Movie,"It is with deep regret that my first submission to IMDb is to describe a movie that just doesn't cut it.This movie is loaded with potential, and blasts off to a fast pace and near exhausting energy level in the early going. But the shine goes away as it spirals into a Jennifer Hudson yellfest.Jamie Foxx gives us his normal great performance, and Beyonce is charming, but the performance superlatives end there.As a viewer of AI I was very much captivated by the Jennifer Hudson ugly-duckling-rags-to-riches success story she'd become. But as I scrambled to disable the audio features of my home theatre I realized that the day had come to admit I was wrong about her talents. Her mediocrity weighted this movie down noticeably.And I think that's where you'll see the lines of opinion drawn in this movie. Those that enjoyed Hudson will like this light hearted effort and come away satisfied, those like myself who failed to connect with Hudson's character and her thunderous, forceful, over-the-top vocals will be thankful they didn't pay theatre price.If having your body rattled by 2 hours of Jennifer Hudson's merciless shouting is what you like, then this movie is for you. Otherwise save yourself the migraine.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Simply fantastic!,"Two things I have not seen in decades. A nearly full, large house and applause by the film audience for several of the numbers.This is the best of the best when it comes to musicals.

Over-hyped but entertaining.,"Several noted critics (armond white comes to mind) have already torn into this film (probably as backlash for all the hype that's been whirling around it). While it's not a bad movie, and actually a very entertaining film with great production values, Dreamgirls never treads further than some great theatrics and very limited character development.We already know what's going to happen but the film is single minded in it's approach, wasting the opportunity to throw some insight into the tumultuous time period and build a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations.The performances were okay. Eddie Murphy's singing (if that is really him) is not bad but his choreography reminds me of his SNL impressions of Stevie and Prince. Beyonce is strangely akin to Diana Ross (who the character was based on anyway), but really doesn't have much to do aside from take the brunt of Jamie Foxx's overly-slick Berry Gordy-inspired Curtis Taylor.As every one has already said, the magnet of this movie is Jennifer Hudson, who for a first timer applies just the right amount of sass and measure to her role, remaining dignified and powerful even during the movie's soppiest moment (""And I Am Telling You""). Which leads me onto the music itself which is pretty faultless and lends the film the depth and freshness it lacks in direction and storytelling.The things that work best here are the pacing, production design, and music. The film moves very fast, almost too fast to notice its flaws, which in this case, is a good thing. Could have been more, but it will satisfy most viewers, especially lovers of Motown.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Almost Perfect...,"Dreamgirls certainly is an outstanding movie!! Lots of quality here! But it could have been so much better... I gave it a 9/10 because I really enjoyed it a lot, but it wasn't as good as Chicago (which I gave a 10/10 to)On the technical side, there's absolutely no problem: great sound design, wonderful flashy costumes, lovely sets, thrilling editing, and gorgeous cinematography! In general, Dreamgirls is a lot of fun, because it's fast-paced and keeps the rhythm to the end. The direction by Bill Condon is really top notch.Now, my favorite part of the review: the acting. Here's where the film could have been so much better...First, Jamie Foxx. I must say his work as Curtis Taylor Jr. here seems a little uninspired... I know his character is supposed to be shallow, but the performance shouldn't! He's definitely done much better work... obviously in Ray and Collateral (even though I wouldn't have given him the Oscar in 2005... that would have been for Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda...)I don't know what to think of Beyoncé Knowles as DeenaJones. An uneven performance... Sometimes acceptable, sometimes awful, but sometimes quite good, even really good. Weird... Fortunately, most of her character's purpose in the movie is to look beautiful, smile and sing. Miss Knowles' beauty is quite obvious and she's certainly no slouch at singing! So, that does it for me in the end. And kudos for ""Listen"". Not only was the performance of that song outstanding, but I understood she co-wrote the lyrics too. Well done.But we all know that, from the very beginning, all eyes would be on Jennifer Hudson as Effie White. She's the current front-runner for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. And while I can see why she's receiving so much praise, I don't quite agree with it. Don't get me wrong... it's a good performance. Her singing is absolutely marvelous!! Like so many people, tears came to my eyes during ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" (and that's a miracle for me as I never show any external emotion while watching a movie... not that I don't want to, but I just can't cry normally... It's all inside...) but her non-singing part wasn't as convincing as I would have hoped... She's not undeserving, but I'm still a little disappointed...And now, Eddie Murphy!! Oh boy, am I glad to see him like this!! What a pleasure!! Aside from Donkey in the Shrek series, Eddie's done almost nothing good in the last 15 years... and now, here's something he'll be remembered by! That's easily his best performance ever! And I never knew he could sing so well!! The dancing isn't bad either! Watch out for ""Jimmy's Rap""!! That scene is to die for!! He's got soul, that's for sure!! And of course, he remains a great comedian and you can see he really loves what he's doing and wants to share his love, unlike Jamie Foxx. Mr Murphy, thank you!!So, in a nutshell, Dreamgirls definitely is a great movie with its flaws but all in all, you have a lot of fun!! Long live Eddie Murphy and please give him the Oscar!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not the shining star the Play was and By Far,"Dreamgirls, One of the Best Musicals ever comes to the big screen and like many I was looking forward to seeing one of my all time favorites shine. Regrettably this is not the case. I will credit the actors hired for this. They were given a less then great script to work with. That said, I feel that Effie was not nearly powerful enough. I know that it would take a lot to fill the shoes of Jennifer Holiday and in the movie this shows. I cannot help but think the actress was stifled by the very even leveled volume thru the DVD. I have tried listening thru home theater at a decent volume but when Effie was belting ( or lack there of) her soul I didn't notice any difference in volume. This should have blasted at that point. Further the camera angles were very odd. Why the pan in and out at odd times was ever chosen that way I don't know other than they take away from the scene at hand. Also the fluff added to make this longer was so so at best. It could have happened yes, but I feel it strayed away from the original far too much. Also the fact that numbers were moved around didn't help. I tried really hard to watch this and keep in mind that it was not the original and tried to view it in its own light, however I could not find that place. Bottom line is this, Some Broadway shows should never be redone on the big screen and this is one of those. If you were fortunate enough to see the original you will know what I mean. Again the actors they hired are not to blame for this lousy attempt at bringing a cherished play to the big screen,the attempts to tie this to Diana Ross and the Supremes were too blatant ( the unspoken was this was based on the struggle they had making to the top) and rent the DVD. I know that I wont be buying it.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Jennifer's acting and singing show she is my American Idol. The fact that the rest of the cast were also amazing really made this one of the finest feel good films I have ever seen.

Watchable but!,"The movie begins as a parody of early Motown, Jamie Foxx is clearly supposed to be Berry Gordy, Keith Robinson is Smokey Robinson and obviously the Dreamgirls are the Supremes, Eddie Murphy's character is an amalgamation of several male singers, aspects of Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin are all in his character.
The first half of the movie is quite good with some great Motown-like music, but then it switches to dull over long show tunes which does not fit into the story.
The Effie White character played by Jennifer Hudson is clearly following Florence Ballard, who was the better singer in the Supremes but not the kind of voice Berry Gordy needed to appeal to white audiences. Beyonce carries off a passable impression of Diana Ross and there are other Motown acts parodied such as The Jackson 5.
I think with all the talent this movie would have been better as a Motown biopic instead of a parody.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Jennifer vs Beyonce,"I have seen this movie on Christmas day and I thought Jennifer Hudson was outstanding against Beyonce in the acting department as well as some singing, but Ms B was by far at her best with ""Listen"" this is a must see movie. Eddie Murphy was excellent as well as Jamie Foxx who I am not a big fan of but was really good. And this is a movie for all. With the one exception where Ms B use the four letter word, I was shocked hearing that come from her. Because of the Miss innocent act she is but yup she said. This is a must own DVD when it is released. With Oscars around the corner I think Jennifer should get best Actress nod, but like I said Ms B needs to improve on her acting. I also feel that Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx should also get nods. Well the countdown begins with the Golden GLobes and hopefully Jennifer can grab that one and start rolling with the ball.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Tedious Soap Opera Musical! Chicago It Ain't!,"Full Disclosure: I forced myself to see this film at my historic, 63-year-old, locally owned theater because they are facing a bank foreclosure in 11 days. (If you ever lived in the City of Baltimore - The Senator, with probably the single largest movie screen in Maryland, is in danger of closing it's doors forever.) However, I did enter the theater with hope, no matter how slight, that I would leave feeling entertained!Call me old-fashioned, but I like to care about at least one of the characters in a story. Even in a godforsaken, awful movie I will sit through the whole tedious thing, if I can empathize with at least a single character. In Dreamgirls, I literally felt like I was watching an obnoxious soap opera with very shallow two-dimensional characters. Who cares about a bunch of rich & famous show business losers?For example, after hearing one character say: "" I spent half a million dollars (in 1960's dollars) on drinking."" I practically groaned and said to myself, ""as a young adult, you had nothing better to do with your money during the height of the Vietnam War & the Civil Rights movement then spend it on booze? How inspiring!Granted the cinematography and costumes are absolutely magnificent ! But that's icing on the cake. After a while it wears thin, and it certainly does not carry a story to its conclusion.This movie is all flash and no substance. While there is certainly nothing offensive in this overblown production, having a wry sense of humor, like the very clever Chicago, would have done this film wonders. Also having fewer characters, and better editing, would not have hurt either.I found it quite ironic that one of the songs performed in Dreamgirls was along the lines of ""I've got soul,"" something this shallow film sorely lacked!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Like a Dream,"Magical, bittersweet story of the ups and downs of fame, friendship, and love. I was pleasantly surprised by Beyonce's performance as Deena Jones, the humble backup singer who gets thrown into the spotlight. Needless to say, Jennifer Hudson gave a legendary performance as Effie. People were applauding so loudly in the theater after her songs that it felt like I was at a live theatrical event. You know an actress has done a brilliant job when people in a movie theater give her a standing ovation, and that's what happened after Ms. Hudson sang ""I Am Changing"". Other stand-out performances came from Eddie Murphy and Anika Noni-Rose. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Movie with Great Performances!!,"I initially went into this movie with so-so expectations and thought that 5 Golden Globe Nominations was given very generously. However, having now seen the movie, I have to say I can see why it received all 5. The first half of the movie was perfect in almost every conceivable way, from the period-piece costumes to the cinematography, and this coming from a very intense film buff/critic. The second half of the movie changed gears and lost some of its momentum but remained quite good none the less. I believe Beyonce did a very credible job but will not win for best actress. Eddie may very well win for best actor for he was perfectly cast. The show, however, goes to relative newcomer Jennifer Hudson for her intense vocals, especially on ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going."" The audience practically gave the screen a standing ovation. It is hard to tell whether this movie will win any Golden Globes or even be Oscar nominated with movies such as Blood Diamond and The Departed in the running. Hands down this movie is excellently done in so many different ways and I am definitely recommending it to others.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Wigstock,"First, I'm a big fan of musicals. Love them to death. But not everyone of them works on the big screen. And ultra-fast editing sure will not help transferring it from the stage to the screen. When you don't get any time to get to know the characters and learn to care for them, the whole thing will fall flat. The art directors and costume department unfortunately upstaged the directing department in this movie. On the sunny side: drag queens all over the world will have years of material to work on for their new acts. Best thing about the whole thing is Miss Hudson who shows more acting chops by raising an eyebrow than Beyonce's whole acting career so far. And uttering a few swearing words will not turn you into a serious thespian, B ! Effie's 'big' number could have been so much more effective if they just had dared her to let it sing on a bare stage without the editing. Well, on to 'Hairspray'.

Exceptional!!!!,"One of the best movies of 2006. Jennifer Hudson was a powerful additional to the movie that is a credit to the Broadway play. Jennifer Holiday should be proud of the performance by Jennifer Hudson, especially during the singing of ""And I Am Telling You"". I'm sure everyone was waiting to see if Jennifer could pull off the emotion of the song the way Jennifer Holiday was able to do. All actors and actresses in the movie deserve an applause for their performances. The story was moving and told the story of the hardship African American endured in the 60's trying to breakout in the music industry.

People will now have a chance to see what a mistake it was to vote her off the ""Idol."" But, perhaps if she had won, we wouldn't be seeing her in this film right now. It worked out for everyone. Beyonce has her own ""wow"" moments as well, especially ""Listen."" Give yourself a treat and see this film. It's highly entertaining. A wonderful addition to the musical genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Hang in there for the second half,"While a huge fan of the Dreamgirls soundtrack when in high school, I never saw the stage version, so don't know how closely the movie follows the staged version.So, speaking strictly about the film, I found the first half or so to be bewildering fast and shallow, with no character development or even a pause for breath. The songs were pale imitations of real soul, Motown, R&B -- even the blues piece was weak! Since there was virtually no dialogue, there was no sense of identification with the characters. It was very difficult to know what each character was actually thinking or feeling. This was especially frustrating when the picture made reference to social issues of the time yet didn't even follow through with the characters' reactions to them.The second half of the film was much more compelling, largely due to better placement of song material, additional dialogue, far greater dramatic range and tension, and more clear character development. If this is a good adaption of stage show, I think it's a mediocre Broadway show and probably fares better on-screen where emotion can be conveyed more subtly through close-ups and long edits.Jennifer Hudson was the most consistently real character throughout the film, and burst through the role. Everyone else's performance paled in comparison. Eddie Murphy played his part easily, skimming the surface, until the very end when we suddenly saw the depth of his acting ability -- made me wonder why he wastes his time on inane comedies when he's capable of such depth!The pyrotechnics of the sets and the lavish attention to detail on period costumes and make- up helped cover the mediocre quality of many of the musical pieces. The ending was too neat, too sewn up for my tastes, but at least it was over quickly!The picture is definitely worth seeing for glimpses of the Motown story and the compromises and flat-out rip-offs that were part and parcel of the African-American music scene until recently. The trip through time visually is entertaining, even though the music and lyrics come nowhere near the accuracy of the eye candy. Fast forward through the music numbers at the beginning and then just hold out for Jennifer Hudson and the character development in the latter half of the film. It's worth seeing at least once.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
wow,"I must honestly say that I went into this film convinced that I was not going to like it. I felt that it was overly-hyped since day one, and I was looking forward to saying i told you so. Instead, I'm eating humble pie because this was not just a great film, but an experience. The film was well acted, but in the end, it was the Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy show. Hudson was AMAZING. In her highlight song, 'I'm Gonna Tell You' the crowd applauded 3 times. At the end of the number you could just feel the crowd holding back in expectation of one more uproarious applause. The crowd also ate up Eddie Murphy, just at it up. And yes, Beyonce has one beautiful number too, with the original song written for the film 'Listen.' She got a nice applause for that too. OK, here's the thing, the crowd I saw it with was a 12:30 pm matinée in suburban Atlanta that was actually sold out. Generally, this is a pretty passive crowd but they really loved this film. The crowd applauded 8 times during the show. During the end credits, about 8 or 9 members of the cast were billed, and then finally, the show stealer, Jennifer Hudson, and the crowd went crazy one last time. Again, this was very unusual behavior for a suburban matinée crowd, and I think that says something. I think Jennifer Hudson is going to need to start getting her acceptance speech ready for this one, and maybe Eddie Murphy too. It's not the best picture of the year, but it is the most entertaining big budget blockbuster show!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Ms. Hudson stole the whole show, with her exquisite singing and acting abilities; Mr Murphy surprised me with his acting and singing talents also; Ms Beyonce was very good also; especially with her song ""Listen""--I loved it. The other actor who played CC White (Effie's brother) also was good--Mr Foxx's acting/singing was the only sore spot--it was just mediocre.

My Anticipated Dreamgirls Review,"OF COURSE I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE IT!!!!!! This movie lived up to it's hype. I don't think a film since Chicago has lived up to its pre-Oscar hype.This film was electrifying and exhilarating. The costumes, the music, the voices- it all worked so well. The film could have felt like one giant music video, but for some reason it flowed like a musical should. The underline message of black oppression in Rock & roll also became this unsaid ""star."" It really showcased the ignored impression we as Black Americans had on music today.Jamie Foxx- I must say surprised me. I thought he would just phone this performance in, but on the contrary. He was manipulative, and fearless. He was what this crook of a character needed to be. I must say I REALLY enjoyed his performance.Beyonce Knowles- Like many people said, she pulled it off. I will say her beauty is magical. She embodied Diana Ross very much so in her performance, but actually made it her own. I mean the entire musical is a take off Motown and what not, so I don't disagree with what she did. Beautiful singing. As for her acting-OK. I did love her looks and stares more than when she opened her mouth (unless she was singing). She brought incredible beauty to this role, and for that I loved her! She was a gem in my mind. Her character was not really developed enough in a way for us to see a range, but I though she soaked up every time she really could. I almost could call her an actress, but not as of yet. A worthy performance from a young starlet.Eddie Murphy- one of those great performances that you rarely see from anyone in the industry. It was comical, yet really heart retching. If you watch his eyes he tells James Thunder's story all on it's own. In my opinion, everyone should come and see this film for Eddie Murphy's performance. He brought energy EVERY SINGLE TIME he was on camera. His musical performances were so entertaining. He was awesome. The only person who should win an Oscar from this film is him.Jennifer Hudson-Her voice is INCREDIBLY. I have to admit after ""And I am Telling You"" I freaking cheered. I almost got teary eyed. Her performance of that song is one of the greatest musical performances in all of movie musical history. And every time this woman opened her mouth to sing I was astonished. Her acting however bothered me. Regardless of this being her first time and minimal acting before this, I still felt as if a better actress could have REALLY took advantage of every single word Effie said. Not that Jennifer didn't do it in her own little way, to me it just wasn't enough. She's not really an ""actress"", but for this film her acting can take a backseat to her musical ability, which is why the character is so an audience's favorite. She could have pulled a tad bit more out of her for Effie when it came to the speaking parts, but her musical performances stole the film for me. Oscar worthy? Sure. She's going to win anyway so why not? Anika Noni Rose-FANTASTIC!!! You can tell this woman is a season pro. But what I loved about what this woman did was that fact you saw this woman change from a little girl, to a woman. She fist began as a giggly girl going with the flow of everything, to end up a woman and realizing the man she loves is killing himself. Her performance is going unlooked, and it's not fair because she steals the film in her scenes, and rightly so. And her voice is quite amazing. She was the best- acted female in that film. A job will done Anika. I really appreciated her performance.I will say though, the end of the film was a tad bit expected, and too much happening so fast that end seems rush and quite anti-climatic. I honestly wanted Beyonce's character to turn into the Diana Ross bitch that she should have always been. I doubt Denna wouldn't have ANY type of power. And Effie- sorry to say- I didn't want her to get what she deserved. In life that rarely happens to good people. I think the film would have been more effective if she would have been cheated still, but Jamie and Beyonce's character would still live in some great guilt. And then at the end there could have been this really great ballad of suffering or something. I don't like Hallmark endings, and that's what it was. I LOVED the way Eddie's character went out. He went out in a depressing way, but you still felt for him.Other than that I couldn't keep my eyes off this movie. It kept my attention for every single second.I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bland,"This movie is far from good, its just so bland I could do a musical on how to sit on my butt and say bungalow while farting. I mean the acting is very bad, the dialog is atrocious and the songs aren't in anyway memorable. When they played the remake of Jennifer Holiday's ""Your Gonna Love Me"" performed by Jennifer Hudson (Who I loved in secret lives of bees)on the radio, I got tired of it after two plays, heck I don't like the original song either. Anyway I sat through it and just got bored so quickly I just ran around the house and rolled on my belly to pass the rest of the time because this musical was an ""A"" flat literally just plain flat. The ending was a bomb in the tush and the singing and characters gave me a headache. All in all just terribly bland. Note ""If anyone wants a decent musical, watch the movie this was inspired from named Sparkle, because it's way better than this.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Lipsinking,"Am I the only one who was turned off by the horrible lip-sinking to the songs? I'm sure it is done most of the time, but I don't notice it. It gave a feeling of disconnect when songs were being performed. Jennifer Hudson did an exceptional job acting, but not an Oscar performance, Kudos -- yes, an Oscar --no. The songs weren't any good either and the time span was from a decade of excellent R&B sounds. The only song that was exceptional was Whitney Houston's song, ""I have changed.""I would not recommend the movie at all and I looked forward to seeing it and was really pulling for Jennifer to win the Oscar.

Brilliant adaptation of a Broadway legend,"From the cow bell at the start until the jingling bells at the end, this gorgeous and entertaining masterpiece of a movie fulfills on every level and delivers a brilliant adaptation of the original Broadway show.

Dreamgirls in A Dream of A Film ****,"From the beginning ensemble, you know you're in for a tremendous treat in this whirlwind ensemble loosely based on Diana Ross and the Supremes.The film deals with the rise of the girl singing group with the problems that success shall inevitably create. It is done along the backdrop of the history of the civil rights struggle of the 1960s along with the Detroit riots.Besides the singing, the acting is absolutely first-rate. Jamie Foxx has never been better since ""Ray."" As the guy who discovers the girls, he shows a ruthlessness inside a calm demeanor. Eddie Murphy, as a drug-addicted singer, whose career declines as the habit worsens, is excellent in a supporting role. Special kudos go to Beyonce Knowles and Jennifer Hudson. Hudson's one scene-singing will positively knock you off your feet.The musical arrangements are magnificent along with the set designs.This is absolutely a terrific musical far better than the Oscar-winning ""Chicago"" of several years back.Miss Hudson, who portrays the hefty singer Effie, gives it everything in a heart-wrenching performance. Man, can she belt it out as she becomes a shoo-in for best supporting actress come Oscar time.The group begins to break up when they reach the pinnacle of success.A towering, superlative film which is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An excellent movie - a musical with a good story.,"I hate musicals but loved Dreamgirls. It had a great story, great songs and constant conflict between the main characters to keep the plot moving. The history of the 1950's (whites displacing blacks on the Billboard charts with watered-down versions of the same song) and 1960's (MLK and the Detroit riots) added an important part to the story. Jennifer Hudson had two show-stopping solos that drew heavy applause from the audience. Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx were excellent. Though I know the show and movie are ""loosely based"" on the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes and I am very familiar with that history, I still never knew what would happen next or how the movie would play out. There were a couple of slow spots but I don't know of anything specific I would have cut out. Beyonce was Beyonce but Jennifer Hudson really stole the show, though she received less billing than Beyonce in the credits at the end of the movie. December has been a very disappointing month for movies when Hollywood usually showcases its Oscar-worthy pictures but Dreamgirls really stands out. Look for many Oscar nominations from Dreamgirls, though there should be lots of competition for similar categories, perhaps leading to the plot of Dreamgirls II.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Have you ever been in a movie audience where people applauded a song? Jennifer Hudson and the entire cast were spectacular and Oscar worthy! WOW.,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.A perfect 10! Academy Awards galore. Not since Chicago has there been such a spectacular musical. Jennifer Hudson is simply spectacular and she deserves the Academy Award. She will never be able to top this performance and she has a brilliant musical career ahead. The entire cast are all worthy of nominations. Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Eddie Murphy. Wow wow wow. Every hear an audience applaud a song in a movie theater? I never ever experienced that ever! I saw original Dreamgirls on Broadway and it had the same reaction to Jennifer Hudson as it did for Jennifer Holliday in 1982. Wow.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Thank you, ""American Idol""","Here we have a movie starring the brilliance of Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover and along comes this 25 year old 3rd season ""American Idol"" runner-up, Jennifer Hudson, who absolutely DOMINATES them, as well as the entire film and will end up receiving the Oscar for 2006 Best Supporting Actress. Hard to believe but oh so true and my hat's off to Randy Jackson,Paula Abdul, Simon Cowell and to all those whom, for week after week, voted to keep Ms. Hudson in the spotlight.""Dream Girls"" is no ordinary very good film; it is the best film of '06 and Oscar time will prove me right. Did you like the phenomenal ""Chicago"" and ""Evita?"" This is every bit as good if not better. Similar in that all three are, more or less, operas insofar as telling stories in music but Jennifer Hudson OUTDOES the acting skills of Rene Zellweger, Catherine Zeta Jones and Madonna.However Jennifer is bound to meet with a bit of trouble because of her performance. She will NEVER exceed it and so if her movie career STOPS at this point, it will mean the end of one venue but the recording field is now open to her bigger than ever, will remain that way and Ms.Hudson will become an enormous name in that field.The film is no less than phenomenal and a separate truck will be needed at the Academy Awards to haul off all that golden booty from the stage.

"Well Directed, Well Acted and just a wonderful movie","I just love this movie. I can't wait for it to become available on DVD. I have seen this movie five times since Xmas.

I was actually outraged when she was voted off the show singing the very same song that is remarkable and breathtaking in the movie. In my opinion, Jennifer was the lead actress and Beyonce' should have been best supporting actress. Now don't get me wrong she does her thing also and Listen is one of my all time favorites, but the movie seemed to revolve around Effie. This is a must see show for all those who have not seen it yet please do.

GREAT Movie.........,"Tonight i just came back from watching DREAMGIRLS..........What a great movie! All the right characters, not to tell so much about the movie. Beyonce and Jennifer played wonderful roles, it's almost expected to get such quality performance from both actress. I can't forget about Nokia (i think that's her name) she was wonderful as well.........And her voice is amazing. Jamie and Eddie played their roles. Jamie a more straight forward man and about business, but also he was cut throat just like these record producers are. Eddie he played a role that i haven't seen in years, and it's great to have him back, even it's for one film. I would also like to comment that the feud that people would like to have between Beyonce and Jennifer, they need to put to rest the both had totally different parts. I must admit Jennifer gave Jennifer Holiday with ""I'm telling U"".........a run for her money. Worth Watching and paying 8.00 for HELL YESS all i have to say is DREAM.....",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dream on and on and on.,"This is a colossal musical in every sense of the cinemascope word. Basically the story of Diana Ross the Supremes and the rise of Motown, and a megaton musical hit for those who did not know about the Broadway show DREAMGIRLS delivers over and over again. It actually made me curious to again see the mid 70s musicals MAHOGANY and BINGO LONG and perhaps even LADY SINGS THE BLUES. Jennifer Hudson's 15 minute Streisand level showstopper belting crying and pleading her way through ""I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"" is the FUNNY GIRL/Don't rain on my parade piece most musical fans have been searching for since 1968. Well she delivers and the film shifts gear and upward into legend status because of it. Perhaps a little too exhausting in the delivery of every song (each is belted and troweled onto your face) it more than balances in the superb art direction, costumes and acting. DREAMGIRLS is glorious and massive, a satisfying musical achievement. I look forward to an encore and encourage you to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly outstanding,"I just got back from a screening of this movie, and it might make my top 10 of all time. Going into it, I didn't expect a musical, but it was, but it was more than that. I saw that Beyonce Knowles can do more than just sing. She can act! I know, holy crap, but she was surprisingly good. Surrounded by a cast of other greats, such as Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy, not to mention that one girl from American Idol, who didn't win, but after seeing her performance, she should've. After one of her songs, the whole theater was clapping and whistling. The movie makes you laugh, makes you tear up, makes you smile, and it makes you wanna sing in your car at the top of your lungs.....Which I did....Every single actor in this movie acted their heart out, and you can really feel it. I can see Jamie Foxx as a mean, bossy, controlling dude now. I couldn't before. Eddie Murphy took his comedic roles aside and had a hell of a performance. While I give it all this praise, I did have a few tiffs with it. The beginning comes out a little too fast, and while everyone in this movie sings great, I felt some singing parts were a little dragged out. But those are small flaws in an overall great movie. So go see it. You'll be glad you did, and will come out of the theater smiling.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Even with flaws, this is one good movie!!","As I watched this movie, I counted the flaws. But despite the flaws, this was one good movie! This was one movie that I wanted to be longer so that each character could have more screen time.....so that each character could be fully explored.....so that the scenes could flow more cohesively. There are many criticisms about the music. This was a Broadway musical people!! The music is dated and it is for the genre of Broadway, not MOTOWN. Dreamgirls would not have worked with all new Motown music any more than Chicago would have worked with all original bluesy jazz. And yes, Broadway is all about over-the-top songs, dancing, costumes and acting....therefore so is some of the singing in Dreamgirls! That being said, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose, Danny Glover....you guys rocked! Beyonce did very well, but still don't understand the Best Actress nomination. Jamie Foxx, worked with what he had, did good. Biggest pet peeve? The editing and the ending. If this movie had no flaws, they would rename the 'Golden globe', the 'Dreamgirl.' But no film is perfect, so......5 nominations is not bad.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid movie experience,"I had seen Dreamgirls on Broadway many years ago so I looked forward to seeing the movie when it came out.I wasn't disappointed in the least. The movie allowed character development to occur with greater depth and the performances were really superb.Yes, Jennifer Hudson as Effie and Eddie Murphy as Jimmy are the scene- stealers. But all of the performances are very strong - not a weak character among them.One thing that has annoyed me when reading critics' or moviegoer reviews. Beyonce' is described as being unimpressive or having a ""flat"" performance. This is exactly as it should be. She's showing great acting ability by not coming across as the star she truly is. Rather, she is playing to character - a doormat for her manager's vision who gradually comes into her own. I thought she was pretty terrific.Overall, a really good movie that I look forward to seeing again when it comes out on DVD.The music is fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow.  Amazing.,"I will admit to being totally enamored with the original Broadway production of ""Dreamgirls"". I have been anticipating this movie for a long while, and with all the hype around it lately, expected to be disappointed. I am not a Beyonce fan. I am not a Jaime Foxx fan. I did not vote for Jennifer Hudson on American Idol.I saw it today. I cried three times. The hype around this movie is so well deserved.Jennifer Hudson, however, blows everyone away on the big screen. When she is sharing the scene with others, they all seem flat compared to her. From her first words, she IS the movie. If she doesn't take home an Oscar, there is something wrong with the voting process.Eddie Murphy was born to play James ""Thunder"" Early. He brought his own brand of comedy to an otherwise tragic character.Beyonce impressed me...but didn't blow me away until she sang ""Listen"" a new song written for the movie, which is sure to be Oscar nominated.I was a bit disappointed in the direction by Bill Condon. It was a bit busy at times, but the script he wrote stayed very true to the original story and flowed beautifully....but how anyone can deny this is about (or at least based on) Diana Ross and The Supremes is beyond me. The movie is pretty blatant in its comparison of The Dreams to The Supremes. There is obvious homage being paid to ""Mahogany"" and other Diana Ross vehicles in the sets and costumes. Why.... there's even a ""Jackson Five"" group! Bottom line....don't miss this movie. Hudson is a star in the making. Applause from the audience erupted twice for her!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Another 'Star Is Born'...,"In the history of outstanding movie musicals, any singer/actress worth her talent has had ""that moment."" I certainly don't need to tell you what it is; you know the moment well, because each and every actress who has seized it and made something out of it has been nominated for an Academy Award for just about bringing the house down.Liza Minelli singing ""Maybe This Time"" from CABARET.Barbara Streisand singing ""Watch Closely Now"" in A STAR IS BORN.Bette Midler pouring out her heart and soul with ""Stay With Me"" from THE ROSE.In the chronicles of great performances, each woman has left an indelible mark.And now, Jennifer Hudson joins them.At the very least, this amazing performer is owed a nomination for what she does with the coveted role of Effie White in DREAMGIRLS. And right behind her is another dynamic portrayal that will shock and surprise a lot of people: Eddie Murphy as James ""Thunder"" Early. Nowhere in the catalog of his past performances is there any indication that he was capable of something with this much depth and complexity. Whenever Jennifer and Eddie aren't on-screen, you can definitely feel the difference.And that's not to say that everyone else doesn't do a bang-up job in their roles. It's just that both standouts are so amazing that they leave their co-stars in a cloud of stardust. Jamie Foxx is good, but nowhere near as dastardly as he should've been as Curtis Taylor Jr., the ""villain"" of the piece. Danny Glover is fine as Marty, and Keith Robinson shines as C.C., Effie's songwriting brother, especially in one of the show's most poignant numbers, ""Family."" Anika Noni Rose and Sharon Leal don't disappoint as Lorell and Michele, the third member of the group and the singer who eventually replaces Effie respectively.And then, there's Beyonce. DREAMGIRLS was supposed to be her vehicle, and in the role that closely follows the career of a certain Ms. Ross, you couldn't want for a better actress. Though she's been pretty much content to play slightly altered versions of her own star persona in previous roles, she understood what it takes to play Deena and she is radiant in what has to be the best performance she has ever given on film, particularly with ""Listen"", a number written specifically for the movie.Technically, in every department, everybody gets it right. Production and costume design, musical arranging, photography...this is a movie that will be scooping up some major awards and nominations.And as admirably as every single cast member performed in this remarkable film, it still has to be said...sooner or later, they will all have their time to shine.But right now...this is Eddie's time to come back strong.And Jennifer's moment to take her rightful place in the pantheon of the stars who came before her.The former contestant of ""American Idol"" now truly IS one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Dreamgirls - An Instant Classic,"Sometimes, the simplest of compliments conveys the greatest sincerity.Dreamgirls is a beautiful, beautiful movie.The movie adaptation of the hit Broadway musical is ""easy"" all the way around. Easy on the eyes, the ears and any other sense within cinematic reach. Dreamgirls is a comfortable confluence of style, talent and pageantry. It is like our favorite song we all have. Every time we listen to it, the music hits us in the right place all day long. Dreamgirls is beautiful in its artistry, its emotion and most importantly in its truthfulness.The question most often asked is whether ""the movie"" measures up to ""the musical."" It's a question that is well-intentioned but rather unimportant and misguided.For all the visual advantages that a motion picture has over theatre productions, it's a pointless comparison. Likewise, for all the energy and spontaneity a live performance offers that an edited tape and 2-dimensional screen do notit too is a pointless comparison. What can be said is that Dreamgirls the movie can't touch the Broadway musical. Conversely, Dreamgirls the Broadway musicalcan't touch the movie. These apples and oranges don't need to be examined any further.But those of you old enough to remember the original musical, you'll probably appreciate the cameo appearances of Hinton Battle and Loretta Devinean understated tip of fedora to its predecessor. And yes, it was both conspicuous and somewhat controversial how Jennifer Holiday, the signature voice of the 80s Broadway show was nowhere to be found in the film version. It also must also be said that Jennifer Hudson's 2006 performance was nothing short of amazing in its own right.It's not often than an audience of film critics breaks out in thunderous applause in the middle of a movie, and it's even rarer when such lofty acclaim is deserved.Jennifer Hudson deserved it and is an absolute star from her first frame until the final credits. Jennifer Holiday did something special and spectacular in 1982which will never be undone or duplicated. Jennifer Hudson not only paid her own musical homage to Holiday, but tastefully put her own hot sauce on it, which should leave any true fan of the Dreamgirls story, pleased and satisfied. Again, let's leave the apples and oranges comparisons for another day. They're both very, very good fruit and that's all that needs to be said.Hudson gave an unprecedented and outstanding performance that will likely resonate for decadesjust like Holiday. There's your comparison, now leave it alone.But even having said all of thatarguably the greatest performance came from the unlikeliest of places.Eddie Murphy.Murphy's performance was Oscar-caliber and career defining. Although he's spent the better part of his life making folks laugh, when all is said and done, he just might be best remembered for displaying a level of vulnerability and screen presence that is beyond many of the best in Hollywood.This isn't hyperbole. Eddie Murphy is THAT good in the role of James 'Thunder' Early. He sings all of his songs, dances all of his dances and most importantly earns all of your attention and theatrical respect. It's a performance as a supporting actor that deserves Oscar consideration. One can't help but wonder whether Eddie Murphy saw any parallels between the life and career of James 'Thunder' Early and his own. The character arc of an entertainer staring irrelevancy in the face and a disheveled home life makes you wonder if the role struck very close to home for him.Only he knowsJust FYIthe last time Mo'Kelly felt this strongly about an Oscar-caliber performance, Jamie Foxx went home with an Oscar.Just FYI.And speaking of Foxxmaybe the Black-Oscar jinx is now over. For those who say it is career suicide for Black actors after garnering one of the golden statuettes, meet Mr. Foxxthe 'villain' 'Curtis Taylor Jr.'It's almost unfortunate, as Foxx's muted performance (doesn't do much singing) might easily get lost amidst the eye-popping gowns, over-blown songs and characters justifiably more important to the story. Then again, when you still get noticed while everything else is set up for you NOT to be noticedyou must have been pretty good.Jamie Foxx was more than just 'pretty good.'If you could sum up the whole of Dreamgirls, it's in the performance of Beyoncé Knowles. This is a movie heavy on history, expectation and hype in anticipation of its release. At the same time, Beyoncé has been groomed accordingly to stand in the spotlight literally and figuratively in this role. To those who saw the original Dreamgirls, the comparisons and allusions to Diana Ross and the Supremes were obvious. Accordingly, such comparisons can be made to Destiny's Child and its similar history. The casting of Beyoncé in the role of 'Deena Jones' is eerie on many levels if you want to read into all of the subtext of Knowles' own career.That said; she brought her 'A' game. For those of you who may have believed she wasn't on a vocal par consistent with such a roleyou will be disappointed. She demonstrated she is as talented as advertised this fact can't be denied. For those of you who may have ventured to criticize her as being unskilled as an actor and not worthy of such a roleyou will be disappointed and proved wrong. Mo'Kelly was not a Beyoncé fan going in and of the opinion that she was an elaborate prop, positioned for stardombut not destined for greatness. Note the distinction.But fair is fairMo'Kelly was flat out wrong. Beyoncé put in a performance that I suspect even Lena Horne and the late Dorothy Dandridge would give her high-fives in appreciation.Dreamgirls is a beautiful, beautiful movieand by the way, an instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Extraordinary Movie Musical,"I saw this movie two days ago at an advance screening. The costumes were gorgeous, the set design was too, the acting was wonderful, and the singing spectacular. I have not seen the original musical, but I still think it was great.Dreamgirls tells the story ('loosely based on Diana Ross and the Supremes') of three girls- Deena (Beyonce), Effie (Jennifer Hudson) and Lorell (Anika Noni Rose). They are aspiring singers (the Dreams) who enter a talent contest but sadly lose. A 'wheeler-dealer manager' named Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) sees the Dreams and signs then up to be back-up for James ""Thunder"" Early (Eddie Murphy).The movie shows the ways of the music industry and what they will do to make it big.Jennifer Hudson is FANTASTIC as Effie White.

But....that would be the only critical comment I would make on this film.It was a very good film. The movie flowed and I never felt as if it ""dragged"" at all. In fact, once it was over, I found myself sitting there wishing there was more to come.I thought the acting was well done and not too much or too little.

In fact there were several outstanding ones. I've got to acknowledge Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce, Jamie Foxx in a very unsympathetic role that he somehow made more of then was probably written.

"This is a very well done movie with a great storyline, cast and soundtrack","Dreamgirls (2006) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an upcoming female group during the beginning stages of Motown music. They find a manager and he attaches them on an aging singer's tour to gain notoriety initially as background singers and occasionally they perform on their own. They quickly standout and success, fame and fortune quickly pulls the singers and manager in multiple directions causing cracks in what made them so talented. Can the group reach their full potential under the circumstances?This movie is directed by Bill Condon (Kinsey) and stars Jaime Fox (Ray), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Beyonce (Austin Powers: Gold Member), Eddie Murphy (Harlem Nights), Jennifer Hudson (Respect), Keith D. Robinson (Blade: Trinity), Loretta Devine (Urban Legend) and John Lithgow (3rd Rock).The storyline for this is a healthy mix of various real life stories from the Motown era. The acting is out of this world by everyone involved, especially Fox, Murphy and Hudson. The soundtrack was out of this world and how the songs tied into the plot was perfect. The character evolutions were well portrayed and the conclusion was perfect. How so much of the storyline comes full circle is fantastic.Overall this is a very well done movie with a great storyline, cast and soundtrack. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Greed and Bad Judgment Bred by Success,"Dreamgirls is not something I would've imagined myself wanting to see at the beginning of 2006, but now that we're at the end of it, I'm so glad I didn't pass it up. It is so full of passion, energy, heart and soul that you feel like every single one of the singers, dancers, and actors has leaped from the screen, shaken you back and forth, slapped you repeatedly across the face, spun you around in circles, and shoved back into your seat by the time the credits have begun to roll. Even if you are not a fan of musicals, you will enjoy this film tremendously if you give it a chance. I promise you. I almost want to give you my name and phone number so that you can call me and tell me I was right, because I will be. I've never been very interested in musicals and glamorous stage productions like that. I've never seen Seven Brides For Seven Brothers or Showboat and may not. All I know is that Dreamgirls is a great movie with success in the writing, the cast, the direction, and the earth-shaking, heart- pumping, explosive music.I think one way to rejuvenate a freshly dead person is for the EMT to play the soundtrack to this film and this corpse will be dancing and jumping and thrusting and spinning around and stomping. In a way, Dreamgirls is a very important film, especially in a time underscored by awful, truly monotonous rap music played by thugs and womanizers who use nothing but drum machines and their brutish and inarticulate speaking voices. This film really demonstrates the mind-blowing volume of the contribution black culture has given to music. It depicts a time and a place in American history when we were just beginning to hear these sounds and were not able to help but be moved by the heart, soul, blood, sweat, tears, and flesh poured outrageously into a single performance. It also depicts the dawn of the debilitating effect industry and profit has that dominates and creates great obstacles for that passion. Everyone from the title performers to Eddie Murphy's Jimmy ""Thunder"" Early is riveting. Jennifer Hudson is without argument skyscrapers above what is typically expected of a performer from American Idol. She delivers one of the most shockingly amazing performances as an actress and as a singer that I think I've ever seen. I may not have ever seen anything like it. It's also very refreshing to see Eddie Murphy in a good movie again. This just may be the best film he's ever made, and someone with his talent and presence doesn't deserve a career of bad sequels and awful Z-list comedies, like he's made for himself, and has finally climbed into a role that shows us the fine actor he is, holding down his side of the screen just fine with the subtle tempest that is Jamie Foxx and an old pro in the character actor game like Danny Glover.Bill Condon, the film's director and adapting screenwriter, draws heavily to my surprise from Scorsese, his style being increasingly very clear and gradually more and more blatantly barefaced in the jump-cutting, bull-charging camera movements, and subtle juxtapositions emotionally affected by music. Condon's intense projection of the story is brilliant in its outcome the very same way Scorsese's is, creating a long movie with a ram's pace. Dreamgirls will leave you feeling like a million bucks. It is among the ultimate feel-good films and is one remarkable argument for musicals.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Utterly Delightful!,"The best way for me to explain this film is to draw an almost inevitable comparison to ""Chicago""; both are big-screen adaptation of acclaimed Broadway musicals, both feature the luminous and dark dichotomy of show business, and both were written for screen by Bill Condon (who also directed ""Dreamgirls""). While the strength of ""Chicago"" was its wit and clever songs, ""Dreamgirls"" hits you squarely in the chest with its unrelenting power and energy that is quite hard to match.What I also found to be different was that while some musicals use music merely as a mode of communication with the audience (no doubt, some do this quite well), the music is actually the main character of ""Dreamgirls."" All of the characters are bound by their love of music, as each seek innovation, profit, and liberation of their soul through it. I think those who love music in the same way would not only find it entertaining, but also be held captivated by its power and the emotion that jumps out from each note.Among the generally great acting performances all around, Jennifer Hudson gives a performance that is truly heart-pounding as well as heartbreaking. There is a stretch of about 12 minutes of music in the middle of the movie that has not only left me but the entire theater audience breathless, and we could not help but offer an earnest round of clapping at the end of the scene. And while I don't believe that an actor should win an acting award just for great singing, I think Hudson gave a performance in both singing and acting that I can't imagine she will ever be able to match through the rest of her career.""Dreamgirls"" is a delightful and wonderfully entertaining movie that restores faith in kindness, dignity and the power of music. I heartily give it a 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
There's a first .........,"Have you ever seen a movie where everyone else disappears and you end up focusing on just one character for the whole movie? Welcome to Dreamgirls! After watching the first musical number that Jennifer Hudson sings as Effie White I was mesmerized for the rest of the movie. I forgot about those other Actors/Musicians who flitted in and out of scenes and just waited until Ms Hudson was back. I have watched it another 3 times just so I could see what Beyonce/Eddie and Jamie were up to but keep getting captivated by Jennifer Hudsons musical/acting performance. All I can say is if nothing see this movie for the songs/music and yes once again the penultimate ""I'm telling you I'm not going"" knocks your socks off! Go see it on the big screen DVD will not do this movie justice.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls is a MUST SEE,"This movie is a must see for all! Hudson of American Idol fame, was off the hook! I saw the original Dreamgirls with Jennifer Holiday and Hudson is a great understudy, she was just as good and moving as Holiday was in the Broadway production. For the first film for Beyonce, I think she also did a phenomenal job. This movie took me back to the days of talent competitions and live shows of the 60's. It too was full of good music, talented singers and oh the gowns! If you want to see a good movie, check out Dreamgirls. It should truly win awards this year and keep your eyes on Hudson! The songs were moving and powerful full of excitement and tears. I thought Danny Glover, one of my favorite actors, played a stellar part. It showed the cut throat actions of the music business.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreams do live forever!!,"I am a mostly wait for it to be on DVD kind of woman. For Dreamgirls I dug into the old pocketbook and saw it during the special release and paid the $25 (oh it hurt my little heart). It was worth every penny and then some. I can't wait to go back and see it again this week. I know that Dreamgirls will have thousands of repeat customers.Having seen the Broadway musical of Dreamgirls, I still remember the energy I felt when I left the Theater. Leaving the Ziegfeld the other night I felt 20 years old again, and had the same pep in my step that I had so many years ago. Dreamgirls is not only a movie, it is a EVENT. I have never been in a movie audience where people applauded during the movie and gave standing ovations for the actors on the screen, it was like being at a Broadway show.In parting I just have to say, do yourself a favor and see DREAMGIRLS.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Film, Mediocre Beyonce!","Beyonce sure is lucky to have been given the chance to be in this film. Great cinematography and wonderful direction. The shinning stars were truly Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson who were just the show stoppers.Beyonce and Jamie Foxx were riding high on their coat tails. The flow of the movie from scene to scene is very similar to that of Chicago and a similar formula is used to tell the story. Some of the songs like ""Step into the Bad Side"" are songs that you can't help but get into, especially if you have a musical theater background yourself.It's terribly ironic that Beyonce's song ""Listen"" is the one that is being pushed on the radio when the HUGE song in the movie is Jennifer Hudson's ""And I am telling you I'm not going"". I guess the only way to justify Hudson not getting top billing in both the titles and the song is to say that she is the movie's best kept secret once you walk into the theaters.I can let the golden globes slide, but if Beyonce gets a best actress nod instead of Hudson, all will be lost in the film industry. Enjoy the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A good semi autobiography,"Ah... the dreamgirls strike again... in film form. Beyonce at her really worst (shoulda got a Razzie), a great debut for Jen Hudson (deserved the Oscar), Jamie Foxx in another semi-autobiography and Eddie Murphy playing the comedian. It's sort of spoof of Supremes only it doesn't have very many funny parts. It's kind of sad but not tear-worthy. I liked the broke Jackson 5. My mom said when we were watching it, that the hair was a wig on the broke Michael Jackson. But there were some tragedies and silly parts. I liked the girl named Magic in the film.

It's not always what it seems!,"Combining pleasure and business is never a smart decision because your judgement becomes swayed. There are predators in the music industry looking to take advantage of and manipulate gullible, prey. After being seduced by Curtis' charm and assurances, Effie agreed to have him manage their group. However, as soon as she noticed that he was starting to focus more on Deena than on her, she became envious and began to act out. Rather than uniting with her sisters to demonstrate their unwavering allegiance, she chose to disparage and denigrate them, which perfectly served Curtis's purpose. It was heartbreaking watching Effie being exiled from the group because she had so much faith in her relationship that she didn't think he would betray her. Sometimes it takes for you to lose everything in order for you to appreciate.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Instant Classic!!!!!!,"Oh my gosh! I just saw this movie today and was amazed. The cast was great and so were the songs. You could tell that they worked hard on it. Beyonce channeled Diana Ross and Jennifer Hudson was amazing as Effie. She stole the show and should win that golden globe. While Jamie Foxx was a good mixture of Berry Gordy and Ike Turner, and Eddie Murphy was great as a James Brown/Little Richard/Jackie Wilson type of character. The directing was very beautiful and the costumes were. It was an excellent story and it was nice to see Hinton Battle and Loretta Devine in the movie.

A good movie,"Condon's movie based on a book about a car salesman (Foxx) who breaks into the music business by signing a trio of 18 year olds who call themselves the Dreamettes. With the help of a washed up singer (Murphy) he jumpstarts their career, but then shafts the lead singer Effie White for better looking softer-voiced Deena (Beyonce) in a move that he thinks is the logical thing to do. The film can be at times a bit idealistic, yet it has a good message, great music and very suitable screenplay and cinematography. Its a good film, that one can watch with the family or with a more mature crowd. I enjoyed this one even though initially didn't buy the hype about the movie, but when i got around to watching it, i can see why it made the noise it did. IMDb Rating: 6.6.

Dreamgirls- Nostalgic As It Was,"Finally saw it, the re-visit to the musical Camelot of which this writer enjoyed two years being a part. From the Martha Reeves character hired out of a crowd of hangers on as a typist outside the recording studio/office doors, to the group recording with musicians, it all rang vaguely familiar.Other reviewers adequately covered acting of the various principals, direction, and cinematography.The Effie, strong-voiced character fallen to Medicaid type welfare seemed mildly reminiscent of Florence Ballard, purportedly the stronger singer of the Primette (later the Supremes). But this is fiction, right?To this writer, kudos to the set directors, and prop masters. Seeing the eggshell and crates on the recording studio walls, well as seeing beloved 45s RPM, with colored sleeves, brought fond recollections. For before the age of the sterile CD, mini-disks, or tapesmanufacturers made records from or cut into shellac. Several Dreamgirls recording sequences were only a few years removed from that period.Eddie Murphy's character-- some critics say appears loosely based on JB (James Brown) or Jackie Wilson. Yet those in the know (whether at Motown, or Stax, or Cameo Parkway, or Atlantic) would probably find Murphy's self destructive personage (sans the drugs) more like Joe Tex, partly Sam Cooke womanizer, and later Marvin Gaye balladeer.Seem to recall Marvin actually wishing a new direction (in real life), and promptly moved over to Columbia and popped Let's Get It On, and Sexual Healing, before releasing the landmark ""What's Going On."" and other music, including Trouble Man film soundtrack.Also seem to recall Marvin slated to singing soft ballads at the Jule's Podell's (spelling?) Copa in New York when he desired to change up on the show. But the film is fiction, right?Absolutely loved the Georgie Woods type -- Uptown/Paramount/ Apollo/Regal Theater talent contest-like shows, where the Dreamettes initially lose. Still, the crowds in those venues responded more vigorously. And the movie makers threw away about $100,000.Appearing on the Chittlin Circuit for several years, this writer never, evah, saw a musical review with as many dancers on the stage (This writer missed the original Cotton Club by a few years). Humble opinion--the chorus lines weren't needed. Murphy could carry the scenes by himself (or with the girls). Yet, understood! It is a musical. Buttttt???).Excellent depiction shown of records cut in the afternoon and shortly thereafter,(at least the shellac version) moved onto the radio, with the help of some well placed Jacksons, LincolnsBenjamins had yet to become the standard, before the days of the centralized music director (or program director) in some far off town.The 1950s style tour bus would host card games among the musicians in the front, hanky panky amongst some female and male stars, and fierce competition when the stage became hot with the first act.Surprisingly, some names were actually not too disguised, but no lawsuit, so maybe legal received adequate clearances (and many of the folks deceased). For example, Curtis (Jamie Foxx) announces Jollie Jenkins coming into the company to do choreography and put together slick act for the Dreams.Hmmmmmmm shades of Cholly Atkins (legendary Atkins and Cole dance act)But did not see portrayed the legendary musical conductors represented (Gil Askey, Maurice King), unless the Holland Dozieresque featured songwriter combined them, with a hint of Robert Gordy type (who was over Jobete Publishing) and Fuller Gordy type floating around the company. Different writers and different producers did the chores.Notwithstanding other critics, there were riots in Detroit and tanks in the street, if memory serves, (this writer tried to get out, and couldn't) after the MLK assassination,Songs and Music:Where oh where did the prop department find those old one and two track recorders? While many of the songs were nearly mono chromatic, mono-interval syrupy pabulum, a couple stood out as rewrites of the Hitsville smashes this writer enjoyed playing on stage. (Ooppss! Keep forgetting. This film is fiction).(Still, guitarists Cornelius Grant, Wah Wah Watson, Ray Parker Jr, Bassist Bob Babbitt, Carol Kaye, and a few other West Coast musicians still alive that were actually there, could have really polished up that soundtrack, making it more, well, we understand )Even had to fight back a-sniff, snifftear or two with Effie's (""Judson's) belting out And I am Telling You"" One always thought tune mistress Jennifer Holiday owned it. But Hudson made it her own-- at least her version.The club scene where several of the musicians hung out showed wistful. There were such in Detroit nightlife, 20 Grand, and I think the other (where everyone went) Chit Chat Club (or Kit Kat).Dreamgirls proves a nostalgic memory lane excursion for those who have ever ridden the tour bus, been back stage, or taken part of a multi-act stage show where from the first act, the stage was hot. The last scene reminiscent of the Someday We'll Be Together show in Vegas, (sans Florenceshe was gone from the earth).The soundtrack I will definitely buy. Some of Murphy's tunes (the first one and the Kofi wearing groove) were ""locked"" Hudson's And I am Telling You, and proposed single (in the movie) superlative. Beyonce's ""Listen,"" well Beyonce!At the denouement, one cannot help but stand and give props to all concerned at the end of the film.James Wesly Smith-30-",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The first musical I stayed awake in!,"I saw this last night, a bottle of wine at my side, and enjoyed it immensely. Admittedly, I had expectations of the film being a vehicle for Beyonce, akin to the 'Lady Sings the Blues' biopic for Diana Ross. This would have been a post modern ironic parallel! However I'm glad that the cast had a balanced contribution to make, although Effie is the stand out highlight, her vocal and acting skills exceeding all others.As a Motown fan, I enjoyed the similarities, and remember hearing about founder Berry Gordy's dissatisfaction with the original stageshow. The tale of power corrupting is a timeless one, and transferred to the setting of classic R&B, it just begs the Diana Ross/Berry Gordy story, which is well documented, and clearly the inspiration for this tale.I don't like musicals, but I adored this, in no small part to the style of music. It's not classic music - Blues Brothers wins on that count - but it is a well overdue dramatic retelling of the classic period of American music.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Watch Dreamgirls for all the great performances-especially Jennifer Hudson's,"Three days after Christmas, on a day I was off from work, I paid for admission for my two sisters and their husbands for this long-awaited movie version of one of the most popular Broadway musicals of the last 25 years. Of the five of us, only one of my brothers-in-law wasn't too enamored of Dreamgirls the movie thinking it was miscast with comedian Eddie Murphy and Danny ""Lethal Weapon"" Glover in it (though he liked the music like the rest of us). From beginning to end, Dreamgirls had the energy to push the drama and music in full force throughout the picture. Murphy is great playing soul pioneer James ""Thunder"" Early as he experiences both the ups and downs of his popularity especially whenever he had to entertain more discriminating audiences like the one at a mostly white Miami hotel. Jamie Foxx and Glover are wonderful as Early's younger and older managers whose clashing styles cause an end for one of them (though he resurfaces later on for one of the Dreams). Beyonce Knowles is okay with her part of the beauty Deena's rise to fame from backup to lead singer of her group. Anika Noni Rose is likewise with her Dreams role as a mistress to Early. But the best performance-bar none-is former American Idol contestant Jennifer Hudson as Effie especially when she sings the show stopper: ""And I'm Telling You"". I've read about the spontaneous applause in various movie theatres after this number and while our matinée attendance had a not even half-full audience I still heard some clapping inside. While the film loses some steam after that, Dreamgirls still has some entertaining music and moments through to the end. While watching this most superior movie musical, look for cameos of John Lithgow, John ""The Office"" Krasinski, and, as the talent booker who at first refuses to book the Dreamettes after they arrived late then lets them be the last one on, a grown-up Jaleel ""Urkel"" White.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I haven't ever learned to like the Motown Sound, as I thought it was artificial and lacked emotion--but when Jennifer Hudson sings--wow! all the emotion and truth is out on the table. Nothing is held back. I should have paid double for this movie.Lately Hollywood has come back to making serious movies (films?) and this is one of them. I learned some about the music business, Motown, desperation, honesty, and how hard musicians work to make their records perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
masterpiece!!,"My favorite movie is Dreamgirls. Three women - Deena Jones, Effie White, and Lorrell Robinson - want to become pop stars. Deena Jones has an instinct for sing a song and beauty. So she is lead vocal. At first, they debuted as a chorus girl. But one day their talent is found by producer's Curtis and they get a big break to sing a song at the big stage. Then they become popular in the United States. But Deena Jones is becoming most popular all of them. Effie thought that to be unpleasant and for their success she is removed by the group. Thus their bond starts break...This movie's director is Bill Condon who was Chicago's scenario writer. That's one of the reason why I saw this movie. I also like music and musical movie. So I listened this soundtrack many times.Beyonce played Deena Jones in this movie.She sang the song ""Listen"" is so great.If you see this movie, you can enjoy not only plot but also music.But I want to listen Jennifer Hudson's song more.Her song is powerful.

A fabulous look-back at the Boomer's engine room.,"Diane and I saw this brilliant movie this afternoon and I am in awe of the magnificent performances that graced the screen. I had to take away one star because of my disdain for musicals in general but thankfully the musical numbers were short and the vocals were excellent. New York musicals do not fit with Motown and I did not realize that form played such a role in a story whose roots were in Detroit. I was also sorry that the singing was modern meaning that the musical numbers were not the originals as I had expected and therefore the magic of Holland-Dozier-Holland was missing; however, these are probably minor points for the great mass of the viewing public.Yes, Murphy probably did play his greatest role to date. And yes, if Jennifer Hudson was only voted into sixth on American Idol then the voting public for that show needs their heads thoroughly examined. If anybody ever makes a film biography of the great Aretha, then Hudson should be a shoe-in for the role.I thought the way in which the movie wove the stories of the different characters together was wonderful storytelling. The chronological changes seen in the costumes and props as the movie progressed was a credit to the production crew.Any Boomer reading this should absolutely see this film, even if you don't like, even a little, musicals.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls: An Unbelievable Cinematic Experience,"There is not much else to be said about the film event that is ""Dreamgirls."" Like many others, I had a love/hate feeling going into this film when I saw it back in December. There is no doubt that Jamie Foxx has amazing talent for this sort of thing, and his Oscar for Ray proves that...but the guy annoys me and I feel he is a little overrated, really (just listen to his horrid debut album). There is no doubt that Beyonce has incredible singing ability, but I find most of her recorded material boring and tedious (granted, there are a few acceptions), and thus, she annoys me, too. And Eddie Murphy taking on a role like this? I didn't think he could offer anything to the film. The one shining star was Jennifer Hudson who, like anyone else with half a brain and ability to hear, was horrifically voted off American Idol way too early when her voice proved to be one of the best that show ever saw.Well, look who's laughing now.Not only did Hudson learn to play the role by starting rehearsals weeks before the rest of the cast because she just couldn't get the attitude right at first, she sang her way all the way to a Best Actress Academy Award on her first time out, not to mention the Golden Globe and the SAG awards to boot! Beyonce hit the mark as well, also delivering a seriously beautiful new inclusion with the song ""Listen"", Foxx did an impeccable job and I truly believe, as much as I respect Arkin, (and I never thought I would say this), Murphy was robbed of an Oscar of his own.An incredible film that deserved every nomination it got, and should have also nabbed a nomination for Best Picture (although it should not have won), this film is definitely one of the most entertaining films of 2006 and one of the best stage to screen translations ever put out there. Whether you like musicals or not, if you enjoy great vocal and acting talents, this is one of the must-see films produced last year.Buying the soundtrack, be sure to get the full 2 CDs.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The Dream Team deserving of a Silver Medal!,"Keep dreaming if you agree with some moviegoers and critics that Bill Condon's ""Dreamgirls"" is the finest cinematic feast of 2006. However, I must state that the storyline and screenplay was capturing enough to be a bit dreamy. The film centers around The Dreams, a Supremes-type of black trio soul-singing gals, and their rise to prominence and stardom. Jamie Foxx stars as a shady musical manager named Curtis Taylor. He gives The Dreams their embryonic phases of recognition by contracting them to sing backup to a renowned James Brown-type soul singer named James ""Thunder"" Early. Some have called Eddy Murphy's performance as Early the best of the year. Even though it was a vibrant performance, I think it is too early to categorize it in that echelon. OK, here is where Dreams come true (Yea, I know! It was a very Mickey Mouse statement!) : The Dreams eventually do mature to break out of the background singer supporting world and reach the apex of lead recording artists success, but not with some nightmares along the way. One of the Dreamies named Effie leaves the trio because of jealousy and stubbornness, another Dreamie named Deena marries Taylor and reaches Divaland but also ""divas covering"" the ruthlessness of the music industry. I will not wake you up in the middle of your 'Dreamgirls"" dream and spoil the rest for you. Writer-Director Bill Condon does ""Condonly"" protect ""Dreamgirls"" from a musical cinematic epidemic by orchestrating some thrilling scenes featuring the amazing Jennifer Hudson, who plays Effie. However, I think Condon played risky movie musical business by not wrapping it up fast enough in some elongated conversation-musical scenes that was the nightmare of ""Dreamgirls"". As far as the leads, Beyonce Knowles was middling as Deena and Foxx was not his usual ""foxtrotting"" acting self as Taylor. No doubt that ""Dreamgirls"" was Jennifer Hudson's acting & musical showcase! The J. Hudson River has channeled its waters in Tinsletown and it might be sailing with a potential Oscar statuette for Best Supporting Actress. Jenny, I think Hollywood is got your production number and they want to make you theirs. Though it did a have a few yawns, ""Dreamgirls"" is one film worth waking up to. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Simple Story but the Cast Brings it to Life,","Dreamgirls is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The films plot is very basic and easy to follow,but the cast is really what brings it to life,everyone delivers brilliant performances,Jennifer Hudson did a great job and definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role,as well as Jamie Foxx,who is always great,Beyoncé Knowles,I didn't expect her to be very good because she is mainly a singer and I've only seen her in comedies (Austin Powers,the Pink Panther) previously but she really was a very good dramatic actress.My favourite performance was Eddie Murphy,I thought he was only in this movie for comic relief,which he was for a while but eventually his character becomes very serious and he was acknowledged for his spectacular performance with a Golden Globe win and an Academy Award nomination,I wish he had continued to do more dramas after this movie but sadly he is still just doing comedy,I know him best for that but it would be nice to see him deliver some more serious performances every now and then because he proved in this he is very good at it.The music in this movie is also beautiful,particularly the song Listen,and a lot of the actors that I didn't expect to sing did and were very good.My only real problem with this movie is that it is a bit longer than it needs to be and can be s little boring at times,however,Dreamgirls is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or musical.A trio of soul singers are catapulted to fame when they become the backing vocalist for an established star.Best Performance: Eddie Murphy Worst Performance: John Krasinki",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Overwhelming, spectacular and gritty!","This is one of the best adaptions of a Broadway musical I've ever seen. The chiefly African-American audience I watched the movie with was equally blown away. We laughed, gasped, sniffled and applauded--even applauded a celluloid image--in the same places. Why not? This is a story of how black music was whitened.The screenplay employs an interesting technique of starting a song as part of the plot with the characters are in regular clothes and then continuing it with full production values with glitzy costumes, wigs, lighting and audience on stage.Dreamgirls is like Ray with big production numbers. It shows the gritty side as well as the glamor of show business as daring performers attempted to break through beyond race music to the chiefly white audience of pop, where the money is. The performers are currently advised to ""lighten it"" (that is less racy with less lust and less pelvic writhing) to be commercial. Still, their original songs are covered by even lighter artists, not just more pop black stars, but even whites.The script, by director, Bill Condon, and book, by Tom Eyen, make the point, who introduced the song ""Hound Dog"", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, both white? No, it wasn't Elvis, but Big Momma Thornton, in 1953.We soon see that it isn't even enough to have a catchy song, but how much the promoter pays to have the record played on the radio. These are the days before Congress outlawed payola.With all the wonderful accolades given to the Dreamgirls, all well deserved, Eddie Murphy emerges as did Jaimie Foxx in Ray, as very musical and a superb performer. While Ray stayed close to his piano, Murphy as the composite character James ""Thunder"" Early, with a cap to cover the space between his front teeth, struts in satin pants and runs the gamut from rhythm & blues of Curtis Mayfield and Smokey Robinson, boogie, and finally to raucous soul of James Brown. He skips over the social-commentary stage of Marvin Gaye because he and the ""girls"" can't sell it to their agent. Who knew Murphy could pull this off, we can assume with Condon's direction? Early is a tragic figure who tries hard to crossover and appeal to ""the kids"" as the popular sounds change quickly from the mid-1960s into the next decade.The score by Henry Krieger and lyrics by Tom Eyen takes the Dreamettes through local Detroit R & B for what was then called Negro race music to audiences to a lighter Motown sound to appeal to the white kids, who buy records and show tickets, and then through the flower-child era of the late 1960s to definitely Caucasian disco in the 1970s. There is a very realistic scene in what looks very much like the Fontainebleau Hotel's night club in Miami Beach where the Dreamgirls get their big break in front of a white, mainly Jewish audience, which accepts them as it did in the late 1960s for the Supremes and Diana Ross.There are many glances and nonverbal reactions that make the film quite clever. The director, in this case Condon, is usually responsible. These glances sometimes, but not always, can be seen on the Broadway stage. Condon translated into the big screen the direction and choreography of the late Michael Bennett.Unlike Murphy, Jamie Foxx puts away his musical chops for the role of suave Cadillac dealer and then agent for the Dreamettes and soon Early, Curtis Taylor Jr. He renames them the Dreamgirls, makes them sound less black and, and breaks through to white venues soon after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which abolished segregation in public accommodations. He's the closest thing to Berry Gordy, Jr., who created the Motown sound.Songwriter and composer ""C.C."" (Clarence Conrad) White, younger brother to big-voiced Effie White of the Dreamettes, is memorably played by Keith Robinson. He is a composite of the teams of Holland-Dozier-Holland and Leiber-Stoller, cranking out those hits. He can lighten the boogie, but draws a line at disco.Not enough can be said about the women. Effie as the largest Dreamgirl with the biggest voice and most attitude is played by American-Idol reject Jennifer Hudson, who should win many awards for her work. First Taylor replaces her for the slimmer and blander Deena (Beyonce' Knowles) so that Effie, who can do the runs and the belting, must sing backup with the youngest, Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose). Then she is told that her absenteeism and lateness is causing her to be bounced from the group for not being professional (we later learn that she had a good reason). Since Effie loves him Taylor and they have a relationship, she realizes that she is being forced to give up both ties. She registers her protest in the show stopping number which ends act one of the play.The previews of ""And I'm Telling You, I'm Not Going,"" gave the impression that she screams her head off in the number. Not so, at least not right away. She takes a long time to build to the climax. She arrives shortly before the Dreamettes open in Miami Beach to learn that she has been replaced by a slim, curvaceous black singer. Michelle (Sharon Leal). Effie starts the song quietly and hurtfully. Taylor stops and listens, and a dolly camera makes rings around her. He finally turns and leaves, and Effie (Hudson) sings a musical tantrum. When she's done, our audience, seemingly emotionally spent, broke out into strong applause for the screen. I couldn't have been the only one with goosebumps.There's plenty of laughter, too, from Early and from the looks. Most of us left 2 hours 11 minutes later emotionally drained.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Screams for a Sequel,"I hate people who spoil movies too and talk through them. Everyone in the movie theater was too quiet and no one even boogied down. I had to sit in the last row to be able to dance a little. The music was phenomenal. The costumes were amazing as well. I can't wait to see the sequel!!!!There are so many possibilities for a sequel. One can imagine Magic growing up to be a detective, or maybe a songbird herself. It could be a flashback scene to maintain the style of the 60s or 70s. Or, it could be like a Golden Girls musical version! I think that would be cool too. I don't know. I can't wait to see the next one. It will be a wonderful surprise.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
It's taken its time getting here but it's been worth the wait,"You could say the musical has arrived or, to put it another way, has made a welcome comeback. Once upon a time, of course, they were ten-a-penny and the stars were made for them. Musicals sang and they danced and the best ones did both. And it seemed as if the directors were made for them, too. We had Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli and, to a lesser extent, we had George Sidney. But these versatile men could turn their hand to other things too, which helped when musicals fell out of favour. (Robert Wise won his two directing Oscars for musicals but you don't think of him as a director of musicals).Some years ago a new kind of stage musical began to make inroads. More people seemed to be flocking to theatres in London and New York and around the world to see the latest Kander and Ebb or more probably the new Andrew Lloyd Webber. These shows would run and run, close and then re-open, maybe slightly altered or with new casts. Musicals became the fashion. The cinema, however, kept its distance. Once in a while a popular stage show made it to the screen but couldn't find the requisite audience, perhaps because the screen version lacked something, was weak in comparison; (Richard Attenborough killed ""A Chorus Line"" stone dead). But the talk was there. 'It's time to film that popular show, the one that's been around for years; yes, that one'. There was even talk of a film of Sondheim's ""Follies"", (the film of his ""A Little Night Music"" was one of the great failures). Eventually it happened; we had ""Chicago"".To say ""Chicago"" bucked the trend would be an understatement. It wasn't a 'pop' musical like ""Grease"". To the public its songs would hardly be called well-known and since we no longer had stars geared specifically to the musical it gave us actors instead. Whether they could sing or dance almost seemed immaterial. It also gave us an untried director in Rob Marshall, yet by magic it worked. ""Chicago"" may not be a great musical in the way that ""Singin in the Rain"" or ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" are great musicals but it made us want to sing and dance again; it lifted our spirits.And now we have ""Dreamgirls"". Like ""Chicago"" the talk of a movie version of ""Dreamgirls"" has been around for a very long time; the difference, however, is that while ""Chicago"" has been enjoying an almost continuous stage revival in recent years, ""Dreamgirls"" hasn't been seen since it closed on Broadway all those years ago; (in London it hasn't been seen at all). It also had one of those legendary stage performances, (in this case by Jennifer Holliday), that seemed impossible to duplicate. So, you may ask, what prompted a film version of ""Dreamgirls"" at this point? The only answer I can think of is that musicals are popular again even if, with ""Dreamgirls"", they were taking a chance.The plot of ""Dreamgirls"" is that of a black singing group and their rise to fame in the 1960's. Supposedly they are based on the Supremes but this is not acknowledged and I would imagine the facts in the story bear no resemblance to what may or may not have happened with the Supremes. The songs are a very successful blend of the kind of soul music the Supremes specialized in and the kind of traditional Broadway score where a song is used to further the plot. And very good it is, too. In fact, I think it is better than ""Chicago"". (The director is the Oscar winning writer/director Bill Condon). This feels like a real film where ""Chicago"" looked like a filmed stage show and this time round they cast real singers who can act rather than actors who can sing.The star, nominally, is Beyonce and I must confess I didn't know her work as a pop performer before this but she really is the business, singing and acting her little heart out. And there is an excellent turn from Eddie Murphy, (it seems he can sing, too), as a James Brown-like soul star with an inflated ego. For whatever reason, Murphy seems to know the character well.But what about that performance that on the stage was legendary? Well, here they really have hit pay-dirt and again, as if by magic, they have found a star. Not an established star, mind you, but a new star and the circumstances surrounding the finding of this new star might have come, without reverting to cliché, from a fairytale. The star in question is Jennifer Hudson, an unknown who tried for her place in the sun on an American talent show called 'American Idol' and lost, (well, let's just say she didn't win the crown), but somebody was impressed, impressed enough to take a chance on her playing Effie, the lead singer dropped from the group for 'getting fat', replaced by the more glamorous character played by Beyonce and she's sensational. (She may have lost 'American Idol' but she won the Oscar). The show's big number is when Effie sings 'And I'm telling you I'm not going', (it has the effect of an aria), and Hudson does the seemingly impossible; she makes you forget Jennifer Holliday.Of course, the trend for musicals may not last and Hudson's career on screen may be short-lived but one hopes her singing career is just beginning. Her voice and range are extraordinary and her performance in ""Dreamgirls"" serves to remind us just how pleasurable a really good musical performance can be.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreams Come True - But at a cost!,"Passion, Destiny, Circumstance and Reality all come together when you watch three girls (Deena Jones, Effie White, and Lorrell Robinson) try their passions in possessing their dreams in music. It shows an honest contrast of the pains of striving and also the joys of being able to possess your passion! I became very much attached to the charter Effie White (Jennifer Hudson). I must say that to me, this was her movie indeed. I was a bit disappointed that I didn't see more from Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles) in this film. It appeared to be a story centered around Effie which displayed all the joy, pain and having to be humble to hold on to that dream. It gave that very in your face reality that we all face in one form or another in life. It was very encouraging to know that you can make your dream but holding on to it is something altogether different. I'm sure that Diana Ross would be pleased with this film, as Beyonce portrayed her in a good light. So in the end, there is always a cost for something, the cost for a good lunch, the cost for an expensive dinner, and ultimately the cost for a dream. This movie is a definite ""Must Go"". Take your mom, your aunt, your sister or even a friend there is something for everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"I have to say, I wanted to hate this movie....","When a movie gets so much praise, I usually go into it with a skeptical eye. I didn't even want to see this movie because I heard so much praise for it. Having watched it, all I can say is that it made a believer of me.The only way it has this low of a rating is due to backlash from all the praise, because, honestly, it's stunning.E. Murphy deserved the Oscar, his performance DESTROYED Alan Alda's weak performance in the WEAK movie 'Little Miss Sunshine' And JH's performance? Incredible. When watching the Academy Awards, I was miffed that she won Best Supporting Actress over other 'professional' actresses. Having seen the movie, I relunctantly admit that she deserved it.Beautiful soundtrack, perfect performances by so many, just an incredible movie.Again, the low rating has to be due to backlash...and not true ratings.

I was not expecting anything outstanding, it is not as bad as I thought. In my opinion, movies are meant to deliver a drama, a lesson, a message. Musicals most of the times are just about that (Music) naturally. I was not surprise of Eddy Murphy performance, He has been a good actor all this time. Ms Hudson was brilliant as well. Basically, this movie talks about the struggles musicians have to deal during emerging and trying to be successful and make money.It's just that is too much music... seem to be a long movie, and after too much music it gets kind of boring... overall - Not that bad...",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow,I think musicals are coming back big time to the screen. This formula will work. If you don't believe that look at the success of Tyler Perry and his musical plays. My fiancé loved the songs. We talked about using one during our marriage. Several people in the audience gave rousing applause and standing ovation on several songs. One of the best movies this year. All of the performances by the actors were well done. It is hard to believe that Ms. Hudson who played Effie did not win on American Idol. She was great. Had I not seen the faces of the singers I would have to say that she was better than Beyonce. Her voice has more strength and character. If you appreciate powerful music with a message you will enjoy this movie. I plan on buying the soundtrack . 5 stars for this one,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow .. What a fantastic movie,"Well I watched this at a preview and all I can say is that I loved it.. I had never heard of Jennifer Hudson before the film ,but after hearing her performance I looked her up and found her history in X Factor..With a voice like this I think she is definitely a winner, what a find and what great directorial excellence to cast her .. The gamble more that paid off, leaving Beyonce in the dust vocal wise. Performances by Eddie Murphy and Danny Glover were excellent and it gave me great pleasure to see a different side to Mr Murphy's abilities. He certainly shows that he can sing and also can also act seriously when required. Looking forward to the DVD so I can get the extras...",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun Movie,"I am not the biggest fan of the genre by any means but this was a great movie. Beyonce, in many scenes, did not have makeup on. She still looks great. She looks better then what you would expect. I guess that heavy girl was an American Idol contestant. She had a wonderful voice! It was just amazing. I was shocked and amazed how great Eddie Murphy was as well. He was very believable in his role. I was shocked how his character developed through the movie. He had feelings yet Jamie Foxx, who was very ""evil"" did not seem to care. There were many times during this movie when you would expect a bit more drama. However, the drama never really came as much as the MUSIC came to the forefront. I also did not know that this was a musical from the old days.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"EXCLUDING THE SLOW START, EVERYONE DID THEIR JOBS PERFECTLY!","DIRECTION AND STORY - I loved the direction the film's story took. At first, ""Dreamgirls"" started as a slow, very boring movie with beautiful songs. By the time the characters met Eddie Murphy, the movie started to get better. Not only that, the movie got better and better as the story progresses. The story is WONDERFUL AND MAKE ME THINK IF (ASSUMING THAT I HAVE GREAT ACTING SKILLS) I ACTUALLY WOULD WANT TO BE AN ACTOR SOMEDAY. I later found out that the story is loosely based on The Supremes and that fact made the story better (in my opinion)ACTING - Everyone was great. Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy were undeniably fantastic. Also, I did not know that Beyonce could act.SONGS / MUSICAL NUMBERS - They were so good, they made me sing. (Especially in ""Listen"" and ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going."" Though, admittedly, I sang thanks to the TNT Boys)MAKE UP (COSTUMES) - Like the other aspects of the film, they were amazing. (At the film's start, I did not recognize Beyonce)WHY 8 AND NOT 10? - Like I said, the movie started as a slow, boring movie with beautiful songs..
STILL, I LOVED IT!!!!!!! I'm glad that my idols, the TNT Boys, sang ""Listen,"" ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" and ""Can't Hurry Love"" because some comments on Youtube videos featuring the TNT Boys singing these songs mentioned that they wanted to rewatch this movie. THOSE COMMENTS ARE THE ONLY REASONS WHY I SAW THIS FILM! Those comments lead me to a wonderful movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A mosiac of Motowners,"Having never seeing the Broadway musical I went in to Dreamgirls understanding it is loosely based on the Supremes. It is better stated that it is loosely based on a mosaic of Motown artists. I saw pieces of the Supremes, Diana Ross, Ike Turner, James Brown, the temptations and more. It focuses on the rise of three women to the top of pop culture and the cost of the journey to get there. Although the story is fictitious it is compelling. I would be interested on why this is not the story of the Supremes there is certainly the drama in that story. The vocals are top notch, and there is not a week link in the chain. Jennifer Hudson, of American Idol, is a stand out as Effie White. The audience applauded the screen when Jennifers's picture came on the screen during cast credits at the end. I am happy to see that there is something good to come out of the Fox series.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Well Worth the Wait!,"I first fell in love with the original score way back in the eighties. I heard Jennifer Holiday's powerhouse vocals on two of Broadway's legendary show-stopping tunes and I was hooked. I knew the words to all the songs and sang along with abandon at the drop of a hat. That soundtrack ranks as one of my top five favorites. I never saw the play but I live nowhere close to where it played...EVER. I kept hoping to see a film of the play somewhere and searched for years. I bought the two CD concert recording with Audra McDonald a couple years ago. Didn't think there would be anything I'd like as well as the original. I loved that version as well mainly because it's like having an unabridged version of the stage play on my CD player.So I'm a fan, right? As a fan I was really leery about this new version of the play. I was excited but didn't really believe that these folk (actors/singers) would be able to live up to the material. I like Beyonce and she's got a good voice but she's more performer than singer. I adore Eddie Murphy but he's a bit long in the tooth and while I thought his ""Party All The Time"" was an amusing bit of 80's fluff I didn't really believe he could pull off James ""Thunder"" Early without winking at the camera and letting us all know that he didn't take it seriously. I was aware of Jennifer Hudson but she had been pushed aside on that show...American Idol...by Fantasia. I detest Fantasia and if she was supposed to be better than Jennifer then I really had reservations about my two favorite songs getting the justice they deserved.But, I'm a sucker for this material so I plunked down my money and found myself in a seat prepared to make excuses for the mess that I was SURE would be on the screen. I had the surprise of my life! The movie great.Wait, let me say that again, please...The movie is GREAT! Damn good! Marvelous!! The story is so real yet not maudlin or overbearing. The music, ya'll the MUSIC!! I was moved to tears more than once. Eddie Murphy surprised the hell out of me. He can SING!! He paid homage to all the great soul singers and crooners. Way to go Eddie!! Jennifer Hudson grabs the camera by the throat and won't let go whenever she's on screen. Her voice, oh Lord, that voice! Let me just say, for the record, that girl has SKILLS!! Beyonce has more depth in her performance than I thought possible. Her voice has a maturity that I didn't realize she possessed. I knew Jamie Foxx could sing and act but he went to a dark place to find Curtis and brings home the goods. Anika Noni Rose is a jewel and so underused it's almost a crime.Bottom line...GO SEE THIS! You have GOT to experience this in a theater! Don't wait for the DVD...Run, DO NOT WALK to your local movie theater and see this picture. Then go out and buy the Dreamgirls Deluxe Edition double CD. All the songs are on that version and they ROCK!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I'm in no way discounting Beyonce's talent. The fact of the matter is that Jennifer Hudson stole the show. Moreover, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx did a marvelous job.

Excellent high paced movie.,"While this is a formula movie the execution is excellent and the action carries the movie forward at all times. Jennifer Hudson is magnificent and her voice takes every scene in which she appears. I think the movie makes clear the difficulty that the black performers had when first they attempted to break into the white music scene. I was taken aback when the first ""operetta"" scenes appeared and thought that they did not work. But if you give yourself up to the movie you will find that indeed they do work and advance the characters far more than mere dialog would. Jennifer Hudson's ""soloquiy"" was magnificent if a shade too long. I would have liked to see Curtis get his comeuppance more definitely. And finally, the singing and dancing carry the show even if you do not like the plot.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Lives Up to the Hype - Indeed an Excellent Movie,"I deliberately waited until all the hype was done, all the awards were won, and until I was no longer tired of Beyonce to purchase and view Dreamgirls.It is indeed an excellent presentation.Directed by the director of Chicago, another fantastic musical (and that's saying a LOT as I am generally NOT into musicals) Dreamgirls brings to the screen the excellent Broadway production of the 80s that put Jennifer Holiday on the map.Apart from top-notch production standards, wonderful costumes, fantastic music, and excellent performances all around, Dreamgirls is indeed another wonderful presentation of a slice of African-American life/culture that is worthy of any movie collection.All performances were equally riveting. Of course we all recognize this as a thinly veiled retelling of the Motown/Supremes story. (Its a shame Florence did not have the happy ending Effie did, but such is life.) Jennifer Hudson's Oscar was indeed well-deserved. She was simply powerful though not necessarily a sympathetic character for the most part. To Beyonce's credit, she did not AT ALL try to be the focus and her performance was rightfully understated. Eddie Murphy was indeed wonderful as a composite of Little Richard, James Brown, Wilson Pickett, etc. Jamie Foxx was most competent and I am so glad he got a chance to sing a few songs - though not a sympathetic character at all, he is still a consummate actor and a major contributor to making this work on film.I can certainly understand the standing ovations it got in some theaters and friends of mine who went to see it in a theaters attested to that.It really should have been at least nominated for Best Picture but, alas, again, the nature of the beast!!

Anyone who feels that Beyonce did poorly are being ridiculous I think if anyone did more than she did then they would have been going over the top with her character. Jennifer Hudson was fab as well, I mean she could do know wrong in this production. Eddie Murphy was also a spectacle I understand why so many critics feel this is one if not the best he's done on film.

A visually stunning musical; and then some,"Dreamgirls, probably one of the most hyped up films of 2006, is most definitely one of the most entertaining films around. The overall look of the film is just stunning, particularly the opening shots of the Detroit Theater Talent Contest. The costumes are absolutely gorgeous, which means quite a bit coming from someone who could care less about costumes and fashion. The performances for the most part are amazing. Don't listen to all the negative hype about Beyonce, she was actually pretty good in this. While not Oscar worthy, it is certainly an enormous improvement over her previous efforts. Eddie Murphy is just perfect as Jimmy Early. Most people will probably be turned off in hearing that he is in it simply because of some of his more recent films (Pluto Nash, Daddy Day Care, and now Norbit), but don't be fooled; this is an Eddie Murphy you've never seen before. Anika Noni Rose and Danny Glover are the most underrated performers here, yet they are both a pleasure to see on screen; Anika's Lorell easily makes the transition from bubbly, naive young backup singer to a mature, respectable young woman. Danny Glover hasn't got much screen time, but his performance is definitely very touching and believable. Keith Robinson was also wonderful as CC White; his performance of ""Family"" is just lovely to listen to. Jamie Foxx was just 'eh' to me; I'm sure Terrence Howard could have pulled off the part and made it so much better. Jennifer Hudson, what more is there to say about her? This is the most memorable film performance in a long time, and even more so considering it's Hudson's film debut. She holds her own and then some against this top notch cast. All of the positive things you've heard about her don't even do her performance justice. After she belted out the anthem ""And I Am Telling You"", the entire theater burst into applause and cheers; it was definitely one of the most memorable movie theater moments I have ever had and I'll probably never have one quite like it again. The music itself is also marvelous and extremely well-adapted from the original Broadway score. There are tunes that are sure to make you want to just get up and dance, while others may bring a tear to your eye. It isn't the first film soundtrack to reach #1 on the Billboard charts since Grease in 1978 for nothing'! Overall the look of the film, the brilliant performances, and the vibrant music make Dreamgirls one of the most entertaining filmgoing experiences of 2006, as well as one of the most entertaining filmgoing experiences of the past few years. Extremely recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls...WOW,"What a surprise. I must admit that after seeing the musical on Broadway as a young girl, I was a bit scared about the movie version not living up to the awesome performances of Jennifer Holiday and the lot, but watch out - there's a new girl in tinsel-town and her name is Jennifer Hudson! No question, Hudson is the movie. Her passion, her voice and surprisingly, her acting were the only reasons I didn't get out of my seat to go to the bathroom. Beyonce and Jamie Fox were average at best in their roles, but thanks to Hudson and Eddie Murphy, it really didn't matter. Dreamgirls is well worth the $9.00 and the 2 1/2 hours. Whether you like musicals or not, the screenplay did the stage play justice and, in my opinion, made the story a lot more engaging and interesting enough to keep my husband from falling asleep...or maybe it was Beyonce in all the tiny outfits. Well, however you get to the theatre to see this one, it's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very entertaining musical with awesome singing,"This screen adaptation of the classic Broadway musical is a very well made one. The cast is great, they all so such a fine job with their performances. Jennifer Hudson gives the best performance out of all in my opinion. Hudson just has an incredible singing voice and she shows off her acting chops along with her singing ability in this film. Eddie Murphy is a supporting actor here, he's alright, I personally don't think his performance here was deserving of an academy award nomination, but it's not necessarily a bad performance. Jamie Foxx plays Beyoncé Knowles's husband who is involved in the music industry and helped get the girls started. He gave a good performance, if you ask me I think he should have gotten an academy award nomination instead of Murphy. I really enjoyed Beyoncé Knowles and her performance, of course her singing is good, everyone knows she won't let you down on that front. I may be slightly biased since I'm a big Beyoncé fan, but she really is good here. The script allows for deep character development and good story lines for every character. And of course fantastic musical performances. I'm telling you that Jennifer Hudson has a set of unbelievable pipes! 8/10 for Dreamgirls.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie!!!,"As a lover of musicals, I really enjoyed this movie! Jennifer Hudson was BRILLIANT!!!And as for Beyonce, Sorry Girl!!! Jennifer Hudson just stole your show!!! Did Beyonce even read the script before signing up? The story isn't really about her character. This movie was all about Jennifer Hudson as Effie!!! You GO GIRL!!!! Amazing!!!! Hope to see DREAMGIRLS at the Oscars!!! Jamie Foxx also turned in a stellar performance... I wasn't familiar with Dreamgirls as a Broadway show, but I do think that the translation from stage to screen was very well handled. Meanwhile I felt compelled to applaud after ever big song---even though the actors were not actually there in front of me!! And Lastly, a big WOW!!! to Jennifer Hudson... you are going to be a HUGE STAR!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Rise of a Group Just Like the Supremes,"Deny it as they may, the makers and stars of this film were at the very least inspired by the Supremes and the gripping story of the all-girl Motown trio's rise to international fame in the 1960s. Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson (singing ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" in her Oscar-winning role) bring the story to life rather effectively. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2016",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Revise it to Jennifer and the Dream Girls,"I saw Dreamgirls last Friday and the movie blew me away like a hurricane, and the name of the hurricane is Jennifer Hudson. She was the one who made the movie. When her character left for a few minutes the movie was dead, when Jennifer came back so did the magic. I hate to say this but the spotlight is more on Jennifer instead of Beyonce. Personally I felt that she should be a candidate for ""Best Actress"" instead of Beyonce. Beyonce was good but she couldn't top Jennifer in this one. Not only that Jennifer sang her heart out but when it comes to her acting I can tell this is a lot of emotion to it. All I to say is you Jennifer, you have a guy who is routing for you",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Only a 6.6?,"Oh my god, I loved this movie. It's a movie for everyone. Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson really do deliver amazing performances. Beyonce's was so underrated and Jennifer Hudson truly did deserve the Oscar. The music was phenomenal and I can't believe this didn't stand out more at the Oscars. A 6.6 really makes this movie seem so underrated. I can't wait for this to come back on Broadway and I will be there opening night. This is so worth a look at. Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson are all great and this really was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Amazing acting, amazing cast, great story, amazing songs...Dreamgirls hits it out of the park.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"An awesome musical, oh yeah some great acting too!","I saw this movie and was amazed from the moment the music started until the credits started to roll. Everyone did an excellent acting job but I was more in awe of Eddie Murphy's singing talent. I have seen the music video that he did a few years ago, I think it was entitled ""Party all the time"". His singing parts in this film was outstanding and he did an excellent job. I hope this sends a message to the studio's that the public still loves a good musical. Not since grease have I enjoyed myself and knowing a lot of the music, I found myself silently singing along at times.Just a thought, wasn't that Steve Erkel aka...Jaleel White as the stage manager in the opening sequence? Or was it Stephan? :)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing Musical,"DreamGirls is one of the best musicals ever and the music is specular, inspirational and incredible. Beyonce Knowles is extremely beautiful and an incredible singer, Anika Noni Rose is funny, pretty and sweet as the lovable lorelle, Jamie Foxx is a talent as Curtis Taylor Jr, Eddie Murphy shines as James Thunder Early, Keith Robinson is a talent as Effie's brother, CeCe and Jennifer Hudson shines in her unforgettable role, Effie White. This is a great movie musical to watch with just about with everybody. I thought that this movie is big hit and this movie musical dazzles and sparkles every time it's watched that is how good it is. I would give this movie a 10/10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What a performance!!!,"JENNIFER HUDSON WAS BRILLIANT!!! I was so impressed with her. She deserves every award she has already received and most certainly, the big one. I would go see this movie again just to see her performance. The movie was very well done. I am not a fan of Beyonce's acting abilities, but even she kicked it up a notch this time. She was very believable in this film. I will definitely be adding this to my movie collection when it comes out on DVD. Like the movie, ""The Color Purple""...this is one of those movies that you will watch over and over and over and over again. Congratulations to the cast and crew! Excellent work!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamgirls is a musical film. The story of the film is that one vocal group which is unknown become famous through getting over a lot of difficulties.,"In 1962, the vocal group which name is ""The Dreamettes"" from Chicago, performs a show in Detroit with dreaming to be famous. The Dreamettes is formed by Deena Jones, Lorell Robinson and Effie White who is a lead singer. In the same day, the Dreamettes meets a man whose name is Curtis. He presents himself as the Dreamettes' new manager and makes the Dreamettes back chorus of a R&B singer Jimmy. One day, Jimmy and the Dreamettes get a chance to sing at a hotel in Miami. But it end in failure because of Jimmy. This failure makes Curtis angry and cold-hearted Curtis sell Jimmy to a hotel in New York. After that the Dreamettes changes their name to ""The Dreams"". This means that Curtis decide to launch out the Dreams alone. And also he decide to change a lead singer to Deena from Effie. Effie is wounded heart. Then the Dreams become very famous. Especially, Deena is hold the spotlight. Effie soon has bad condition and frequently she is absent from a performance. One day, Effie recovers and she goes to dressing room of the Dreams. Then she notice something is strange. There is a new member whose name is Michelle instead of her. In 1972, the Dreams has become international star. On the other hand, Effie is back to Chicago and she is singing for a living. But eventually she decide to try her best again. The song of Effie is in the charts and Curtis knows it. After that he lowers the ranking of Effie and makes the Dreams be in charts with offering bribe. One day, Effie and lawyer come to the concert of the Dreams to bring an accusation against him. At that time, Effie and Deena meet each other after a long separation. Although they have had a mountain of difficulties, finally, they get back their friendship. At last, the story come to the emotional climax.This movie contains a lot of scenes of singing. Of course, Beyonce who is acting Deena has a good singing voice, but I think that the singing voice of Jennifer Hudson who is acting Effie is more wonderful!! When Deena and Effie become reconciled, they sing duet in the movie. This song was so powerful and beautiful so I was very impressed. I would love for everyone who have never watched the movie to listen to this song. However I saw the musical of Dreamgirls too because I really like this story. Dreamgirls is influential for me that much. Anyway, this is a touching movie. Even if you don't like music, you can enjoy enough watching this movie. I really recommend you to watch it!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Much, much better than I expected!","Dreamgirls was very much anticipated and also very advertised, I would say even too advertised in order to have a big splash when it came out in cinemas. To be frank, I didn't expect very much from this musical, not too much from the acting part anyway. All this contributed to my not so insignificant surprise, to see a moving, well acted and entertaining movie. I have to admit I've been somewhat surprised to find out that Dreamgirls is one of the Oscars candidates, and that was one of the reasons that led to my paying to see a movie I wouldn't otherwise. Jennifer Hudson is BIG in this movie and I look forward to hear her again if not see her in as many productions as possible. Her presence on the screen is magnetic. Oscar performance! So, my advice for those who haven't seen this movie, go see it as soon as you can; you'll have good music, good acting, great cast and eye-candy!Worthwhile!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamy dreamgirls,"Dreamgirls is a musical in every sense of the word, its pace and visual style never lets you rest. Condon's direction is flawless and really encapsulates the essence of live theatre. Jennifer Hudson is terrific as is commonly noted and I got to the point where I couldn't wait for her to appear on screen again. Beyonce is barely noticeable at times and is wasted - she doesn't add anything to the film and wouldn't be missed if she wasn't there probably because everybody else in the cast is correctly cast and excels in their roles namely Eddie Murphy. Overall Dreamgirls is a visual treat which roots itself into the musical genre with such a thud that it grabs you and doesn't let you go for two hours. It's just a shame that Beyonce was in it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beyonce, will you marry me? .. Or maybe we could just hang out???","2-15-08. I rented this flick for the sole purpose of ogling Beyonce, and while it turned out not be a peep show, I was rewarded nevertheless with a very entertaining movie! It wasn't sexy, and it wasn't a fantastic movie overall, but I was fascinated by parts of it, enough so to recommend it highly. For you techies, the cinematography was excellent.I expected authentic Mo-Town music, but it was all original songs, with musical dialogue mixed in. Reminded me of JC Superstar or Hair, at times. Eddie Murphy did a terrific number that I didn't know he had in him! There was a lot to like about Dreamgirls, but one particular solo of Beyonce's blew me away! I had tears running down my face! She can sing with anybody, as well as dance and is a superb actress! She actually doesn't have a beautiful face, but the accumulative effect of all her talents, make her a stone TEN!WOO WOO!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
stand up and cheer,"I'm 42 years old and have seen a lot of films, both at the cinema and elsewhere. While I will concede that 'Dreamgirls' isn't the most profound movie ever made, it is however THE ONLY FILM I'VE EVER SEEN AT THE CINEMA WHICH ACTUALLY MADE ME WANT TO STAND UP AND CHEER AND APPLAUD AT A GOOD FEW MOMENTS* (naturally, being stereotypically British, I didn't do this ~ there were no more than 8 other people at the screening I attended: I'd probably have been thrown out). Personally I thought Jennifer Hudson stole the whole show and should have won the Oscar for Best Actress, never mind Supporting ~ she was the real meat and bones of the movie. * Even when Eddie Murphy sang ~ and under normal circumstances I cannot stand Eddie Murphy",9.0,Anonymous,Music
great,"The sound track is great....singing voices phenomenal... It may not be ""Ray"" but it is better than the Johnny Cash movie...... I thoroughly enjoyed the whole movie and the new range of skills displayed by each of the actors. Jennifer Hudson has established herself in this movie & Eddy was such a surprise....wonderful!! Only people who were never into this ""sound"" in the first place would walk out on this movie.... Loved Keith Robinson who gave a sensitive performance & Beyonce was made for this role..... could feel & see the connection..... Jamie Fox's character was hard to take but he was meant to be that way... If this were just fiction, then it might come across as too much fluff but for those of us old enough to have been around in these times, it presents a thoughtful & insightful presentation of the events that occurred.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The best musical in years!,"I don't think I can say anything about Dreamgirls that hasn't been said yet. Many love it, some hate the hype surrounding it.Here's what I think. It is the best musical to hit the big screen in years.Soundtrack-wise, it achieves greater things than Chicago did back in 2002. The songs are catchy and performed to near perfection by an amazing cast.As you all know, most of the cast has been nominated for an award or two or three. The supporting actors in Dreamgirls, I think, outperform the lead actors. Jennifer Hudson excels as proud Effie and Eddie Murphy burns up the screen as James 'Thunder' Early, in the most electrifying performance of the year. Though flawed, the film grips you with its infectious music and amazing performance. A must-see!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Based on a true story!!!  Musical,emotional,strength of a woman","Dear friends, This is a movie that you must watch if you love movies which are musical and based on true stories. The movies gives accounts of a time when Black people were never given the standing that they needed in the society. You need to work together as a family, to make it to the top.This is exactly what this movie shows us. Eddie Murphy and Jamie Fox play their parts too perfection. Beyonce and Hudson really sing especially there is one very emotional song sung by Jennifer Hudson if you hear it on a 5.1 stereo system I'm sure you will cry.IF your a music lover especially of Black American singers, then you must definitely buy the music album.It really has songs that will make you feel.I enjoyed the movie cause I love a good musically, I would love to attend the stage version of Dreamgirls as well,I think it would be entertaining.

Wowee Wowee Wow!,"If you want a good time at the movies, go see Dreamgirls. Feet were tapping, heads were bobbing all throughout. (That's in the audience, I mean.) I saw the original cast on Broadway and as wonderful as that was, the movie version improves on it.(And you can't say that about all movie musicals -- look at ""The Producers"". No, don't.)There are wall to wall songs. Every frame is filled with wonderful things to see and hear.Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson blew me away (and I'm not easily impressed). This is the best role Eddie has ever had. When he first came out as the marcelled 50s soul singer, I had a brief flashback to the ""In the Hot Tub - YOW!"" sketch of his early SNL days when he was doing James Brown. But this role goes far beyond mere impersonation. He's a joy to watch every moment.I can see the Academy Voters breathing a collective sigh of relief (from their elderly lungs as they take a hit off their oxygen masks): ""Phfew!! At last! An easy choice for Best Picture Oscar!"" Unlike last year: ""Brokeback Mountain or Crash ... hmmm... errrmmm... Do we HAVE to pick one? Can't we just say there were several pretty good pictures this year?""My only quibble is several of the songs sounded Show-Tuney when they ought to have sounded Motown-ey.But I guess they felt they had to reproduce the original score exactly. But they could have made a few improvements there.Also (OK, second quibble) -- occasionally they do that annoying thing that they do in musicals -- where people having a conversation suddenly starting singing to one another. It's fine when the song is being performed on stage by the Supremes -- uh, er, I mean -- ""The Dreams"" -- but when brother and sister are talking backstage and suddenly burst into song, well...And (OK, third quibble) they could have used a few moments of black screen after Jennifer Hudson finishes her amazing rendition of ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"", coz in the Broadway theater the audience rose to its feet and applauded (the original performer) for 3 minutes. But in the movie they just immediately cut to another scene. We need a moment to take in such an astounding performance.But these are small quibbles and I got past them pretty easily because this whole movie is just so darn enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a story with just on moral,"Good movies that are more than just transitions from scene to scene have opinions. The story has more than one moral but many. Many little objects or lessons or points. Effie's lesson was that if everyone who plays music in the American music during that time period got screwed or treated unfairly, she got screwed even more. Being a plus size girl, she seemed to get opted out of the trio. What they call part of the business. But later on in the show she really truly got a raw deal from Curtis(Jamie Foxx). She did get involved with her boss. Which did not work out, and she acted like she loved Curtis. Then Deena(Beyonce Knowles) steps in. At that part of the movie, the film becomes like a musical, yet there is more to come in terms of a drama. The music is a backdrop to the drama ensuing at times, but at other times the film is like music video. Jennifer Hudson does an awe-inspiring solo, standing on the stage alone. She runs everyone off, the rest of them, Curtis, the other singers, and her own brother, a keyboardist and lyricist.Between being the best of the worst, I have to say Curtis Taylor is a more shady character than James Early played by Eddie Murphy. Early has addictions. He loves women and he loves the white powder. I was wasted, I mean happy, when Early changes his tune during a live dinner theater performance. The crowd loved it, and Curtis hated it. It was not what want Curtis wanted, and everything was that way with the producer. Although he wanted that special something, a niche for black musicians, he went to great lengths to accomplish things and he hurt Jones very much. She was a good snooper. The wild man ""Thunder"" Early also has trouble keeping Lorrell interested even though the two are together despite the lack of a diamond.The trio begins with other assorted associates who are friends and lovers, but later all become professional associates. Curtis represented the company and there are major riffs, both interpersonal and what the performers wanted as opposed to what the company desired. Their desire?Terrific choreography and acting. Set in an era spanning the late 50's and the late 60's. All in all, a movie hard to resist.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Murphy and Hudson carry the day in Dreamgirls,"After months of anticipation Dreamgirls did not disappoint as it burst onto the screen unlike no other musical swinging you back into a time gone by of excitement, style and great music. From the opening scene both Eddie Murphy (James Early) and Jennifer Hudson (Effie White) take command of Dreamgirls to bring you a very enjoyable movie musical experience. Both actors wrapped the theater audience around their thumbs with standout performances. Beyonce Knowles(Deena Jones aka Diane Ross) is beautiful as always as she hit her spot every time during her singing performances often reminding me of the great one herself as she strutted her stuff across the stage. Ms.Knowles acting although an improvement over her past roles was still not up par. Her counterpart Jamie Foxx (Curtis Taylor Jr.)appeared to be out of his comfort zone as his performance lacked the emotions needed to carry such a important part in the movie. Also there appeared to be some transition problems going into some of the songs. But when you put it all together the film was great and well worth the wait. We are in an era today where there is more hype then talent when it comes to newcomers in the record and acting business, I can tell you that Jennifer Hudson gives a standout performance second to none. I suspect that we will hear her name called come Oscar time. Mr. Murphy also gave the best performance to date in what has been a great career. Dreamgirls, one of the best films this year!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
""" Loved this flick ""","Just saw the movie DG over the wk-nd...enjoyed it very much.. Being a Motown Freak from the 60's , I was wondering if the story was true to form about Motown..?

I don't think JB recorded with Motown did he ? How about that other songwriter for Effie.. was he referencing any of the Motown writers.. Berry Gordy had a child with Diana Ross didn't he..? What was the connection with this baby ? ( I was thinking about Jackie Wilson..Dozier and Holland for some of my answers...Marvin Gaye..Donnie Hathoway..

Very Good Movie...but worth the hype?,"Dreamgirls is a good movie that is definitely worth the price of admission. Let me start by getting that point across. But does it hold up against the hype that is surrounding it? I had the chance to see this film last night. It was definitely an experience. Now this is not a review of the film but merely a statement of fact. Jennifer Hudson is amazing. She is an amazing singer but when she's not singing and just acting, she's better than average. She is definitely worthy of all the acclaim that will come to her, but an Oscar? When there were much better acting performances this year? Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada or Toni Collette for Little Miss Sunshine were amazing acting performances. Hudson will receive a worthy nomination, but there were just better performances this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A truly inspirational and unforgettable experience!,"Watching this film inspired the forging of my love for the creative process of music-making. The entire work of Bill Condon's Dreamgirls was memorable.I was never a fan of Beyonce, not because I was disappointed in her previous work, but because I never took the time to really listen to her. Well, her performance of ""Listen"" fixed that. She won me over! I always loved the work of Jennifer Hudson on American Idol and although she was denied the recognition she deserved, her musical and acting performances in Dreamgirls vindicated her and sealed her proper place in the hearts of many. Furthermore, the performances of the entire ensemble was rich, genuine, and very effective.One word of caution: Take this film on its own merit and do everything possible not to compare it with the Motown performers and artists. Otherwise, this could distract from the pure worthiness of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Move over Beyonce', here comes Jennifer Hudson","I never thought I'd ever see someone that could push Beyonce' to the back of the room with singing. Jennifer Hudson blew Beyonce' out of the water. Her performance was breath-taking. Where has this girl been hiding? I understand she was passed over in American Idol. Simon Cowel?, you should be hiding your head. Whoever made the mistake on this one - shouldn't have a job anymore. This girls performance was magnificent. If the Academy doesn't nominate her - they should all be retired. The whole cast of this movie was good. The musical numbers were outstanding. Eddie Murphy outdid himself. He was funny & dramatic as James Thunder Early, James Brown character. The musical numbers were very good- they were done with feeling & made you feel good. Jennifer Hudson's solo staying goodbye to her lover & friends was moving - she brought tears to my eyes. I hope to see this girl move onto Broadway - she would pack the house. Go see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One night only,"""Dreamgirls,"" written for the screen and directed by Richard Condon, is based on the Broadway hit about a Supremes-like group breaking into the 1960s mainstream. It stars Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal, and Hinton Battle.I have to admit that I really loved the slickness and glitz of this film, as well as the fabulous music. The book is light, but it does go into the history of black artists trying to break through the ""chitlin circuit"" and play Vegas; it also hit on payola.The performances are all excellent, with Eddie Murphy in a showy, Oscar-nominated role of a James Brown-type performer; a stunning debut by Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as the rejected Effie; she brings down the house with ""And I Am Telling You""; and the beautiful Beyonce Knowles as the lead singer who is managed by Curtis (Jamie Foxx).Foxx gives an interesting performance, playing a brilliant visionary and businessman who on the surface seems like Mr. Nice Guy but who in reality is ruthless. Danny Glover is an old-time manager who doesn't see the future as a changing one for blacks.What I liked the most about ""Dreamgirls"" is that Condon lets the musical numbers play out; they're not cut up like an MTV video, although he does provide visual excitement.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A dream cast,The movie was amazing. I went into it not wanting to give Beyonce a chance but she did a great job especially as the film progressed. Jennifer Hudson tho stole the show.

Surprised me by how good it was,"I never intended to see Dreamgirls in the theater but once it came out in DVD I rented it and watched it with my wife and another couple. We were all very pleasantly surprised by how much we liked it! The acting is superb and the songs and singing were excellent.If I have any quibbles with it, it is that I never knew who the ""main character"" was supposed to be or what the plot is trying to show. It seemed to jump from person to person and make each one of them a ""main character"" for part of the story.As an aside as a 60+ white male I have to say that I love Beyonce. I once saw her on a ""celebrity"" quiz show and she answered all the questions correctly, and they were not easy questions. I also hear that she's basically a ""nice person."" Add to that her talent and beauty and I think she is one of the premiere celebrities today.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
