An atmosphere like no other.,"This is how horror films need to be made. Aside from The House of the Devil (a beautiful throwback to this period of the genre) there aren't any films that can so perfectly create this kind of a chilling atmosphere that keeps your skin tingling from start to finish. From the haunting echo of Mia Farrow's voice eerily leading us in, Rosemary's Baby immediately absorbs you into it's world and never lets you out. That's the perfect word for this; absorbing. Roman Polanski is one of cinema's finest directors and what makes him stand as such is how perfectly he can create an atmosphere. Even in his few failures he crafts a unique and full atmosphere that is expertly made for the film he's creating. He's one of the few directors who always know what he's doing and always creates a complete vision that never wavers. That's on display in spades in Rosemary's Baby, a film that drives mystery, supernatural paranoia and the fears of any pregnant woman into the heart of the viewer. With the help of a revelatory performance in terror from Farrow, Polanski creates a truly perfect film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Veneer Of Normalcy,"It starts off like one of those 1950's Doris Day movies. Young, idealistic Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and new hubby Guy (John Cassavetes) move into a Manhattan apartment building called the ""Bramford"". Throughout most of the film we, as viewers, see and hear what innocent Rosemary sees and hears. There's a veneer of normalcy at the Bramford that belies what's really going on, behind our backs. It's the script's POV, therefore, that makes this film so chilling.At the Bramford, which has quite a colorful history, you can hear through the walls. And, as Rosemary and we viewers soon find out, strange people lurk in other parts of the building. The strangest of all are Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon), superficially cordial, but a bit too inquisitive. Roman is retired. His wife, Minnie, wears tons of makeup and pawnshop jewelry, and gushes with praise for herbal cures, especially something called tannis-root. And Minnie's friend Laura-Louise (Patsy Kelly) wears thick glasses that make her eyes seem to bulge, and she talks with a strangely deep voice.""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of the great thrillers of all time. Given the underlying subject matter, can you imagine how this film must have come across to viewers in 1968? The strength of the film is the script, which through its plot and dialogue implies and suggests. Not until near the end do we, like Rosemary, find out the presumed truth. Suspense increases toward the end as Rosemary ventures into the inner sanctum of the Bramford.The film's acting is great, and reinforces the strong script. I particularly liked Ruth Gordon, with her delightfully eccentric behavior and mannerisms. Production design and especially costumes are lavish and colorful. Clothes and hairstyles, as you would expect, are very 1960ish. Visual effects are minimal, and are used to enhance the story, not be the story.Given the film's POV, the story is rather subjective. Its interpretation is based on Rosemary's perceptions, images, and fears. One could explain that Rosemary suffers from delusions. Or, alternately, one could explain that what happens is real. It's all in the interpretation. Either way, it's a great movie. It holds up well, forty years later, a tribute to its writer and director, Roman Polanski.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Awful things happen in every apartment house""","Rosemary's Baby was originally proposed as a project to Alfred Hitchcock. He turned it down, and instead it fell to the up-and-coming Polish director Roman Polanski. It's hard to imagine what the master of suspense would have made out of this tale of devil worship and Catholic guilt, even though there is some Hitchockian psychology and mystery at work. As it was however, it proved to be right up the young Polanski's street, taking his career to new heights, and spawning a run of occult horrors in the late 60s and early 70s, of which this is still one of the few greats.Polanski had already established himself as a director most comfortable with the confinement of interiors in films like Repulsion (1965). Here he draws us right into the claustrophobic feel of the upstairs apartment, often placing the camera in a room adjacent to the action, with the characters viewed through a doorway. The camera movement is mostly restricted to pans. It rarely tracks or dollys, as if it were trapped in a corner. Even in the exterior scenes the sky is often sandwiched or blotted out altogether between the buildings rising on either side. The actors often appear uncomfortably close to the camera, but not in individual close-up shots. Instead, they come in that close as they move around the set and the camera pans back and forth. Not only does this add to the cramped, awkward atmosphere, but this constantly changing distancing of actors within a single shots makes the audience feel as if they are actually standing there.Rosemary's Baby may come across as very slow to some viewers. 140 minutes certainly is a long time in the horror genre. There do also appear to be a lot of unnecessary details in the dialogue  we get to find out far more about Rosemary's background than is normal for a character in cinema. But for one thing, Polanski was not interested in making a shock-and-gore horror  Rosemary's Baby is all about the eerie atmosphere, the tension and the mystery. He holds our attention by regularly dropping in clues that something sinister is afoot. Furthermore, all the detail and depth has its significance in the finished product  like the references to Rosemary's Catholic upbringing or the background of the Castavets.Polanski has never overused flashy techniques  no fast editing, zooms or unusual angles that make for a very obvious directorial style. But there is always great complexity and meaning in the look of things  the set design, lighting, costume and so on. One of my favourite touches is Mia Farrow's extremely short Vidal Sassoon hairdo that she has done halfway through the film. With her bony features and pale skin she more and more begins to resemble a skeleton, especially under the carefully placed lighting in the scene after the party when she realises the pain has gone. It's simple yet significant ideas like that which make Polanski one of the best directors of his era.There's some great casting in this picture. Careful choice of character actors makes for some quirky supporting roles. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are perfect in the lead roles. The musical score  that haunting opening melody, or the atonal violin squeaks  all add to the atmosphere.Rosemary's Baby is a real landmark in horror. It helped keep the genre alive by pushing the occult - something fairly taboo, and not fully explored in cinema since the days of silents - to the fore. Also the restrained atmospheric horror was doubtless influential, particularly on Kubrick when he came to make The Shining. It inspired a lot, but was rarely bettered.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the ultimate horror classics,"Every bit of acclaim that Rosemary's Baby has earned is totally deserved. The Dakota, located at 72nd and Central Park West, is the perfect setting for the demonic events; all that rich Gothic detail in the heart of Manhattan provides the perfect atmosphere, serving as a dark fairy-tale world of its own within the modern setting. Roman Polanski knows this and utilizes it brilliantly, opening the film with stunning aerial shots of the skyline and focusing in on the ornate castle amongst the skyscrapers and tenements.The acting is fantastic, particularly Mia Farrow, who is the only person I can envision as Rosemary. Her fine-boned fragility makes her the ideal target for terror. She goes from obliviousness to suspicion to fear to near madness without showing a seam, and we as the audience are with her all the way. And Mia is given a run for her money by the delightful Ruth Gordon, a comical yet sinister presence popping in on a deliberate schedule with pale green drinks and sandpapery advice. She's scary because we know her--a batty old broad with a seemingly sweet nature beneath her caustic surface. That such a person could possibly be a vessel of evil is a thoroughly unnerving concept.Unnerving is the proper adjective for the entire movie. Unnerving, eerie, and penetratingly frightening in a very subtle manner. The subtlety is key, since a more explicit treatment would've spoiled everything. As the tension heightens, we feel what Rosemary feels: Curiosity, then vague suspicion, then paralyzing terror at the final revelation. At all times, the movie retains its dignity, from the opening and closing shots of the building to the flourishing title script to the beautiful music. Even on TV, this picture can chill you to the bone. The best big-budget horror movie of all time.",,Anonymous,Horror
Polanski's Baby,"When people talk about perfect films I don't actually know what they mean. Perfect for whom? Perfect compared to what? I think that perfection is in the brain and heart of the beholder. ""Rosemary's baby"" is a perfect film to me. Scary in a way that makes you breathless. You're thinking and feeling throughout the film. One of the many sides of Polanski's genius is to suggest. And what he suggest is so monstrous that we don't want to believe it, but we do. The characters are so perfectly drawn that there is no cheating involved. John Cassavettes's superb study in selfishness and egomaniacal frustration is so real that comes to no surprise that he could do what he does to advance his career, but we are surprised, we're horrified. The spectacular Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are not Deborah Kerr and David Niven, are they? So that they turn out to be what they turn out to be is totally believable, but Polanski presents it in such a light of normality that you can't believe it. Mia Farrow's predicament is as classic as the boy who cried wolf tale and yet, as told by Roman Polanski in the wonderful face of Mia Farrow, is as if we're hearing it, seeing it and living it for the first time. Every silence, every voice in the distance, every door opening. Your heart is always in your throat. There is something there that accelerates a constant state of dread. Very few movies have been able to take me to that place, most of them by Roman Polanski, what about ""The Tenant"" or ""Repulsion""? Other movies that come to mind: David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" and Martin Donovan's ""Apartment Zero"" But ""Rosemary's baby"" stands alone as a terrifying masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Flawless Horror Masterpiece,"Rosemary, in Mia Farrow's performance, is so immediately recognizable that everything that happens to her, happens to us. Her explanation to Dr Hill (Charles Grodin) about the absurdity she's at the center of, is so brilliantly written that she becomes more than just one of us, she becomes us in all the depth of our unspoken fears. To see this film in 2007 is really amazing. Perfection! And that for our benefit. Polanski is not one of those directors who concocts camera tricks to feed his own ego. Everything is at the service of the story. John Cassavettes is a scarily convincing weakling with an ambition bigger than his talent. Ruth Gordon got, what I, in my modest opinion, consider one of the most deserving Oscars in the history of the Oscars. Her performance is beyond superb. Okay, I'm running out of superlatives but let me finish with one more...Roman Polanski is the greatest.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not The Classic ""Horror"" Movie You Might Expect - More Of A Psychological Mystery","This movie is a classic, and 50 years old, and yet strangely enough I had never watched it until now. And, to be honest, it wasn't really what I was expecting it to be. I had the impression that ""Rosemary's Baby"" was more of a straight horror/thriller type of movie. Instead what I found was more of a suspense/mystery type of story. I didn't find there to be anything particularly frightening in it. It was more mysterious, and for me the question hanging over the whole story was whether any of what Rosemary came to believe was real or if it was just a figment of her imagination. I'll give credit to Roman Polanski, who both directed this and wrote the screenplay - there are plenty of scenes and events in this movie that add to that uncertainty. Things happened or would be said that maybe at first seemed innocent, but as they added up I could see how they began to appear suspicious to Rosemary. But there's also enough going on that causes you to think - ""No - this is just Rosemary's imagination going wild."" So, although I have to confess that at first I was struggling with this just a bit (probably because it was so unlike what I was expecting) after a while I became quite fixed on the story. Once you're into it (even if you have to struggle a bit with the beginning) you have to see it through to the end. And I will say this about the ending (which I won't give away) - I don't think the resolution was as clear as some make it out to be. I was still left thinking that what was happening could be real - or maybe was still in Rosemary's mind. If I could hazard a guess I'd say that the intent was that what Rosemary believed turned out to be true, but it just wasn't crystal clear to me.I had mixed reactions to the performances in this. No one really came across to me as outstanding - this in spite of the fact that Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Minnie Castevet - Rosemary and Guy's annoying neighbour. I truly did find the character annoying - which perhaps does say that Gordon pulled off the part perfectly, but my reaction to the character perhaps clouded my appreciation of Gordon's performance. I would say that if you wanted to make a movie that in some way features Satan, you could do worse than simply have a young couple move in to a new place who then have to put up with Minnie and Roman as their neighbours. ""Neighbours From Hell"" you could call it, even without a supernatural angle! As for Mia Farrow as Rosemary - she grew on me over the course of the picture. At first she seemed a bit wooden for lack of a better word, but I thought she did a good job of portraying Rosemary's ""evolution"" as she begins to suspect that something evil was going on.This was OK. Once I adjusted my expectations of it - after realizing that it wasn't going to be the traditional horror movie I was expecting - it managed to draw me in. I would say that I think it's perhaps a little bit over-rated, and if you are looking for a traditional horror/thriller type of movie, this is going to be a disappointment. It doesn't have many traditional frights involved with it and it's a little bit slow paced at times. It's a psychological thriller at best; more akin to a mystery than anything. As long as you keep that in mind, it's enjoyable enough. But don't expect to be scared out of your wits, or even to jump or be particularly startled by anything. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reassuring to fine it's every bit as good as its staunchest champions would have you believe,"Why aren't the horror directors of today as careful with their scripts as Polanski was?  Not that this is really horror.  Horror as we know it came into being with the slasher flicks of the late 1970s and early 1980s; ""Rosemary's Baby"" is rather the kind of thing that the term ""dark fantasy"" was coined to describe, by people of taste who noticed that the word ""horror"" promised audiences something distinctly unpleasant and nasty.The film's construction is marvellous.  Things start slow - one beat, so to speak, to a bar - and gradually pick up speed so that by the end we are nervously tapping out semiquavers with our feet.  Polanski also understands the gentle art of hint-dropping.  Many events are filed away as tiny puzzles to be solved later, and they ARE solved later; others we don't attach any particular significance to at the time Polanski invites us to re-interpret in retrospect, AND chooses the right moment to let us do so.  And then, at the end, AFTER we've worked everything out, he presents us with a surprise - a delightful, gratuitous twist which nothing had prepared us for, which we couldn't have guessed, yet which doesn't cancel out the story as we'd understood it.  (Alas, many people know what this surprise is in advance. I, for one.  Yet this foreknowledge did nothing to spoil my enjoyment: a sure sign of superb construction.)All in all, a film that tempts you to rank it with the best ever made - which is more, but not much more, than it deserves - simply because it's perfect.  Everything went right.  Rosemary is a wonderfully sympathetic heroine, powerless without being passive, largely ignorant of what's going on around her without being at all stupid, and Mia Farrow makes you care deeply about her.  The cinematography is pellucid; the art direction is subtly right; there's also a fine, odd yet tuneful, musical score.  I can't believe I waited so long to see this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Staple Horror Film,"A great Polanski film, especially for his first American one. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a classic movie for the genre, and has created a story for horror movies to leech from for decades. Mia Farrow is outstanding in her performance as Rosemary, seeming completely genuine in the role; the film is ripe with great supporting cast members. Eerie music that rises and falls with the scenes creates a perfect tension that fills out the 'scary' aspects when nothing truly frightening is happening; a great touch that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the piece. A fan of the genre may not appreciate the film as much because of a lack of true gore, which seems to be all too common in movies now, but the way that ""Rosemary's Baby"" was shot is well-crafted, and well-suited to horror; Polanski helps add himself to a list of horror fore-fathers with this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Landmark Horror film,"""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of the best horror films ever made.  This isn't because it's going to scare the pants off you with a series of sensational jolts.  This isn't the shallow, gimmicky kind of horror movie we mostly get these days, and it isn't the traditional old-fashioned horror film of an earlier era.  This is a movie that came out during a period of transition in Hollywood.  The old production codes were breaking down and films could suddenly be more true to life in the way they showed how people really lived, acted and talked.  1968s ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a more sophisticated, less elegant thriller of the kind that Alfred Hitchcock patented, but it displays much more class and intelligence than the horror movies that would come out in its wake.  Popular '70s films such as ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" are the prodigy of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but offer far less nuance and much greater vulgarity.  What we get here is a more naturalistic depiction of modern life, but without the crassness that would soon explode into American cinema.Most of the credit for what makes ""Rosemary's Baby"" such a successful film goes to Roman Polanski.  Polanski is a master at conveying to an audience not just a sense of the uncanny but a vivid depiction of it.  His earlier films like ""Knife in the Water,"" ""Repulsion"" and ""Dance of the Vampires,"" display the talents that would come to such a controlled mastery in ""Rosemary's Baby.""Polanski very faithfully adapts Ira Levin's novel to the screen so that the viewer is, just as the reader was, free to interpret the eerie events of the story as either reality or a depiction of an isolated woman's decent into madness.  At the same time the picture can be taken as a black joke on the human male's fears of the changes a woman goes through during pregnancy, both physically and emotionally.  But Polanski seems most interested in presenting a normal world, in this case Manhattan in the mid 1960s, and then through subtle cinematic techniques get an audience to actually believe that the hysterical, fantastic ravings of the heroine could be true.  It is this tour de force exercise in suspension of disbelief that makes the film a classic.  The horror films that have come since have had to ratchet up the shock effects in order to thrill more desensitized audiences, but this deliberately paced film reminds us of how much better it is to leave things to the imagination of the viewer.  That is where films really come alive and remain so.The Paramount DVD presents an excellent print of the movie that looks as if it were shot yesterday, along with extras that include new interviews with Polanski, executive producer Bob Evans and production designer Richard Sylbert, and a featurette from the time of the film's original release that really works as a good time capsule.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Fight,"Polanski successfully sets the tone right from the beginning as the strange and somewhat scary lullaby plays as the opening credits appear. In the background we see Rosemary's neighborhood while the focus is on her window. This tone is maintained throughout the entire film. The film is quite well executed. Polanski creates a gloomy, isolated and chilling mood. 'Rosemary's Baby' is a horror film but unlike most movies of this genre, this one is very subtle and is more dependent on the atmosphere rather than the 'horror creatures'. It is only in the excellently executed nightmare sequence, which is comprised of fragments of scenes, that one witnesses something 'out of the ordinary'. I was initially dissatisfied by the ending but after some thought, I couldn't think of a better more effective conclusion. The ending itself is so spine-chilling and makes the movie experience more horrifying. The haunting lullaby replays in the end capturing that moment of horror like a photographic memory. The cast does a fine job though clearly this is Farrow's film. Mia Farrow is spellbinding. The way she captures Rosemary's kindness, agony, anguish, fragility and courage is noteworthy. She is simply amazing to watch. I can understand why it is still so popular after 40 years. There has been hardly anything else like it.",,Anonymous,Horror
the best supernatural movie ever made?,"I'm not sure about that but Rosemary's baby has got to be one of the best, if not the best, psychological supernatural thrillers ever made. The real test of a good movie(or one of them) is can it hold up to multiple viewings? In this case-oh yes.I cannot even count how many times I have seen this. A good-really good-""scary movie"" must have more then the ability to merely scare, it must have the ability to haunt. Rosemary's baby is a movie where certain scenes become etched in memory. Movie as good as book which is almost a non existent thing.This is not a slow moving picture at all or at least I don't see it as one. What this movie does, as does another Levin creation, Stepford wives, is lure you in. There maybe moments that are not scary but as it goes on and you keep watching you start to get more and more creeped out-the atmosphere is what does it-even if someone were tuning in and didn't know this story already-the creepy feeling that something's very wrong is still there strongly from the beginning, strengthening in tone as you get deeper into the picture until by the end and the final few scenes your blown away.This is definitely more subtley and atmospherically creepy then a ""boo"" in your face scare fest like ""scream"". It is the type of movie you very rarely see anymore.If anyone, by chance has NOT seen it they are missing someone-I don't recall seeing this in the IMDb top 250-while I'm not sure I'd put it in my top 10, I still think this maybe should be there, in IMDb'S top 250, it's been an influence on so many other movies and so few movies have been able to follow the movie's lead in the same well done way.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Authentic Classic,"I forget exactly when I saw this movie but I will say this: I was a kid when I saw it, quite literally, maybe 9 or 10. My mom spoke very highly of this movie and actually sat down with me to watch it way back when. She told me a few things here and there while we were watching it but I wanted to see it for myself without absorbing the little hints that she was dropping to me. By the time the movie was done, I wanted to rewind it (yes, I watched it on video tape) and watch it again. It is definitely one of those movies that draws you in and never lets go. Ira Levin (may he rest in peace) knew what he was doing when he wrote the book to this. I highly recommend it to anyone, although it doesn't really matter what order you do it in, whether that's being watching it first and then reading it or reading it first and then watching it. Roman Polanski was a real master at terror and suspense back in the day, especially with this work of art.

rosemary's baby,"When I started to watch Rosemary's Baby, I thought it was an ordinary baby story. But it was not like that. As soon as you begin to watch, you feel that some mystic things will happen. Rosemary and Guy moved a new apartment where some bad things had happened. They wanted to have a baby.And also they had a strange neighbors. Two people both of them are old. Rosemary had a good relationship with them. But after a while Rosemary learned that she had a baby. She had a good doctor. But their strange neighbor suggest them a new doctor. Guy relied on them so he accepted this suggestion. After these things, Rosemary started to have strange dreams. Everything begins with these dreams that she was confused about that. In the end she had a strange baby who was called Satan by her neighbor and also her husband. It was a group that disobey and ignore the God. She wanted to save her baby from these bad people she understood their intention but it was too late. They had already captured her baby.Actually, the movie includes something mystic and horror. You feel terrible in some spot. I was affected by Rosemary's physical appearance and also her psychology. At some point you feel pity about her due to the fact that she did not look well. And another thing that was affected me is that when rosemary gave birth they put it in a black cradle. Whatever happened, she was a mother. When she saw it in a cradle she was sorry, she shake its cradle even if it was not a normal baby.Last but not least, nobody believed her and only one person believed her.Truth was much horrific.

"Terrifying; a timeless, paranoid classic","""Rosemary's Baby"" centers on Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes), a young couple who move into a New York City apartment building to start their life together. They become entwined with their elderly neighbors, Minnie and Roman Castevet (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer), an eccentric and friendly couple who are helpful if not a bit intrusive. When Rosemary becomes pregnant, her life soon takes a downward turn toward the demonic.Maybe one of the greatest stories of betrayal and paranoia to grace the silver screen, this adaptation from Levin's phenomenal novel is done neatly and the transfer to the screen is brilliant. The film, like the book, takes its time, but the slow-going nature gives plenty of room for formidable suspense and atmosphere.One of the scariest things about ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the intoxicating effect it has on the viewer. The paranoia, fear, claustrophobia, and foreboding that Rosemary feels channels directly to the audience, and you by proxy experience everything she is experiencing. The first forty-five minutes or so seem fairly conventional, but after that the film goes into a straight downward spiral into madness, and by God do you feel it. There's a consistent sense of something not being quite right, mainly with the neighbors whose motives are questionable behind their friendly facade, and this feeling never dissipates. Within the betrayal are the layers of subjects that make it a horror film- the Satanic society, the occult, strange rituals, the Antichrist, and an overall demonic subtext. The film looks amazing even today, boasting camerawork that is subtle and neat, but shaky and effective when needed. The settings are all truly spooky, and the Dakota is is photographed to its full Gothic effect.Mia Farrow stars in the performance of her career as the young, naive Rosemary. All she wants is the ideal life with her husband and child, but she is swept into something more terrifying than she could ever imagine. Farrow plays the part precisely and gains plenty of sympathy from the audience. Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Woodhouse's nosy neighbor, Minnie. She's friendly and inquisitive, but we know from the start that she has ulterior motives, as well as her husband. John Cassavettes plays Guy excellently, and Sidney Blackmer is great as well as Minnie's odd husband.As for the ending, it's a shocker, and probably the most memorable thing about the entire movie. It's something that will stick with you and that you can't easily shake, but is ambiguous enough to keep you asking questions.Overall, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a through-and-through classic. While it isn't 'scary' by conventional means, it manages to maintain a subtle, foreboding atmosphere, unnerving the audience to the point of paranoia. The performances are top-notch, and the subject matter is as shuddering as the Castevet's dark, evil intrusion into Rosemary's life. You'll spend an uncomfortable but spellbinding two hours on the edge of your seat. Isn't that what a good horror movie should do? 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

But as is sometimes the case, the characters I imagined in the book were nothing like those that were cast.

I didn't go into it expecting to be creeped out or scared, but I expected there to be a little more atmospheric creepiness.The basement was well-lit and not intimidating. The satanists were laughable. The dialogue felt rushed and unnatural for 80% of the movie.

This movie messes with your mind. It's so well told and acted, you can help but get into it and it still scares the hell out of me. Every time. This movie is pure psychological terror. I have never seen a film that made me think so much after it was over, I guess that's my it gave me nightmares. I am a horror fan, but this film is beyond horror, its a mind screw. Polanski got it right, to almost perfection. For cinema lovers, just watch it and love it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I can't hear you...you're in Dubrovnik.""","Mia Farrow is the ultimate innocent as Rosemary Woodhouse, a character you feel connected to and care about from the film's start. Guy Woodhouse, her husband played by John Cassavetes, is a struggling actor trying to make his mark with support from his loving wife.The characterisation and atmosphere are particularly effective. Rosemary and Guy's shared goals, desires, and friendships are showcased as they relocate to their dream New York apartment, and the connection is displayed to us with their flirty and familiar dialogue and a background that isn't rushed. It is clear that Rosemary longs to be a mother, and the joy the couple feel when her pregnancy is announced is not without a sense of foreboding. Consequently, Guy's acting credentials are climbing, his ego alongside, touching on the old idiom 'sold my soul to the devil"".The aged but stylish apartment setting adds to the underlying claustrophobia felt throughout the film, not to mention the overbearing neighbours they have bonded with way too quickly. The Castevets, so effectively played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, insert themselves into the couple's lives with a distinct lack of boundaries. Guy's increasing insistence that the neighbours are to be trusted contrasts with Rosemary's growing suspicion that they are not what they seem. As viewers, we know something awful is coming.Rosemary's Baby is a film about motherhood and trusting that gut feeling (which is arguably even stronger in new mothers). Rosemary is consistently uneasy with the events happening to her, but you can practically see her making those tiny decisions to ignore her intuition and be polite. It's a film ahead of its time, capturing the dismissal of women's problems in the medical field and reducing an entire gender's feelings and pain to ""hysteria"". The gaslighting from people Rosemary should be able to trust makes you want to scream at the screen, which only builds as the events unfold. Her paranoia, frustration, and panic are strongly felt along with the final terror when the pieces fit together.One of the scarier things about this movie is that you can imagine it happening. Roman Polanski creates such an authentic but creepy atmosphere, that you can't look away from it for a second as much as you might want to. Some may say the movie is a slow burn -viewers agree it's a slow burn in the best way. If you're looking for fast action and thrills with your horror, this isn't for you, it is purely psychological.One of the most influential horror predecessors based on the popular novel by Ira Levin, Rosemary's Baby started the demonic theme nicely before iconic films from the next decade such as The Omen and The Exorcist. A more recent addition to the genre, Late Night with the Devil, also touches on the theme of success and the price one has to pay for it (even at the expense of loved ones). Die-hard horror fans agree this movie is a must-see and will not disappoint psychological horror enthusiasts.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Neurosis,First time i've watched this horror classic right through and i'm glad i did. This is the first of the big Devil inspired films. Next the great The Exorcist. Then The Omen etc. But i don't see this as a supernatural story. I see it as a film about a young woman having mental problems over her first pregnancy. Mia does it so well. It's like watching a documentary. Thank god for 60's minis too. She has great pins. She was only 22 when she was in this but she is brilliant. Everyone is. Polanski for all his faults does a great job directing. The dream sequences are manic. I shall watch this one again. Not just for Ms. Farrow's legs.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""This is no dream! This is really happening!""","Rosemary's Baby stands as a cinematic masterpiece that not only defines the horror genre but also marks a golden era for cult classics. The film's footage, style, and setting are alluring, capturing the essence of a bygone era that remains irreplaceable.Describing it as the traditional term 'classic' or even 'masterpiece' falls short of truly encapsulating the brilliance of Rosemary's Baby. It goes beyond that-it defines cinema, laying the foundations that countless films, stories, and video games have drawn inspiration from.The film's drug-induced rape scene which will have raised eyebrows in 1968, but It's the sheer brush off from other characters which raised mine. Adding the portrayal of the peculiar, nosy, and intrusive neighbours sets the stage for the secrecies that follow including the occult that continue to pursue the unsuspecting Rosemary.Guy's knowledge and haunting confession to Rosemary in the morning that he had slept with her, while she was unconscious was malevolent on so many levels, and I was left mouth agape, that she didn't react with more resistance but perhaps this was more shockingly appropriate for married couples or Stepford wives in those times.Simplicity becomes the beauty of Rosemary's Baby. The heart of the story revolves around a couple moving into a New York apartment, wanting to start a family, and the husband pursing his acting dream, showcasing a slow, but character driven buildup. The Bramford where the couple have found their new home becomes its own character-a beautifully creepy and complex entity with a dark, and morbid history. The cinematography heightens this in some gorgeous scenes, revealing a city that is both eerily beautiful and unsettling.Mia Farrow's portrayal of Rosemary is the film's guiding light. Her childlike innocence resonates deeply with the audience, despite frustrations with her decisions and her unknowing trust in her obnoxious and self-centred husband. Farrow's performance is utterly enchanting, deserving of the nomination she received for best actress.Roman and Minnie, (Sidney Blackmer & Ruth Gordon) played despicably but haunting characters the audience loves to despise. Sinister individuals tempting their religion or satanic witchcraft on unknowing victims. Concepts like Tannis Root, a mind-controlling drug, are introduced but not extensively explored, and could have been given more time to flourish.Questions linger, such as why the coven lacks children or families of their own. The horror in Rosemary's Baby doesn't stem from overtly terrifying elements; instead, it emanates from the foreboding atmosphere that something is very, very wrong. And the slow but ominous buildup engages us with a constant sense of unease, and concern about the likely harm to Rosemary and her baby.The character of Guy, Rosemary's husband, emerges as one of the most despicable men on screen. Clearly noted as self-centred and callous, he adds a layer of horror beyond traditional movie villains, making his presence deeply distressing. I for one despised his lines, his attitude, and having to see his face, not to mention his outrageous and his toxic attitude towards his wife.Rosemary's Baby is an emotional journey through a timeless classic. From the very beginning you are caught in a stupor from Mia Farrow's alluring lullaby. Watching it over five decades after its release, the film's suspenseful storytelling continues to grip the imagination, offering a nostalgic exploration into the enduring art of captivating storytelling.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

He fell asleep and anytime that he woke up, he kept telling me that this is the slowest movie that he had ever seen. i have to admit, it was a real slow movie but does that really matter? i don't think so... not if the story is compelling. The problem here is not that the movie is boring or slow. the problem is that people compare it to movies that are coming out today. In a world of high speed chases and incredible special effect its no wonder that people think that this movie is slow or boring. people just don't have patience for slower movies. one thing is for sure, this is a very good movie.one thing i gotta say Mia Farrow was HOT. i give the move a solid 8/10 and i give Mia Farrow a very solid 10/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A dark jewel of-a-movie in the Age of Aquarius's occult crown,"What does it mean to give a movie 10/10? It must mean that no part of the film could possibly(!) be better: the characters must be three-dimensional and engage the viewer (whether it be sympathetic or antagonistic); the performances must then bring these characters to life; the script must carry the plot without stale verbiage or cliché; the story itself must be believable or, in the case of horror or science fiction, create the conditions wherein the story can be seen as believable; the editing must make it not a scene too long nor a scene too short; the music must beand you get the point, right? On each of these points, as well as any other you care to mention, 'Rosemary's Baby' easily qualifies.Having established himself as an up-and-coming European director in the 1960s with the likes of his debut 'Knife in the Water' (1962), Roman Polanski was brought to America to direct this horror movie about a secret society of Devil worshippers composed of wealthy and distinguished citizens manipulating a young woman into giving birth to the child of Satan in late-60's New York. The film is the second part of Polanski's so-called ""apartment trilogy"" (the other parts being 'Repulsion (1965)' and 'The Tenant' (1976)) and as such begins with a shot of the Bramford apartment building (in reality the Dakota building which would later be the building John Lennon was shot in front of) which struggling actor Guy Woodhouse (Cassavetes) and his beautiful young wife Rosemary (Farrow) manage to bag a sizable apartment in. Despite being regaled with macabre stories of the history of the ""Black Bramford"" from their previous landlord/paternal figure Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins the couple move in to begin their new life and soon strike up a relationship with an elderly couple, Minnie (Gordan) and Roman Castevet (Blackmer), after a young drug addict in their care kills herself. Not long after (and with the ""help"" of a dizzying dream/nightmare sequence which is far more authentic than the famed Dali sequence in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound') Rosemary becomes pregnantbut her jubilation is short-lived and soon transforms into a disturbing paranoid nightmare.For a horror film it is refreshingly free of gore or ridiculous ""jump-moments"", and instead slowly chills the viewer through an atmosphere which becomes increasingly unnerving and claustrophobic as Rosemary discovers various clues which suggest that the Castevets may be involved in the darkest of dealings, and may have lured Guy into their ranks. However, the film perfectly walks the line between suggesting an actual conspiracy (supernatural or otherwise) and a hysterical paranoid fantasy on Rosemary's part which is surely a testament to the fine performances of every one of the cast. A particular joy of the film are the countless ""Oh yeah"" moments you get from corroborating, upon repeat viewings, observations made by Rosemary like the mismatched paintings on the walls of the Castevets' apartment when they first visit, or that Guy is still wearing his make-up when he returns home unexpectedly early to disrupt Hutch's visit, all of which contribute to Rosemary suspecting that something is afoot. These subtle psychological ploys unsettle the viewer as they suggest things which we are prone to miss despite being in plain sight and effectively conjures an atmosphere rooted in the familiar but where disturbing figures may be watching from the periphery.A year later, Polanki's wife Sharon Tate would star in the role which would earn her pop-culture immortality: a butchered victim of Charles Manson's family. As such, with its explicit occult themes (although Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey's involvement as a consultant and the figure of the Devil in the dream sequence has been shown to be false) and its exultant subversion of Nietzsche's ""God is Dead!"" the film could be seen as an eerie prophecy of the darker vein inherent in the flower-power ideology which ended so abruptly with the Tate-LaBianca slayingsand the post-script of which would be with Lennon's murder outside the BramfoDakota building. Polanski himself would go on to secure his Hollywood A-List status with 'Chinatown' (1974) and 'The Pianist' (2002), but how can one's career improve upon a movie genuinely worthy of 10/10?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A masterpiece of mood,"Like ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a horror film that is so justifiably praised that it's a pretty futile effort to attempt to find something that hasn't been said about it before, and better. Until recently, it had been many years since I'd seen the film, and upon revisiting it (with a newfound appreciation for director Roman Polanski), was thoroughly impressed.The story is simple and ingenious, and hooks us from the start: Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her actor husband, Guy (John Cassavetes) move into an upscale New York apartment complex attract the attention of their kind yet invasive neighbors; shortly after, Rosemary becomes pregnant and grows increasingly concerned that the residents are plotting against her. Polanski would revisit this type of paranoia (albeit through male eyes) in ""The Tenant""; ""Rosemary's Baby"" takes a similarly subjective approach to the story, telling it largely through the perspective of the title character--and Mia Farrow is incredibly good at conveying pain, sorrow, fear, and submission.In addition to structuring suspense well, Polanski also gives the film a sense of patriarchal commentary: the husband is cunning, cocky, self-centered, and manipulative; ditto the loathsome Dr. Saperstien (Ralph Bellamy) who insists that Rosemary stop reading books that might cause worry. Throughout the film, Rosemary is presented as a passive, soft-spoken wallflower, easily put in her place by the male figures in her life; even when she uncovers the conspiracy around her, everyone is so firmly pitted against her that her efforts become meaningless in the face of the inevitable. Polanski makes us pity Rosemary and loathe the occult conspirators, but gives us a conclusion that drips of irony from all angles--in a sense, a great injustice is perpetrated, then accepted.With ""Rosemary's Baby,"" Polanski delivers a masterpiece of mood and subtle scares without a reliance on blood and guts. Strong performances and a fine story contribute to making this a gem of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Different idea about the film,"Actually, after thinking about this movie a bit more, I tend to think that this subject has absolutely nothing to do with Satan or devil worshipers. Repeatedly we are remind that Rosemary's due date is June 28 This date so coincides with the beginning of the First World War that I often wonder if that was what the author of the book had in mind. If there was one day in human history that marked a sudden and irreversible change, I would have to pick June 28, 1914Suddenly the world powers of the day begin to arm and arm heavily as they prepared to do battle. This marked the up swing in war technologies on an unimaginable scale. Airplanes were introduced, machine-guns, armored vehicles, giant battle ships and of course chemical warfare. Trench warfare and ""no man's land"", we are reminded through Hollywood and even my own grandfather, was indeed hell on earth. Soon after royal governments ceased to exist as a new idea was born. The Tsar was disposed soon after as well as the Kaiser at the end of the war. This would not be the end of weapon research nor global atrocities on civilian populations. In less than 20 years a new idea blossomed as Fascism took hold of Italy, Germany and Japan. The end results of the Second World War need not be discussed here.So that is my slant on an otherwise interesting thought provoking film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Movies Ever,"It should come as no surprise that ""Rosemary's Baby"" ranks in the top 250 on IMDb; I, however, would rank it even higher than the general public does. It's the kind of film you can watch occasionally over the years and enjoy each and every time, i.e., a classic. Technically the film is brilliant, with superb cinematography, editing, music, acting, art design, and masterful direction. Polanski captures the timeless essence of New York, at least as I remember it, even though the setting is unmistakably the 1960s, and the milieu is literally diabolical. Depending on how you look at it, you can enjoy the film as a supernatural thriller or as a psychological thriller and study in paranoia. I especially love the dream sequences, which have a surreal beauty and nightmarish logic of their own.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very scary film,"God and Satan make for great subjects for horror films.  The reason for that is because we know so little about either of them.  Sure we have what the Bible says, but that is all just theory.  If the Bible is real, I don't believe that God would truly tell us, one of his creations, how powerful he is and I certainly don't think he would tell us how powerful his arch enemy, Satan, is. So when we see movies about Michael Myers and Jason and Freddy, sometimes the later sequels try to explain their superiority with Satanic possession.  After all, what other reason would there be for these beings to be so evil?  That is what makes Rosemary's Baby so frightening.  The fear of the unknown.  To be possessed by the devil is scary, to be impregnated by the devil is dire.Mia Farrow is great in this film, Cassavettes is very good as well but it is Gordon that is the epitome of fear.  She hits every note perfectly and her smile gives me the creeps.  And say nothing of Polanski.  This film came out before TCM.  And it really shows his love of the camera because he uses it like it was his best friend here.  His filming of the dream sequence and the rape was as good as any scene filmed before the early 80's.  And this was a true crystal ball into how good Texas Chainsaw was going to be.Rosemary's Baby is what horror movies are all about.  It has great atmosphere, haunting lighting and a very spooky score.  And on one final side note, I think there is one movie character that comes to mind when I think of what the devil could have looked like as a man.  If you have never seen the film Angel Heart, check it out.  DeNiro's turn as Louise Cypher is priceless and he almost seems like it was him that was the one who was haunting everyone in Rosemary's Baby.A great film.  Much better than most 90's horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Welcome to the Bramford: Don't eat the mousse,"Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), based on Ira Levin's bestselling novel, which Polanski also adapted, is less remarkable today for its horror than for its matter-of-fact realism.Originally a project producer William Castle intended to direct, it was wisely handed over to Polanski for his American directorial debut (Castle makes a significant cameo appearance outside a phone booth). Setting the action in upper east-side Manhattan, specifically inside the legendary Dakota (aka Bramford), as in the novel, and using interiors recreated to Levin's specifications, Polanski does something unexpected for a horror movie: he opens it in bright daylight, yet underscores with an eerie lullaby sung wordlessly by Mia Farrow's Rosemary (the composer is Christopher Komeda who a year earlier had scored Polanski's ""Dance of the Vampires""). From the moment the camera settles on the Bramford, everything it sees (mostly from Rosemary's perspective) is off kilter a bit: the framing unbalanced, the shots disjointed, like the elevator that misses the floor. Dialogue seems a bit off, too. And the characters are especially off (Ruth Gordon!), eventually also Rosemary's husband (John Cassavetes). You can't quite put your finger on it, but neither can Rosemary. Her revelation comes gradually.Mia Farrow is a revelation here. Her total commitment to the role is extraordinary: from getting her hair shorn to appearing nude in key scenes--eating raw chicken livers, having blood drawn, and walking into New York City traffic (Polanski could not secure permission in time to film the scene, so he shot on the fly, telling Farrow to walk into the traffic: ""No one is going to run down a pregnant woman""). She is in nearly every frame as the narrative unfolds from her P. O. V--the gradual progression of Rosemary's consciousness is remarkable--you can't take your eyes off her. It's hard to imagine the film without Farrow. Polanski's first choice was Tuesday Weld, but Paramount wanted someone better known to TV viewers, and ""Peyton Place,"" in which Farrow costarred, was a popular hit at the time. But her casting was good for the film in another way. Polanski wanted to populate it with Hollywood veterans, most of them as the devil worshipers who befriend Rosemary, actors familiar to Americans and the least suspect. Since Farrow was raised in Hollywood, the daughter of two such veterans, John Farrow and Maureen O'Sullivan, the casting made perfect sense, as some of these actors she knew from her childhood: Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer, Maurice Evans, Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, Elisha Cook Jr., Phil Leeds, Patricia O'Neal (Ryan's mother), Walter Baldwin, Almira Sessions, Mona Knox, and Hope Summers (Clara Edwards from ""The Andy Griffith Show""). The cast also includes a very young Charles Grodin, who nicely plays his cards close to the vest as Dr. Hill--also Emmaline Henry, Hanna Landry, D'Uville Martin (later of ""Dolemite"" fame), and, as the voice of Donald Baumgart, Tony Curtis.Once the camera has descended on the gothic facade of the Dakota (itself out-of-place and strange), until it finally withdraws at the end, Polanski--and Levin too--have made the unsettling point that no one can ever truly know what goes on behind walls, inside private spaces, in a bustling city, in the middle of the day. That's the real horror.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It is impossible to explain the feelings i have for this movie, but I'll try.","To Preface:
Roman Polanski, a disturbed, sickening human being who is essentially the poster child for Hollywood's corrupted blindness of children's welfare. Once began as an empowering and invigorating story of holocaust survivor, to an influential powerful artist, then became ""The one director who shall not be named"". I need this out of the way due the Immense aroma surrounding his works. So just to Preface, The artwork is not the artist.The Formal Review:
An ungodly, superficial, project on the raging phenomenon of Satan In the Christian dominated, cold war era, America. It Capitalizes on the fear of occult's and, in turn Refuses the ""Thou shalt love thy neighbor"" argument. If anything being too open to the neighbor might just let the infamous fallen angel in. The age of this movie might've been a problem, as we have grown, and no longer have a reigning suspicion of our neighbors being occultist. But the the idea isn't completely gone, if anything the paranoia has become Deeper, subtler within our subconscious. I think that's why this movie stuck with me. As Rosemary submits herself into this middle class, predictable housewife, position, the consequences start ripping the seams. Her body, soul, and mind have all been compromised by everyone around her. Her body to her husband, her soul to her neighbors, and her mind... well that's to be determined. She is used, abused, and manipulated. Every aspect of how she talks all the way to how she cuts her hair is controlled to appease the sick. The frantic pacing helps this increasingly stressful tone. Simple gestures are quick, and sharp tapping into your already paranoid subconscious... Something is wrong, but you don't know what it is. The movie tackles the one thing considered sacred in our culture, children. It abuses you with ideas of a corrupted child, and unsettles you with a seemingly familiar scenario, family. Its slow and painful. Angers you in a hopeless vegetative state. You are to sit there and watch her lose the only thing anyone wants in this world control. Horror movies that force you to think are all indebted to this landmark film...10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The horror of childbirth,"One of Roman Polanski's most well-known films and a considered to be a mid-century horror masterpiece. And for a reason. Rosemary's Baby knows exactly how to build horror, tension and how to unsettle and exploit the deepest fears within our collective psyche. Just like The Exorcist five years later, it knows exactly where to strike: our progeny.The directing and the atmosphere are all thanks to Polanski, but a lot of the film's excellence is due to the chillingly good performance from Mia Farrow, playing the role of Rosemary. She's extremely likable and adorable from the very first scene she's in, making the audience cringe that much harder when the eventual horrible things start happening to her. She also portrays the confused terror of not knowing what's going on with her pregnancy extremely well and exactly like a real person would react. Granted, the way she eventually starts to unravel the mystery is a bit coincidental, but that's the fault of the script, and she does her very best to sell it to you.What I also like about the film is that it doesn't take itself one hundred percent seriously. There are some lighter touches and the film freely nods when the plot starts to become a bit over the top. Which it does, especially near the end, but the film's honesty saves a lot. Another thing about the film is that like many movies of its time, it's a bit slow. In horror that works better than in most films because the atmosphere has that much more time to build, but it'd still be very easy to cut fifteen to thirty minutes away without affecting much. It doesn't ruin the film, really, but it's something that's different to modern films.All in all Rosemary's Baby is a strong horror piece that has left a lasting impact on its genre. Definitely worth a watch if you like Polanski's style and/or horror in general.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Turbulent Tale of a Horror Pregnancy with the Devils Child,"Wow, it's completely mental what Roman Polanski and Mia Farrow did with this film. I find Rosemary's baby an inspired piece that provides such an experience that I'd argue that I enjoyed my second watch more than my first. As one of Roman Polanski's best films, it's known as a classic, It also has a significant monopoly on the pregnancy horror genre and it is quite influential.I find the horror of this experience is unique as it is not in the passing scares but in the terror of ot all. The horror isn't not knowing, but knowing deep down this is wrong and it's terrifying. You may not know what they're saying is true or if they lying there may no means of knowing how deep their web of lies goes. Rosemary's whole experience screams, ""This is wrong, I'm not okay, get me out of here,"" and she does eventually reach that breaking point. I'd say that Roman (despite his own transgressions) captures this experience and truly puts you on the side of the woman who's going through this. Even if pregnancy and a woman say over such is a very feminist angle.The acting and directing is superb getting excellent critical recognition and was nominated for a few oscars, even if it was ultimately shafted in that area. Mia Farrow's performance can not be undersated as she does so much in this. She is so docile at the beginning, but we truly see her deteriorate. Also, it's just a very rewarding film if you pay attention to the performances and what's going on. So many little things from early can come back later into play. Aside from tough topics like sexaul assault and excessive gasslighting, this film would be an easy recommendation to anyone who can give it the like of day.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two of the shots in this film were equally disturbing and uproarious- the film stands as one of Polanski's crowning thrillers,"Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby was adapted by Polish director Roman Polanski, who in his American directing debut, created a horror film that contained no gore, practically no blood, no characters with knives and other weapons. Just the feeling of constant dredd and confusion over the fate of a woman's child.  Mia Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse, wife of a struggling actor, who finds a new apartment in New York called the Dakota.  Here, they meet some neighbors (one of which is the impecable, Oscar winning Ruth Gordon) who befriend them, invite themselves over whenever, and even bring food as gifts.  Rosemary and her husband, played by director John Cassavettes, think about having a baby, but aren't sure if the time is right.  Then one night, after having a drink that the ""friendly"" neighbor brings over, they make love to concieve, though that may or may not be how Rosemary sees it ""this is not a dream, this is really happening!""  From then on, the film develops as Rosemary gets pregnant, is recommended a doctor (Ralph Bellamy) who may or may not be giving her the right medical advise, and as she enters her thirs trimester, she starts to realize something is fishy about her neighbors, and her un-born child.Like Polanski's 1965 film Repulsion, the viewer gets a feeling of something that one could feel in such horror films as Texas Chainsaw Massacre or, more appropriately, the Blair Witch Project- we feel scared or in a state os suspense not because of what we see, but of what we don't see and can't figure out.  Those who want to compare this to The first Exorcist need to know that this is the European perspective of a Satan story, and that this builds more brilliantly on claustrophobia while the other builds on the un-expected with style.  Overall, Rosemary's Baby is a remarkable achievement in the genre, and in the very last moment in the end, the sense of acceptance Rosemary achieves is possibly the most scariest thing about it.As I mentioned in the one line summary, there are two shots that to me represent the kind of startling and, bizarrely, even funny double edged sword Polanski can pull in films like this (see also John Huston in Chinatown):  the one shot of the ""devil"" on top of Rosemary will make some drop their mouths open in shock, as did I, but I was sort of laughing at it too, in the manner of how she's so calm in the scene.  Another is in the climax, when the witches are gazing proudly at their master's new bouncing baby boy, and out of nowhere there's a little Chinese guy with a camera taking pictures.  I'm not sure if this is a detail Polanski took from the book, or if he threw it in himself, but it's rather amazing that this person appears in a group of Satan galvanizers.

Year of the Devil,"(There are Spoilers) One of the best horror movies ever made with almost no blood or splatters scenes at all with the exception of Terry, Victoria Vetri, jumping, off camera, to her death form the seventh floor of the Bramford Building. ""Rosemary' Baby"" has to do with the most darkest fears one can conjure up in a movie book as well as in one's own mind; The return of Satan-the Devil-on earth and everything that goes along with him.It's early October 1965 and the Pope, Pope Paul VI, has made a historical visit to the US and is in the process of giving a sermon, to some 60,000 people, at New York's Yankee Stadium. It's also the time designated by a coven of Devil worshiping witches for the Devil's offspring, to be named Adrian, to be conceived by the unsuspecting and Catholic observant Rosemary Woodhouse, Mia Farrow.Since Rosemary and her actor husband Guy, John Cassavetes, moved into the creepy Bramford Building they've become very friendly with the elderly couple who lives next door to their apartment Roman and Minnie Castevet, Sidney Blackman & Ruth Roman. Even though Rosemary is not that taken in by the Castevets eccentric and somewhat wired behaviors her husband Guy is. Guy a struggling actor was desperately trying to get a part in a play that the far more talented Donald Baumgart, Tony Curtis, got. After Guy's involvement with the Castevets Baumgart suddenly lost his sight opening the door for another actor to replace him: Guy Woodhouse!The movie starts to grow and accelerate, together with Rosemary's pregnancy, in both tension as well as curiosity as she becomes very frail and sickly as the day of the ""blessed event"", June 28, 1966, is soon to arrive. Feeling that something just isn't right Rosmary has been haunted since her night of conception, October 5/6 1965, it that she feels that it's wasn't Guy who fathered her now soon to be born child but the Devil or Satan,played by Clay Tanner, himself!Despite the movie's many subplots, all centered around Rosemary's pregnancy and birth to her child, the film is never confusing in that they, the subplots, all come together in the film's final and shocking ten or so minutes! The Woodhouse's at first had no idea to what evil existed right at their front doorsteps! Soon they would become in their associations with the Castevets the very central, and rotten, core of it!It was family friend Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins, Maurice Evens, who knew not only the history of the eerie Bramford Building but that of one of its infamous tenants Steven Marcato. It was also that knowledge that lead to Hutch falling into a deep coma that he never came out of!****SPOILER ALERT**** It was Marcato who was killed by an angry New York mob some 80 years ago for secretly practicing witchcraft! It was also Marcato who had a son who had since changed, or rearranged, his name and became a man of the world as well as, in his many travels, secretly gotten himself involved with the occult like his father did! That person is non other then the Woodhouse's kindly and harmless looking next door neighbor Roman Castevet himself!Making a pact with the Devil has its price and the price that Guy Woodhouse paid for bringing him, in Guy allowing Satan to rape his wife Rosemary, out of the depths of Hell and into the unsuspecting world above was more that it was worth. Guy's career in both TV and the movies, as well as the theater, took off like a shot but in reality he ended up damned for all eternity. As for poor Rosemany in the end after seeing what her new born son really looked like, and what he represented, it was both her goodness, in Rosemary's Christian beliefs, and maternal instincts that eventually overrode her horror and revulsion in what she was forced, by her husband Guy and the Castevets, to unknowingly participate in. As the movie ends Rosemary is heard humming the lullaby theme of the movie as she's gently and tenderly rocking the ""cute"" little Devil, her son Adrian, to sleep!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I can't see you, you're in Dubrovnik.","This is my first ever IMDb review of what just so happens to be my favourite movie of all time: 'Rosemary's Baby'. I can't recommend this film enough. Even though I hate to admit it since Roman Polanski is... dubious, this movie is fantastically written and directed. The performances, specifically those of Mia Farrow (who was robbed of an Oscar nomination) and the legendary Ruth Gordon are enduringly stunning. Watch this movie if you like a fascinating story that can be told in a simple and dreamlike manner where you don't even realise the two hours go by.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun stuff, deluxe.","People seem to approach this as being a horror movie. Well, I guess it's not. And certainly not in days where the genre has been fully occupied by more or less brain dead slasher flicks.So to be perfectly clear, this movie is more or less typical Polanski style apartment suspense stuff, with the usual, well balanced mixture of paranoia and sarcasm. And as such it's outstandingly playful, entertaining and well crafted.Most notable of course are the character portrayals, and those many special moments one immediately realizes were created not to drive the story, further the potential success of the movie or the fame of anybody involved, but to plainly create atmosphere and entertain us.Just take the suicide sequence, the outfits in which Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer come strolling down the street and the following dialog about cleaning windows at night, all in face of a dead body. If I ever saw sarcasm working on screen, I'd say it was here.And the shot of Gordon holding her spectacles up to further inspect that young women who might know more about the relations of the deceased than herself - this potentially being a threat of course. Clearly, this stuff borders on being cartoonish, but Polanski - and Gordon - truly walk the line here.Also a favorite of mine, their first dinner and Farrow's looking back into the dining room while helping out in the kitchen - all just quiescence, only the tobacco smoke hinting at people sitting around the corner and maybe talking about what? Ample space for our fantasy to fill in, deliberately given to us.Gordon's performance here as house invading, chit chatting ever inquisitive elderly lady is a blast anyway. To me, one of the most memorable captured on screen, ever. Very much notable also Cassavetes, extending the evasiveness of his character to almost avoiding the camera. Rarely seen amongst actors I'd say, and giving a nice opaqueness to his performance.I could go on of course, likely for hours and without even mentioning classics like the phone booth sequence. To me, this, Chinatown and Le Locataire comprise Polanski's classic period, and are ample evidence of what a really exceptional Hollywood studio director he was and could further have been - if he hadn't blown it himself. Very regrettable, really.Highly recommended, to the true film fan.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
overlong and overblown,"Back in 1968 I attended the UK premiere of this film. I had seen some of Polanski's early Polish shorts, his first feature, Knife in the Water as well as Repulsion and Cut-De-Sac and was already a great fan. That I was now to see the much hyped film Hitchcock had turned aside perhaps led to my expecting too much and I was bitterly disappointed in this overlong and overblown movie filled with hammy performances and Mia farrow looking and acting like some schoolgirl. Watching it again, after a viewing of The Mephisto Waltz, I imagined that 'class' would show through and that I had been nothing but a petulant youngster all those years ago. But, no, this seemingly much loved 'classic horror' really is rather lacking in substance. I guess the satanic sequence, still good but tame by today's standards had much greater impact originally and although I think Farrow's performance generally poor, she is excellent in a very fine telephone booth sequence towards the end. It may be that Polanski was in awe of her playing the skinny little girl and only now and again let her show her real potential and let rip in a scene or two that could have come from Hitch himself.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Polanski's third suspense masterpiece.,"Indeed ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a classic but let's get the bad points out of the way first. Some scenes are awkward, Mia Farrow and her new found friend in the washing room really doesn't belong in a movie hailed as a classic. Terrible dialogue and acting from both. Farrow seems to change accents throughout the movie, even in her same lines which is a little off putting. However she is terrific in this role as the quiet naive woman who senses over the films two hours that something is very wrong. The movie has been directed much like Nicolas Roeg's classic, Don't Look Now, that classic 70's look of chopping and changing scenes during dialogue. Rosemary's Baby is also very sexually aware of itself, and one could say with all validity was the bridge between censorship issues and what would follow in the glorious 70's.The movie was shot in the Dakota Buildings, and looks dreadfully eerie, director Roman Polanski makes New York like that too, which all fits with the mood of the film. John Cassavetes has some great lines and is particularly good, though isn't needed once he plays his cards too early. But two actors out-stage Farrow and Cassavetes and that is their old noisy could be witch neighbors played delightfully well by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. The performances in the movie are phenomenal, particularly that of Ruth Gordon, who plays the nosy meddling neighbor (she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance). Mia Farrow is also very convincing as Rosemary, the trapped individual whose intentions are always good.""Rosemary's Baby"" is still as watchable today (and, of course, deeply horrific and disturbing) as it was all those years ago. It doesn't need gallons of fake blood or computer-generated effects to be scary. Everything here feels a little too real and is a credit to how films can be made. Don't expect a roller-coaster ride of scares and guts – it's much too 'foreboding' to succumb to anything so cheap and easy. If you're in the mood for something horrible, dark with an every-increasing sense of dread then give this one a watch before it gets remade with too many special effects and no soul.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where's the horror?,"Throughout the years, I have come across numerous opinions about ""Rosemary's Baby."" The majority of which consider it to be one of their all-time favourite films, emphasizing its terrifying and unsettling nature, particularly for expectant mothers.While I agree with the latter part, acknowledging that it can indeed be a deeply unsettling experience for some, I cannot fully support the former claim. It is not terrifying, at least not in the conventional sense, especially when compared to other movies in the ""Occult"" genre.Apart from the dream-like sequence, there's almost nothing that could potentially induce horror. It may make you uncomfortable to a certain extent, but it lacks the ability to truly shake you to the core. Personally, I believe it would have been more effective if it had been treated as a psychological thriller instead.On a side note, Mia Farrow's portrayal of Rosemary is exceptional. To be honest, she was the one who held my attention until the last frame.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It is literally impossible to describe how bad this movie is.,"This can barely be described as a horror movie. More than anything, it's a joke, and a bad one at that. There are only 1-2 parts that are even remotely creepy. Everything else is predictable and boring.I love a slow-burn, but almost nothing happens in this film. And the acting is so bad, it's hard to stay immersed. There are only 1-2 significant plot developments, and they're spaced so far apart that by the 2nd one, you don't even care. You just want it to be over.The absolute worst part of the film is that it's told from the perspective of a completely helpless person. Yeah, she gets put in a messed up situation. But she has the IQ of a 12 year old to not be able to get out of it. Literally every time she does something right, she turns around and does 5 things wrong. It's insufferable to try to cheer for this dope.And if that isn't bad enough, after sitting through this incredibly frustrating film, it gives you an ending that provides no payoff whatsoever. All it does it reinforce the moronic nature of the main character, and everything wrong with the movie to begin with.For this to be considered a classic, I can only assume there are a bunch of old timers reminiscing about the good times and living in denial about films like this. I was excited to watch this movie with all the hype behind it, and I'm not opposed to older movies. But this was just awful. Utterly awful.If you want to see a real movie focused around witchcraft that is actually a HORROR movie and not some bland genre-bender, watch The Witch (2015).

Brilliant,"What struck me most about this film is something that I don't think anyone has mentioned yet which is the use of colour. For a large section of the film, the overwhelmingly predominant colour is yellow, traditionally the colour of Satan. Then, as the birth draws near and after the birth, blue is brought in, an allusion to the Virgin Mary. There are many scenes symbolically comparing her to Mary, notably one while she is giving birth with her head on a pillow with yellow stripes on it so it appears she has a halo. There are so many things like that to notice, which is one of the reasons I love it so much.",,Anonymous,Horror

Still an Unforgettable Masterpiece After Almost Sixty Years,"In 1965, in New York City, the housewife Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband, the actor of commercials Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes), move to the Bramford building to the former apartment 7E of Mrs. Gardenia on the seventh floor. The lady died after three weeks in coma and Rosemary and Guy intend to have children of their own. They renovate the apartment, and Rosemary befriends the dweller Terry in the laundry, who speaks highly of Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer), who rescued her from the streets and treat her like a daughter. Soon Terry commits suicide, and Rosemary tells the police officer that the girl loved Mr. & Mrs. Castevet. Minnie invites Rosemary and her husband to have dinner with her and Guy goes, despite the initial complaint to the invitation. He immediately befriends Roman, and soon he has sex with Rosemary fainted while she has weirdest dreams. She gets pregnant and Minnie asks her to change her obstetrician to the famous Dr. Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), who prescribes herbs prepared by Minnie instead of vitamins to her. She begins to wither away with pain and when her friend Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins (Maurice Evans) visits her, he is impressed with her appearance. He schedules a lunch with Rosemary to show his discoveries, but he never appears, and she learns that he is in coma. When she meets a common friend at his funeral, she gives a book to Rosemary that Hutch asked her to give while he was in coma. Soon Rosemary learns that the Bramford is a coven and Roman is the son of a notorious devil worshipper. She believes her baby is in danger and tries to escape from the witches. But who can help her?Revisiting ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), the viewer will realize that it is still an unforgettable masterpiece after almost sixty years. The atmospheric plot shows an inexperienced young mother that follows the instructions of her beloved husband and her gentle new neighbors to her pregnancy until she finds who they are. But she is wrong since they do not want to harm her son. When she learns who is the father and why their lives have progressed, her sensation of paranoid and panic changes to an inexplicable one of motherhood. After rewatching this classic, I realize that the recently released ""Apartment 7A"" is better than my first evaluation and explores open details in the original movie, such as the deaths of Mrs. Gardenia and Terry.

"A creepy, slow but landmark horror film","Before 'The Exorcist' scared the wits out of people about devil possession Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby came along in 1968 to scare the audiences then. Not your typical horror flick; this is slow and brooding and eventually leads to a shocking and terrifying finale that only few could have pulled off as flawlessly as Polanski did. This isn't cheap, schlocky horror, this is pure horror (at its best).Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavettes) move into a new apartment. Across their room live two elderly people, Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon, in an Oscar winning performance). They are very friendly people and Guy takes an immediate liking to them but Rosemary isn't so sure about them. She hears weird noises coming from their room at night, they seem to take down their pictures whenever they go over to their apartment and other things like that. When Rosemary becomes pregnant they start to become more intrusive. They convince her to switch doctor and Minnie starts giving her ""herbal"" drinks everyday. It is a rather unpleasant pregnancy, though, Rosemary is having constant pains and soon she starts suspected everyone of foul play.The mood of this film is set perfectly from the very start when we hear the creepiest piece of music (a lullaby) played over the opening credits (sung by Mia Farrow). Polanski is a genius at setting mood, throughout the whole movie their is a sense of unease that gradually builds until your on the very edge of your seat waiting for the final revelation. Polanski doesn't rely on gore or special effects, in fact, their is (save for one brief moment of a corpse) no gore at all in the film. Very much unlike modern horror films might I add!The best part of this movie, though, is the outstanding acting. Horror movies are unfortunately part of a stereotype which suggests no good acting can come out of a horror movie. How wrong those people are. Every single performance is perfect. Mia Farrow plays the naive but suspecting wife hauntingly realistic. She truly looks like she is suffering from her pregnancy. John Cassavettes is great as the self-centred Guy, an actor who never really pays attention to his wife. Ruth Gordon, though, is the stand-out performance as Minnie. Although she is a friendly, bubbly, helpful woman there is always a sinister feeling she radiates and the same can be said for Sidney Blackmer as well. Ruth Gordon rightfully deserved that Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.So, if you're looking for a horror film with real scares, top-notch performances, a creepy soundtrack and a hell of a twisted ending look no further than Rosemary's Baby.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""It was kind of fun in a necrophile sort of way""","Mystery, conspiracy, paranoia, fear ... that this film fails to deliver impressive enough. It was conceived as a psychological horror, and maybe for the average '60s viewer it really was, but after thousands of watched films and from the perspective of the 21st century, it left me quite indifferent and I would classify it as a mediocre psychological drama. It was neither tense nor dramatic, and certainly not frightful. Moreover, for the most part I was bored and only the end made a somewhat stronger impression.

It's not what you're expecting !. Conceived in terror, born in fear !. Pray for Rosemary's Baby !.This is the first film to open up the subject of the modern-day practice of the occult . Polanski's notorious movie about contemporary witchcraft and necromancy on the loose in an apartment building , where new tenant Rosemary plunges giddily , deeply into a nightmare world which enfolds her in evil . Roman uses every throat-clutching trick in the book to compel his audience into total belief of what is basically a rather disconcerting and preposterous story . The suspense is sustained throughout as our starring is made aware that those friendly people around her are not what they seem . At times Polanski is so persuasively nasty that it needs strong nerves to watch out as he opts for an open-ended climax . Interpretations are pretty good , Mia Farrow is nice as a suave , sensitive wife who becomes involved into bizarre happenings , while John Cassavetes is fine as the suspicious husband who forces her into an unholy arrangement with a group of devil-worshippers. Ruth Gordon is priceless in her Academy Award-winning character as one of the seemingly normal neighbors. And other familiar secondaries appearing here and there , giving decent performances , such as : Sidney Blackmer , Maurice Evans , Ralph Bellamy , Victoria Vetri or Angela Dorian, Patsy Kelly , Charles Grodin , Phil Leeds , Elisha Cook Jr, among others.It displays an atmospheric and adequate cinematography by classic cameraman William A.

As well as weird and sinister musical score by Polish composer Krzysztof Komeda , he died at 37 , a bit later finishing Rosemary's Baby due to head injuries after an accident in Los Angeles , he was a prestigious composer and actor, known for The dance of vampires (1967) , Knife in the water (1962) and other Polanski films. From bestseller novel by Ira Levin , the motion picture was co-written and professionally directed by the Polish Roman Polanski . Polanski's cinematic trajectory is hard , problematic and full of incidents. In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, Rosemary's Baby (1968). However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Chinatown (1974). It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the sodomy of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from he USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979), which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films. In 1992 made Bitter Moon , but it doesn't succeed as the erotic drama it's intented to be and including some ludicrous lines from what must be Polanski's worst movie . It wasn't until The pianist (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. His career is full of hits and some flops , such as : his big success Rosemary's Baby , Chinatown, The pianist , Oliver Twist , Frantic, Dance of vampire , among others .

"A quiet, erudite chiller, but not conventionally frightening","If there are omens in this world, they were not heeded by the makers of Rosemary's Baby. The director would soon see his own pregnant wife disemboweled by the Manson family, the actor hired to play Satan would be revealed as a serial rapist, the leading lady would see her husband engage in an affair with someone who was effectively their daughter, and the building around which the film was shot would 12 years later bear witness to the tragic death of John Lennon.This was without a doubt a cursed film, and its sado-sexual undercurrents are ultimately made more powerful by knowledge of the evils, perversions, and obsessions woven into the myth of its making.However, do not expect to be overtly frightened by this film. Unlike more recent ""traditional"" horror films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others,"" this film will not make you jump. It is instead a slightly comic, often disturbing psychological portrait of one innocent woman's breakdown as she comes into contact with the carnal and callous power of Satanism. Mia Farrow plays this breakdown perfectly. Her performance (easily the best she has ever given) is potently tremulous, and effectively walks the fine line between hysteria and conviction. The Satanists, into whose complete power she is delivered by her husband, possess a wonderfully concealed menace, particulaly the obstetrician, a smiling, cold-eyed fascist.The once infamous scenes, such as Rosemary eating raw liver, lack the shock value they once had, and are filmed in such a documentary style that whatever horror they could have conveyed is lost on modern audiences. Whatever power the film has is entirely invested in Rosemary's descent into madness, and that is still as powerful as ever",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
He has his father's eyes...,"For 1968 standards Rosemary's Baby is a good horror movie. It's not very graphic, it has to have it from the tension building, from the weird characters, and from an intriguing story that keeps you plastered to the screen. Roman Polanski mastered all that. He's a good director, made some really good movies, and for that we have to thank him, but let's not forget he's also a child molester that fled the USA to escape his sentence. Just let's never forget that! That said Rosemary's Baby is one of his better movies. Mia Farrow did a good job playing the main character Rosemary. The rest of the cast did also a good job, for 1968 that is, when acting was different from what we get now.

Superlative nail-biter marred by gutless ending.,"Viscerally, this is a stunning film. The New York interiors are beautifully-rendered, and both Polanski's cast is to be thanked for breathing life into his own tepid script. This movie is not for impatient. It moves very slow, but if one pays attention to the various plot details, it will have you biting your nails throughout. Rosemary's Baby reels you in almost from the very beginning and sets you squarely on the side of the protagonist, the beautiful Mia Farrow in a very believable, subtle performance. There is great dramatic irony in the horror's complex discovery plot -- you find yourself almost screaming at the film because Rosemary is too naive and charmingly honest to suspect what the audience has already gathered: that there are terrible forces and terrible people out to get her.The very fact that you root so hard for Rosemary -- and believe so much in her integrity -- makes the film's ludicrously-scripted and childishly-shot ending all the more trite and hard to follow. I won't give it away, it's too silly for anything but the actual experience, but suffice it to say that whether or not you agree with the decisions that are made, they are a hard pill to swallow. Of course, it's only Polanksi manipulating his audience even more, like he does throughout the movies early hours. Like I wrote, you have to see the ending to (un)believe it: it does not taste good.I have reserved the highest praise, though, for a trio of superlative performances. First, there is Ralph Bellamy in a tiny role; however, what he demonstrates is a firm grasp on the craft. In his few minutes of screen time, he manages to be sinister while seemingly doing nothing. In fact, Polanski admitted that his favorite scene in the whole movie is Bellamy retrieving Farrow from an office later on in the film. With only a few lines, Bellamy reveals his power as an actor.Secondly, there is Farrow, who deserved all the raves. Against the hopelessly miscast Cassavettes as her husband, Farrow's performance is a tour de force without the force -- she does all her acting quietly. She is so beautiful, so fragile and so earnest that it no wonder how quickly you fall in love with her. I doubt very much that any other actress could have pulled this one off, and if there are ones which could have it's a testament to Farrow's performance that you still can't picture anyone else as Rosemary.This is movie is not over-the-top (until it's end). If you want a bloody slasher film, you should not rent this one. It is an intelligent, suspenseful thriller. Were it not for the incredible ending, this one would have been an easy 9/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seems tame today but still delivers chills...,"Since ROSEMARY'S BABY came upon the scene so many years ago, we've had a great many supernatural tales (THE OMEN, THE SIXTH SENSE) to name just a couple of the more recent scary titles, that it's no wonder someone viewing this for the first time might feel cheated.The audiences of '68 were used to this kind of slow build-up to a plot that kept audiences waiting for revelations explaining some mysterious goings-on in an uptown apartment house called The Dakota. They didn't expect slasher gore or quick cuts to show gruesome body parts on display. They wanted the story to develop at its own pace and then deliver the goods for a substantial conclusion.And this is what ROSEMARY'S BABY does so efficiently. It starts slowly and only gradually do we come to realize that something much more serious than just eccentric neighbors is going on here. Best of the eccentrics is RUTH GORDON who rightfully won a Supporting Role Oscar for her work as Minnie, the overly solicitous neighbor who watches so carefully over the pregnant MIA FARROW. Hubby JOHN CASSAVETES seems to be concerned too but that turns out to be for other reasons.There are several good supporting roles, but another performer who stands out is RALPH BELLAMY as the doctor Rosemary confides in when she begins to suspect things are wrong.It's a good screen version of Ira Levin's novel and MIA FARROW does a commendable job as the worried and confused young wife.

Masterpiece of  supernatural suspense.,"Polanski's first American film is one of the most enduring films of the 60's. Well-received when released in 1968, Rosemary's Baby is that rare film that grows more impressive with repeated viewings. It's a near perfect, multi-layered classic that mixes psychological horror with supernatural suspense while being funny, scary, and ironic. No remake could ever come close and the spate of films it inspired, most notably the The Exorcist and The Omen, pale by comparison. Expertly directed by Polanski, the film is perfectly cast and splendidly acted by all. Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for supporting actress, but Farrow, who is in every scene, wasn't even nominated for her iconic portrayal. The entire film is told from Rosemary's point of view. The growing sense of menace and paranoia is beautifully handled, and the audience is with Farrow and her unborn child every step of the way. On one level Rosemary's Baby is the ultimate tribute to motherhood. A winner any way you look at it. Consider it essential viewing. Among others, French film director Francois Truffaut expressed great admiration for the film, and Rosemary's Baby deserved a place on the AFI's top 100.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Psychological horror that is more disturbing than scary,"Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse are a young couple looking for a new home in New York. The move into The Bramford; a building with a somewhat dark history... at the turn of the century certain people living there were linked to witchcraft and murder. Of course the Woodhouses don't believe there is anything wrong with the place now. Soon after moving in they are befriended by Roman and Minnie Castevet, their elderly neighbours. Guy likes them but Rosemary finds them more than a little strange. They plan to have a child and one day Rosemary has a strange and disturbing dream; various neighbours are there and she is raped by the Devil! Soon after she learns she is pregnant and starts to believe it wasn't a dream... worse still she becomes convinced that Guy is involved too.If you like your horror film to be full of jump scares, gore and violence than you might be disappointed with this. If on the other hand you want a great story with some genuinely disturbing moments you are likely to love it. While the story is told from Rosemary's perspective the possibility that she is delusional and paranoid remains for most of the film; but as the saying goes 'Just because you are paranoid it doesn't mean they aren't out to get you'. The viewer is really dragged into Rosemary's view of things and soon suspect every other than her of being part of a demonic plot. The cast is really impressive; Mia Farrow carries the film as Rosemary but it wouldn't be what it is without fine performances also from John Cassavetes, as Guy; Ruth Gordon as Minnie and Sidney Blackmer as Roman. Overall I'd say this is a must see for horror fans; it clearly had an influence on the genre, leading the way where 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' would follow in a less subtle manner.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has aged well and can still chill,"Rosemary's Baby was a shocker in 1968 when it was released.  Recently screening the film with my wife, I see it still can impart a huge psychological impact today.My wife did not find it particularly frightening.  It is true, there are no CG demons flying around cutting people's heads off ala End of Days.  It's from an age of film when people actually watched and thought about what was on the screen instead of just being wowed by eye-candy.  As such, it calls upon the viewer to be drawn into Rosemary's plight and paranoia.  And at this, it still succeeds.I was struck by the fact that, even though there are some telltale signs of it's age (guys readily smoke around the pregnant Rosemary while handing her drinks, etc.), the film holds up so well and appears even today to be remarkably contemporary.  The characters, so well acted, are timeless types of horror:  The nosey old lady (Ruth Gordon) who eventually grows on you and, even after you find out what she's all about, you can't help but find her funny; the benign grandfatherly figure (Sidney Blackmer) and the trusted doctor (Ralph Bellemy) who surely wouldn't harm a fly; and the innocent Rosemary who becomes victim to a justified paranoia.  At the end, my wife asked whether the second doctor (Charles Grodin) was ""in"" on the plot. That's the whole point in a nutshell... you never know.Rosemary's Baby was a daring precursor to many films to follow including the Omen and The Exorcist.  While those films use gallons of pea soup and shocking special effects, neither works so hard on your mind as this one. Unlike so many of it's contemporaries, Rosemary's Baby has aged well and can still chill!   8 out 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fine acted movie, has some chills, but really nothing all that great.","I like a little bit more horror in my horror movies and this one just does not have enough. I would like to combine it with other horror movies that have lots of violence and gore, but has sorry stories and actors in it as this one does have a good story and acting. It just tends to get a bit tedious at times for my tastes, not taking anything away from the movie mind you, if you like it you probably have better tastes than I a person whose favorite genre of horror is the zombie movie, the genre most consider the lowest of the low. The story has a woman who is pregnant and something seems to be going wrong. Simple enough, eh? Actually the story is a lot more interesting and complex than that line, but that line works good too. She has some rather seemingly helpful neighbors at first, but they seem odd to. The husband also is quite the normal husband at first, but he too seems to succumb to what everyone else in the building seems to be doing. Of course, as interesting as the story is, it is also quite long and tedious to watch, I needed a break from watching it at times. Still the payoff is rather good in a underdone kind of way that makes it work all the more. Ruth Gordon is excellent in this film, it is to bad she just about undermines this role by playing in the horrid direct to television sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Suprisingly chilling,"I managed to catch this on an AMC late-night showing as part of the Halloween Monsterfest collection of flims.  I was initially only a little more than mildly interested because of the movie's reported influence on the superb Silent Hill videogame series, but the movie drew me in, and I eventually gave my undivided attention to the television set.I'm honestly glad that I did.  What I expected to be (at least) a decent way to kill an hour or two turned out to be a well-acted, disturbing, and psychological horror film.  I won't go into detail about the plot (though many people have probably heard about it without seeing it, like I had), but I will say that Rosemary's Baby is a good example of the horror film that doesn't rely on blood and gore to make an impression.  I'm not very experienced in the genre of horror cinema, but I would recommend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in horror.Silent Hill fans will enjoy looking for points of similarity between the film and certain aspects of the game series (that's as specific as I'll be on that point).In summary: disturbing in a GOOD way- intentionally so- and intelligently crafted.

Some of the movie I really liked and noticed.  I really liked how the husband and wife were sometimes sarcastic to each other and jokeing around with each other all of the time.

"'Rosemary's Baby' is a masterful slow-burn horror that painstakingly works its way under your skin, creating an atmosphere simmering with evil, dread and paranoia.","Mia Farrow delivers an astonishing performance as Rosemary, a young expectant mother whose overly friendly neighbours begin edging their way ever more into her and her husband's life. And it isn't long before she suspects they harbour a sinister agenda...Writer-director Roman Polanski demonstrates how to craft a film reliant on atmosphere. This is primarily a drama with an undercurrent of horror for much of its runtime, but thankfully the strong attention to characters and story enables the film to slowly imbed itself into your mind. The threat soon becomes palpable but the film still gives you moments to question the mental state of its protagonist: Is Rosemary uncovering nasty clues to her neighbours behaviour? Or is she simply making the pieces fit a disturbing narrative she's become so convinced is true? It makes for compelling viewing.Overall, 'Rosemary's Baby' is an expertly paced psychological horror that has stunning cinematography and strong performances to contribute to the high level of discomfort you'll feel throughout, and proves itself as one of the finest of the genre.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
And the award for Worst Pregnancy Ever goes to...(opening envelope)...,"Rosemary's Baby (1968) gave America two new stars, lead actress Mia Farrow and Polish director Roman Polanski. Prior to Rosemary Farrow was a TV actress and Polanski an arthouse hero, but Rosemary launched them into the big time. Her participation precipitated the breakdown of her marriage to Sinatra, but the possibility of an Oscar was just too good to miss. In the end it was co-star Ruth Gordon (as Minnie) who bagged the award. Polanski was nominated but had to wait until 2003 to get one (for The Pianist).Rosemary and her husband move into an old apartment block despite warnings from their friend and current landlord that the place has a dark past. Rosemary makes friends with a young lady who promptly goes out the window. The couple next door, Minnie and Roman, are soon intruding on Rosemary's life, all the more so after she falls pregnant. But just how did she manage to get pregnant, and by whom, or by what?I wonder, is Rosemary's severe Vidal Sassoon haircut a fashion statement or an early signifier of demonic possession? One thing's for certain, Satanic conspiracy aside, this movie is no advert for pregnancy, or for getting to know your neighbours. Farrow, c/o the makeup artist, is made to look more and more ill as her pregnancy progresses, and as viewers we are likely to become more and more anxious on her behalf. Who do you turn to when you begin to distrust everyone? In such a predicament, where do you run to?Rosemary's Baby, as you can see from the thumbnail, had a superb advertising campaign, and a great poster. All the actors do a terrific job, especially Farrow, and Polanski slowly amplifies the disquiet without resorting to histrionics. The film works brilliantly on a first watch, but with secondary and tertiary viewing it does become a long haul. Some commentators have attempted to interpret Rosemary's final position as one of power, but that seems like wishful thinking to me. But you see the movie and you decide if there's any reason to be optimistic (assuming you're not a Satanist yourself).Farrow described this, c.2008, as the only great movie she ever did, which is an intolerable slight upon Woody Allen, with whom she made a dozen movies, several of them great ones. It is true, however, that this is the only one that offers her 100% screen time. Rosemary is in virtually every scene of the movie, whereas most often Allen put Farrow in as part of an ensemble, not the above-the-title star, so to speak. Far as I know, Polanski never worked with her again. Not many did, except poor benighted Woody.It is a great movie, scarier for women than for men to watch, for obvious reasons (apparently some women were very powerfully affected by Ridley Scott's Alien, because of its evil pregnancy theme). It works best the first time, but even the first time one must ask the question, what is that hairdo?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A mother and her baby !!!,"'Rosemary's Baby' is perhaps the most popular and well known Roman Polanski film after 'Chinatown'. The film is based on a novel of the same name by Ira Levin and it's the 2nd film in Polanski's 'Apartment Trilogy'. The film is about a married couple - Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse who move into the Bramford, a Manhattan apartment. They get introduced to a nosy and odd neighbouring couple - The Castevets who start intruding in their lives a lot. Finally when Rosemary gets pregnant, she starts becoming more and more suspicious about the neighbours as well as her husband.Polanski had already made 'Repulsion' in 1965 which was the 1st film in his 'Apartment Trilogy' and his 1st film in the English language. But 'Rosemary's Baby' was his first big-budget film and this was also the 1st big-budget Hollywood horror film. But like a true product of its time, it still had the audacity to have ambiguity as one of its qualities unlike the big-budget Hollywood studio productions of the current era. Like 'Repulsion', this film can also be interpreted in many different ways.The first way to interpret it will be to view it as a work on female liberation. This was made in the 60s when the feminist movement was finally starting to have some impact. One can view the film and opine that Polanski is showing how a woman is being dominated by others and others' opinions are being forced upon her during her pregnancy when all the decisions should rest with her. She starts becoming more and more distant from her husband due to the fact even he fails to understand her mindset and starts dominating her.The second way to interpret the film will be to take everything literally. The viewer can decide to not go too much into subtexts and themes and take the film for what it is and get immersed in this interesting story of a woman and her pregnancy.The third way to interpret the film will be to view it as an allegory on how women can seem excessively paranoid and whimsical during pregnancy from a male point of view.The fourth way to interpret it will be to view the film as the struggle of a woman with a Catholic background to adjust herself to the new and changing society of the 1960s, a decade during which non-conformism and counterculture became a craze. Her paranoia gets the better of her and she begins to fear the prospect of bringing a new child to a world and a society which is straying away from her beliefs and so she tries to distance herself and her unborn baby from all folks that she suspects to have 'questionable' beliefs and faiths.The beauty of the screenplay written by Polanski himself, is that it facilitates all the interpretations that can be possible. The screenplay is open and provides hints and scopes for viewers to take the film and accept in their own way. I especially loved the ending of the film as I think it is a beautiful tribute to mothers and motherly love.Another very important aspect of the film is the style of storytelling. Polanski uses surrealism with some dream sequences that are truly weird and effective. Just like 'Repulsion', Polanski blurs the distinctions between what is real and what is being imagined by using a paranoid and sort of unreliable narrator as the whole film is from the point of view of Rosemary who is in pretty much every scene.Mia Farrow is absolutely brilliant as the titular Rosemary. She looks incredibly gaunt and petite in the film to underline her fragility. She beautifully pulls off the transition from being sweet and gullible to being flat out paranoid. I also loved Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castevet. She richly deserved the Oscar that she won for this role. She is dynamite in every scene she is in. She puts in a method performance so brilliantly that the viewer is always guessing whether to believe her or not.'Rosemary's Baby' is a very influential horror film. It uses psychological horror to explore deeper themes without resorting to cheap scares, but it still is pretty disturbing. This film is an absolute masterpiece which I can't recommend highly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

30 years later and still one of the best!,"This is quite simply an incredibly engrossing film.  Easily one of the best films of the horror/suspense genre, it benefits from a strong cast and enough time to flesh out the story.  There are not a lot of films of this genre that can maintain a level of suspense past the 100 minute mark, but this film at nearly 2 hours and 20 minutes has no problem what so ever with that.  If one did not know what the film was about when they first started watching, one would think it was about a young couple beginning their life together (kind of like ""Barefoot in the Park""), but when the mysterious circumstances begin to take place and the strange neighbors come on the scene, one knows they're in for a rollercoaster ride of suspense.

If this doesn't scare you...,"I had heard a lot about this movie for a long time but I had not had the chance to see it until recently. And I must say that at first I wasn't that impressed. For the first 30-40 minutes not a lot of stuff seemed to happen, but after the truly horrifying rape scene (a great depiction of ""was-it-a-dream or reality"") I was bolted to my couch watching the enchanting Mia Farrow grow more and more into the frenzy of thinking she is impregnated with the child of Satan himself. I am now convinced that I should go see this movie again to catch all the details director Roman Polanski must have put in those first 30-40 minutes.Like in other movies in Polanski's early work (i.e. Knife In The Water) this was so well-paced that as a watcher you are lured into this false sense of security just like Rosemary is, but underneath horrible things are happening to her that are unspeakable.Another thing about this film was the feel to it. I was convinced that this movie was made in 1978 or something but later on I checked my Maltin guide and read that it was actually from 1968! How's that for a surprise. This looks and feels like a seventies film but it's not!The role of Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castavet was played to perfection to once again give the audience that feeling that such nice neighbours would not be capable of doing something so horrible and give us the dilemma in which we are driven to thinking that it is Rosemary who is dillusional and is making all this up.

A masterpiece of psychological horror is that rare PERFECT horror film!,"Richard Sylbert, the production designer on ""Rosemary's Baby"", called it ""the greatest horror film without any horror in it."" Mia Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse, a hip young NYC wife to actor Guy Woodhouse, played by the talented John Cassavetes. When she becomes pregnant, Rosemary starts to suspect a conspiracy that her nosy old neighbors, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, are the leaders of a coven of modern day witches seeking to do harm to her unborn child. Is she right? Is losing her mind? The brilliance of ""Rosemary's Baby"" is that it convincingly plays both sides of that coin, the same way Henry James did with ""Turn of the Screw"" or Robert Wise in his film ""The Haunting"", right up until the very end. Writer/director Roman Polanski crafts a disturbingly paranoid film that is reminiscent of his earlier film ""Repulsion"" and a later film of his in which Polanski himself starred, ""The Tenant."" All three of these film are stories form an interesting trilogy of isolation and madness in modern metropolitan apartments. I've always thought the Coen Brothers' ""Barton Fink"" was something of a homage to these Polanski films. Interestingly, Fink won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, the same year Polanski was the head of the jury that awarded them the prize. Polanski brings a strong visual style and atmosphere to the film that is at once very slick and contemporary, but also hints at classic gothic horror. While he delivers a few showy sequences, such a memorable surreal dream sequence early in the film, the more subtle touches he brings to the film are make it such a unique classic. For example, one moment early in the film when Rosemary and Guy tour their future apartment (led by the always great Elisha Cook Jr.), Rosemary notices there's a door being a large dresser. The camera almost imperceptibly pans upward as Rosemary and Guy stand on tip toes to peek over the dresser, which causes the audience to seemingly discover this hidden door with the characters. Another great moment isn't a visual one, but a moment sucks the audience in none-the-less, is when Rosemary thinks she hears something happening in the next apartment and turns off the air conditioning, which the viewer never even noticed among the many other city noises, but this subtle sound design moment is another example of Polanski using cinematic techniques to draw the audience into the story and into these characters heads. This becomes even more intense when we're drawn into these characters beginning to lose their minds. Featuring an unsettling lullaby themed score by Krzysztof Komeda, lush and hypnotic photography by William A. Fraker that is at once bright and modern and also darkly gothic, and a stellar cast that also includes Maurice Evans as Rosemary's father figure friend Hutch, Ralph Bellamy as her obstetrician Dr. Sapirstein, Charles Grodin as Dr. Hill, and you even have D'Urville Martin, the director and co-star of ""Dolomite"", as an elevator operator. And look fast for producer William Castle in a cameo as a man on the phone and in another scene, and listen for an unbilled Tony Curtis as the voice on the other end of a phone call for the unseen but significant character Donald Baumgart. For those who aren't familiar with producer William Castle, he was famous for making schlocky horror films like ""The House on Haunted Hill"" or ""The Tingler"" and featured gimmicks such as selling life insurance policies in the theater lobby in case audience members died of fright or another where he put joy buzzers under theater seats to terrify the audience. Castle's brand of horror movies were the antithesis of the smart horror film that ""Rosemary's Baby"" represents. Castle mortgaged his home in order to buy the rights to Ira Levin's novel in hopes of finally directing a quality film, but studio head Robert Evans (""Love Story"" ""The Godfather"" ""Chinatown"") insisted on hiring Polanski to direct the film. Overall, this is a perfect horror film that taps modern world insolation and paranoia in a way that makes old world horrors seem plausible. FUN FACT! ""Rosemary's Baby"" is reportedly one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films and ""The Shining"" star Jack Nicholson was suggested to Roman Polanski by producer Robert Evans, but Polanski felt that ""for all his talent, his slightly sinister appearance ruled him out"". That insight was Stephen King's major criticism of the Kubrick adaptation of ""The Shining"", that no one's dad looks like Jack Nicholson and that he was clearly off-kilter and crazy from the start of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unsettling, creepy classic horror film","Rosemary's Baby (1968) is one of the most famous horror films ever made. It got excellent unanimously positive reviews when it was released. It received those excellent reviews because it really is a great well done horror film that will creep the hell out of you. The cast includes: Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Charles Grodin, and Ruth Gordon. The performances are marvelous all around, especially by Farrow (Rosemary). Farrow plays the lead role wonderfully. Rosemary goes through a lot in the film and Farrow plays it all so well. Her character starts out as a normal wife. Her and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move into a new apartment and there are many creepy, eerie neighbors around them. They befriend one couple in their 70s and they form a relationship. Rosemary becomes pregnant soon after, but as the pregnancy progresses, complications come up and Rosemary begins to realize that something is deeply wrong and that the people around her might be in on it. She comes to believe that her neighbors are Satan worshipers and that her husband Guy has promised them their baby to use in rituals. It's not until the end that the truth about everything is revealed. This movie uses real effective scare tactics instead of relying on blood and gore like other horror movies. The direction is wonderfully done, the writing is very smart and well written, the performances are spot on from the entire cast, and the ending is one of the most chilling and effective ending I've ever seen!

The high Tension,"When published in 1967, Rosemary's Baby was one of the first contemporary horror novels to become a national bestseller. And that's why this film related to novel. Actually I did not read the novel but I watch Rosemary's Baby in the university ( in pronunciation and listening lesson ). And now I have a comment about that movie.This film about a woman who discovers that her pregnancy is not actually normal.

And strange things start to happen : She is raped by a man who is not human. But Rosemary think that it is a dream and than Rosemary falls pregnant but she think that she is pregnant by her husband. Then she begins to suspect that her neighbors have special plans for her child.If we talk about the place which is shown in movies are good and interesting (exp.the building).

"" Rosemary's Baby "" written by Ira Levin in 1967 was adapted for the screen in 1968. The story is of a young couple who move into a New York Apartment called 'the Bramford' a building with a haunting past. There, Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse (John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow) are befriended by Mr. and Mrs Castevet,(Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) an elderly couple who take an abiding interest in their new neighbors. Guy is a struggling actor who's stage career instantly improves with their help. Rosemary is interested in having children but suddenly discovers, Mrs. Castevet has invaded her life with intrusive advice and puzzling instructions. Eventually she evolves into a surrogate Mother-in-law. Following a nightmarish rape during a Satanic ritual, Rosemary becomes pregnant. There after the selected mother to be is smothered with attention and begins to doubt whether the attention is directed at anything but her child. Frightening in it's approach, the movie lays the foundation for a terrifying ordeal and the cast which includes Maurice Evans, Ralph Bellamy and Elisha Cook Jr. does a terrific take on the original novel. Written and directed by Roman Polanski, this film has become a dark Classic and a surprising cult movie. ****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's baby,"While Rosemary's Baby is often dubbed a horror film, the contemporary viewer may find that generic attribution confusing. Due to its slow pace and reliance on less-traditional formal tools to create suspense, Rosemary's Baby, like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), is best described as a psychological thriller or suspense story. Polanski's film, adapted from a novel by Ira Levin, isn't furnished with bloody murders and shocking off-screen entrances. Rather, what makes Rosemary's Baby terrifying is the sense of inevitability. Yes, this inevitability not only manifests itself in the plot, as Rosemary is incapable of stopping the plans set in motion by her neighbors, but from the audience as well. Polanski cues us in to the cult's true intent quite early with the aid of surrealistic dream sequence, so we're aware of Rosemary's potential fate far sooner than she is. Hitchcock once described the difference between surprise and suspense as involving the knowledge of the audience, concluding that in order to fully capitalize upon suspense, ""the public must be informed.""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

You'll realize quickly that the screenwriters high school English teacher forgot to explain the whole issue of ""show, don't tell"" to him. The characters have no depth or complexity, they're all black and white contributors to a black and white story line. This movie could have spent two hours developing the difficulty of the characters situations and trying to watch the audience empathize with them, instead you'll barely be able to empathize with the protagonist.

Flawless,"This is indeed a rare film, a sublime masterpiece, Roman Polanski's crowning achievement. Based upon the likewise-flawless novel by Ira Levin and virtually unaltered by Polanski, Rosemary's Baby is a work of art, a classic which stands alone to this day, never to be surpassed.Everyone knows the story by now; Mia Farrow is the sweet and innocent Rosemary Woodhouse who, along with her actor/husband Guy, finds the perfect apartment in New York. Despite a disreputable history, it seems the catalyst of good fortune for the happily married young couple. Their friendly, if somewhat brassy, neighbors are played to absolute perfection by Ruth Gordon (who received an Oscar for her efforts) and Sidney Blackmer. Despite some foreboding nightmares and the unfortunate accidental (?) death of a young woman, life is good for Rosemary and her husband, whose acting career seems to finally be taking off. But there's always a price to pay for good fortune. Unbeknownst to poor Rosemary, her husband has literally made a deal with the Devil. Shortly after a romantic dinner, some chalky chocolate mousse and the mother of all nightmares in which Rosemary is raped by a beast whilst her neighbors and husband look on, Rosemary discovers she is pregnant. But the pregnancy is a difficult one, her neighbors are not what they seem and the inevitable closes in around her over the course of nine long months time. Rosemary comes to believe that she and the baby are in danger, that her baby is a potential sacrificial victim for a coven of witches. The truth, however, is much, much worse.I've always thought of Rosemary's Baby as the blackest of black comedies, and of Rosemary as the butt of a very long and drawn-out practical joke. Fans of modern day horror films, used to gory death scenes and disposable heroes, will probably not appreciate the pace at which this film moves or its wry sense of humor. This is indeed a shame, because this film is everything that a good horror film should be; intelligent, subtle and almost rather dismissive of its own brilliance. The films climax is practically shrugged off by the characters who have brought it about. And Rosemary finally realizes that perhaps the only way to beat them is to join them; there is no fiercer predator than a mother defending her child, and as she accepts her role as the Mary of the Profane, we must wonder; will she triumph after all?I've hesitated to review this film for a long time, simply because I couldn't think of anything to say about it that hasn't already been said. It's a masterpiece, a work of art, an inspiration for many films to come, some good and some not so good. It continues to loom large over the genre, virtually untouchable and yet always accessible. No fan of film - horror or otherwise - should miss this. It truly deserves every word of praise it has ever earned.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The greatest horror film of all time!,"by naturalACTOR- The only newer horror film (say, 90's to present) that ever even slightly scared me, surprisingly, was ""The Blair Witch Project"". Notably, ""The Sixth Sense"" had one quite terrifying scene, but contained nothing else that was truly ""scary"". It's so hard to find an amazing horror title today that I've almost given up trying. Rosemary's Baby (1968) is not only a film that (no joke here) cannot be watched alone, but is the scariest, most horrifying film of all time.It's difficult to break it all down, because there is so much that contributes to the sheer fear this movie gives off. Firstly, Roman Polanski directs with some magic here, conjuring a well-written script into a haunting visual masterpiece. It is creepy how this film is so real, how the idea within its story doesn't seem very fictional. Mia Farrow plays Rosemary with frightening, twisted emotion. Her character even seems a little eerie at times when she begins to go too far with her accusations, and speaks as if somebody tortured her. John Cassavetes is unpredictable, and his character unreadable. He gives a solid performance, and Ruth Gordon, in her Oscar-winning portrayal of Minnie Castevet, brings the only light to this film, brewing a mix of nosiness and hilarity to her character.I've found that films about Satanists are the very scariest, including this one and Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" (1977). The film is shot smartly, and in a way that keeps the mystery, fear, and suspense tingling right to the very end. Again, Polanski is very masterful and careful about how he works this film, and how he directs his actors. If I had to pick the main reasons why this movie is so scary, and why it makes my hairs stick up so tall, it would have to be the camera work and directing, the story and script and how brilliantly it's played out, the simple feel and atmosphere, so unpredictable and creepy, the acting, done with malice and originality that I am still afraid to think about, and finally, the music.Krzysztof Komeda composes the most haunting, and definitive horror film score, a lullaby that produces goosebumps and that gets the mind racing through tunnels of fear, through darkness, acting as almost a prelude to what is to happen in the film. It would even be plausible to say that the wild, satanic flute music, and mainly the original score, account for almost all of the film's alarming mountain of horror.Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a unique horror film, one that is immensely scary, and also very well made. Never again will there be a better film of its kind. Polanski creates an air of dooming, prevalent fear and musically and plot-driven terror, but the greatest thing he achieves is the surpassing of Hitchcock's greatest works, in the same style--playing his own game, and coming out on top.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the Best!,"Undoubtedly, this film is certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made.  It is a chilling psycho-drama, a social commentary, and a good old-fashioned horror yarn all at once.  The story, of course, concerns a young Rosemary Woodhouse and her husband's journey in becoming tenants of a huge Brownstone called the Bram, where many evil, mysterious things have happened to/with its tenants over its long history.  The story unfolds, and we are caught up in what Rosemary sees, hears, and even thinks.  We feel her pain, anxiety, paranoia, and even fear.  We sense conspiracy all around us and want nothing more than security for her and her child to come.  This is due in large part to the masterful direction of one of the greatest directors of the screen...Roman Polanski.  Polanski shows us just enough and lets are imaginations kick in and conceive the horrors around us as only are minds can conjure.  The acting is extremely good in this film and it is in many ways a character actor's dream.  Ruth Gordon deservedly won an oscar for her portrayal of the nosy, loquacious Minnie Castavet.  Sidney Blackmer, playing her husband, also is equally good as an elderly man seemingly polite and good-natured but seething with hatred, evil, and delight in the pain of others.  Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, and Maurice Evans are also memorable in their roles.  Mia Farrow is very convincing as is her husband John Cassavetes.  William Castle, the great showman of the movies, produced this gem, and unquestionably it was his greatest collaborative effort. First-rate direction, top-notch acting, one heck of a good script based on Ira Levin's masterpiece of simplicity in story-telling all lead to one heck of a good film!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""He was in 'Luther' and 'Nobody Loves an Albatross...""","Poor young Rosemary!

Ok, I've already given you more than an appetizer, if you're the last person on Earth that hasn't seen it or read Ira Levin's book on which this Polanski chiller is based.

Terrible Movie,"I just watched this movie, and I must say it is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. The interactions between the stars were extremely awkward, the ""suspense"" wasn't exciting at all and the pace of the movie was far too slow. The plot is extremely obvious from the start and there was nothing to make the viewer think deeply. There were too many scenes that I would deem unnecessary, and without them, the movie might have been a little better. Many scenes seemed incredibly random and were not explained further anywhere else. The ending was lame and the loose ends could have been tied up much, much better. There was nothing remotely creepy or intense about it. This movie should not be classified as a ""thriller""; ""a bore"" would be more appropriate.

"A Perfect Film, For What It Is","For its genre, and really, for any genre, this film is a perfect film. Why is it so perfect? In my humble opinion, it is all in the absolutely superb storytelling. All of the dialog that slowly ensues throughout the movie offers the audience little clues bit by bit, unbeknownst to us, however. Unless you believe Rosemary from the outset at the point at which she begins to suspect what's happening to her, you really need to wait until the end of the film to see what was in store all along. And once you're at the end of the film, if you take a moment and think back of all the dialog served up by all the principles and key supporting players throughout the film...the Castevets (""my work takes me all over the world""), Hutch, Dr. Saperstein, Dr. Hill (""I need to take a blood sample from you...uhhh, a blood test""), and the sudden professional luck of Guy Woodhouse, it all becomes eerily plausible, and a perfectly (and sick, of course) planned scenario. I never read the book, but, I wonder if there are even more characters in on the whole plot. At any rate, this film presents a masterpiece of suspenseful and perfectly metered storytelling, and for this reason, I call it a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It didn't do that much for me,"Maybe its because I'm hard to scare, but ""Rosemary's Baby"" didn't work well for me.  I thought the urban paranoia was interesting and sometimes effective, but because I knew the Satanists' entire plan of action within the first five minutes of the movie, the suspense was spoiled (I won't kill the final discoveries for you.  That wouldn't be fair.  Just know that if you're experienced in these sorts of stories you'll have figured it out _way_ before Mia Farrow does).Movies like these depend on holding one crucial piece of information out of reach so that you'll figure it out at exactly the same time the character does.  If you get it too early, you spend too much time saying, ""No, dummy, it's over there!"", which makes me feel more frustrated than scared.So, while it wasn't a bad movie and kept my interest (and Ruth Goldman was amusingly dotty as the neighbor) it didn't scare me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Empathetic, bleak, foreboding, and beautiful","It is difficult for me to watch Rosemary's Baby. Maybe by some people's measure of film that makes it a poor one. I would understand that perspective, but I must disagree. Few films have been able to capture such a dour and oppressive atmosphere while at the same time being ethereally beautiful and compelling. It does incredibly justice to a fantastic book. This is in no small part due to an empathetic and earnest performance from Mia Farrow who plays Rosemary Woodhouse, energetic, young, beautiful and in love with her down and out yet devilishly charming husband Guy. Mia understood this character and she melted into the role, and it creates such a compelling want in the viewer to see her escape the hellish machinations of the films villains.Rosemary came from a big family, and she wants desperately to be a mother. We can tell she would be an excellent one. As the movie opens her relationship with Guy, played all to expertly by John Cassavetes, is a happy and lighthearted one. They joke and enjoy each other constantly embracing all while preparing for their future. They move into an absolutely stunning gothic building, named the Bramford, which is reasonably priced in no small part because of a series of unfortunate events that occurred in it's past. But the past isn't on Rosemary's mind, she thinks only of her future and how wonderful motherhood will be. Injected into her life, however, comes nosey neighbors who even in their advanced age have an otherworldly energy and fervor. They are excellently cast, chatty and welcoming with a demeanor that is both familiar and off-putting. Guy is taken with them, he is down and out actor and they flatter his theatrical abilities as criminally under noticed. His vanity comes to fore as the shots close in on the young and old couple exchanging niceties with drinks and food. Then, while Rosemary is in the kitchen helping with the dishes, smoke pours in from another room while Guy chats leisurely with Mr. Castevet.There are so many subtle ways in which the camera expresses a deep uneasiness to the viewer. Rosemary's Baby is the mother of many of the more cerebral and slow burn horror films of today, and still remains an exemplar of how to create a compellingly dark and frightening atmosphere without relying on a litany of monsters and jump scares. The horror of Rosemary's Baby comes from how Rosemary's earnest and commendable love for family and friends is twisted against her by the selfishness of both her partner and those around her, and from the callousness in which pregnancy and motherhood are treated by people who are sinister and uncaring.The direction and cinematography stand the test of time in more ways than one. Few movies can cultivate the kind of uneasiness achieved here and with such a measured tone and atmosphere. Visually, the exploration of both Rosemary and the Bamford Hotel is compelling from start to finish. Every shot is meaningful. It is colorful yet bleak and oppressive. I hated what occurred on screen, but I did not want to look away, I wanted to stick it out and see Rosemary reclaim her vision of motherhood and protect her child.It is hard for me to think of a more empathetic examination of the difficulties of motherhood. Her surroundings push an expectation on her without a thought for her own wellbeing or a modicum of nuance. The camera pours over Rosemary and you route for her in the face of tremendous adversity. Unfortunately selfishness and ingratitude all too often pervert and destroy a loving relationship, corrupting what should be beautiful and profound.Rosemary's Baby is not an easy watch, but it is a worthwhile one. Influential, expertly crafted, lovingly acted, and unyieldingly depressing, it remains one of the most important horror films to date. In the end, it left me with a deep appreciation for life and family, because some people never even get that much.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Timeless,"Interesting, well acted, and superbly well crafted- Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a thriller that is not only scary- but one that will always stand the test of time. The film is very well acted, most notably by Mia Farrow who plays Rosemary herself. The film is a bit slow at times, but at every interesting twist and turn, your attention is so forced upon the screen- its truly quite enjoyable. The set pieces and costumes are of the time, and deeply nostalgic in pleasure. The soundtrack is haunting and the cinematography and atmosphere is so as well. The film does feel like it could be about 10 minutes shorter, but even with its slow way of telling the tale, the film makes the best of what its got and makes for a truly suspenseful time.

Now watch that and see if you can sleep with your lights on. I was all fired up to be on the edge of my seat, but as the movie progressed I felt there wasn't going to be anything scary, a little bit of mystery yes since Rosemary does not know whether she is delusional or her neighbors are really out to get her baby., but that's about it.

A claustrophobic and well-paced horror film which will get under your skin,"Once Rosemary's Baby takes off, it becomes a brilliant psychological and claustrophobic horror film.After a woman gets pregnant, she becomes increasingly suspicious as a result of bizarre coincidences and occurrences. She then starts to expect the worst and slowly starts to dip into insanity.The film's construction is amazing. Things start off slow and then slowly build up. Things gradually pick up speed to make us more nervous. The events start off a bit slow at first but once the movie picks up, it keeps us on the edge of our seats and we're left on our seats dying to find out what happens next.This is definitely one of the more atmospheric, subtle, and creepy horror films out there. It's really rare that you find a film like this anymore. Most horror films are ""in your face"" nowadays but this one sneaks up on you and messes with your head throughout it.The score is amazing. The soft motherly voice and the shill instruments get under our skin and it sets up what kind of movie this is. Mia Farrow gave an outstanding performance. She did a great job setting scenes with her facial expressions. The other supporting actors and actresses were great but Mia did the best job.To be honest though, I saw the ending coming from a mile away. I'm not going to say what it is but it was very predictable. I would've been surprised if my prediction about what I think would happen wasn't correct. During the film, I thought ""I don't think they're going to do this. It would be way too predictable"".The ending needed work. It wasn't completely terrible but it wasn't all that surprising like I hoped it to be. Despite that, the movie is still a phenomenal work of horror. It's claustrophobic and it has a great pacing.

Sodom On The Hudson,"Anyone else play with the name ""Ira Levin"" and come up with ""Evil Rain""?""Rosemarie's Baby"" is so clever and audacious a film, it makes you want to come up with your own twists on its tightly-knotted storyline, a tale of a young woman named Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) who finds her idyllic Manhattan lifestyle shaken by a series of strange goings-on, not least of which involves her expected baby. Director Roman Polanski channels the best of Hitchcock and French New Wave cinema to come up with a new, ever-so-perverse, retelling of the Greatest Story Ever Told.That Rosemarie's baby has something to do with Evil Incarnate is what everyone knows about this film going in. But as so many reviewers here note quite well, the film is not your conventional horror flick, but something quite different, that uses atmosphere and mood to weave an eerie spell to stay with you long after the film is over.Seeing the film once is enough, but seeing it again really brings out the humor and pathos in this strange tale. Lines like the one Rosemarie says to her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), when she feels her baby kicking and notices he's shy about putting his hand on her belly: ""Don't be scared, it won't bite."" Or the strange girl Rosemary meets in the laundry room of the ""Black Bram,"" full of gratitude to the couple that took her in. ""Real grandparents,"" the girl calls them. ""They picked me up off the sidewalk."" The sidewalk is where she ends up, though, a few minutes later, one of the first signs something's wrong.Minutely faithful to Ira Levin's novel, Polanski nevertheless frames his film in such an imaginative way as to make it feel alive, and thus more chilling as it goes on, with its attention to Upper East Side decor, summer dresses that resemble paisley sofa covers, and of course the baroque architecture of the Bramford, i.e. the real-life Dakota apartments, whose own unhappy history give this film a guilty kick.That's too bad, because the film would stand up as well without any tragic real-life subtext. Farrow's performance (shades of Jean Seberg) is an amazing display of an actress in complete control as her character spins farther out of it. Though she was deprived of so much as an Oscar nomination (at least the Golden Globes weren't as asleep at the wheel), Ruth Gordon did win an Oscar playing a neighbor whose amiable kookiness conceals nasty depth, the best of a supporting cast that doesn't miss a trick, whether it be Ralph Bellamy as an unorthodox obstetrician or Elisha Cook as a fey doorman.The only performance many have caveats about is Cassavetes. Would not Robert Redford had worked better in the role of the struggling, amoral actor? Yet I find myself liking Cassavetes better the more I watch this film, his guilty laughter as he urges Rosemary to finish her chocolate ""mouse"" and wear her smelly charm. He really nails a deeper sense of evil on offer, with his callous comments to Rosemary and his nasty way with a joke, at peace with a world that can ask, on the cover of Time magazine: ""Is God Dead?"" Existential dread is at the heart of this film, and Guy presents a post-Christian figure that Cassavetes nails down from beginning to end.Polanski and Farrow give the best work. He frames every shot with the kind of depth and focus that reminds you of Hitchcock at his peak, while she, eerily resembling Twiggy, sets a standard for '60s glamour and acting prowess that makes you wonder how she failed to find worthy projects in the next decade. It wasn't really until the 1980s, as Woody Allen's muse, that she had the opportunity to develop a real body of work. It's like this film had some kind of curse on it.Of course, talking about curses and ""Rosemary's Baby"" makes you realize Mia got off rather lightly in comparison. My random music machine just played selections from John Lennon and Frank Sinatra in tandem, and now I really have the creeps. So will you, when you give this a chance. Creepiness is a harder trick to pull off in movies than raw shock, and here is a film that sets a standard few, if any, have come close to matching.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest horror movies,"Whenever I watch this movie, I nearly forget that this is a horror movie. It's because this is such a well-made movie...there is actually a story in this movie and it is told in a captivating way.  Nonetheless, the director, Roman Polanski added just the right amount of suspense and shock to make this a definite horror film.  He did not need to include any gory or intensely graphic scenes in this movie. Yet, the movie is scary enough. This movie stars the great Mia Farrow in an awesome, amazing performance. Angel-faced Mia, turns in a marvelous performance as the tragic heroine, Rosemary.  It was quite a feat for Mia, who was only 22 years old when she made this movie.  She's wonderful as the leading character in this movie, and her transformation in the movie from a doe-eyed beauty to a gaunt waif is startling.  John Cassavetes also does a good job playing Rosemary's ambitious husband who's willing to sell his soul to achieve success.  And, Ruth Gordon is superb as their eccentric, devil-worshipping older neighbor. You can't help but feel for poor Rosemary. She initially believes that those closest to her are people that she can trust.  Little by little, she discovers that all those people are plotting against her, and that she's basically on her own. It's horrible to know that she's surrounded by all of those occult-practicing people, yet she can't really do anything about it...she can only accept it.  One of the best things about this movie is the editing--I really liked the way that certain images were superimposed on some of the scenes.  It was like seeing a collage come to life.  The editing is especially noteworthy during the rape scene.  The rape scene is outstanding, frightening, and spellbinding all at the same time.  It's also worthy to point out that sometimes music can do a lot for a movie.  If a movie is good, the right music can make the movie even better; it can set the appropriate mood for the movie.  That's the case with this movie and it's theme song, ""Lullaby"".  Overall, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a terrific movie. One of the greatest horror movies ever made, and one of Roman Polanski's best movies. **** out of ****.",,Anonymous,Horror

Rosemary's Baby took some cues from Hitchcock's work, but by its own right it revolutionized horror cinema, and had a huge part in inspiring classics from Jaws to The Shining and The Thing - films that took to heart the lesson that nothing is scarier than nothing, and maintain tension and terror throughout with very little actually happening.Partly thanks to the film's minimalistic nature (most of it takes place in one apartment, not unlike Repulsion) and the refusal to rely on special effects, and partly thanks to Polanski's inspired directorial work, Rosemary's Baby stood the test of time better than any horror film of its time - indeed, better than most films of the 60's. Young viewers more accustomed to slasher horror may scoff at how little happens, but once you start watching the feeling of terror and discomfort grows and it's impossible not to be taken in, especially if you've anywhere near the protagonists' age. Mya Farrow and John Cassavetes are terrific in the leads, probably delivering the most powerful performances in their careers; and their show is nearly stolen by the irritating, charming, creepy, lovable Ruth Gordon (who won a very deserved Oscar for her part).Very few films are as timeless as Rosemary's Baby, and few are as absorbing and effective. A must-see for every film lover.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting but not quite intriguing enough, at least not in 2021.","I can see why this movie was great back in the 60's, but in 2021 it doesn't stand a chance and becomes rather boring, but in someway deep down you know there is something interestingly different.I found the plot itself to be quite tedious and it definitely didn't feel like a horror by todays standards, but the tone and atmosphere is was sold me, and what kept me hooked, not so much the story. You definitely know something is wrong from the first look inside the apartment and the characters you are introduced to through the movie. You start to ask questions like ""Is this all in her head?"" or ""Who are all of these old people"" Questions that linger in your mind as you slowly creep closer towards the end.The pacing is great and the way they chose to work with the different colors is interesting. In every seen you can really see the way they used the wide aspect of the color scheme to illustrate different emotions, give warnings and tell you about what's to come. Diffrent colors like an all white room with a single red painting really pops in your eyes, or the blue color on a shirt, which I found particularly interesting to keep my eyes peeled for.But... to be honest I don't know who I would recommend this to in modern times.
I just don't have the feeling that the newer generation, such as myself really need to experience the movie. It was alright to look for the different aspects they used at the time, but the entertainment value wasn't really there. It also became quite a slog at times, which I think a lot of people will find if they are having their first viewing adventure in 2021.
Instead I think this is truly a movie for the people feeling nostalgic for it and the way It portrayed horror at the time it came out.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Film But The Scare Value Is Massively Over-Hyped.,"Rosemary's Baby has been out now for 47 years and I finally decided to see what all the hype was about by recently watching it, and I must say that it is indeed not too bad of a movie. I actually had this pinned down as (probably) being one of the most over-hyped films ever made but it's actually a very decent and intriguing psychological thriller (this isn't a horror for me).Is it one of the best ""horror"" films ever made? Not even close, and I do think the scare factor it's been given by people definitely is over-hyped, but like I say, it is a very decent film that is worth watching.It's also a pretty slow-paced movie, but because the story is told well and it holds your interest decently enough you don't really feel the lack of pace, and you do get drawn into it all. Story is obviously the main element here, and it's that, along with the acting & atmosphere, that keeps you watching.Speaking of acting...there are some moments where it's a bit dodgy or over-the-top, but this film was made in '68 so some of the performances will seem a touch melodramatic by today's standards. In saying that, however, I do think Mia Farrow gives a great performance as the sweet & innocent, yet somewhat naive, Rosemary.As I mentioned earlier, I think the scare factor hype has been amped way up and I always scratch my head in wonderment when people say they found it extremely scary/creepy as I personally never found it to be either of those. I guess it proves that different people find different things scary. I mean I know of people who have said The Exorcist isn't creepy/scary yet for me that film completely pacifies Rosemary's Baby. I wasn't expecting a ""boo!"" or gory film, and a film doesn't have to have those elements to be scary for me, but while it was disappointing on that side, other aspects held my interest enough for me to enjoy it.Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it, especially if you enjoy films that cater more towards the psychological element.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best horror film of the 60's!,"Since the beginning of the cinema, ghosts, monsters, vampires, mummies and werewolves were a hit, but in 1968 three films changed the horror genre forever ""The Night of the Living Dead"", ""The Devil Rides Out"" and ""Rosemary's baby"", this third film with a plot about satanism and witchcraft, two subjects used before in the long of the 60's, but ""Rosemary's baby"" went further. A realistic story about a witchcraft coven and their satanic wishes. Based on Ira Levin book, the film is totally loyal to it. Roman Polanski direction is perfect, obviously this is his best film, the performances are wonderful, mainly Mia Farrow, the cinematography is creepy and the film locations are fabulous, this team between cinematographer and set decorator brought an incredible atmospheric work. ""Rosemary's baby"" is a masterpiece, one of the greatest horror films ever made!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"What I love most about this movie isn't that it's scary, it's that I almost forget that I'm watching a horror movie in the first half of the film.","Sure we have that dark and foreboding lullaby (that is so hauntingly beautiful you'll be humming it for days!!!!) at the very beginning to set the tone, shortly followed by a suicide, but after that, besides a couple trippy dream sequences, this movie isn't too much different than other New Hollywood dramas.Rosemary's actual pregnancy doesn't even start until the 52-minute mark of the film. This means that those first 50 minutes are used to add some color to the world before the psychological elements come into effect. If you had just shown me the first 50 minutes of this film and not a second more, outside of one truly despicable instance, I'd say that Guy was a charming and good husband to Rosemary and that their relationship was an absolute delight to watch. I thought they had witty bantering, good chemistry, and that their main issue in the relationship (being Guy's self-centeredness due to him being an actor) was something that could cause issues but was more than manageable especially since Rosemary is a god-tier waifu deserving of the #mustprotecc trademark.There are so many moments in this film where Mia Farrow was super cute and I couldn't handle it. That little dance she does when she found out she was pregnant... ughhh it kills me :D. Mia plays the role of the utterly sweet and caring wife to perfection and is so easy to fall in love with her. I get so mad at Guy when he insults her haircut. (Granted, her original bob cut is probably my favorite hairstyle of all time. I mean just look at my Characters That I've Crushed On list) Yet, Rosemary is more than a pretty face. She's a relatable protagonist that makes sensible decisions despite the messed-up situation she either perceives herself to be in or is unfortunate enough to be placed in. And right up until the reveal at the end, we are taken on this psychological trip where we see this beautiful and graceful woman slowly become more and more sickly and frantic. It's awful to watch, yet no matter the outcome, we still need to know whether Rosemary's baby is going to be safe from the sinister plot or from Rosemary herself.To summarize, unlike a lot of films of the horror genre, this story puts a lot of care into giving the characters personalities that start off as really likable but get twisted as the plot unfolds. The ending might seem cheesy by today's standards (in 1968 oh boy it must've been a sight to behold) but I actually really admire that the story is as in your face as it is with its reveal while holding back no punches (other than giving the viewer a good look at Rosemary's baby itself since it probably would have looked cheesy). It treads the line very well on the is she or isn't she crazy for most of the film and for them to give us a definite answer to that question in a manner that is as entertaining as it is for subject matter as dark as it pertains, I find it to be ironically hilarious! In fact, I wouldn't even be surprised if Polanski intended for the ending to be funny much like Ari Aster intended for both Hereditary and Midsommar (which is heavily inspired by this film) of his films. Regardless, the ending will forever be iconic as will Mia's legendary performance, as will Krzysztof Komeda's haunting film score.I love this movie! One of My Favorite Movies! And one of the best psychological horror movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Eat Your Liver, Rosemary","Quite simply, one of the best horror movies ever made.""Rosemary's Baby"" is terrifying, and it remains terrifying every time I see it. I watch this, and then I watch what passes today for horror movies (""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake is an example), and I simply shake my head in awe and dismay at how far the horror film has fallen.Everything about this movie hits the right notes. The acting is expert, especially Mia Farrow's hugely underrated performance as the impressionable Rosemary. Roman Polanski's direction is perfect; he eschews the shock horror approach used by directors like William Friedkin and instead creates a subtly creepy atmosphere, ratcheting up the tension gradually until you're ready to jump out of your skin. The production design and cinematography are off-kilter in ways you can't quite define. And the musical score, all plucked strings and jangling piano chords (except for the sinister lullaby that opens the film), is nerve-wracking.Because every element of the film comes together so well, this supernatural tale feels as realistic as it could possibly be, and one feels that if there is indeed such a thing as the coming of an Anti-Christ, it would happen something like this.With John Cassavetes, superbly slimy as the sell-out husband; Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, as the Jewish grandma and grandpa from Hell (literally); Ralph Bellamy as a crooked doctor; and, most effectively, Maurice Evans, poor Rosemary's only ally.Any number of scenes could qualify as creepiest, but my personal favorite is the one in which Rosemary uses a Scrabble game set to make sense of an anagram. I get shivers just writing about it.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dated, but of historical curiosity","I saw this movie a few years back and I just want to note something that I found intriguing about it. Before that, however, I'll just provide a brief synopsis of the plot: a newly married couple move into a town-house & prepare for the birth of their new child. An element of surreality does enter into the equation & I suppose part of of hook of the movie is wondering whether the wife's paranoia about her unborn child's nature is well founded or hysterical. In the movie, there are hints that her circumstances are a vast conspiracy-involving her husband, neighbours and...Satan!One thing that this movie did clear up, was the question of what inspired the ""Tupperware witches"" sketches in the Australian sketch comedy show ""Fast Forward"". I think that this movie may have been the source of these sketches!Interestingly, an SBS TV (Australia) documentary in September 07 entitled ""The history of the Devil"" mentioned this movie too, along with another movie that I've reviewed here, The Exorcist. I'll mention those points below, but first a warning...the comments below are spoilers, to a lesser or greater extent. Maybe read the stuff below after you've watched the movie.Potential spoilers: In the documentary above, The Exorcist is described as a Christian fightback to this movie, in that in Rosemary's Baby, the Devil triumphs. The Exorcist sees Good triumphing over Evil.Rosemary's Baby is described as a product of the counter-cultural movement during the Vietnam War in the 1960's, a time when The Establishment (Government, Capitalism and Religion) were viewed with suspicion and hostility. During this time, Satanism was seen by some as an antidote to The Establishment.Anyway, I wasn't overly impressed with this movie. It's OK. what I did find intriguing was the implication that God did a poor job designing humans. In the metaphysical conflict between Good and Evil, God seems to have made a monumental mistake in allowing a woman's maternal instinct to over-ride eternal consequences.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Boo-boo. Well done horror flick.,"I do not like Polanski's films at all. But he did a good job here. The movie is just plain creepy.Mia Farrow does a really great job here. You really feel for her as she struggles (and fails) to climb out of the pit of hell she's been placed in.The scene where she's drugged at the beginning and raped by the devil is done well and unnervingly eerie. Having experience with drugging and raping young women himself, Polanski really knew what he was doing. I'm a bit surprised that Mia Farrow's character was so old though.All of the drama revolves around Mia trying to crawl out from under the power, and influence, of her evil conspiratorial neighbors.Cassavetes does a great job selling his wife down the River, and off to the ""dark side"", in exchange for acting roles. Parts he read for, but couldn't land on his own; were suddenly his, with the aid of his Pagen buddies putting hexes of blindness & death on his competition. It appears Cassavetes was not under any spell to have his wife drugged & raped by the devil himself. Nor was he under any spell to keep her quiet (and terrorized) throughout the pregnancy. Instead, it was just good old fashioned avarice; which makes him the most despicable man/husband ever in the movies.This It's not a movie you want to take in but once every 30 years maybe. But, it is certainly a movie that should be viewed once because it's very well done.And all the players (especially Farrow), really do a great job.ThxBob R.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Predecessor of the ""Satanic films"" of the 70s","""Rosemary's baby"" (1968) is a mixture of a haunted house and a Satanic film. It is part of the appartment trilogy that further consists of ""Repulsion"" (1965) and ""The tenant"" (1976).In a haunted house film the location is always very important. It needs more than some cobwebs to make a location suitable for a haunted house movie. Robert Wise did understand this ans chose Ettington Park in Warwickshire as the location for the exterior shots of his film ""The haunting"" (1963). Roman Polanski also understands the importance of location. He chose the Dakota builing in New York as location (and called it the fictional Bramford buidling). In the film it is said that the building had a evil history of deadly accidents. In reality the building would have an evil future of deadly accidents. In 1980 John Lennon would be killed just outside the Dakota building.In horror movies the question always is if the evil comes from the outside or from the inside. In other words is it real or just imagined? In ""Repulsion"" (the first film of the ""appartment trilogy"") it is clear that the evil is imagined.In ""Rosemary's baby"" the answer to this question is not clear for a long time. There are many scenes in which Rosemary (Mia Farrow) hears or sees things through a door that is half open and half closed. So she bases her ""complot theory"" on imperfect (but not non existing) information. Only in the closing scenes the scales tip to evil from the outside.I have not seen ""The tenant"" yet, so I can't answer the question for this film.""Rosemary's baby"" was a starting point for various ""Satanic films"" in the 70s. I am referring to films such as ""The exorcist"" (1973, William Friedkin) and ""The omen"" (1976, Richard Donner). ""Rosemary's baby"" is about the birth of Satan's son, ""The omen"" about his upbringing. ""The omen"" can however not be regarded as a sequel to ""Rosemary's baby"" because Rosemary doesn't die in giving birth. Striking however is the role of (also Satanic) nannies in both films. In ""The omen"" Mrs Baylock (Billie Whitelaw) is this nannie, in ""Rosemary's baby"" the aging couple Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) takes on this role.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A pretty good ""classic""","""Rosemary's Baby"" always ends up being a satisfying watch. It takes its time getting there but by the end, it delivers. It is well acted by most of the cast. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are the two stand outs. I wouldn't put ""Rosemary's Baby"" on any Top Ten list. It's a famous movie but it doesn't reach the level of a classic. That said, after it ends I'm always glad I watched it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Virgin Mary Had God In The Flesh. Rosemary Had Satan In The Flesh.,"I love classic movies, and about this time 6 years ago, my youth pastor lent me his DVD of Rosemary's Baby so I could see it. I really enjoyed it, but it took a 2nd viewing to fully appreciate the movie. I would concur with a majority of people that Rosemary's Baby is one of the creepiest, and finest, horror movies ever made.Rosemary is a newlywed woman who moves into a hotel with weird neighbors, who obsess over making sure her first pregnancy goes as right as rain. What's even stanger is that she got knocked up after having a dream where Satan rapes her. Is she just crazy, or is there more going on than it seems?Rosemary's Baby is led by some great performances, particularly Mia Farrow's, who plays Rosemary, and brilliantly displays her range of emotions with her unusual pregnancy. John Cassavettes is great as her husband, and so are their new friends played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer.However, Rosemary's Baby works best as its genre piece, a horror film. Without any bloodbaths or gore, Rosemary's Baby is a very effective psychological horror- the fear comes from an intenseness of knowing what has caused the baby's conception while Rosemary herself is uncertain.The climax, which takes up over a half hour of the film, builds up as the baby's birth is coming and Rosemary fears that her baby is in danger, and the reveal of the truth is disturbing as the fact itself. Again, the tenseness makes up the horror rather than blood and gore. I've seen the movie twice, and even the 2nd time, the tension was a bit much to handle- I guess since I knew the result, it gave me more sympathy for Rosemary.Rosemary's Baby also plays into the fact that Rosemary is a lapsed Catholic. While she has doubts about her religious upbringing, there are still close ties to her lost faith and her pregnancy. For one thing, The Virgin Mary has God in the flesh, and Rosemary has Satan in the flesh. The baby was even born in June 1966, or 6/66, a reference to The Mark of the Beast in Revelation.In one scene, Rosemary tells her friend that the pregnancy causes her a ton of pain and one of her friends tells her to see another doctor. She sobs that she's not going to have an abortion, and her friends tell her that's not what they are saying. It's clear that even though her Catholic beliefs are lacking, her values in the faith have not. (Also consider that this movie was released 5 years before Roe V. Wade was decided and the story is set 2 years before that.)I told my Pastor about the movie after seeing it the 2nd time (I'm a Lutheran, and many Lutherans hold to pro-life values just like Catholics), and I asked him what the church would do if such a thing were to actually happen? He admitted that he didn't know, but I told him that I heard a Catholic say that you could have the baby baptized and hope that would cure the devil in the baby, and he said ""There you go.""So while I can't sympathize with the far fetched pro-choice argument implied in Rosemary's Baby, it's still a very effective and creepy horror movie and it stands as one of the best in the genre even 56 years later, a feat that few horror films can so richly match on this level.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Satanism, devil-worshipping, witchcraft and possession","This was one of the first mainstream horror movies about Satanism, devil-worshipping, witchcraft and possession, five years before William Friedkin's The Exorcist made its mark on history. Rosemary's Baby was Roman Polanski's first American film, after he had earned a name for himself worldwide through European films such as Noz w wodzie and Repulsion. And the trip across the Atlantic didn't seem to Americanize him too much - he kept his delicate playfulness and command of the medium. Polanski was a master at utilizing props for thematic effect, sometimes subtly, sometimes more outright, and that is very much valid also for Rosemary's Baby. Nothing is left to chance in this film, and certainly not the cinematography, as William A. Fraker trails Mia Farrow throughout the movie, and not with one ounce of pity.One of the highlights of this iconic film is a wonderful dream-sequence, which in many ways also is its turning point. Polanski piles on so many narrative and thematic elements here that the scene ultimately becomes a thought-provoking chaos of imagery. Throughout the rest of the film, Polanski reaps the benefits of this segment, as Rosemary delves deeper and deeper into her predicament.The ending is one for interpretation, but perhaps not in the way some would have hoped. Because how can those cosy geriatrics really be anything than nice? The threat they pose has all the way been thematic and implicit, which towards the end may make it less palpable seeing as their characters remain good-natured. The only really dishonest person in the film is Guy - so perhaps actors and filmmakers are the real target here?Notwithstanding, Rosemary's Baby is two hours of meticulously built suspense. Not only has Polanski derived Hitchcock's delightful lack of consideration for his protagonist and viewers, but he also manages to create a uniquely stylistic horror movie without even mentioning SFX. And as Mia Farrow peeks into the bassinette, we don't even get to see little Adrian's eyes, which is far from what Linda Blair had to suffer for the art five years later.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Rosemary's Baby,"I thought Rosemary's baby was a very interesting and spooky movie. I love scary movies because they are so unpredictable. The movie consisted of lots of dark lighting and pretty average camera work and a variety of short takes. It is about a couple, Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, who move in to a kind of creepy apartment in Manhattan. They become friends with the old couple next door but weird things began happening to Rosemary that started to freak her out and Guy starts to spend a lot of time with the older couple especially after their ward committed suicide. A woman Rosemary met while doing laundry one day suddenly died a very mysterious death then Rosemary began to hear strange noises and even had a scary dream where a weird scary monster type thing makes love to her. Guy became very distant after Rosemary told him all the weird things she was going through. After she delivered the baby, she found out that her neighbors had other plans for her son. When she awoke after the birth, they told her that her son was dead but then she heard him crying in the next room over and went to see what was going on. After she walked up to her son, who was surrounded by the neighbors, she saw a devilish look in his eye and that's when they told her that her baby was the spawn of Satan. The movie ends with the people trying to convince Rosemary to raise the baby and how she didn't have to join the cult if she didn't want to. The movie ends with Rosemary holding her son and kind of smiling so you don't know what she plans on doing in the future with him which just adds to the overall spooky vibe of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
All that build up to an unsatisfactory ending....!,"I was searching for some great horror movies, and this name recurred in several lists, so I went ahead and saw this movie and was bitterly disappointed to say the least.The plot is engaging and intriguing on the onset, and the movie has an overall vintage kind of feel which raises your expectations from the film. But as the movie proceeds you will think like you are up for some unforeseen magic on the celluloid, like someone is lifting you up in the air to exalt you but in the end that someone will let you go, and you will fall flat on the ground utterly dissatisfied and dejected.When it comes to acting in the movie, Mia Farrow has done a fine job. John Cassavetes on the other hand is very unconvincing. The chemistry between them seems forced rather than organic. Other actors have done their bit satisfactorily.The story is suitable to be told in novel format only. Although the movie kind of grows on you, like someone taking you to the edge of the mountain just so you could appreciate the view, but then instead that someone pushes you off the cliff, the ending of the film does that ""pushing off the cliff"" thing here. The ending just blows a blatant hole in the entire plot and you end up thinking ""Did I just watch the entire movie for this..?""Being so highly rated in so many lists on IMDb and elsewhere I expected a lot more from the movie, but it fell miles short of my expectations.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thoughtful Horror Masterpiece that should be viewed at least once in a lifetime,"'Rosemary's Baby' is remembered as one of the greatest and most important horror movies of all-time, and for good reason, it's a masterful example of horror realism, featuring a combination of unnerving psychological terror, strong storytelling and most importantly it's a critique on society that deals with heavy themes that are still relevant to this day. This movie is a firm classic of the horror genre plain and simple.The Plot = A young couple Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) and his wife Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) move into an old apartment building where they find themselves surrounded by strange neighbours and soon enough Rosemary becomes pregnant and that's where things become even more unsettling.A masterpiece of suspense and perfectly directed by Roman Polanski who expresses realism in how he visually tells the story and in what the story's about by tapping into our real fears about religion, loss of control and the aspect of female pregnancy. While most horror films focus on blood and gore, this relies on a slow build of narrative tension, precise character portrayals, social commentary, and paranoia. The atmosphere is eerie and full of dread thanks to the fantastic cinematography and fluid camera work that brings everything to life.Mia Farrow gives a perfect performance as Rosemary with her natural demure and fragility appearance that's central to her character, perfectly conveying believability, and sympathy in what's perhaps her greatest role of her entire career. John Cassavetes is equally impressive in his role as the husband Guy and delivers superb menace and intrigue to his role. Ruth Gordon delivers an iconic steal stealing performance as the neighbour managing to be both disturbing and humorous at the same time and well deserved her Oscar win.Overall 'Rosemary's Baby' is a thoughtful and yet intriguing horror masterpiece that should be viewed by everyone at least once in a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Roman,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Took advantage of the re-release of this Polanski classic with a family trip to the Magnolia Theatre.  Tremendous script with Polanski at his finest with creepy camera angles and lighting. Really paid attention to the performances this time and came away with even greater admiration for the one and only Ruth Gordan and her on screen husband Sidney Blackmer.  Even Mia Farrow's performance was better than I remembered.  Cassavetes was a bit stiff, but Maurice Evans was terrific. Fun to see a young Charles Grodin.  Yeah, there is a ton of interesting background info with the connections between Polanski/Farrow, Farrow/Sinatra, Polanski/Sharon Tate (who appears briefly in this one) and the subsequent horrific tale of the Charles Manson clan.  In spite of that, this is a wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby is so surreal,"A fine example of classic horror with a script that was truly ahead of its time. Despite its at some points hammy acting, it still surprisingly holds up very well for today standards. This certainly is the definition of a slow-burn however, though most top-tier horror is. Its pacing may seem as an issue to some, but it certainly pays off with a bone-chilling climax that will leave you contemplating the movie far long after viewing. This remains to be a prime example of what good psychological/satanic horror should be, I only hope its legacy lives on as inspiration to the future of horror directors. Rosemary's Baby is one of the best horror films of all time not because it is one of the scariest, but because of how confident it is in its horror. You could argue that the most terrifying things in this film all happen off camera. If you watched the first hour with no prior knowledge of the film, you might well mistake it for a slightly uneasy drama about urban life. It is a sheer masterclass in subtlety and slow dread.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is the first movie of hers I've watched and she is just incredible here, a performance for the generations and surprised she didn't become even bigger than she was.As for the script itself, brilliant and suspenseful in almost every scene, the 2 plus hours pass by very quickly. Without giving anything away, the dynamics between the old couple neighbours and Mia Farrow and her husband is superb, as is pretty much everybody else that's on screen.The soundtrack I personally found haunting and very much matches the era.

"Creepy, Atmospheric, Great Acting","If this movie had been made in the 1990s or even at the turn of the 21st century I don't believe it would have been as interesting or creative as it is. There is something about swinging 1960s that makes this movie a treasure -- the modern 1960s goes gothic in a way.Of course, no matter what you may think of director Roman Polansky personally, one cannot deny that he has made a mark here, showing style and wit as well as horror. It stand the test of time. Rosemary's Baby still manages to scare, not with blood (although there is a little at the beginning) or cheap shock tactics but with psychological weaving like one would not believe.Ruth Gordon, as neighbor Minnie, is both bizarrely funny and totally creepy, as is her husband, Roman, of whom you might want to call ""Grandpa"" one moment then ""Master of Evil"" a moment after that. Also fun seeing Pasty Kelly who is so out of place as a Satan worshipper that you know, all at once, that she is perfectly cast.I love this movie because it did what it set out to do, scare me (and leave a lasting impression), and give it 4 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby,"İt's very interesting film, with its topic and events acted in movie. Also, the acting efficiency of actors is perfect. While watching this work, I easily imagined myself in the screenplay, I felt pessimistic, scared and curious about the subsequent events. I think it's the result of the actors' fantastic acting performance. Furthermore; passages are prepared carefully, anyone watching movie doesn't able to predict ""what's going to be in movie"" and waits the next scene. With these aspects, Rosemary's Baby is really a successful ""drama, horror and mystery"" movie. If we talk it's another aspects, the characters in the movie are good organized so, roles are generally comprehensible. Besides, the feelings of Rosemary and Guy can easily be sensed. You can feel desperately sad as if you were the parents of the baby. Roles are generally understandable but I think some scenes can be eliminated, in these eliminative scenes I was bored and these parts can be seen as really complex scenes. Other than this complexity, movie begins in slow pace, and you start to identify the characters. After this identifying process movie becomes to be interesting and mysterious, from this part on you cannot be distracted, you totally focus on the events. During this passionately watching period, facts are started to shown and they surprise the viewer. Then, on the movie finale, all facts are clarified. I can frankly say that the ending of the film is terrific. Finally, no matter how old the film is, with its plot and all the things it makes feel it can be figured out that Rosemary's Baby is really fantastic movie. Also it is on the top 250 list of Internet Movie Database and I think it is one of the most worth watching films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

But saying this, the film instantly grabbed my intention.More of an supernatural thriller, Rosemary baby starts off very much like an soap opera, starting off with an couple finding an apartment, inviting guests for dinner. Nothing particular horrifying so far. But the scene that I see Rosemary baby being known by is the hallucination part. The first scene that makes you feel uncomfortable. No doubt is this the best hallucination I've seen so far in any film. It was chilling and eerie. Not once do you believe Rosemary is safe. Polanski creates the perfect atmosphere. Just like Rosemary, you feel trapped and surrounded by monsters all the way through the film.The acting is top notch. Mia is brilliant as Rosemary and Cassavetes plays the perfect husband. But its Ruth Gordon who shines. At first I found here rather annoying but as the film progresses you come to accept here and enjoy here character , who always liven up the scenes .Even though the film is great is watch , it can come tedious and slow . This mainly because after half an hour, you know who's who . I guessed the ending very early on. Despite all the positives , it not a film which I would want to watch again and again . I could watch it a second time but it not that great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A supsense thriller of the supernatural,"This is my all time favorite movie.  I love it and I think its a great example of a movie made in the late sixties era.  Mia Farrow is just wonderful, I loved her style and acting in the movie.  It was very suspensful and not very bloody but it still can be known as a horror movie. Anything dealing with the devil is worse than any slasher movie b/c the devil very well exist in our everyday lives.  I do wish that they would have shown what the baby looked like b/c all you know is that his eyes must not appear normal.  If you haven't seen this movie pls rent it, and if you have seen it then pls read the book.  I was very disapointed with the second book ""Son of Rosemary"" but the first book was very very good.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepily Enjoyable,"It's absolutely worth a watch. Polanski does a stellar job of creating a suspenseful tension that builds through the film. In the end, it felt somewhat long. I would give it a 7.5 if I could, as that seems most accurate.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overrated and doesn't quite qualify as horror,"All right, I kind of liked the visual style. There's interesting use of color and lighting which reminded me of Dario Argento's style. Also the story with a supernatural element of witchcraft has a lot in common with, say, Suspiria. That's the only thing that makes this film somewhat horror and somewhat good.But mostly it is boring and irritating. Yes, it does create an anxious feeling but that is not horror. That's psychological thriller or something. When the film goes on it does become a little bit better when the secrets are revealed, and I was feeling hopeful that it could still become relatively good. But the ending was disappointing. All the slow buildup goes to garbage.I can't give a real bottom rating because the directing and acting are basically good, but overall it's a movie that I don't see any point in watching. I'm glad I finally watched it through once so that I know what it is. But don't need to watch ever again.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosamary's baby,"Rosemary and Guy Woodhouseare are a couple who move into a new apartment of their dream together in New York. However rose couldn't like their elderly neighbors, Minnie and Roman Castevet even if they are pretty helpful, friendly to them. As every couple, Rosemary and her husband's intention is to have a baby. But one day Rosa mary has a strange and weird dream which seems rather genuine to her. She is raped by someone who seems absolutely inhuman. when she wakes up, she could realize the scars on her body but thought she and her husband had sex together. After that, she becomes pregnant assuming that she would have a normal baby. While she is unaware of anything, Minnie and Roman get closer with Guy taking care of Rosamery's pregnancy. After some weird events, she finds out something strange goes on around her and the unborn baby. And she struggles to save it. But she fails as her doctor, husband and nearly everyone around are involved in these events which aim to get her baby for some satanist rituals. Eventually, she gives birth to her lovely(!) baby on her bedroom's bed while trying to escape from her husband and doctor. But the baby is not human but a Satan with too big and weird eyes. At first it is hard for her to accept it, later she does and the movie ends up in this way. When the date is taken into account (1968), l think the movie is amazing and successful ! İt is also authentic and fast- paced. the author has a unique way to make unordinary scenes come alive hypnotizing the audience. The movie stands out ! İt has completely interesting story as horror thriller which will certainly hold your attention. There is always a genuine concern about what will happen to the distinctive individuals involved. Still it is quite entertaining !",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure period style suspense fun,"""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968): Even the very young & cute Mia Farrow could barely carry off that ""Twiggy"" look of 1965-68, and yes, there are other ""period"" clues in this film: the camera work has that ""trippiness"" when she's (possibly) in another consciousness, the music has a druggy sound to it at times, the ""high fashion"" was often at a low point...but this film is STILL a great exercise in PARANOIA. WHO is imagining WHAT? WHY is she suspecting THAT? Is Rosemary nuts? If not, are THEY in on it? John Cassevettes plays her patient husband, the crazy Ruth Gordon who won the Oscar for her role, as one of their neighbors, many character actors you'll recognize...and they all add up to an increasingly tense, psychological-horror film that shook up EVERYONE in 1968. Pure period style fun.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Holds up, could have been filmed yesterday.","A great film from the mind of Roman Polanski, one of the masters of twentieth century suspense. Over the course of time, this film has stood the test, remaining horrifying to an entirely new audience. The suspense is fantastic, and the characters well developed. Without a doubt, one of the films that should be on every movie fans list.Mia Farrow plays an innocent, naive woman, who mature's overnight, in lieu of her motherly instinct in reaction to losing her child. The fear of losing her baby is countered only by the realization that keeping it possibly entails endangering the fate of the human race.an interesting note about this film, Mia farrow was going to walk off the production because her then husband Frank Sinatra wanted her to quit. Robert Evans the producer told her that the buzz on the street was she would win the Oscar for best actress. Her response was ""Frank who?""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror for grownups,"The film starts in New York and is slow at first, an attractive young couple find and move into a new apartment. We learn a little about their desires and aspirations. There's some really good realism throughout these early scenes, we feel like a fly on the wall. Also the dialogue is nice and natural too, it doesn't sound too polished or scripted. The film is slow, we gradually meet more characters and begin to delve more into the urban environment of the characters. Slowly a change does start to come over our main character. She loses much of her energy and warmth and cheerfulness. The film starts to make you feel a bit paranoid and you get a creeping sense of unease. It's all very well executed. It is not difficult to get frustrated with the main character, it's so obvious there's something going on but she is so behind the viewer it's frustrating to watch at times. The film though does have lots of nice themes and subtext you can delve into. The costumes are all very adult, the men all wear suits and the Rosemary's dress style also changes over the course of the film. There's one really good tense scene involving a phone box which I liked a lot. Also a heatwave adds to oppression are main character feels. The film I suppose could be seen as a metaphor for the fear over the loss of control during pregnancy women may feel. There's not jump scares in the film, nothing screaming at you to get your attention, no sudden jolts of loud music and cats jumping out of cupboards like modern horror. For something which came out back in the 60s it's aged very well and must have been quite shocking when it came out for a lot of people who saw it. It nicely captured the sense of urban paranoia and uncertainty about the state of modern life and values in an America that seemed to be losing it's mind. The very notion of the family was under fire like never before. The performances are all really terrific every one. The film is also as much as what you don't see as what you do. Everything we see happens from Rosemary's perspective. All in all a very classy, smart, well directed film. While I find the premise kind of far fetched and the weight of the film can be heavy overall I still rate it very highly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Remarkable film in every way,"You see the word masterpiece in almost any article or review of Roman Polansky's ""Rosemary's Baby"" and in this case you can trust that assessment. Rarely has a film in the horror genre succeeded so well in creating a feeling of terror and entrapment and even more rarely has it also been simply a great film. The combination of the source material, director and actors set you on an inexorable journey from everyday life to a paranoid world in which for once the paranoia is valid. One of the main ways it accomplishes this is to present everything as matter of fact and normal as possible, rejecting all the over the top aspects in which most horror films revel. Everyone smiles and acts in the way average people would and none of the actors seem particularly evil or ominous. Sure, the Castevets are certainly eccentric, but it seems to be mostly in their choice of clothes and Minnie's nosy neighbor ways. Emphasizing the everyday ordinariness of the setting of many scenes, there's a reminder of a real world outside going about its business such as the traffic sounds in the background when Rosemary uses Scrabble letters to try to solve an anagram. Creepy music is used only in important moments as are special effects which are almost entirely absent and there are no jump scares.The cast is impeccable as well, none more so than Mia Farrow whose characterization of Rosemary Woodhouse is so total that you don't even feel you're watching a performance. She simply is Rosemary. It's an involving performance that makes you feel for her situation. It's a moment of great pathos when she apologizes to ""Andy or Jessica"", her potential newborn, for the terrible situation they are in. No matter how many times I see the film, I always feel devastated by the end. John Cassavetes is able to come off as a good and loving husband but is believable as a career-obsessed man who might do anything to get ahead. He feels totally duplicitous when he tries to keep Rosemary in line over wearing an amulet, drinking an herbal concoction and sticking with a particular doctor . Yet his facial expressions show how torn he is inside as a man who has overthrown all decency after his desire for success wins over all other considerations. Neither of them were first choices. Polansky had at first wanted a more All-American, almost athletic couple of Tuesday Weld or Jane Fonda, both of whom turned the role down. Robert Redford was having a contractual dispute with Paramount and said no. Farrow had been a huge television hit in the prime time soap opera, ""Peyton Place"", playing the innocent Allison Mackenzie so successfully that when she left the show (at new husband Frank Sinatra's urging) it had to be cut from three nights a week to two. Her waiflike appearance is a real asset to the film. Robert Redford, this early in his career, mostly played good guys and I wonder if he would have been able to appear as conniving as Cassavetes.Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer play Minnie and Roman Castevets, who live in the adjoining apartment. Gordon, who appeared in her first film in 1915 and won an Oscar for this role, gave the only over-the-top performance which perfectly personified a New York type. She's your sweet, solicitous grandmother, always bringing you something to eat. Sidney Blackmer, whose film career went as far back as Gordon's is warm and friendly and knowledgeable about the history of Broadway, regaling Guy with stories of Victorian era actress Helena Modjeska and a few other things. Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans is Edward ""Hutch"" Hutcherson, a bookish, erudite friend of the Woodhouses (he probably would have appreciated their Austen-shared name) who warns them about the dark and mysterious happenings at the Bramford, a building whose literary-inspired name would have been known to fewer people then than now. Ralph Bellamy, a major actor in Hollywood films of the 30s and 40s is Dr. Abraham Sapirstein, an authoritative obstetrician into whose care Rosemary is placed. In the basement laundry room scene Rosemary comments to a neighbor a few machines down that she looks like the actress Victoria Vetri. This is an inside joke as the actress is Victoria Vetri (though she was using her modeling name Angela Dorian in the credits).The Bramford is played by the Dakota on Central Park West, a famous Gothic Revival building since its construction in what was the boondocks in the 1880s and later from the many celebrities who have lived there. After the pink opening credits (in fluorid script like an announcement or invitation), the camera swoops above from the Majestic Apartment Building's tall Deco towers to the roof of the Dakota with its gabled roofs and seeming infinity of tiny dormers. This Gothic delight is the only concession to the more traditional tropes of horror and because it's never made to be overly creepy, is just right for the setting. Rosemary and Guy take a vast, high-ceilinged apartment on the seventh floor and Rosemary at once sets about completely painting it in a lighter, more airy color scheme with sunshine yellow in the kitchen and bedroom and adding new furniture for a 60s modern look. The set was based on the apartment owned by Lauren Bacall in the Dakota and Polanski told the production designer that it should look like Doris Day lived there. The interior always seems to envelop Rosemary, not in a cheap, spooky way with gargoyles or frightening taxidermy, but it can turn from sanctuary to prison in an instant.The genesis of the film was strange in its own right. Based on Ira Levin's best-seller, the film begins with, of all people, William Castle optioning the rights before the book actually came out. This is the same William Castle who was kind of a schlockmeister in the 50s and 60s making films promoted by gimmicks like ""The Tingler"" with electric buzzers affixed to some seats, ""13 Ghosts"" with special glasses to see the ghosts and insurance policies should you die from fright. He was now making B-movies for Paramount. He has a cameo playing the man waiting outside the phone booth. Paramount itself was in a crisis. 9th of 9 studios and recently bought by Gulf + Western, Robert Evans was chosen as the new head of production. He knew he didn't want Castle directing the picture. He needed a big, A-list film and feared what Castle might do to it. Polanski was not well known to the public but had made a big splash with critics and arthouse fans with ""Knife In the Water"" and ""Repulsion"". Evans would have known about him. Anyone who had made ""Repulsion"", in which Jacqueline Deneuve, the youthful star of ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" played a mentally disturbed murderer., was the man to make ""Rosemary's Baby"". The films had a similarity: in ""Repulsion"" the central figure is descending into madness while everyone around her is sane - in ""Rosemary's Baby"" it's the central character who is sane and those around her are in a sense, mad.Evans got Polansky to Hollywood ostensibly to direct ""Downhill Racer"", knowing the director to be a ski enthusiast. He then handed him the novel, asking him if it was filmable. Polanski devoured it in one evening and wrote the screenplay in the coming months. He had a talent for depicting isolation and paranoia, perhaps helped by his childhood in Poland where he saw both parents taken away to concentration camps. He then spent years living with a Catholic family who had promised his father to take him in, constantly having to pretend he was Catholic himself during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Many thought it was too much of a gamble, bringing in someone who had never directed an American film, but the result speaks for itself. It was Polanski who brought in film school friend and major jazz musician in Poland, Krysztof Komeda to compose the score and gave it the haunting, mournful lullaby which you never forget once you hear it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Young innocent  married woman is delighted to find herself pregnant but begins to realise that all is not what it seems.,"A truly magnificent shocker which does not require blood or bullets to make your spine tingle. The old dark Gothic building with its rickety lift and heavy furnishings only lends to the atmosphere but conversely, evil can also be sensed in the most banal of places, eg Rosemary's lemony coloured kitchen and freshly painted nursery. Cassavetes' Faustian Guy with his cynical wisecracking leaves you uneasy and Ruth Gordon is superb as the colourful, eccentric, annoying old neighbour. (""Buzz me when you get back"" -Would you really want a neighbour who makes you account for your movements?)The various middle aged women who float in and out of the scenario seem like certain harpy teachers from my convent school in the sixties(maybe there were certain things I didn't know then!)You really feel for Rosemary and her increasing fear and isolation as small events and signs take on fresh significance -or is she just a lonely, slightly neurotic young bride who needs more chicknights with les girls? The lullaby, hummed so sweetly by Mia Farrow at the start and end, seems to convey the film's image -haunting, sorrowful and ultimately helpless.

Polanski's Best,"How can you accurately Review this film? Its so complex but simple at the same time. The main Idea is simple, but the plot and the way this film was written and directed really makes this film what it is.
The sound track is suspensful, creepy and really adds to the film and makes it as scary as it is. And you have to give credit where it is do Mia Farrow and her co-stars all gave terrific performances, very convincing, authentic and impressive. What else can you really say about this film? Its practically perfect. The pacing feels slow but if you follow the story and pay close attention Polanski's story telling is actually really captivating. A must see, must own horror film for fans of the genre.

anything,"first of all, the movie was impressive. i think a lot of people liked it. for example my classmates loved it. but when we review,the bargain guy makes involves Rosemary's Baby.unfortunately for the viewer,we see very little of people acting strangely.there are very little indications of this in the movie.i watched to the end,hoping there would be a pay off that would have made it worth watching and explain some things.maybe tie up some loose ends.there is a scene toward the end,involving a group of people,which instead of having an impact,was laughable,with pathetic acting.the ending was anti climatic,but then so was the entire movie.there was actually a pay off,and that was end credits finally rolling.i can't tell you how disappointed i was with this effort.this movie came out in 1968 and i thought it might have been in the same vein as The Omen,which came out 8 years later.and roles of course, there are good supporting roles, but another performer who stands out is RALPH BELLAMY as the doctor Rosemary confides in when she begins to suspect things are wrong.f you can accept that, and watch this movie, then maybe you will see why this movie is a cult favorite among many horror movie buffs. and you can watch this film for fun or you can watch Exorcist :D",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Rosemary's Baby,"I've never found Mia Farrow to be a very versatile actor, but she certainly delivers the best performance of her career in this gripping story of Satanic manipulation. ""Rosemary"" is married to ""Guy"" (John Cassavetes) and they live in one of those lovely great buildings that overlook New York's Central Park. Their neighbours are a bit eccentric, to day the least, with ""Minnie"" (the almost perfect Ruth Gordon) and ""Roman"" (Sidney Blackmer) chief amongst those who take an increasing interest in this couple when it appears that a baby is on the way. Gradually, she begins to suspect that something is amiss with not just her pregnancy, but with her marital relationship as she seems to see less and less of those previously close to her and becomes little better than a prisoner in her own apartment. She is becoming increasingly paranoid, confused and resentful of a seemingly indofferent husband who seems content to let just about everyone interfere as the due date approaches. This is also Roman Polanski at his best as he manages to amalgamate the sinister and the coercive with the religiosity of a story that exudes menace and panic whilst also calling into question established societal values around faith and trust. It's almost claustrophobic by design, and their small apartment soon takes on the mantle of a cell occupied by a woman who is very much not in control of her own destiny - whichever way she tries to turn, and with the careful use of a score from Christopher Komeda that could rival Bernard Herrmann then we have a story of visceral fear that looks great on a big screen. Gripping and genuinely quite terrifying at times, it's amongst the best of this genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too Bad Rosemary Didn't Have Twins,"Believe me - The sinister scares that took place in this grossly over-rated Horror/Thriller from 1968 were so few, and far between, that they were almost non-existent.Basically, all that this movie ended up being is just one long, drawn-out build-up to a totally disappointing finale where, after sitting through well-over 2 hours of nonsense, we never even got a single glimpse of the demon-baby, anyways.When people speak about Rosemary's Baby, the word ""atmospheric"" is how I've often heard many of them enthusiastically gush and rave over it. But about the only ""atmosphere"" that I detected while watching this over-long movie was that of claustrophobia and boredom.Rosemary's Baby was yet another modern-day tale of Satanism. This time the inanity was set in New York City.I really wouldn't waste my time with this one.

An Inspiration for Modern Horror,"Horror is a genre that has seen its evolutions over the years. It's shocking to see how similar Rosemary's Baby is to modern films, it has clearly been used as an inspiration for film makers.What sets this film apart from others and even earlier films is the misdirection of the audience. Some actions are meant to be obvious foreshadowing but near the climax, you start to doubt everything you saw yourself and maybe believe that the opposite could be true.Rosemary's Baby was ahead of its years.

rosemary's baby,"Rosemary's Baby is one of the greatest horror film of that times. It was made 43 years ago, however it is rather fantastic. Rosemary and her husband Guy Woodhouse move to an apartment. They meet their elderly neighbors named Roman and Minnie Castevet who are very friendly to them. Although their friendly behaviors, Rosemary feels something strange about them. On the contrary, her husband begins to be very close to them. Rosemary and her husband wants to have a baby, and the night that they decided to have a baby, Minnie comes and brings them a desert to eat. At first Rosemary hesitates to eat it but her husband insists on her to eat. After eating that, she feels dizzy and she thinks that she sees a nightmare but she really lives it. That part of the film is really thrilling, complex and disturbing to me. While watching the scene, i felt so nervous and disgusted. Rosemary becomes pregnant but something starts going wrong. She begins to lose weight and suffer from terrible pains. She begins to complain about her pains but her husband and neighbors don't care about her discomfort. Nobody attempts to help her, even her friends, and her doctor... When she understands that all of them are witches, she wants to run away but because of her baby, firstly she has to go to her doctor and she tells the doctor that her husband and neighbors are witches and they want to harm her baby. But the doctor give her to them. They take her to home, she try to escape again but she can't escape and gives a birth. At the and of the film, we understand that she gives birth to a satanist baby. And she can do nothing in the face of such a situation. I think this is a disappointing ending. But this is not important because the film is absolutely gripping.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Tormenting and agonising in all the right ways, Polanski's chiller about a woman's forlorn descent into grim territory makes for slow burning, strained viewing.","Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is imbued with this underpinning sense of terror; this sense of dread or horror at what 'might' be, it is a remarkably well played horror/thriller near faultlessly encompassing both the natural and the supernatural within one realm of a world but always playing everything straight-faced and in a gruesomely suggestive way. The text is a pure and unadulterated piece, so much so that it is living proof that precisely why it is that keeping everything in suspense and refraining from necessarily showing your contents in all its inglory is a million times more effective than full on, bloody horror violence and petty 'jumps' along the way to an obligatory genre denouement. The film's top trump might very well be in the way its director flawlessly maintains that balance much later on in the film by the time certain reveals and revelations have unfolded; in a lesser film the foreplay and suggestion prior to the shocking disclosure might very well have been the film's substantial core, but instead of wilting for a final act of frills-and-spills of whatever nature, Rosemary's Baby arguably pushes on from its provocative routes and steps up a gear into more agonising territory, in what is rather-an impressive demonstration of construction and tempo to a film of this ilk.The film is a quite engrossing drama, a film teasing and bedeviling the audience with two realities, one of which would lead one to assume it is a gritty, urban and somewhat everyday drama set in New York City about a woman slowly loosing her mind as she balances the moving into a new apartment; the pressures with some neighbours she comes to be wary of and the desiring of motherhood which leads onto pregnancy. Is it the bustle of the city driving her mad, or is there something seedier going on; something more broadly linked to things of a more unworldly nature unfolding within this very worldly zone. The film begins with the Woodhouse's searching out a new abode within which to live, with the aim to turn their family of two into a family of three. The Woodhouse's are made up of the titular Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, and her husband Guy (Cassavetes); people with the ability to, we feel, afford the high-life given the exquisite nature of the apartment they are shown around: a porter in the elevator complimenting the Beethoven music playing somewhere within the complex once inside the apartment proper and the generally rich nature of the interior furnishing. But we are all informed of some prior nastiness that once happened in the apartment and a wardrobe seemingly blocking something to great convenience offers slight distrust.There is a moment, eventually doubling up for the catalyst of what later transpires, in which Rosemary will admit to those listening of a terrifying dream she had; a dream in which she was situated on a dock wearing next to nothing as a ship about to set off on a doomed cruise sat perched awaiting boarding just ahead of her. The notion of feeling bare or vulnerable whilst situated at a locale upon which the beginnings of what are usually long, arduous journeys appearing prominent; the ship itself appearing metaphorically as the literal apartment purchase, those of whom are allowed on linked directly to class and those within a class able to afford to move into such spaces – the underlying factor being that what lies ahead on this cruise or journey is mandatory trouble and strife, the precise things which plague Rosemary's life once she has gotten herself into this true-to-life nightmare.Ploanski allows for things to brood before hitting us with any counter punches he mostly certainly has up his sleeve; a young girl named Terry bonds well with Rosemary, but this is not a character study between two girls and the quaint friendship they strike up; the Castevet family neighbours named Roman (Blackmer) and Minnie (Gordon) come to infiltrate the lives of Rosemary and Guy, much to Rosemary's disdain; but this isn't necessarily a character drama about numerous people whom live and integrate with one another in a jolly fashion on grounded terms within a mere New York apartment block. The film allows for raw human behaviour, Guy's attitudes and reactions to the Castevet's presence or demands shifting naturally enough without bringing to awares any seedier side to the agreements he's actually striking up with them, the likes of which subsequent viewings might reveal more clearly, as intense or obvious underhanded tactics. By the time Rosemary's titular baby has been conceived and is known to be on the way, natural human behaviour is captured as somewhat unnatural, or at least made so that the audience might be drawn towards assuming it to be unnatural – cravings for specific foods; immense weight loss; pains and paranoia each straddling a fine line between what might be uneasily typical or just disturbingly atypical behaviour going on to contribute to a nastier cause.Polanksi keeps the tension, terror and paranoia wrenched up to some near-unbearable levels; the fact that certain people around Rosemary, whom she's known for varying degrees of time and most of whom come into contact with the Castevet's, appear to come to sticky ends is a predominant item; the working out of various clues and the shifting of different notions into place occupying most of the film's somewhat agonising crucible. The end result is a superior thriller revolving around the potentially distressing, but with the underlying source of terror being the fear of one's accuracy in seeing through such matters and where that would then place them; culminating in a distinguished piece.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"What have you done to him? What have you done to his eyes, you maniacs!","I just got done watching Rosemary's Baby (1968) for the first time ever and I don't know why I never watched this movie any sooner because this movie was phenomenal.Positives for Rosemary's Baby (1968):
The first thing I would like to say about this movie is the masterful direction by Roman Polanski. Now, you can say what you want about this man and his personal life, but what he does with this movie is perfection. The way how he captures the terrifying nature of Satanism in this movie is something that needs to be applaud and it still holds up to this day. The movie's atmosphere gives off one of the most horrifying experiences I've ever had while watching a horror movie. The movie's score does a masterful job at giving the movie those vibes that you would expect from a horror movie. The performances from the entire cast are all top-notch in this movie and there is not one person who isn't phoning it in. Of course, the standout performance in this movie is Mia Farrow as Rosemary Woodhouse and it really pisses me off that she wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. And finally, the ending of the movie is one of the greatest endings I cinematic history and I appreciated that it never shows you the baby because just imagining what the baby looks like is more terrifying than what they could ever show in the movie.Overall, Rosemary's Baby (1968) is absolute horror classic form the ages and it is one of my favorite horror movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true cinema masterpiece,"A simply brilliant film that redefines the boundaries of the genre. The direction is precise, with a gripping narrative that balances mystery and tension impeccably. In a conservative era, the film dares to explore complex and taboo subjects, breaking all expectations. The enigmatic atmosphere of the filming and the strange happenings behind the scenes only reinforce the mystical aura surrounding the production. Each scene is a lesson in psychological suspense, where the real terror lies in the subtle details and raw emotions of the characters. A unique experience and A true masterpiece of Roman Polanski's cinema!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy,"This film was way ahead of it's time and there are many young filmmakers out there today that could learn from watching this. It had a captivating story to begin with from Ira Levin's book.The director gives the film a chilly creepy feeling all the way through.

I feel a quality sequel could be made in the right hands, from Ira Levin's novel 'Rosemary's Son'.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Desperate fight of a woman for self-determination,"Roman Polanskis film Rosemarys Baby is one of the most debated movies. Some people think it's a conspiracy movie with horror elements. Others say it's a horror movie about a satanic cult. And there is the theory that it's a movie about ideologistic oppression. Because it's the second part of Polanskis Apartment trilogy among with Repulsion from 1965 and The Tenant from 1971. Both films weren't as successful.Rosemary's Baby is a very subtle movie from one of the best directors in movie history. So how do people perceive this movie so differently? People of a younger generations even partly think it's boring and weird.I personally think everyone is right. Because Polansky overloads the movie with subtlety. There are scenes in it that are not easy for interpretation. Let's take one scene: The scene after Rosemary wakes up after she got impregnated. She has scratches and she feels tired and strange. Her Husband said he took her while she was unconscious, for fun and it was a change and something new. -Besides it's rape. This theme was discussed in many courtyards and back in the days the woman had no right to say no because it would be a part of marital obligations. In consideration of the satanic cult theme of the movie the topic looses its power and is not considered a serious topic anymore because satanic cults do satanic things. I hope it's clear what I am trying to say.In my opinion Rosemary's Baby is a masterpiece but sometimes it stumbles and falls. In my eyes the horror that still has relevance is that a woman in this society needs to get pregnant and if she is, she needs to do this and that. If she refuses a thing a doctor said she is treated like Rosemary. So we are in our society more towards a satanic cult then away from it. That's what still makes the movie frightening even after almost 60 years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As frightening as a movie can be!,"Rosemary's Baby is a gruesome and intense story adapted for the big screen by the Polish director Roman Polanski, from the novel with the same name by Ira Levin. Although it does not contain the elements that traditionally compose a horror movie (blood, sudden shock-moments, etc.) this film is a masterpiece of its genre because it does not depend on these same elements to create a truly frightening and unsettling atmosphere.Guy (John Cassavetes) and Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) are a young couple facing a promising life together. Guy is an actor looking for his big break and Rosemary longs to be a mother. The two just moved into an apartment in the heart of Manhattan where they have as neighbors Roman (Sydney Blackmer) and Minnie Castavet (Ruth Gordon), a caring but nosy elderly couple. Guy develops a close relationship to his neighbors while his wife does not feel very comfortable around them. Finally, Rosemary's much desired pregnancy happens but brings unexpected complications: the young woman begins to lose weight and to feel excruciating pains in her stomach. A series of unusual events, strange noises coming from the apartment next door and a strange obsession revealed by Minnie for her pregnancy, lead Rosemary to a state of complete distrust on those around her and fear for the baby that she's carrying.This whole storyline is framed perfectly by Polanski. The unsettling and gloomy atmosphere present throughout the film is immediately introduced by the strange lullaby sung by Mia Farrow during the opening credits. The architecture, decoration and lightning of the settings create in the viewer a constant sense of claustrophobia and the confusing succession of screenshots in some moments - particularly during the odd nightmare of Rosemary - implement in the public an almost asphyxiating feeling of anxiety that lasts for several hours after the end of the movie. In general, all the actors are very convincing in their roles and contribute a lot in creating a great familiarity between the viewer and the scene. However, there are two representations that stand out: Mia Farrow is brilliant in the role of the innocent young pregnant woman, fragile and submissive, personality to which his avant-garde pixie hair cut offers an interesting counterpoint, and Ruth Gordon offers a sublime interpretation of the comic yet sinister Minnie Castavet. Roman Polanski leads the suspense masterfully, revealing the whole plot progressively, creating a very intimate connection between the viewer and the main character. This turns to be particularly brilliant when, instead of ending the film with some unexpected and shocking happening, he chooses a predictable but inevitable conclusion, as if we all knew bad things were meant to happen and there was no way out. This makes the story even scarier.Personally, I don't like to feel anxious and scared, so to say that I have suffered every second of this film is the best thing I can say about it. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of horror cinema and a must for all lovers of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Extremely well conducted, Tthe classic Rosemary's Baby proves to be an excellent horror film that does not use violent scenes as a way to scare the viewer","Produced by legendary horror film expert William Castle (who makes a cameo as the man who goes into the phone booth and scares the fugitive Rosemary), the film managed to create an intense suspense: using small spaces in a ghostly apartment (shadows, people passing by unnoticed, voices coming from the wall, etc.), Rosemary is completely trapped - even in a gigantic city like New York, the ""nets"" can be closed and there is no place to escape. The film became a masterpiece of psychological horror, despite having strong moments, such as the impressive scenes of the Devil having sex with Rosemary; her frailty suffering from inexplicable pregnancy pains; the climate of persecution that makes her paranoid; and the shocking ending (Rosemary, with a knife, breaks into the apartment next door, discovers the real nature of her son - Polanski added several frames of the ""child"", highlighting the horrifying eyes - and accepts to be his mother), among others. Such scenes provoked controversy - the Catholic Church called the film ""blasphemous"", as did other religions, which sought to prevent the film from being shown - and a huge box office success. The film and book opened a series of works on cults and demons at the time. We can also place this film as the direct precursor of the future classics The Exorcist (The Exorcist) and The Prophecy (The Omen).In the elegant opening tracking shot, Roman Polanski throws us inside the building where all the action will take place. Then, through the stories told to the couple by Hutch (Maurice Evans) about the building they are moving into, the director begins to create the ideal climate for suspense, gradually increasing the expectation in the viewer. When Guy and Rosemary finally move into the building and meet elderly couple Minnie Castlevet (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castlevet (Sidney Blackmer), we're slowly introduced to a number of clues that cast doubt on the Castlevet's suitability. Very receptive, and even nosy, they prove to be both charming and frightening people. The conversation about religion, right at their first dinner at their house, is the first clear sign that will reinforce Rosemary's future thoughts on witchcraft.Many other signs would come with the passage of time, such as the suicide of Terry (Victoria Vetri), the girl who lived with the Castlevets and, mainly, the amulet that is given to Rosemary (and that belonged to Terry), arousing suspicion for the bad smell and the mysterious herb it carries inside. Another clear indication happens when, right after talking to Roman about the difficulty of getting a major role in a play and hearing ""I'm sure I'll get them"" in response, the contracted actor goes blind and Guy is chosen as his replacement. Finally, it is also worth noting how during Rosemary's nightmares we can hear the same strange prayer, coming from the Castlevets' apartment, which preceded Terry's death. Was it just coincidence? Finally, the phrase spoken by Roman as soon as he learned of her pregnancy (""1966, year one!"") further contributes to the girl's thoughts.And what thoughts are these? Why, Rosemary, on the night she becomes pregnant, is beset by disturbing visions to say the least. The composition of the disturbing scene in which the baby is born is flawless, filled with distorted images reminiscent of a nightmare. The confusing mix - with the Sistine Chapel ceiling (a Catholic symbol), people known and others never seen by Rosemary, a dark basement with a fireplace that refers to hell, a bed and the image of the beast - ends up generating doubt about the reality or not from these images. Was it a nightmare or did it really happen? Coincidentally, after the conversations between Guy and Roman, the actor begins to succeed in his career, at the same moment that he finally wants to have a baby. Doubt and distrust begin to wander through the girl's mind. But rightly, Polanski's own excellent script (based on the book by Ira Levin) doesn't make it clear if Rosemary really went through all that or if she's going crazy.As it is normal for women to be more sensitive during pregnancy, this second possibility is plausible. Note that at crucial moments in the narrative - such as the night the baby is born - we can never be sure if she is having a nightmare or if what we see is reality. Even the small details collaborate to create this doubt, like the fact that Rosemary didn't eat all the chocolate mousse and the scratches on her body the day after the ""nightmare"". For supporters of Rosemary's evil theory, even the red color of her outfit that night could symbolize her unconscious union with the devil, which reveals a smart choice by Anthea Sylbert, in charge of the costumes. Christopher Komeda's soundtrack is reminiscent of a lullaby, featuring many variations on the same theme throughout the film. William A. Fraker's Cinematography involves the characters in dark environments, in addition to working well on the contrast between Rosemary's apartments (light and clean) and the Castlevets' (messy and dark), also revealing the good work of Direction of Art by Joel Schiller. When Rosemary and Guy make love for the first time in the film, Fraker plunges them both into complete darkness, perhaps reflecting the devious path she would take the next time the two became sexually involved.Exploiting very well the constant doubt that the spectator feels when witnessing Rosemary's search for the truth, Polanski also hits the spot in the choice of the cast, fundamental for the success of the plot. Mia Farrow's performance is very good, letting Rosemary's doubts and fears show on her face. Fragile and suspicious, her interpretation collaborates with this ambiguous feeling that the viewer feels throughout practically the entire film and her determination to defend her baby is touching. The strange prayers heard through the wall and the paintings removed when Rosemary visits the Castlevets increase her suspicion, further reinforced by the fact that Roman says he has traveled all over the world (""Say a place and I'll tell you if I've ever been there""), since a wizard cannot stay long in the same place risking discovery.John Cassavetes' Guy is a mysterious person. Good-natured, as we can see when he jokes about growing weed and the spirits of two sisters in the apartment, he maintains good chemistry with Rosemary at first. On the other hand, his professional failure begins to distance him from his wife, and curiously, to bring him closer to the elderly couple, contributing to Rosemary's distrust. Notice how the two react in a cold way to the pregnancy, already reflecting the couple's estrangement. Her joy is contained but noticeable, while Guy, despite being happy, does not show the excitement expected of a father. On the other hand, notice how he rushes to tell the Castlevets as soon as he hears the news of the pregnancy, generating even more distrust in the girl. Finally, the fantastic Castlevet couple is played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, with emphasis on Gordon's beautiful performance as Minnie Castlevet. Nosy and talkative, she constantly leaves us in doubt about her real intentions as she befriends the couple, making the viewer never know if Minnie really is a witch or if she just likes them. While being receptive and warm to Guy and Rosemary, Mrs. Castlevet shows a suspicious interest in the girl's first baby, saying repeatedly that she is young and is sure to have ""many"" babies yet.The slow and tense discovery of the signs - again, the merit of the great script - leads Rosemary to seek help with another doctor. However, his diagnosis that she is delusional throws us back into doubt. And now? Was she really imagining all this or was it a widespread plot against the helpless girl? The excellent final sequence in which Rosemary discovers the whole truth, walking through the back of her house closet with a knife in her hand, is splendidly well-directed by Polanski. We are slowly introduced to the details of the house, such as the sinister paintings and the black crib, which confirm Rosemary's theory. And the big climax comes when Rosemary finally finds her son, taken from her arms before she can even see her face. The shock is so great that she can't contain her amazement - and Mia Farrow puts on a show in this scene. However, after the scare and conversations with Guy and Roman, she returns to the crib and looks at her son with the enchanted eyes of a mother. And the question comes back: was she still delirious when she entered the place or had she resigned herself to reality? I go with the second option. Still, it is worth mentioning that the feature never shows Rosemary's baby, which allows for several different interpretations and opens space for the viewer's imagination to flow.Rosemary's Baby is very important proof that you don't need fancy special effects, scary creatures, bloody scenes or too many scares for a good horror movie to be produced. Even without feeling fear when watching it, I can see the grandeur of its creation. With each new scene we are presented with a new clue that makes us doubt along with it. The fear of the work comes precisely from this uncertainty, from this possibility of whether or not there is a macabre ritual and that the nightmares that arise in the protagonist's mind may not be just hallucinations. Both sides are possible and it is brilliant how the film manages to maintain this suspense for much of the plot. We feel the tension because we don't know what's outside that apartment, because we don't know what bad can happen to that woman or her child.Extremely well conducted, in order to generate ambiguous thoughts in each viewer, Rosemary's Baby proves to be an excellent horror film that does not use violent scenes as a way to scare the viewer. Polanski creates a terrifying situation, capable of causing panic without the need to use artificial resources such as the soundtrack to do so.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Overrated,"So this was an award winning film, eh? A movie that currently ranks #209 on IMDb's top 250? A movie that I was told is not only one of the best horror movies ever, but one of the best movies of the 1960's among all genre's. I think that's utter crap, because I found this movie to be flat out ridiculous. Not only was it incredibly boring, but the acting in this movie (and that includes the Actress who won Best Supporting Actress) was very hammy. And why is it that this movie seemed to have no build up what so ever? Everything just seem repeated. It's made obvious very quickly that the whole situation isn't just paranoia. After that, the entire movie is just redundant. The neighbors are established as oddball devil-worshippers (you even see it in the goofy rape sequence), then that idea just keeps being repeated through events in the plot. It's made apparent that somethings wrong with Rosemary's pregnancy...then that idea just keeps being repeated through events in the plot. It's literally unbearable, and this is coming from someone who enjoys simmering & brooding movies. After over two hours of going in a circle, this movie built up to an ending that was seen coming from the onset? And I'm supposed to be thrilled about that? There were no scares and there was no suspense, absolutely nothing. Honestly, if you have trouble sleeping at night, this movie should do you some justice, but other then the use for Insomnia, this movie is practically worthless.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"This is an all time great movie, especially for the genre","Rosemary's Baby (1968) is a movie I recently rewatched on the DVR that I recorded off STARZ. The storyline follows a young coupe settling down in a new apartment near Central Park. The young wife spends a lot of time home alone while her husband tries to work his way up his career ladder. She quickly discovers her neighbors she initially hopes to make friends with are a bit eccentric and may have ulterior motive.This movie is directed by Roman Polanski (Chinatown) and stars Mia Farrow (Crimes and Misdemeanors), John Cassavetes (Dirty Dozen), Ruth Gordon (Every Which Way but Loose), Elisha Cook Jr. (House on Haunted Hill), Charles Grodin (Midnight Run) and D'Urville Martin (Dolemite).This movies does a phenomenal job establishing the characters and atmosphere. The slow burn shows an evolution in the characters and feel of the circumstances. Farrow does an excellent job portraying the young and naive character and as the movie progresses it feels like the world is closing in on her. The eerie elements are very well done and the cult elements are subtly executed. The ending of this movie is magnificent and wraps up the premise to perfection.Overall this is an all time great movie, especially for the genre. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great fun: a film that takes the best part of any horror movie and makes it the whole show,"I saw this at a revival theater a few years ago, and it was one of the best times I've had at the movies. I won't post any spoilers, but I recommend that you read nothing about this movie before you see it. Part of my pleasure was in expecting a certain event to occur earlier in the film: I thought ""Rosemary's Baby"" was going to be about a rampaging demon baby. This misconception helped keep me gripped in suspense until the end.Now that I've watched it again on DVD, I can appreciate it as well as enjoy it. Here's why it was so fun: my favorite part of any horror film is first twenty minutes or so leading up to the first appearance of the monster. It doesn't matter how enjoyable the monster is; the best part is always the wait. This principle works in such diverse films as ""Them!"" (waiting for the killer ants), ""King Kong"" ( for the giant ape), ""Psycho"" ( for the shower scene) and so on. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is all wait, and it's marvelously effective. (But does a monster finally appear at the end? See the movie.)Roman Polanski directs his own script based on Ira Levin's novel (which I read later and enjoyed); he is extremely clever at tantalizing us and dropping clues. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her actor-husband Guy (John Cassavetes) have moved into a new apartment in an old 19th century building which has a bad reputation for murders and strange deaths that occur on its premises. They befriend the old couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) next door who are nosy and eccentric but later seem more sinister. When Rosemary gets pregnant, she begins to suspect her neighbors are witches.The casting is important. Rosemary must be weak-willed but not so passive that she becomes irritating or unsympathetic: Mia Farrow is perfect. Cassavetes plays an unsympathetic jerk yet allows us to see his moral struggle, mainly hidden from his wife (and only suggested to the audience). Sidney Blackmer seems gracious and charming, yet conveys something dark underneath. Ruth Gordon steals the show, a wacky oddball who becomes terrifying.Roman Polanski delivers a slowly-paced film that screws our attention to the sticking place for two hours and fifteen minutes. You can't ask for more fun than that.",,Anonymous,Horror
Horror Played Out in Broad Daylight,"There are no brooms or tall black hats associated with the witches in Ira Levine's ""Rosemary's Baby,"" yet this is a terrifying intense read. Director Roman Polanski's screenplay is just as meticulously mounted. Even if you read the book you will be riveted by the film's slow reveal. This is a horror movie played out in broad daylight. The devil worshippers are an outwardly kind, talkative elderly couple played by veterans Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon, who befriend their Manhattan apartment neighbors the Woodhouses.Mia Farrow (as Rosemary Woodhouse) knows this is a casting opportunity not to be missed, even though Frank Sinatra, her husband at the time, recommended she pass on it. All our empathy is with her as she gradually fears for herself and her unborn child. She comes to suspect her actor-husband Guy (John Cassavetes) is in on a diabolical plot. Convincing someone to believe her is the tussle.This is most unusual for producer William Castle, schlock and shock master of gimmick driven terrors (""The House on Haunted Hill,"" ""13 Ghosts,"" ""The Tingler""), I read he was pressured not to direct. The fright images here are much more subtle. They scare without being graphic. The darkest moments occur in the impregnation sqeuence which may or may not be a drug-induced nightmare. The scenes that send the most chills happen in the daytime. Letters from a scrabble game spell out an anagram of one of the conniving characters. Rosemary makes a desperate phone booth call for help to her former obstetrician. In another revealing talk, listen for the uncredited voice of Tony Curtis on the phone with Rosemary.Cassavetes is the weakest link in an otherwise completely superb cast. He seems distant and uninterested, which may have been the intent. By this point in his career, he was active in pursuing his independent projects with wife Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, Ben Gazzara and Peter Falk.Mia has most of the screen time, and rightly so. Even after work with Woody Allen, she will be mostly remembered for this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A 'must see' for cultural enrichment,"Rosemary's baby is definitely a movie that fits in my list of 'good movies'. Even though horror and mystery are not my favorite genres. And I don't like open or semi-open endings.The actors did well. Most of the time, I don't like the acting in old movies. Because it just looks fake to me. But in this movie I could follow the acting very well. The lead role was portrayed by Mia Farrow. I have to say that I don't like this type of women in real life. This is my personal opinion, of course. Her way of communicating with others is so childlike. But I guess that was the role she played. She was a fragile woman. She almost never left her apartment, and when she did, she looked very vulnerable.The old neighbors were played by some good actors. Their behavior was very stereotype. But I can appreciate it. It was fun to compare them to my own grandparents. The little quarrels they had and the habit of giving a lot of food to people and visitors.The plot was well thought of! It was always a bit mysterious and there was that certain tension that you get when watching horror movies. You can feel that Polanski, who made the film, has a dark kind of humor. There is a lot of cynicism in the movie and also paranoia is a very important aspect. Not that it would be wrong to be paranoid in Rosemary's situation.The movie gives a good view of the lessening popularity of the church during the sixties. Not much people really believed in the church. Rosemary was one of the few people who kept loyal to the church and to God. This makes a big contrast with her husband and the neighbors, who make jokes about the pope.At first I thought the movie was non-fiction. I thought that the neighbors were just part of a sect that believed in Satan. I was really surprised that it was fiction after all. Especially at the very end. But even then, in a certain way you can still look at it as non-fiction.The scenes in the movie were chosen very well. There was variation in locations, different kinds of light, and movie techniques This makes everything a lot more interesting. Also the music suited the movie, which is very important, especially for horror and mystery. Music or the absence of it makes a big difference in the atmosphere.I can conclude that this movie is worth to be seen. Even if this genre is not your style. It is definitely a 'must see' for cultural enrichment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Unnerving viewing, more than 40 years down the line ...","Times have changed.In it's time, Rosemary's Baby was regarded as a horror classic. It still is, to an extent. But to tell the truth, more than 40 years after its release, the definition of horror, in cinema, has unquestionably changed greatly, and, in these days, not having, as it does, any over-the-top gore or jump moments, Rosemary's Baby may no longer scare.In fact, if I found anything really unnerving in the film, it was that expression, on the face of Mia Farrow transcendentally evoking Rosemary, in the final 2 minutes. It made me grateful that the film ended there, without showing what followed thereafter ...For, as Polanski tells the story, we already know, or at least have guessed, about halfway through the film, all about Rosemary's baby, even when it is still in utero, though Rosemary herself may not. And THAT is where the supreme artistry of the film lies. Horrifying though it may not be any more, it still is chilling, and chilling to the core, as the fate of Rosemary herself always remains entirely unknown, till the very end. And that is also why the ambiguity in Mia Farrow's parting expression remains so disturbing, and stays etched in the memory much after the film itself has ended.I cannot figure out, for the life of me, why Mia Farrow did not get an Academy Award for her performance. Ruth Gordon did, of course, for playing the perfect foil, as Minnie Castavetes, to Mia's Rosemary. Mia's indecisions, her fear, her abject terror at the threat she perceives to the life of her unborn child, far transcend the limits of the script, and stamp themselves indelibly on the psyche. It is truly a bravura effort, and carries the character to a level where Mia and Rosemary become entirely indistinguishable. To say the least, it can serve as a textbook example for anyone who wants to learn what acting is all about.Equally inspired - if not, however, equally challenging - are, unquestionably, the performances of Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer as Minnie and Roman Castevet. I particularly liked the sly ambivalence with which Blakmer delineates his character, so starkly in contrast to his wife's menacingly overbearing effervescence.The premise of the film is undoubtedly far-fetched and difficult to believe or digest, and, in the hands of a less inspired cast, may have been reduced to B-grade phatasmagoria. As it is, however, as conceived and created by Polanski and as executed by Farrow, Gordon and Blackmer, it is nothing short of art on celluloid.Rewarding and memorably disturbing viewing, more than 40 years after it was made.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby Film Review,"Rosemary's Baby (1968) Film ReviewRosemary's baby is really amazing, frightening and so beautiful. I think this movie is really burrow deep in one's psyche. One can easily feel all the events in the film. The film has a potential to require me to use a night light.Roman Polanski made his American directorial debut with this wonderfully sinister film. The first hour feels like a French New Wave movie in the vein of Godard's Breathless. There's definitely a European sensibility to Polanski's direction which is understandable.Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes play young newlyweds who move into a Gothic apartment in New York previously inhabited by an old woman who recently died. Down the hall live an strange elderly couple who befriend their young neighbors. They seem like good intentions. One night, Rosemary has a nightmare in which she is raped by the devil himself. Upon waking up, she realizes that her husband was having marital relations with her at the moment she was dreaming.Soon after she learns of her pregnancy. Her husband has conveniently found success as an actor. Rosemary continually feels sharp pain. Eventually, with the goading of a recently deceased friend of hers, Rosemary begins to distrust everyone around her, including her husband, her neighbors and her doctor. Perhaps she's suffering from pericardium delusions, or maybe there is a palpable evil that's always nearby.Mia Farrow, who was known to most at the time as Mrs. Frank Sinatra, gives an amazing performance in a really difficult role. She must be likable, yet cold and distant all at once. For much of the film, Rosemary suffers quite a bit while maintaining a cool demeanor. The final scene, especially, is so over the top that I can't even begin to imagine how Farrow was able to find her motivations. The supporting cast, including Gordon who's always fun to watch on screen even if she really can only play one type of character, does fine work, especially cinema verity pioneer director Cassavetes.There are a handful of moments that are a bit too contrived to work, so the movie isn't quite a masterpiece. The whole sequence with the anagram from the book makes little sense. Further, Rosemary transitions from slightly anxious to appearing downright psychotic perhaps a little too quickly. The aforementioned climactic sequence goes down as one of the wackiest ever while proving profoundly unsettling at the same time. Perhaps it might have been even better if everything at the end wasn't so staged. The New Wave style is abandoned during the final act when the horror takes full effect, which does invite the viewer to disconnect slightly. If even these freakish moments had been played straightforwardly, the film as a whole might have proved even scarier than it ended up.Rosemary's Baby isn't just about the ridiculously impossible. It's also a scary metaphor for motherhood. Having never been pregnant myself, I can only begin to imagine the anxieties that go along with bringing another human life to term. It would only be natural to wonder if one's baby is going to be healthy, and what kind of person that baby will grow up to be. Rosemary's horror is shared by all mothers in many different ways. The responsibilities that go along with parenting are enough to make people think twice about having children in the first place. Of course, the decision Rosemary must tackle at the end of the film is beyond any mother's worst fantasies. Still, though, having children can be, among other things, horrifying.A palpable fear of Satan having tangible power in this world is an irrational one, and yet, as a cinematic theme, it's still as in vogue as it was back in the late 60's and early 70's with films like The Last Exorcism and the upcoming film Priest. Maybe it's the idea of evil itself actually able to reason independently, much like humans, that really gets to people. Rosemary's Baby won't force me to sleep with my light on tonight, but it does make me hope that my dreaming remains at a minimum for quite a while. Also, it might be a good idea for me to take a home pregnancy test, you know, just to be safe.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

She can't trust anyone and starts thinking that all those surrounding her in the apartment building are practicing witches and Satanists who want her baby for their nefarious ceremonies.Produced by schlock master William Castle, Rosemary's Baby feels about as un-Castle like as you can get. It's a slow, brooding study on paranoia, motherhood, and urban isolation. Mia Farrow is in every scene and carries the weight of the film on her tiny shoulders, instantly grabbing the audiences sympathies. A scene stealing role by Ruth Gordon adds a lot of humor and fun to an otherwise startling and creepy film.Director Roman Polanski is brilliant at finding the terror in the mundane without any bombastic music, heavy makeup effects, or buckets of fake blood.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
So Uncomfortable!!,"Movie gave me chills at every moment. It showed us the harsh reality, that a human being can sacrifice anything to become successful, the world that was built in this movie was so engaging and story won't bore you at any time, was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie and if I had to describe it in one word that would be Horrific.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby,"Rosemary's Baby is a true genre classic.Undoubtedly, this film is certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made. As a horror fan I thought I was missing out on a lot by not having seen this, and I was right.Expectations were high and this one lived up to them.This movie is an example of the horror genre done right; there are spine-chilling moments, satanic images and horror themes that will stay with you forever. The editing in these parts is very impressive as well, creating visual illusions without special effects. It also contains some of the damned finest performances a horror film has ever seen.Mia Farrow was nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance, and quite rightly so.Farrow's portrayal of the helpless mother desperately seeking to protect her unborn child is powerfully emotional. Ruth Gordon also put in a splendid performance as the creepy character of Minnie.This is a masterpiece of horror. Everyday situations have an undercurrent of evil. These skillfully hid details haunt the viewer. An odd closet, a suicide, her neighbors' extreme interest As the date of birth gets closer, the film grows increasingly claustrophobic. The development of the plot gets interrupted abruptly in the last scenes, when the intrigue is revealed.The story builds a nice conspiracy well and sustains a real creepy atmosphere all the way through to good effect.Farrow is suitable unbalanced and we feel her fear and suspicion growing during the film. Her performance is really good and the fact that she manages to balance her own doubt for most of the film is very effective.The music is also very memorable and creepy.Overall, this is a perfect adaptation of Ira Levin's book, Rosemary's Baby remains today one of the best horror movies, not for its use of gore, but for its use of tension and surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A Classic Thriller That's Creepy and Twisted, but Misses the Scare Mark","Alright, so I finally got around to watching 'Rosemary's Baby' and man, it's a trip. It's not your usual jump-scare kind of horror, but more of a slow burn that gets under your skin. The plot is super twisted - it's about this woman, Rosemary, who moves into this weird apartment with her husband and ends up getting caught in this freaky situation. I gotta say, the way they build up the suspense is pretty cool, even if it takes a while to get going. The whole 60s vibe adds to the creepiness, and the acting, especially Mia Farrow as Rosemary, is on point. She nails the whole scared and confused thing, which makes it even more intense.But here's the thing, even though the story is wild, some parts just felt too slow. There were moments when I was just waiting for something big to happen, and it felt like the movie was dragging its feet. I get that it's more about the psychological horror and paranoia, but I wish there were a few more moments that really made me jump or freaked me out. It's cool how it's all subtle and gets you thinking, but a bit more action or some real scary scenes would've been awesome. The whole cult aspect is freaky, but they could've done more to make it outright terrifying.Overall, I'm giving 'Rosemary's Baby' a 7/10. It's definitely worth watching for the story and the whole classic horror film experience, but it's not going to keep you up at night scared. It's got this cool mix of weirdness and suspense, but for someone looking for non-stop scares, it might fall a bit short. Definitely a must-watch for the horror buffs out there, but if you're all about the modern horror vibe, this might not be your cup of tea.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
At it's time a haunting foreshadowing tale that was symbolic and visually explicit.,"In his day the legendary and controversial director Roman Polanski made some of the best and most cutting edge films of the day. And with this horror mind drama classic ""Rosemary's Baby"" it proves with his use of symbols and foreshadowing combined with the creepy music his films kept you on the edge of your seat. Many may say during the 60's this was the best horror film made maybe in terms psychologically, yet my pick is 1960's ""Psycho"".Anyway the story is set in New York city a couple Rosemary(Mia Farrow)and Guy(John Cassavetes)just have moved into a high rise luxury apartment building and Guy is a struggling actor trying to make it from commercials and plays to the big time of studio pictures. As like all couples settling down they want to start a family only soon they realize after being taken in strange things happen like unexpected tenants deaths. Most striking which foreshadows the viewer and shows symbols so well is the weird and frightening dreams that Rosemary starts to have as is it confusion and worry for a first time mother just who's baby is it she's having.Overall pretty good film that keeps you intrigued with the crazy and foreshadowing type dreams proving that really a lot in life can be strangely cursed. This was clearly a film that was cutting edge at it's time as Polanski pushed the envelope to audiences so their imaginative fears could be sent thru the mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
POOR EXCUSE FOR A HORROR CLASSIC,"A huge waste of time and money. I would rather watch paint dry than to sit through this pathetic excuse for a classic horror film, or, should I say an attempt at a classic horror film.

"Chilling, frightening and yet a must see!","Rosemary's Baby is one of the most controversial films of our time. I can't stop thinking about how sweet and nice Ruth Gordon was in her Academy award winning role. I loved her as Minnie even though she proved that even appearances can be truly deceiving. Who would ever thought that you lived next door to Satanists in New YOrk City. I felt sorry for Mia Farrow's character, Rosemary, but she does give the performance of her career. The haircut by Vidal Sassoon has been etched in my memory since I saw it on television. THe conception of her baby was hard to swallow and not for the squeamish like myself. John Cassavetes also gives a memorable, unforgettable performance as her husband willing to sell his wife out for a successful acting career. You never really like the character because of his immoral actions. As Rosemary comes closer to the truth, we are equally horrified by her discovery of her husband's new allegiance and the satanists who look so ordinary like Aunt Bee from the Andy Griffith Show. You never see them as anything but ordinary and that proves that the nicest, kindest neighbors can fool you. Ruth Gordon's performance as Minnie is well chilling. I won't give away the ending but I bet everybody knows it. A Satanist was consulted on the film and he was connected to Charles Manson whose gang murdered the director's wife. It's more horrifying than the film itself. While I get goosebumps about this story, it won't just leave you. You will always wondered what happened to that baby. Polanski who survived the holocaust as a child always knows how to remind you that people even the sweetest looking people in the world can be evil too.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Favorite Horror Film,"I have seen this countless times and it is still brilliant in every way.Mia Farrow is excellent in the lead, she is in every scene and we see everything from her point of view. You really feel for her every step of the way.Roman Polanski's direction is great, the tension builds and builds and explodes with the still shocking ending. The writing is very faithful to the book, it is nearly a word for word, scene for scene recreation. One striking scene is the dream sequence where a drugged Rosemary finds herself on a yacht with actors portraying JFK and his wife Jackie, I did not realize that is who they were supposed to be until I read the novel.The musical score by Christopher Komeda is one of the finest in film history. The haunting and eerie lullaby (sung by Mia Farrow) sets the mood. There more menacing music when Rosemary first starts having pains.Ruth Gordon gives a funny, Oscar winning performance as the nosy neighbor Minnie. But stage veteran Sidney Blackmer is equally effective as her husband. He is quietly menacing even when he is being kindly, his booming voice at the end is chilling. Maurice Evans provides a great counter point as Hutch the only nice older person in the film. Elisha Cook Jr plays the apartment manager, he was made up to have missing fingers on his hand, though it is hard to see in the film.As a native New Yorker, it is nice to see the city in it's 1960s era. Radio City Music Hall is featured in a Christmas scene where Rosemary is waiting to see Hutch. The Music Hall is still around though the Time and Life Bldg lobby has changed a lot. There is a great scene where Rosemary walks into oncoming traffic across Fifth Avenue. The Dakota apartments still look imposing to this day.If you have never seen this film, when you do you will know the influence it has had on other films, horror or not. If you have seen it, see it again and again you will find something new each time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bone chilling horror that pulls at your paranoia.,"Despite having a slight insight into what might be going on the entire time, that doesn't stop this gothic classic from keeping you guessing the entire time.

Masterfully Directed by Polanski,"Rosemary's Baby (1968)**** (out of 4)Polanski's eerie and disturbing film about a couple (Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes) who move into a new apartment complex and think their lives are about to take off. Soon the wife finds herself pregnant but fears start to slip in that her eccentric neighbors might be trying to do her and the baby harm. She finds out that they could be part of a coven of witches and that they might just be needing the baby for evil deeds. I'm not one who thinks this is a flawless movie as I do have a couple issues with Polanski's screenplay but there's no question that the film contains a certain cold atmosphere and some great performances that make it worth viewing. I think the real key to the film's success is the direction by Polanski because he perfectly blends all the elements and really makes a complete film. I love how the movie starts off with this sweet and innocent nature as if you were watching the happiest film in the world. These calm moments are handled perfectly by the director and he also manages to direct the darker scenes just as masterfully. The dream sequences are brilliantly done and some of them are extremely disturbing to watch. Polanski also handles the smaller, personal drama well and one of the best scenes in the movie happens when Rosemary is in the phone booth trying to find someone to help her. The way Polanski directs this sequence is flawless and Farrow really hits it out of the park and delivers the paranoia that the movie needs. Farrow is simply magnificent in her role as she nails every emotion that she has to play. I really found her chilling in her paranoia that someone is possibly trying to kill her kid. Cassavetes is also excellent even though I think one of the screenplay's major faults is how his character falls in with this group out of no where and the fact that his character comes off as a creepy from scene one. Supporting players Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Bellamy, Maurice Evans and Patsy Kelly are extremely good as well. The disturbing nature of a child being harmed is something that has been attempted in many movies both before and after this one but the creepiness that Polanski brings to the subject is something that hasn't been matched. I've never really cared for the decision of Rosemary at the end of the movie but Polanski's direction through this scene makes one understand what he was going for and what he was trying.",,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby is the epitome of classic horror.,"Oh yes, horror thrillers do not come much classier than this. 1968 and yet impressively still feels fresh when watching it for the first time today. It's one of those classic films that I think every film buff or cinephile or average movie fan should watch and I'm sure it's a popular choice when studying the medium of film. The story revolves around a young woman called Rosemary who moves into a new apartment with her husband. She wishes to conceive a baby, but when her obsessive neighbours become involved things start to take a turn into the realm of surrealism. A prime example of this, would be her ""dream"". She dreamt that she was being raped by Satan and that her neighbours and husband were watching as if it was a ritual. But of course we all know what actually happened (I shan't spoil it). It's a plot of mystery and intrigue. Roman Polanski's intelligent direction and screenplay was quite unique. We all knew what happened to Rosemary and we all knew what the end result was going to be, but we as the audience were interested in how Rosemary unravels the plot herself. This could've been a mystery with several twists and turns, but it's more than that. This was all focussed on her. Mia Farrow was excellent and easily held her own against the rest of the supporting cast. She exhumed innocence, fragility and transformed herself. I was impressed. Ruth Gordon won the Best Supporting actress award, I thought she was good but nothing outstanding. Although, she got that New York accent down to a tee! loved how we never saw what Rosemary's baby looked like, the imagery that is conjured up relies on the audience's imagination and I found that to be powerful. There were a few plot conveniences and I found the pacing to be inconsistent. A scene that oozed intrigue was then followed by a slower scene that seemed to negate everything that was before it. However, this is a solid classic horror film that, I'm sure, will never be forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
busra soyleyici,"It is a horror film which was directed by Roman Polanski.In fact , Rosemary's baby is a 1967 best selling horror novel by Ira Levin.According to me , Roman Polanski is a successful director.His first known film is "" Knife in The Water "".But the doors of Hollywood open with his film ""Rosemary's Baby "".This film creates an air of dread which points jinxes.The film is centered on Rosemary Woodhouse.She and her husband ,Guy , moves into an apartment building .Her husband is not so famous to earn enough money for them , but their new city will create so many problems for them .Altough they still don't realize the real danger , everything happens in quick time.They are surrounded by the church of Satan.Their old friends from apartment are witches.They convince rosemary's husband to have rosemary on.Rosemary's husband finds a work with the help of the witches .but they want a baby from Guy in return for this help. so after he accepts this offer , he try to make bad things to rosemary .

"Classic, Masterful, Horror","In an age of over the top visual and sound effects it's a real treat to look back on this one for an example of a horror flick built around great story telling, excellent direction and attention to detail, where implied horror is much more powerful than anything that could be shown on the screen.  An expecting mother is one of the most vulnerable states of the human condition already filled with worries, doubts and insecurities and this film plays on that to the hilt.  The dream, drugged scenes leading up to the encounter with Satan himself are an excellent depiction of the subconscious mind and this movie itself has a way of slowly seeping into the subconscious and getting under the skin. This one uses the technique of beginning in the most common and pleasant of situations and then slowly descending into a paranoid nightmare as well as it has ever been done. John Cassavetes  does one of the best husbands as jerk roles that you'll see. Everyone in the film is excellent in their roles, Ruth Gordon almost steals the show and Mia Farrow's delivery is perfect at conveying her emotional state with the inflections of her voice in the delivery of every line. This is a must see film and well worth a revisit if it's been some time since you've seen it. One of Polanski's very best with a nod of course to the obvious Hitchcock influence.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
it is very good,"I do not have any idea about the movie but I saw Polanski's name, I think who is the best director, I say I must watch this movie.Then I watched the movie it was some times very boring and dark.It was adapted from Ira Levin's novel.Maybe it was not good adapted from novel. So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple.They are very friendly but there is something strange things about them - the sounds that come from their apartment.Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of their relationship and especially Minnie becomes more and more annoying, especially when Rosemary says she is pregnant she recommends her another gynecologist's and mixes a herbal drink for her every day. The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant.It happens many strange things: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner and their friend 'Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight. And when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband plotted against her and want to harm the baby. Film shows a stereotype of devil it describes scary face, dark and messy.It is also restricted my imagination.It is not horror film it is a triller movie.Roman Polanski conveys the audience the tension actually that sometimes you feel you are in the movie.After the pregnancy Rosemarry's (Mia Farrow) physical appearance changes very strangely especially when she has cut her hair..Mia Forrow performance was very good she acted perfectly lonely and deserted women.The ending is very good.I think not showing the baby is very good choice.Rosemarry's reaction is remarkable that she accepts the son of Satan and she loves him her whole life although everybody don not believe her.In conclusion this movie is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Roman Polanski directs one of the greatest, if not the greatest suspense/thrillers of all time!","Sometimes a film comes along that redeems the art form that is cinema. Rosemary's Baby is one of those films.  In Rosemary's Baby the cinematic content is the priority, the auteur understands what is important is not the story as it is seen on paper, but the story as it is told visually. Polanski proves in this film that when he is on top there is none greater. Polanski takes a remote locale to create in a sense a claustrophobic atmosphere, and understands both cinematography and the audience so well that he uses a barrage of imagery to play the audience like a violin creating a response of pure terror.  However, the amazing thing about this film is that it does even the little things so well.  For example, this film contains the best dream sequences I've ever seen.  True, Hitchcock created some of the most fascinating and artisitc dream sequences visually, but none of them came nearly as close to creating what the dream state is truly like. Many directors lack a sense of daring, they are so worried about appeasing the audience that they cease to challenge them.  Polanski challenges the audience ten times a frame, he creates outrage by allowing chaos to reign, and displays complete disregard for structure/order as the primary priority. Polanski has always struck me as a balance between a director of the French New Wave style and a student of Hitchcock which supplies him with an amazing combination of freedom and precision.  The performances in this film are outstanding all around.  Polanski to me is one of the few directors who is completely fearless when it comes to taking risks.  I don't believe I've ever seen another director who possesses and expresses such dual qualities so effortlessly.  Polanski feels no obligation to tradition, but simultaneously has an enormous amount of respect for the masters who came before him.  There is also a great balance between the fantastic and the realistic in this film, drawing a very thin line between both, and forcing the audience to question the fantastic realities and the realistic fantasies.  They say that the great artists know the rules, but can get away with breaking them because they realize that it is something far beyond rules that makes their medium what it is, and I can think of few filmmaker's who exemplify this to same extent as Polanski.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A psychological horror that chilled me to the bones...,"For me, alongside Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby is one of Roman Polanski's best films. As with all of Polanski's movies, it is very well-made and directed. The cinematography is both striking and atmospheric, with lighting that always helps to enhance the mood, while the music and sound effects are haunting and the story is compelling.The script is yet another strength, all the psychological horror is there and done with genuinely unnerving effect, it has plenty of paranoia mixed with the odd bit of morbid humour. I couldn't have asked for better acting either. Mia Farrow is in I feel her best performance here, and she is an ideal satanic foil.John Cassevetes is suitably selfish and frustrated, and then there's Ruth Gordon who is wonderfully eccentric and in a menacing sense. Overall, a chilling psychological horror that to me is still very effective. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliantly Constructed,"Just a few remarks on seeing the movie again years after its initial release. What a cleverly constructed screenplay (Polanski). We never know more than central character Rosemary (Farrow). That way her gradual realization becomes ours too. Of course, we know in advance from the film's reputation that an infernal plot is underway to envelop her, but still the narrative captivates. Who exactly is involved in the plot remains unclear, along with the details. Tip-offs gradually emerge as when old Minnie (Gordon) insists on the hellish concoction that Rosemary must drink. But then Gordon plays Minnie in such a goofy gadfly manner, it's hard to think of her as a witch. All in all, it's that clever narrative construction combining our awareness with Rosemary's that's the crux of a fascinating film. And given the lengthy two-hour-plus runtime, that's no mean fete. Then too, shouldn't overlook Farrow's career topping performance as the besieged victim. In fact, it's hard for me to think of anyone else as the waifish mother-to-be. Anyway, it's a brilliant horror film in spite of spilling scarcely a drop of blood. Contemporary filmmakers could take note.",,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's baby,"Rosemary's Baby is one of the masters of twentieth century suspense and it is described as a product of the counter-cultural movement during the Vietnam War in the 1960's, a time when The Establishment were viewed with suspicion and hostility. During this time, the largest movement of modern satanism start.The director Instead of use blood and violence to scare audiences he uses genuine psychological tension. It is the differences between Rosemary's Baby and other horror films. The cast is fantastic for example Mia Farrow who play a leading role was ideal.she has got delicate beauty. She kept Rosemary's emotions and thoughts right on her face so we know what she's thinking at all times and we can actually join her emotionally in her desperate fight to save her baby from the witches. I think what makes this movie scary is the fact that all these terrible things are happening to such an innocent, hopeless character Rosamary.If needed to explain,Rosemary(Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move to an apartment but they have strange neighbours Roman ( Ruth Gordon) and Minnie Castevet( Sidney Blackmer) they seem to be very good person even though pull a trick to Rosemary .

Out and out horror classic,"Based on a novel by Ira Levin, Rosemary's Baby is a slow building and suspenseful tale of horror based on Satanism. Rosemary's Baby is often cited as being one of the best horror films ever made, and there is a good reason for this. The genre is famous more for blood and scenes that make the audience squirm - Rosemary's baby doesn't feature any of that, but it does feature an atmosphere of constant dread and a plot that always remains interesting even when the pace is rather slow, and that more than makes up for any gratuitous scenes of gore. The plot is fairly simple and focuses on young couple, Guy (an actor) and Rosemary Woodhouse. They move in to a new apartment building and meet a friendly elderly couple living next door, Roman and Minnie Castevet. Guy begins to spend a lot of time with the couple next door, and before long Rosemary has become pregnant - strangely around the same time she has a dream about being raped by something inhuman. As soon as the neighbours realise she pregnant, they take a keen interest; and strange things start to happen.The rights to Ira Levin's novel were originally acquired by William Castle; and while I don't mean to discredit Castle as I do love most of his work, I have to say that I'm glad that Polanski was brought in to direct as this is not the sort of plot that Castle would have done well with. This film is the second (and best) part of a trilogy of films by Roman Polanksi focusing on Paranoia - the other two being Repulsion and The Tenant. Polanski's direction is really what makes this film what it is; while the plot often plays out like a soap opera and there are periods where nothing really happens, though the atmosphere hanging over the mystery of the story - as well as the fact that we know certain things that are unknown to the central character - ensure that the film is always interesting. I wont spend too much time talking about the actors; but suffice to say, all four of the central performances are excellent; Ruth Gordon's supporting role representing on the few times that a horror film has been recognised by the Academy. It all boils down to a fantastic final ten minutes, which manages to be chilling while still following what has gone before it - i.e. not showing the audience everything. Overall, it's impossible to deny that Rosemary's Baby is a masterpiece and also one of the true 'must see' horror films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A pretty good, faithful adaptation of the novel","""Rosemary's Baby"", adapted & directed by Roman Polanski, is based on the classic novel of the same name by Ira Levin. In the film, a young couple move into an apartment building and are soon befriended by an elderly couple. However, when Rosemary (Mia Farrow) becomes pregnant and things do not go smoothly she begins to suspect that there may be an evil conspiracy at work.The cast is a pretty good one, including Ruth Gordon in an Oscar-winning supporting role. Personally, I thought that Mia Farrow delivered the best performance and was an inspired choice for the role of Rosemary. The rest of the cast is solid but not really worth remarking upon.Polanski's script sticks pretty closely to the novel both in terms of plot and dialogue. I would have rather had some variation from the novel but I'm sure that others will appreciate the script's faithfulness to the source material. Polanski's direction is ably handled as well though I wouldn't hold this film alongside later efforts like ""Chinatown"" & ""The Pianist"". I also have to admit that the score (by Krzysztof Komeda) is memorable, though it isn't quite to my tastes.All in all, I think that this is undeniably a worthwhile horror film but I don't agree with the current top 250 rating. That being said, perhaps I would feel differently if I hadn't already read the very similar (but superior) novel upon which the film is based.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lacks everything,"Rarely have we seen such a little frightening, such a little captivating horror movie, lacking that much tension and suspense than Rosemary's Baby, which spreads over 2 hours — Polanski's initial cut lasted 4 hours ! — which is a lot, a lot too long considering how little action the viewer is offered.One is bored stiff by this plot a lot too predictable: what is the point of trying to manipulate the audience when there is, in fact, no twists ? Everything that is presented to us is actually to be taken for granted such as the ridiculous and predictable final outcome, which is extremely disappointing.The only satisfaction of this film is Mia Farrow who delivered an interesting performance, driven by her character's paranoia, but isolated within a probably badly directed, unsubtle and overacting cast (think of the Castevets for example).Polanski missed the boat with this insipid horror movie that has no effect on the viewer, far from the masterpiece some try to sell.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Creepy Thriller For The Ages,"All too many times, movies that fancy themselves ""thrillers"" are really nothing of the sort. They are either too gory or too short (e.g. not well thought-out) to be regarding as true classics. In the case of ""Rosemary's Baby"", however, director Roman Polanski crafts an epic tale that will forever stand the test of time.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy (John Cassavetes), a young couple moving into a new apartment complex. They quickly make the acquaintance of older neighbors Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and seem to have forged a sort of friendship with them. When Rosemary becomes pregnant, however, she begins to expect that perhaps the friendliness of the neighbors has a sinister ulterior motive regarding a higher power at work.This movie is so creepy (and thus ultimately such a classic) because it is so understated. The characters of Rosemary and Guy are so true-to-life in their portrayal of young, married life that the viewer cannot help but identify with them. In short, we see ourselves in them, which makes us root for (or against) the events surrounding them that much more. There is no blood or guts in this one, but rather just an atmosphere of tension that continues to build and build as the minutes tick by.Granted, however, that this is not a film for youngsters by any means. It is very adult-themed and contains material that may truly haunt younger-than-adolescent minds. That is part of the reason why the film stands up so well, though, as it contains none of the childish ""slasher/gore"" mentality of most horror flicks.Finally, ""Rosemary's Baby"" can also (from today's perspective) be viewed as a nice period piece. I believe Polanski must have suspected it would be looked at as such too, as many pop culture references are strategically placed throughout the flick.Overall, this is one of the classic suspense/thriller pictures of all-time. The plot of the film (which I won't divulge here) is almost a bit clichéd now due to overuse, but this original is still as striking as I'm sure it was in the 1960s. If you like those ""uncomfortable"" movie experiences that might have you sleeping with a night-light for a night or two, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Roman Polanski is bringing it,"A young couple move into a swanky apartment in Manhattan only to find out their neighbors in the building are witches. Roman Polanski is bringing it in this, his first Hollywood movie. This horror movie is so slick and beautiful, so well-paced and placed that one can hardly believe it was made in the 60s. There are few horror movies from that era that evoke the kind of fear and tension that this Baby does. He sports beautiful NYC shots, slick styles and perfect timing, a hallmark of Polanski. The intricately written story is played by a stellar cast, including a damn near nascent Charles Grodin.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror movie? No wonder I found it in the drama section of Blockbuster.,"I was all excited for a 'scary' movie. A scary movie called Rosemary's Baby. I guess the trouble started when I went to Blockbuster and found the movie in the drama section. (Never mind that, I think they should make a new section called 'The Worst Movies No One Should Ever See' and put this hunk of junk in it). Anyway, so I'm sitting down watching this movie, and for the first hour, I fell asleep five times. The total lack of acting skills, music enhancement, and basic movie production was nowhere to be seen. Typical of high-school film endeavors, I feel that this film is comparable to a reenactment of the book ""Summer of My German Soldier"".A horror movie usually consists of intense moments, frightful surprises and some sort of antagonist, however in this movie, the closest thing was some hallucinogenic sequence of a poorly acted rape. I think Bring It On had more horror merit than this movie, for at least Bring It On had some sort of dignified conflict.The overall lack of integrity in the movie made it a very rough two hours to sit through, and for what? Rosemary didn't even spill her tea on the baby. So if you want to waste an afternoon and five bucks, Rosemary's Baby is for you... or you could just sit at home and cut your toe nails, because that'll give you more of a fright anyway.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
As good as the book should have been.,"It's hard to put into words why this is just a swellerific feature.I don't want to sound snooty but a lot of this genre can seem a bit lacklustre. But this movie just seems to be made of some kind of golden stuff. Every moment oozes atmosphere, even when they're just chatting.Maybe its the lurid color of the semi-bourgeois inner city and reserved but decisive approach to camera work. It can seem a bit campy and grand guignel (I think I'm using that right) but that only helps its attempt to through you into a strange new world almost like our own.Dread builds and is intensified with a constant feeling of understatement and denial. Apparently the book is a lot more subtle but I felt that the approach in revealing the narrative was impeccable as the hidden darkness among the seemingly normal emerges.Vivid.Just an update: I read a review in Halliwell's that this movie is ""Good in a Heavy Handed way, the book being a lot more subtle"". Well, it's not actually that subtle, the movie I think is the better made even if it is sort of apples and oranges.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best horror movies of all time,"Roman Polanski directs a slow-burn horror movie with chills throughout. Mia Farrow plays the titular Rosemary in this horror movie. The movie does not get you with jump scares or gore but relies on the psychological and use of sound. The use of the theme is eerie and reminds you of a lullaby. The movie was the utmost eerie and despite knowing the ending, it still was just as creepy. Mia Farrow is brilliant as she goes through the pregnancy and birth in the film. The use of music and silence in this film is one of the best in horror. The use of shots making Rosemary seem small further adds to the horror which can also be said for its use of shadows and lighting in the scenes. This film is a must watch horror movie on Netflix.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the great chilling films of the 1960s,"When I was a very young child (probably 4 or 5), my parents took my brother and me to the drive-in to see this film! Looking back, this was NOT a good plan, as ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the most chilling films of the 1960s and probably warped me for life! Many years later, I finally got to see the entire film. That's because when I was a kid, I hid my face during so much of the film--especially when they talked about a child of Satan--just the sort of thing to freak out a little boy or girl!! And WOW was I glad I finally got to see this one, as it wasn't nearly as scary as I'd thought and it was also an exceptionally well-written and chilling film.Mia farrow and her husband, John Cassavetes, move into a strange apartment building due to the oddball residents. Some are quite welcoming and sweet and others seem like extras from the movie ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST! The more weirdness that occurs, the more Rosemary worries about staying there. A bit later, she has a weird but super-realistic dream where she's raped. Oddly, a short time later, Rosemary discovers she's pregnant! From here on, it's one wild and scary ride--with some wonderful twists and surprises that kept me on the edge of my seat.Usually, I avoid devil movies. Partly this could be because of my Baptist upbringing and partly because I think many of these films are just silly. However, this one is far from silly--being exceptionally well-written, suspenseful and designed for intelligent viewers instead of dull-witted thrill-seekers. Great direction, music, acting, etc.--this film has them all.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Work Of Art In The Horror Film Industry!,"Rosemary's Baby is a brilliant Horror/Drama film. It is in the tops on my horror list. Mia Farrow, John Cassavettes, and Ruth Gordon who won a Golden Globe Award for the film, were all great. Roman Polanski has made a work of art, based on Ira Levin's classic novel. This movie is very good. I know most movies that are old don't interest people these days, but this one is a keeper for sure. I was afraid it would be too old fashioned for my taste, even thought I have seen films older than this, but it really wasn't! I give Rosemary's Baby a 10 out of 10!!!

Breeding Ground.,"Given the well-documented trauma that enveloped his personal life as the Swinging Sixties were drawing to a close, it's perhaps unsurprising that Polanski chose to oversee a loose trilogy about madness taking hold in grim city environs. Of the three films in that canon, my personal preference leans toward ""The Tenant"", but ""Rosemary's Baby"" still remains an unnerving peephole that casts its view over urban paranoia.It's a film that best rewards repeat viewing, as the subtle intricacies of the script can be assimilated properly once the viewer is made fully aware of the diabolical plot at the film's end. If you're at all interested in the philosophies of mind-control or subjugation, then the horror may well deepen. Leave out the supernatural details which are specific to this story, and you'll nevertheless find that 'insistent coercion' is a hallmark of many dubious sects across the world.When he gets it right, Polanski is a master at immersing his audience in the fears of the character on screen. If you're a person who is susceptible to shivers brought on by isolation, then after seeing this you may need to sleep with the light on for awhile...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary in Chinatown.,"Roman Polanski used to be great then;and it seems that his latest movie is a return to outstanding form.""Rosemary's baby"" is a movie I've been watching for years,always finding something new.I'll never grow tired of it,it's definitely my all-time terror favorite movie (with Robert Wise's ""the haunting"" (1963))There are strong connections between ""Rosemary's baby"" and Polanski's film noir ""Chinatown"":in these two masterworks,there are two worlds which coexist and there are tenuous links between them:in ""Rosemary"" the mysterious cupboard ,the Chinese area in the 1974 work.Pregnancy and search for water (in ""Chinatown"" ) show strange analogies too.And two monstrous unions in both movies :the incestuous affair in ""Chinatown"" echoes to the satanic coupling in Levin's story.Although adapted from Levin's novel,""Rosemary's baby"" did not come out of the blue.In his first work,Polanski already showed his irrational world ,his claustrophobia in his ""knife in the water"" ,soon followed by ""repulsion"" which heralded what was perfectly fulfilled by ""Rosemary"".Those obsessions emerged again in POlanski's best works such as ""the tenant"" (1976) and ""death and the maiden"" (1975);and ""the pianist "" seems to walk that fine line ,it thrusts RP into the small circle of the most ambitious directors again.But ""Rosemary's baby"" is perfection itself: a screenplay most of horror movies can only dream of,an absolutely faultless cast-even if Ruth Gordon steals the show- the rest of the cast should be praised to the skies-,a haunting soundtrack including Komeda's magnificent lullaby,and a first-class director ,whom a lot of ""horror movie"" makers should study in detail.They should study,particularly,the last scene ,the strongest of the fantastic genre;no one has ever been able to mix horror,emotion (yes emotion!) and ambiguity all at once.You're all at once bewildered,scared to death and on the verge of tears.Great great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underplayed,"Not much to complain about really. Looks and sounds good for the age. Probably a bit oversaturated and tinny compared to modern releases. Interesting idea and probably well done at the time but it is too subtle since the seventies graphic intense revolution. Problem is that it is not that scary. It should be because her neighbours worship the devil and recruit her husband. Not only that but you are raped by the devil and forced to gestate its only child. There are secret doors and crazy drugs and sects but it is all underplayed so that it is not scary, creepy or has suspense. For shame! Even The Omen (1976) executes the idea better.

A spoof of the atheistic movement of the time,"I watched this movie for the first time yesterday, mostly to see Mia Farrow after she had left ""Peyton Place"". I found that the premise of the movie and the hidden messages within are very powerful, indeed.I quickly saw that what has been called a ""classic Horror movie"" was really a Gothic spoof of the ""GOD IS DEAD"" movement that was in full force at the time of the writing. Rosemary even picks up a TIME magazine with the cover words, ""IS GOD DEAD""?In analyzing the scenes with the child, and listening to the liturgy of the satanic cult, it is clear that the message of the movie/book was: Life does not exist in a vacuum, you must choose to believe in good and evil. If you choose to believe in JUST evil, i.e., God is dead, then Rosemary's ultimate world is the world that you would live in. Dark, dead, without hope, and with a Satan-child to worship.Roman Polanski did a terrific job with the direction of the movie, of course. Mia Farrow was the perfect waif-child to portray the progenitor of Satan's offspring. I did not care for the actor cast as her husband, he never quite settled into the part, but maybe his role was supposed to be ambiguous. The neighbors were funny, not chilling, as was the cult scene at the end of the movie.All in all, I would give it a 5 out of 10 because it was a social message disguised as a horror movie....I have to wonder how many people actually realized the subliminal theme?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Must-See Movie,"There's not a whole lot left to say about Rosemary's Baby that hasn't already been said a million times before. It's a brilliantly crafted story that derives its horror from suspense, an overall sense of dread and the power of the human imagination. It showcases what horror is truly capable of when it's put into the hands of competent individuals: it's not interesting in giving you the ""cheap thrills"" of something jumping out at you every couple of minutes. It properly develops its scenes, grabbing the audience by the neck and relentlessly pulling them into the film.Mia Farrow expertly portrays Rosemary Woodhouse, a naive young woman with a simple goal: to start a family with her husband, Guy (played by John Cassavetes). Things go awry pretty quickly after the duo meet and befriend their eccentric neighbors Minnie and Roman Castevet, brilliantly played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer respectively, two absolutely out-to-lunch individuals that Guy takes an immediate liking to. Rosemary, however, is a little wary, and probably rightfully so.Roman Polanski really goes out of his way to show just how capable he is of spinning a good tale in the genre. The film doesn't have a dull moment. It doesn't feel rushed, but it also doesn't have any scenes that aren't of importance to the plot. Every minute of the film is driving it closer to its thrilling conclusion. Polanski shows just enough to let the audience in on what's going on, but never enough to spoil the surprise. And, as I already said, he builds scenes based on suspense, helplessness and dread that you can't help but sympathize with as you're watching this film.It's incredibly well-edited and has a score that perfectly sets the mood from beginning to end.It's an uncomfortable film for a lot of people to watch, either due to the things the director has done in his past or the general subject matter of the story, but the film, for all its gritty details, is handled with respect. There wasn't a moment where the director wanted to be shocking simply because he had the option to do so (and there were many of those scenes). Instead of going all-out, he keeps himself well controlled, choosing to leave most of the nastier things to your imagination. Ultimately, it makes it worse than seeing it on screen because the human mind can always come up with far more nasty things than even the highest film budget can afford to present.Rosemary's Baby was an absolute thrill from start to finish, and I can't adequately put into words how delighted I am that the film was picked up by the Criterion Collection to be presented in a quality better than we've ever had before. This is an integral horror film for any fan of the genre, but also for film fans in general, and I'm happy to see it being preserved for future generations.If you like darker, occult-themed creepy movies, Rosemary's Baby is definitely one you shouldn't let yourself miss out on.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best horror film,"Pros: Comedy, Directing, Score, Script.Cons: None.Rosemary's baby is probably the best horror film ever made and it doesn't use any of nowaday's horror bag of tricks to scare you. The chills generated from this movie is genuine not manufactured as you will genuinely want to know what will become of rosemary. Rosemarry is played beautifully by Mia Farrow and the part of Guy is played to a tee by John Cassavetes as he puts on a facade on rosemary claiming not to know what she is really carrying. Ruth Gordon won an oscar deservedly as her potrayal of Minnie, the nosy neighbor who cares just a little bit too much for rosemary. In the end, Rosemary's decision is understandable because she has gone through a lot with her baby and she can bring herself to kill him even though he is the antichrist.Premise: Rosemary wonders if her baby is the Antichrist.Rosemary's baby was nominated for two Academy awards and won one.Grade: 10/10 (Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sensational, yes, but sensationally well made...","Rosemary's Baby (1968)Along with the Exorcist (1973), Rosemary's Baby helped shatter taboos in mainstream Hollywood. It builds around Rosemary's pregnancy in a New York City apartment building with nice but nosey neighbors, and Mia Farrow plays the growing paranoia and genuine fear perfectly. This is a psychological thriller told and filmed with naturalism (along with a few surreal dream and nightmare scenes), and editing with smart efficiency so there is no let up in our descent into horror. Director Roman Polanski also wrote the screenplay, and it's a classic construction.Face it, the story, and the willingness of the movie makers to tell it like it is, is a mind blower. Yes, we've heard or imagined such things in jokes or in our own nightmares (heaven forbid). But never spelled out step by step and made reasonable, or likely. The cast around Farrow is really impeccable. Her husband (John Cassavetes, who knows something about how to make a movie himself) and the two neighbors (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) are absolutely convincing in their innocent, lovable guises. Even when you start to be suspicious something is wrong, you don't realize just how wrong it can be.Thankfully this isn't a Gothic horror film, laying into the macabre and occult aspects (it brushes against them just enough). Because it's really a psychological thriller. You might even expect Hitchcock to have liked the idea, but I suspect he would have shied away from the subject matter, at least the way Polanski had the fears develop into a real horror. It's only at the end that we see a different side to the story, going beyond our worries about Rosemary and her baby. And this is the sensational part of the movie that made everyone talk about it. And for me, it wasn't necessary. It wan't unnecessary, but it ends up tilting the whole flavor of the movie a bit into something campy and even silly, though everyone plays it with perfect realism.But I think most people will just gasp and be impressed by the whole thing, including the end. It's not a fun film but it's fun to watch, a treat to really study how all the elements, including camera-work (walking down halls, peering through peepholes) add up to a peculiar, masterful, memorable gem.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"For 1968, this movie is a riveting shocker","In reviewing Rosemary's Baby, a movie that pretty much led to movies like The Exorcist, I have to think back to the year it was released. And upon realizing this, I must say that Rosemary's Baby is a horror movie in the psychological sense. There is no gore whatsoever, but none of that makes this film any less a horror movie.I'm not even sure todays generation of horror movie goers would be able to watch a movie like Rosemary's Baby. It moves very slow and builds tension subtly, leading to the horrifying climax. There are a few shocking scenes, but nothing that would sicken anybody. Today's generation of horror movie buffs might even find Rosemary's Baby to be rather boring, but then things have changed since 1968. You do not have the same audience in 2006 that you had back then. But in watching movies, particularly horror films, for years, I can accept the horrors that Rosemary's Baby brings to the table.Director Roman Polanski directs this movie perfectly and gets incredible performances from his cast, especially Mia Farrow (Rosemary) and Ruth Gordon (Minnie Castavet). From the beginning, this film starts with a gnawing horror that slowly builds throughout, leading to the surprising ending. It is the acting by all the participants as well as clever direction that makes all of this work wonderfully, and like I said above, it does not use gore at all to get its point across.I see that I have not summarize the plot, but if I did, I believe it would only lessen some of the movie's surprises. Let's just say that if you are a horror movie buff, and enjoy slow build-up in your horror movies which leads to a surprising conclusion, then Rosemary's Baby is the movie for you. As I've emphasized above, this film has no explicit gore whatsoever. There are some mild violent scenes but nothing that would gross anybody out. You've got to realize this movie was released in the late 60s, and that was five years before The Exorcist. If you can accept that, and watch this movie, then maybe you will see why this movie is a cult favorite among many horror movie buffs.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't . Trust . Your . Goddamn .

Rosemary's Baby works because of: 1. Mia Farrow: this has got to be some masterful acting. When she felt a pain in her stomach, I felt it too. Her transformation from an independent and strong woman to a helpless weakling is done beautifully. The haircut is one of the best things that was done to further this weakness. Plus her acting is so real, so unlike the typical 60's acting style. She wasn't a dumb character, she knew her surroundings well. She knew something was up. Her confusion and fear was needed. 2. The rest of the cast: Ruth Gordon, and the actor who played Mia's husband (can't remember his name, John something) were breathtaking. How well they play their characters! Even at the end when you may expect a slight shift in their character, they don't. And it is all the more beautiful. 3. The story: the story of a mysterious pregnancy is fresh and frightening, and I'm getting tired of explaining this stuff so I'm just gonna list them out now. 4. The masterful direction 5.

Even after third time watching it ... Still a classic!,"It is my third time watching the horror experienced by Rosemary who undergone a haunting route during her pregnancy. And each time, Mia Farrow's acting always shakes my nerves. Among supernatural-occult-satanism horror genre, despite of our encounter with many recent ones, this film's position as one of my favorite horror film of all time.Recounting my experience, I think what makes this film separates itself from the rest is the drastic appearances and acts of the titular character throughout the story. Starts from an optimistic, full of life Rosemary, turns to a paranoid-hysteric woman that brings the most of the horror given by the concept. Fully using suspense elements, Rosemary's Baby doesn't have time to collect audiences' attention by scary images. It used Mia Farrow's expression to channel the fear of being fear of your own spouse, being scared of your neighborhood, and being lonely because you miss your friends. Even though the film not said it, the character, suffered and vulnerable, manages to keep the tension and mystery float to make us wonder and empathize on her fate.What also makes the film different than the others is the nuance of the scenes, always give a sense of homey, safe, environment, while the psychological side of the character(s) is worsening. The opposite sides make the unnerving, paranoid, and unsafe feelings are able to resonated to us. Polanski had Repulsion and The Tenant which share Rosemary's similar theme, but this film manages to top them both with stronger and deeper lead to convince us to join the macabre tour.Closing this review, Rosemary's Baby is deserved to be picked as one of the best horror film of all time, a classic that still able to shake our nerves even after 50 years passed. Not because it has scary images or gore, but because the film can capture the development of Rosemary's character well, through the setting and the plot, makes us understand what's the best of a horror film: The uneasy feelings that keep linger even after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Rosemary's Baby 7/10,"Try this, compare Rosemary's Baby to all the horror movies that came out in 1968 and does anything hold a candle to this film's production, cinematography, flawless editing and high level acting? Speaking only to Roman Polanski's film-making, it's really a shame that there isn't many risk takers to produce a good written horror film like him. Mia Farrow does a terrific job in portraying a normal outgoing city-dweller who turns into a paranoid, helpless mess. It's in the details of Farrow's reactions and elegant line delivery that really make some scenes chilling. Rosemary's Baby however, does fall short in really memorable moments and an impactful ending.

"Overrated and Disappointing Horror.  Definitely not a ""Classic.""","I appreciate horror films that horrify by means of atmosphere and mood instead of blood and gore. Rosemary's Baby has the atmosphere...just not the horror. The atmosphere in this movie is undeniably well-crafted. The acting is great. The characters are well-developed. Rosemary is portrayed as a vulnerable woman in a patriarchal society. Everything seems to be in place for a tremendous horror movie. However, all this film does is set the scene. It delivers nothing in the way of horror, thrills, chills, or anything of the sort. And no, this is not because of the lack of blood and gore.This movie proceeds at a tortuously slow pace and the suspense is non-existent. I realize that Polanski intentionally creates a ""normal"" environment in this film in order to introduce horror in subtle and psychological ways. But no horror is ever introduced. I kept watching the time tick on my DVD player wondering when something--anything--would happen to catch my attention. After sitting through two hours of this film, I had to reference the DVD case to verify that the film was indeed just 136 minutes long. I couldn't believe that it was almost over and I had not yet seen anything worthwhile. I never did.The ending was the same as the rest of the film--boring, uneventful, and not even slightly horrifying. Some horror/thriller films escalate the suspense only to disappoint with a weak ending. In Rosemary's Baby, the suspense was never built. My disappointment only comes as a result of high expectations before watching this movie. Overall, a huge disappointment.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant Polanski film,"No matter how one feels about Roman Polanski's personal life, one has to admit he has moments - sometimes days and months - of sheer genius. 1968's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is one example. A psychological horror film, Polanski depends on the power of suggestion and elements of mystery to build the story, which is very faithful to Ira Levin's novel.It's very hard to write a review from the perspective of someone who has just seen Rosemary's Baby for the first time and has never read the book. I've seen it countless times, so I can't remember now what I thought originally. But a first-time viewer, I guess, wouldn't actually know whether Rosemary was paranoid and hysterical or, in fact, if there are really strange goings-on. This makes the story all the more potent.In the book, Rosemary isn't the frail-looking woman that Mia Farrow is, but Farrow is perfect as the fragile, passive Rosemary. Cassavetes as her actor-husband does all the actor-y things of imitating different people, etc., and is great. Of course, Ruth Gordon is a standout as nosy Minnie Castevet, every mannerism, from looking at a soup can label to dropping by with chocolate mousse, is fantastic, and she deservedly won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her performance. Polanski called on a cast of experienced stars for the supporting roles: besides Gordon, there is Maurice Evans, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, and Elisha Cook, Jr. Tony Curtis is the voice of the unfortunate actor whom Guy replaces on Broadway.Polanski sets up a compelling tale of religious conflict, ambition, terror, and isolation with the backdrop of New York City and the exterior of the famous Dakota (where John Lennon was killed) as the infamous building where Rosemary, Guy, and the Castevets live.For those who are interested, Ira Levin wrote a sequel to this, ""Rosemary's Boy,"" I believe, that takes place in 1999.

Just like the 1973 movie ""Don't Look Now"", the horror is hidden in the creepy story that keeps you guessing till the end what is truly going on and who you are to believe.The movie is told in a good slow pace which makes the movie and the characters more realistic. Also the atmosphere is another element that adds to the realistic feeling of the movie. Thing I wasn't really to happy about was the editing. At times the movie jumps just from one scene to another without any 'warning'. For instance, the main characters are talking in the living room and boom, the next moment they are sitting at the dinner-table. I'm almost positive that this was done on purpose and that it was perhaps merely an experiment but it was not something I was happy about. So experiment failed in my opinion.Really my favorite moments were the dream sequences. There were just like real dreams are; weird and not logical. Quite possible the most realistic dream sequences featured in a movie-history. Real kudos to Roman Polanski for the magnificent directing of this movie.The actors portray their characters very realistic and are helped by the solid script and dialog. I love how they made Rosemary the only real true main character of the movie. There are not a lot of movies that focus so much on mainly the female character as this movie. Yes, of course there are enough movies where a female is the main characters but most of those movies also feature a much present male character, or other characters. This movie focuses mainly on just Rosemary, especially towards the ending when her paranoia and fear grows and she begins to feel more and more alone and helpless.An highly original and unforgettable horror movie that is up there with the best movies of the '60's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finest Horror Film Ever Made,"Rosemary's Baby, in my humble opinion, is the finest horror film ever made. While staying true to its genre and certainly scaring its audience, this movie is great for a number of other reasons.  It possesses some intagible quality that is difficult to explain or express.  The film has an erie tone to it that certainly adds to its spook factor.  However, it is also a very clever and funny picture at the same time.  In short something just feels askew thoughout the whole movie, and this is what makes it such a uniquely fantastic film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

here is the best review I red on imdb: A quiet, erudite chiller, but not conventionally frightening
magic_marker8 June 2002
If there are omens in this world, they were not heeded by the makers of Rosemary's Baby. The director would soon see his own pregnant wife disemboweled by the Manson family, the actor hired to play Satan would be revealed as a serial rapist, the leading lady would see her husband engage in an affair with someone who was effectively their daughter, and the building around which the film was shot would 12 years later bear witness to the tragic death of John Lennon.This was without a doubt a cursed film, and its sado-sexual undercurrents are ultimately made more powerful by knowledge of the evils, perversions, and obsessions woven into the myth of its making.However, do not expect to be overtly frightened by this film. Unlike more recent ""traditional"" horror films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others,"" this film will not make you jump. It is instead a slightly comic, often disturbing psychological portrait of one innocent woman's breakdown as she comes into contact with the carnal and callous power of Satanism. Mia Farrow plays this breakdown perfectly. Her performance (easily the best she has ever given) is potently tremulous, and effectively walks the fine line between hysteria and conviction. The Satanists, into whose complete power she is delivered by her husband, possess a wonderfully concealed menace, particulaly the obstetrician, a smiling, cold-eyed fascist.The once infamous scenes, such as Rosemary eating raw liver, lack the shock value they once had, and are filmed in such a documentary style that whatever horror they could have conveyed is lost on modern audiences. Whatever power the film has is entirely invested in Rosemary's descent into madness, and that is still as powerful as ever",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too slow,"I have to join the legion of folks that thought this movie was quite longer than I would have made it. Hitchcock kept Psycho down to 1hr. and 45min. and that is one thing I wish Polansky did here. Recently I've seen The Pianist and thought it was really good but, despite the good direction and camera work the plot to Rosemary's Baby doesn't quite stand up to the 2hr. and 15min. mark. I must admit that within the last hour somewhere I do get sucked into the movie and enjoy it quite a bit but, if this movie had a half hour cut out of it the film would excite many more people and be more deserving of the horror genre. If you want a thrilling or horrifying classic movie stick with Hitchcock's Psycho, Vertigo, etc. or some of Kubrick's works, Halloween, and some Stephen King adaptations. Mr. Polanski, if you want to create a good horror movie either you or your editor needs to weed out unimportant pieces of information so the story will play out in a more suitable time frame. This should not be considered one of the top 20 horror movies on IMDb and should have been told in less time and that is why I give 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
perfect,"I saw this movie first like nine years ago, and I was so deeply impressed that I gave it a *9* when I joined the Movie Database - an unusually high rating because thrillers are not my favorite genre. Furthermore, when I saw it for the second time - afew days ago - I remembered every detail; what a higher compliment can you make to a movie? Although you might say that the topic is - nowadays - a bit 'old-fashioned' - and object that, during the last fifteen minutes, there are some superfluous explanations, you have to admit that every little finger-movement in the film is well-thought, that the moment when Mia Farrow has the first look to her 'baby' is TERRIFIC, that Cassavete's silent metamorphosis during the film is absolutely convincing, that all the acting in its blend of everyday behavior and cruelty is simply perfect - and so is the whole movie. At the second view, it might not make you shiver as at the first time. But you won't find an 'error' nor any tastelessness. (The good taste is something of the time, I guess; despite the differences, Hitchcock has it, too.)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
ANXIOUS.,"It was not that scary, just anxious. It's definitely worth the respect it gets as a horror classic.

Masterpiece,"Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse take a lease in the Black Bram. Rosemary wants a baby and Guy intends to build a career in theatre. Their neighbours are only too willing to assist... to take control... to take over. Greed and a desire to succeed grip Guy hook, line and sinker; he will sacrifice everything. Late night gatherings, gifts and a cocktail of drugs pull Rosemary in a kinds of directions until we feel her giddiness. Yet, Rosemary is pulled into a conundrum she cannot solve quickly enough. Even the death of a personal friend is mistaken for coincidence. Yet, the happy couple rejoice in Baby Night. But, the term of pregnancy is a nightmare. Paranoia trumps paranoia in this horrific situation. Becoming more isolated and fragile gets little sympathy from Guy. After all, the Devil is at work, and Guy is in with the in crowd.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a horny devil!,"Pretty housewife Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) are over the moon when they secure a spacious new apartment just right for starting a family. Not long after moving in Rosemary suffers a horrific physical assault that leaves her a shadow of her former self: she's given a dreadful pixie haircut by Vidal Sassoon that makes her look like a young David Bowie. Oh, and she gets knocked up by Satan as well.Roman Polanski's faithful adaptation of Ira Levin's bestseller Rosemary's Baby is an unmissable treat, a slow-burn classic of the Satanic horror sub-genre that builds inexorably to its chilling climax with class and style, never resorting to cheap scare tactics (which some might find surprising given that producer William Castle is renowned for his schlock horror B-movies).Polanski's approach is all about the foreboding atmosphere and mounting tension, building slowly on the sense of dread first triggered by a potted history of the infamous Bramford Building (given by Rosemary's friend Hutch) with a series of bizarre incidences that eventually have Rosemary believing that her neighbours are witches aiming to steal her as-yet unborn baby. Of course, Rosemary is not far wrong but Polanski cleverly toys with his audience right to the finish, almost having us doubt her sanity towards the end despite all that we have seen.Barring a brief glimpse of a bloody corpse—a suicide victim who hits the sidewalk with a splat—the film is totally devoid of gore, but even if you usually prefer your horror drenched in red, this effective chiller still comes highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Masterful , Horror-full & Creepy ? -- What the Hell ..!!","This is my first review in IMDb and i wanna Thank Rosemary's Baby for that.I watched this movie because of the recommendation from most people. The movie started and it took over 45 minutes to enter the plot . Till that there was nothing but meaningless drama . Then the director finally entered the plot which obviously and clearly revealed the movie's end and so the unnecessary drama continues till the tail.I don't know which part of the movie is CREEPY and why they are showing the genre HORROR.

Tannis Anyone?,"Movies were constantly raising the bar for shocking in the late Sixties but few succeeded like this one. It was one of the last films officially 'Condemned' by the Catholic Legion of Decency. The dream sequences were easily the best of their time and continue to hold up well. Polanski's delight in the medium is palpable throughout but it never distracts from the narrative. The movie's texture --sophisticated Manhattan, but attainable-- resonates beautifully in the Christmas season scenes and later, when the temperature rises and Rosemary fumbles in a public phone booth. Note the gay friends at Ro and Guy's party. All the actors are in top form. Mia Farrow, lovely and vulnerable but crucially believable. Cassavettes as an ambitious actor, young but his biological clock is ticking. Did the Catholic Church get it right? This exemplifies the subversive power of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good thriller,"This is a very good thriller with top notch performances. But it is not really a horror movie. In fact, I think it will disappoint many horror fans. Blood is kept to an absolute minimum, same for the supernatural element, although the whole movie is about some supernatural occurrences. So, don't expect the chilling atmosphere and the very scary scenes you find in normal horror, like the Woman in Black, Ju-on or The Changeling. These movies are really intense, eerie and frightening.Rosemary's baby is not the same kind of movie. It is about the agony of a woman that planned to have a baby but got pregnant under some strange circumstances. It is a stylish movie where all the actors deliver very nice performances. The dream scenes are really, well, dream-like. They make you lose touch from reality. There is quite a mystery too but no plot twists or unpredictable turns.An overall solid supernatural thriller with some disturbing elements.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The purest psychological thriller,"This movie is an amazing accomplishment - it manages to get under your skin and give you sleepless nights with almost no display of gore (there is one slightly gory scene), violence (there is one rape scene, but it is not very disturbing due to its implausibility) or pale ghosts with long hair. When the movie started, I was a bit underwhelmed because it seemed like just an ordinary drama. This was intentional I suppose - the director was shooting for a gradual build up of the feeling of dread. I wasn't prepared for how disturbing the movie would eventually get. As Rosemary's sense of paranoia and feelings of despair increased, I found myself empathizing with her. The tragic culmination was absolutely perfectly done, and I felt a sense hopelessness for Rosemary's situation, almost like she was a family member or a close friend. Not many psychological thrillers / horror movies have had this effect on me, and for this reason, I highly recommend it to people who are looking for horror movies that deliver more than just a few scares.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
To 1966! The year One.,"On it's own, this is a dang fine movie! But I'm even more of a fan as it stays pretty true to the novel! And the casting is almost dang near spot on!

Mia Farrow is really, really good in her role, as is Ruth Gordon, who reminds me of almost all of the older, nosy women in my life! And even though it is set in 1965/66, it doesn't really seem dated, other than the phone booths and the old television clicker.

A Traumatic Trailblazer...,"THIS is the movie that made it possible to get films like THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN green-lighted. You have to be of a certain age to remember, let alone appreciate this one, because too many of ""today's generation"" of horror film lovers have been spoon-fed so much absolute crap, they won't watch anything that doesn't have limbs and blood-filled condom squibs flying everywhere. Too bad. ROSEMARY'S BABY, though somewhat dated, is still a classic case of big-city paranoia multiplied exponentially.It was William Castle who optioned Ira Levin's chart-burning bestseller, but Paramount had absolutely no confidence in his directorial abilities by this time, so the job of adaptation and direction was handed off to red-hot auteur Roman Polanski, (who - considering the tragic events that tore apart his life - was perfect for the job,) leaving Castle to produce. In hindsight, it was probably a really good idea, since the story is rooted firmly in those crazy themes that are Polanski's bread and butter - urban angst, isolation, and fear of the unknown...more the kind of unknown about your other half, your neighbors and especially yourself.Mia Farrow (whose career was practically made by this movie) and critically-acclaimed actor/filmmaker John Cassavettes were perfectly cast as Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, blushingly naive newlyweds who move into a huge brownstone in Manhattan as Guy's acting career is just starting to take off. (The infamously famous Dakota - yes, THAT one - stars as their new digs.) It's big, it's dark and it's tremendously creepy in a way that undoubtedly inspired a lot of movies after it - think a much older version of Sigourney Weaver's poltergeist-infested penthouse in GHOSTBUSTERS. In other words: the perfect place to find some supernatural mischief going on.Which is not what Guy and Rosemary find...well, not at first. The most they discover is that they have a pair of unbelievably friendly - and nosy - neighbors, an older couple named Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer, and in her Oscar-winning turn, the late, great Ruth Gordon.) The Castevets are just a little too interested in Guy and Rosemary's personal life, their day-to-day comings and goings, and the fact that the younger couple is very determined in adding a third member of the family very soon.Remember how your mother told you never to talk to strangers? Let me add a new rule: never accept suspicious gifts or food products from the kindly little old lady next door. Besides that, there's all kinds of strange noises and general weirdness going on, conveniently when Rosie's at home by herself and Guy's out working.The important thing to pay attention to is how Rosemary's freaked-out state of mind, combined with the creepy influence of the brownstone, plays an important part in the goings-on around her. Especially when people start dying - from the nice girl from across the hall she meets who ""commits suicide"", to the sudden illness and demise of family friend, Hutch (Maurice Evans). Oh, and to top it all off is one of the most chilling sequences in horror, when she does get pregnant...but there's a really good chance that Guy's not the daddy. (I don't think I have to go into a lot of details - you get the picture.)Okay, so basically, the clothes, the surroundings, the pop-culture references are ""ancient"" enough to leave most newbies scratching their heads. Pay no attention to that stuff, my dears. Just let yourself soak up the atmosphere of menace and dread so superbly provided by Polanski, production designer Richard Sylbert and DP Bill Fraker (not to mention the spine-freezing score by Polish composer Krzystof Komeda). And enjoy the great performances by the leads and all the supporting cast, but especially Ms. Gordon. You'll never think of ""Noo-Yawk"" grand-bubbie types the same way again.As far as recommendations go, this is NOT a rental. If you're a true horror fan, you should already have this as an essential part of your library, in the ""Satanic Specialties"" section.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slow-paced but highly rewarding and chilling experience,"Moving into a lavish apartment complex, a woman becomes increasingly concerned of the elderly residents' concern of her after becoming pregnant and gradually uncovers a sinister plot to offer her unborn baby to their devilsh master.This here manages to be one of the enjoyable and entertaining classic horror efforts around. With the only real problem within being a languished pace that really draws the running time up and make it far longer than it really needs to be, there's a lot to like here. One of the best aspects utilized here is the slow-burn pacing that runs through here as the events wind themselves around her entire pregnancy and that allows for the gradual unraveling of the clues, from the older couples constant interference in their daily lives and offering pregnancy tips and advice, the constant rebuttals of anything she feels as out-of-the-ordinary being commonplace and finally the gag with the name really cluing in the final act. While none of this is really centered around a series of jolts or shocks or even anything creepy beyond the hallucinogenic impregnation, that this really remains watchable as nothing happens is a strong suit of the film and really works quite well in keeping this one interesting. Of course, the finally is all sorts of creepy and chilling, giving this another solid point about it and really generating a lot of excitement about it, making it one of the more rewarding experiences around.Today's Rating-R: Violence, Nudity, Language and a drug-laced Rape scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Perfect In It's Screenplay But So Much Of It Is Done Right That It Shouldn't Be Missed,"Rosemary's Baby wasn't the film that introduced me to the works of Roman Polanski but rather it was Chinatown. So I came into this with very high hopes and thinking it may even top the previous film I have watched, due to the hype and the intriguing subject matter. After watching it twice already, I can clearly say that Rosemary's Baby isn't perfect but it has a lot to offer that proves that it cannot be missed.Rosemary's Baby was based off the novel by Ira Levin and was adapted to the screen by Roman Polanski. I haven't read the novel so I cannot say whether or not the film drives away from the source material but what Polanski has given us here is quite interesting with only minor trips that prevent this from being a perfect film. The film mainly follows through Rosemary's experience during her pregnancy and as she gets closer to the end, she also gets closer to the truth. As much as I enjoyed seeing this concept being explored, it was dragged down by the lack of incentive to keep us emotionally engaged throughout, instead all that was bottled up for the second half of the film once the tension started to build. This made the first half felt a little stretched out and at times feeling unnecessary. Polanski cleverly avoids giving any confirmation of our suspicions until the last few minutes of the film as throughout the film we follow Rosemary alone, along with her paranoia and stress, and never gives us any moment of peace from it.Rosemary's Baby is Roman Polanski's fifth film. Polanski creates his first hour of the film to feel like a play, with characters just talking to one another in a confined space and allowing the actors to completely use their surroundings in order to gain a natural performance. The last hour of the film is where things start to pick up and the horrors of the situation emerge and have us feel stressed for Rosemary. Though I thought highly in Polanski's efforts in creating the first half of the film, regardless I felt that it was quite slow and lacked a bit of a visual or mental incentive to keep us completely invested. It becomes much more enjoyable in subsequent viewings when we already know what happens to Rosemary and understand what every character's motives were.The cinematography of the film was handled by William A. Fraker, who later on in his career will be nominated awards for his work but for Rosemary's Baby it was under-appreciated. Which I found understandable because this film did truly feel take an amateurish style of photography, with shots only showing what it needs to show you in order to move film along. Fraker for the most part has his camera constantly moving, it is not so obvious as it only really moves because the actors are moving or are doing some action and the audience needs to see it in order for us to gain something from it. As we get closer to the end, Polanski and Fraker allows us to get closer and closer to Rosemary emotionally supported with tighter close ups and using the camera as a shadow following her wherever she goes.Krzysztof Komeda is the film's composer and what he has created is hauntingly beautiful. Komeda's score rarely is in display as the film uses silence to create tension at the start and allows the dialogue more to be in display and not have us be too distracted from the actors. The lullaby chant at the beginning of the film is one of the most frightening things I have heard as it has this undertone of evil under it, but if it is just heard as the lullaby alone without the instrumental or Fraker's photography it would just sound like a mother singing to her child with no dark undertone. I wish that the film did contain more of his score as it was truly well crafted but I guess it would have interfered with Polanski's vision.The film's actors truly have to work their asses off for this film, as it demands so much from them, Rosemary in particular. Mia Farrow as Rosemary Woodhouse was so great as she portrays this character who is suffering such elevated stress and who feels alone and lonely during her pregnancy even when there are people around her. Farrow makes us feel like we're the only one who is there for her. John Cassavetes was great as Guy Woodhouse. Cassavetes was able to play a man who doesn't come off at all as unlikable, even if certain events and motives may seem to fracture his character. Ruth Gordon has impressed me on a little film called Harold and Maude, and I think for Rosemary's Baby she is playing a less complex and interesting character, Minnie Castevet. Nevertheless, Gordon doesn't disappoint here with her character rambling on and on, never seeming to give Rosemary or Guy a window of opportunity to even react. Though probably faithful to the novel, I felt that her character needed a bit more for me to truly enjoy watching the character.Rosemary's Baby may not be a perfect film in my eyes but it gets so many things right that I can't help but go back to this when I feel like watching a film that can terrify me and keep me engaged with the technical aspects of the film. The acting is, for the most part, a joy to watch and the film contains patient and subtle cinematography. Polanski has made something wonderful that should at least be given a try even if the subject matter may be too dark for some.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric Thriller,"A young couple moves into a New York City apartment, where strange things start happening. Making his first American film, Polanski expertly creates a suspenseful atmosphere where tension builds slowly but surely in this influential supernatural thriller, helped by a haunting score. As with his earlier ""Repulsion,"" the director conveys horror not so much by what is shown as what is suggested. As a young woman undergoing a difficult pregnancy, to put it mildly, Farrow is terrific in a star-making turn. Cassavetes may be miscast as her husband, but Gordon and Blackmer are quite effective as nosy neighbors. The cast features such familiar faces as Bellamy, Cook, Henry, and Grodin.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Constantly keeps you guessing,"Rosemary's Baby is the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassavettes), a young couple who just moved into a New York City apartment. They have two elderly neighbors who appear to be friendly but a bit too friendly, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer). Rosemary eventually gets pregnant after they try to and this leads to the hysteria of the film as she can't trust anyone around her. She hasn't an idea of what is going on, who has done what to her, or who's side anyone is on. It's complete confusion for her. It's hard to completely describe this film without giving things away, so that's about all I'll talk about plot wise.The wonderful thing about this movie is you feel like Rosemary's character, you have no idea what the truth is, who the people around her are for sure, and up until the very end, you still aren't. The movie will make you think one way and then completely flip it the other way around. It isn't so much a horror movie as it is a psychological thriller depicting hysteria of witchcraft and what's real or isn't. And it works is the amazing part, many times films like this where they try to keep you guessing are unsuccessful where as I found this one to work nearly all of the time.Sometimes though, Rosemary is much too naïve, it can be a bit much but it's a kind of a suspension of disbelief thing where it needs to be there for the plot to progress although, Mia Farrow does a good job of playing it as well as playing hysterics. The movie is well-shot especially the simple opening credits sequence with the haunting music played over it. In addition, the ending was an interesting one, it will leave you thinking, and it left me unsure of what to think but I think I liked the way it ended because it wasn't the thing I expected which made it more interesting. Overall, this is a unique film especially considering I went into it thinking it would be Exorcist/Possession esque movie but its more of smart movie about who/what to believe.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Biggest Satanic Cult Film Ever Made?,"Guy and Rosemary move into a new apartment (the Bramford) and hope to have a baby. But Guy is having trouble finding work as an actor. Once his luck improves, Rosemary is pregnant and her pregnancy becomes more and more unbearable and her neighbors even more and more strange and intruding. What is going on in this apartment?I want to say Mia Farrow was pretty hot in this movie. I don't know why. I mean, she's really not all that hot, and for a good part of the movie she has very short hair which is generally very unattractive on women. Even Guy tells Rosemary that her haircut is the biggest mistake she ever made (and I'm inclined to agree). Yet, you got me Mia... well played.I'm also concerned about the film's anti-Semitism. I've never heard anyone accuse the film of anti-Semitism before, but it seemed possible to me. The satanic doctor had a Jewish-sounding name and the satanic neighbor lady had a very stereotypical Jewish manner about her. Now, it's never stated anyone is Jewish, but it seems to me like that is what Polanski was hinting at. Which is very odd, having Jews be running a Satanic cult to harm Catholic women. I mean, having a cult is one thing, but a Jewish devil-worshiping cult seems like a bad idea.Anyway, this film is of course very good. It's now roughly forty years old and still a classic by both horror and general cinema standards. And I'm not going to say the people who have judged it so are wrong. It really broke ground in some ways. A rape scene involving Satan? You don't see that a lot in movies, at least not in movies that many mainstream people watch. Which is perhaps too bad. I like a good bit of devil rape every now and then.But yeah, the plot is good, the acting good (Rosemary comes off as really naive and far too submissive, but it was the 1960s so I guess that happens). The suspense was very nice, and although the audience is usually two steps ahead of Rosemary in figuring things out, it's nice to see her come across the twists and turns -- is she going mad or is there really something dark lurking under every cradle?Watch this film, if for no other reason than to see D'Urville Martin (""Dolemite"") or hear the voice of Tony Curtis. Or wonder why Mia Farrow can maintain a hotness with short hair. There's no real nudity, no real gore (in fact, none). But this is classic story-telling at its finest.

A true classic,"This is my favorite horror movie--actually one of my favorite movies, period. It features fantastic direction and performances (special kudos to John Cassavettes, who never gets proper recognition for just how good he was here), a wonderfully 60's-sounding music score that goes from frothy to sinister in mere seconds, and of course there's the intricately brilliant story, faithfully adapted from Ira Levin's 1967 novel. It is one of those movies that effortlessly absorbed and channeled back the tenor of the times in which it was made -- for example, the storyline clearly expands upon the youth movement's late 60's rallying cry of ""Never trust anyone over 30,"" and in one pivotal scene there is a glimpse of the ""Is God Dead?"" tempest that was a genuine thing, albeit briefly, in the violent, dark reality that was the USA in 1968. Enormously influential, Rosemary's Baby is an acknowledged classic, and a paranoid delight from start to finish. It gets a 10 out of 10, no question.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Timeless Entertainment,"One of the most remarkable things about this fine film is how little it has dated in almost half a century. Despite the lack of cell phones, computers and other current technology there is little to distract modern audiences from the plot. It's not like watching an old movie at all. Another phenomenal aspect is how well Polanski (a newcomer to the US at the time) conveyed such a trenchant feel for New York City. The direction is sure-handed and the action is well- paced. There are just the right amounts of humor thrown in to relieve the tension. ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Chinatown"" are unquestionably rivals for Polanski's best film. I think this one has the edge, as I defy anyone to not identify with the main character early on through to the end. The dream sequence is pure Polanski. In ""Repulsion"" he tried to make a whole film out of essentially a dream sequence, and it's rather contrived. Here, the surreal touches don't drive the action off course. Mia Farrow is perfect for the part and at age 23 holds her own against seasoned actors a generation or two older. John Cassavetes, who is very good as the husband, always struck me as a bit too old for the part of a struggling actor just starting out (he was 38). The supporting cast is superb, with Ruth Gordon stealing the show (and an Oscar in the process) and Patsy Kelly running a close second. ""Rosemary's Baby"" holds up well to repeated viewings and continues to entertain even after you know where all this is going. It has all the hallmarks of a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Polanski misses the mark in this early film.,"This movie by director Roman Polanski has a very good cast, a certain realism of the 1960's and some fine street photography in New York City. I like the two main characters, with John Cassevetes and Mia Farrow as a young, romantic couple; Ruth Gordon was very entertaining as the snoopy, older tenant in the nearby apartment. However that's about all the praise I can muster for this film. I am even more disappointed because I read and enjoyed the book by Ira Levin. Very little of that enjoyment transmitted to the screen version. The film was shown on AMC and wasn't helped by lengthy and frequent commercial interruptions. The horror didn't register on the fright meter for me. Just ridiculously phoney. I'm totally surprised by the number positive reviews it actually gets.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's baby,"Rosemary's baby This film is certainly horror for me. First of all the soundtracks of movie like Krzysztof Komeda's Lullaby make me irritate. The movie is extremely complicated and full of secretive scene.İn fact Rosemary's Baby is one of the masters of twentieth century suspense and it is described as a product of the counter-cultural movement during the Vietnam War in the 1960's, a time when The Establishment were viewed with suspicion and hostility. During this time, the largest movement of modern satanism start.The director Instead of use blood and violence to scare audiences he uses genuine psychological tension. It is the differences between Rosemary's Baby and other horror films. The cast is fantastic for example Mia Farrow who play a leading role was ideal. She has got delicate beauty.She kept Rosemary's emotion sand thoughts right on her face so we know what she's thinking at all times and we can actually join her emotionally in her desperate fight to save her baby from the witches.I think what makes this movie scary is the fact that all these terrible things are happening to such an innocent, hopeless character Rosamary.If needed to explain, Rosemary (MiaFarrow) and her husband Guy(John Cassavetes) move to an apartment but they have estrange neighbors Roman ( Ruth Gordon) and Minnie Castevet( SidneyBlackmer) they seem to be very good person even though pull a trick to Rosemary . Guy likes the man spends a lot of time with them whereas Rosemary does not like them. When Rosemary becomes pregnant everything start to get strange.She begin to suffer and she start to understand somethings is wrong about her baby. But couldn't do anything because of her husband. After getting a book which is called all of them are witches then she realizes the deal between her husband and the elderly neighbors about the baby. İn spite of her struggle, she couldn't escape from th witches. And she gave birth to her weird, Satan baby accepting the baby as her child. All in all the movie is interesting but so scenario are distracting and hard to follow. At the same time it is gripping.",,Anonymous,Horror
Watch out for the choccy undertaste,"The ancient practice of witchcraft in Swinging 60's New York.Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move into the gothic apartment building known as The Bramford. Guy is an actor who doesn't seem to be getting the big breaks he deserves. That is until he meets the eccentric couple Minnie and Roman next door and then suddenly his luck changes. Could this change in his fortunes be coincidence or is there more than meets the eye?Everything about this film is perfect.On watching this masterpiece again I really tuned into the themes of gaslighting, narcissism and coercive control that occur between the characters who have something to hide from poor Rosemary. Check out the subtle exchange of glances that are swapped between Guy, Minnie and Roman after the Castavets are told that Rosemary is pregnant.The film is also about abuse and the need for the victim of that abuse to speak her truth and have her voice heard. The scene of her telling what she believes to be the truth to Charles Grodin's Dr Hill is both liberating but then ultimately heartbreaking.Watch out for Polanski's direction and marvel at how deft, innovative and revolutionary it is. The scene where Minnie is sat on Rosemary's bed just out of view still makes me crane my neck to look around the door frame to see her more clearly. Now thats genius.The film builds to one of the most unsettling climaxes in film history. And then the scene after that is is even more disconcerting.Ruth Gordon's performance is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. The perfect alignment of perfect writing with an actress who was born to play the part.Look out for the cameo by William Castle.I cannot recommend this film enough. If you haven't seen it you're in for a treat. If you have seen it then watch it again. You're still in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Brilliantly shot with beautiful sets, smooth establishing shots, and several impressive single-shot scenes. Most of the acting is excellent for the era, with the few bumps getting disguised nicely; and an overall evenly paced conflict leading to a timeless climatic scene.

Take a good hard look,"OK, short and sweet, SCREAM is a great film, but it's now created a genre whereby the ironic awareness of, and emotional distance from, the scary stuff is heightened (along with the gore and cheap shocks), and the plot, character, and atmosphere is lessened. ROSEMARY'S BABY maintains a growing paranoid creepiness that builds to a horrifying climax, with no tongue-in-cheek hipness, MTV soundtrack, or digital effects. You never even has to show you the devil baby, just Mia Farrow's reaction. Gee, what was Polanski thinking? Please-more films like this, less like I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU BLAH BLAH BLAH.",,Anonymous,Horror
Errie,"I watched this classic for the first time the other day and I have to say that this movie still holds up. It's eerie and creepy from the opening shot; the dreams were David Lynch/ Twin Peaks-like. The whole entire film was a slow burn to the end.
The ending is so good, the reveal that her son is a demon is everything and more; everyone yelling ""hail satan"" is too funny.
The chase sequence was so intense and suspenseful. When Rosemary locks the door and goes to use the phone and two gentleman walk pass the doorway, I felt so helpless for her. The fact that her husband, doctor, and everyone around her has been gas lighting her felt so horrifying.
Overall, I really enjoyed the film and I really thought that I wouldn't have. The music was good and the character development was very good. I'm curious about how people from around that time reacted to the satanism. There's a lot of things from Rosemary's Baby that remind me of Hereditary.P.S. HAIL SATAN!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Devastating and Horrific 10/10,"Rosemary's Baby is one of the most diabolically evil and twisted films ever made.

The rest of the cast, from her jerk of a husband Cassavetes, to the smarmy Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, are all perfect.

The creepiest antithesis ever made,"I have only seen two Roman Polanski films in my time and this is by far is his best effort (the other being ""The Ninth Gate"" which was also well-done). Polanski did justice to Ira Levin's seminal antithesis to the first few chapters of the Gospel of Luke.  The name of the book and movie are just astounding itself.  Mia Farrow was well cast as the paranoid and protective Rosemary.  Ruth Gordon was excellent as the sugar-coated, sour-centered next door neighbor.  The story was provocative, spooky, and it got under my skin. It ranks in my ""skin-crawling"" movie list.  Overall, this is a well-made creepshow that will probably make any man want to pick up a Bible and read it from cover to cover.  10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe Satan's not so bad after all,"Of course it looks bad at the outset: young Rosemary is unwittingly impregnated by the Prince of Darkness. In the end, is it really so different than the ""immaculate conception"" story associated with Jesus? Sure, he probably had better spin doctors, so of course his tale sounds a little more wholesome. What this film seems to say is that Satanism is just another choice of belief. For worshipping Satan, the cultists do very little that is egregious. Their sneaky behavior looks bad because they had to be sneaky, since such momentous events as the birth of Satan's son is apt to be misconstrued by polite society. What I'm saying is that the reason this film is so creepy is that the characters are all so ""normal"" (if a bit eccentric). Revealing to mainstream America the concept that even Satan worshippers are not so different from the culture at large is perhaps more disturbing than a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" because there is no safe distance for the audience from the material.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An amazing thriller that keeps you guessing,"I'm not a fan of the horror genre and I have to admit that I get scared easily. There are some films though that I just couldn't miss and Rosemary's Baby is one of them. Watching it made me realize once again how big is the gap between our days and the 60's. The film has nothing to do with horror movies released in the 21st century and actually it isn't that scary. That's not to say it isn't good. On the contrary, it's a great psychological thriller that keeps you wondering until the very end.Set in New York City, the story starts with a young couple, Rosemary and Guy (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes respectively), recently married as it seems, who are looking to buy an apartment. They eventually settle in the ""Bramford"" dismissing their friend Hutch's (Maurice Evans) scary stories about infamous incidents that happened there. They soon get befriended by the wealthy old couple that lives next to them, Minnie and Roman (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer respectively). When under strange circumstances Rosemary gets pregnant, Minnie and Roman offer their help. Minnie arranges for her to have one of the best obstetricians in the city and prepares a herbal drink for her every day. As the day of delivery comes closer mysterious events start to occur that cause Rosemary to be suspicious of everyone around her.Roman Polanski proves his immerse talent in this film which is actually his first book adaptation ever. Supposedly, he was unaware that directors often adjusted book stories to make their films, resulting in Rosemary's Baby being the most faithful adaptation ever according to the author Ira Levin. Polanski (or maybe we should say Levin) effectively manipulates the audience from the beginning of the film. We are first presented with ominous events and rumours so to get a feeling that something terrible is going to happen. However, as we move on, despite Rosemary's fears and suspicions, there's hardly any proof for her outrageous allegations. She suspects her neighbours, but all they do is provide her with a herbal drink. She suspects her obstetrician, but he is one of the most renowned in the city, respected even by people that she trusts like Hutch and Dr. Hill. So, since we only follow the events from her point of view, we begin to doubt her. I mean, it's only natural for a mother to worry too much for her unborn child. What if all these are just in her imagination and the 2-3 unfortunate events are just coincidences? Unfortunately, the film's reputation precedes it. I knew something was going to happen from the beginning. It must have been a great experience back in 1968 when the audience was completely unaware of it. It still makes for an exhilarating picture though. The most impressive thing about the film, and the one that differentiates it so much from modern horror films, is that we never see anything visually scary. We don't see any gory scenes or scary satanic rituals or jump scares. We don't even get to see a single glimpse of the baby! It's all in the mind.Technically, Rosemary's Baby is flawless. Roman Polanski did an excellent job. The acting is solid and it's no surprise that Ruth Gordon's portrayal of the sinister Minnie Castevet won an Oscar. The score is the icing on the cake and the mesmerizing lullaby sung by Mia Farrow at the beginning and end of the film is one of the most memorable and haunting elements of the feature. What else is needed to say when the film is still discussed and analyzed today almost 50 years later? Even the reclusive Stanley Kubrick was reportedly impressed by it. An amazing picture altogether.More reviews at: https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stunning. Stands the test of time,"Strangely, I'd never seen Rosemary's Baby until recently. On reflection, I can imagine that at the time of its initial release it was viewed as scandalous, outrageous, horrific.I'll admit it doesn't compete on the same plain as the high-tech CIG assisted horror films of today for out and out blood and guts, but I don't think that was ever its intent.This movie is haunting, unnerving, subtle, and seductive.Roman Polanski  wasn't just playing the kazoo here. Every shot is styled, timed, and positioned meticulously, and beautifully to craft an ingenious adaptation of the Ira Levin novel. It's not without Polanski's own subtle touches. I love the aren't you Victoria Vetri, the actress?' question Rosemary (Mia Farrow) asks the real' Victoria Vetri (playing a bit part in the film's opening sequence).Ypu may recognize Samantha Steven's father,  Maurice (Maurice Evans) as Hutch'.Ruth Gordon is a scene stealer as the nosy neighbor, and John Cassavettes' shines in a very subdued and strong performance as Rosemary's husband, Guy, a man with a hidden agenda.A masterful piece of work, today, or tomorrow.",,Anonymous,Horror
Should be in the top 10 horror films,"I don't want to spend this review gushing about how good this film is and blah blah blah.  It is a masterpiece of cinema, bar none.  This movie is probably second only to the Exorcist because it is one of only a few films in the true gothic tradition.  Anyone that has read HP Lovecraft knows what I am talking about. Everything is designed just slightly askew, like the way the characters eat too fast or that bizarre accent of the lady next door. Nothing is as it seems, and that is the true beauty of it.My complaint is that films like this do not receive the respect they deserve.  In today's MTV culture anything that isn't exploding every five minutes is a sleeper.  What happened to the time when people had the patience to watch a film that had depth to it?  I realize that being in the top 30 of the IMDB ranking should be quite good, but why isn't it number 2? I enjoy comedy as much as the next person, but a film like Young Frankenstein does not deserve to be occupying spots in a serious genre. This film is like a painting by Picasso, and the rest are just comic books.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A top 25 classic,"If you look up any ""Top 25 Horror Movies of All Time"" lists, you are guaranteed to find 'Rosemary's Baby' on every single one of them. This 1968 classic takes on a subject that is already terrifying to most of us and makes it just that much worse. Rosemary is expecting and as her due date approaches, she knows that something is just not quite right. Roman Polanski brought a whole new kind of horror to the table that just wasn't that accessible at the time. Visionaries like Alfred Hitchcock, George A. Romero, and Polanski showed us that horror movies didn't need to just be about Frankenstein and Dracula. These men pulled horror out of the gutter and off the tail end of a joke and sparked a revolution that brought a legitimacy to the genre. Mia Farrow is perfect in this role. Her helplessness and innocence built up the suspense throughout the whole film until it was boiling over by the climax. Polanski gives us very good insight into the struggle of women's rights through this film as well. Farrow's character isn't able to think for herself. Much like Romero's main protagonist in 'Night of the Living Dead' (also made in the same year), both characters show how helpless women were made to feel back then and the struggle they had in just being able to voice their own opinion about something. If this film was made today, or remade, the inner struggle that Rosemary goes through wouldn't have the same impact as equality has strengthened the female vigor. However, if anyone could step into the shoes of Mia Farrow, it would be Gwyneth Paltrow. I do believe that she is this generations Farrow. It's ironic that Paltrow also starred in a Thriller in 1998 called 'Hush' in which she is pregnant and struggles with forces beyond her control. Paltrow was also born in 1971, so maybe she in fact Rosemary's baby. I loved this classic horror. I can't believe it took me this long to watch it. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the great classics of horror movies.,"Roman Polanski is a classic and his long career has consecrated him as one of the most influential directors of the twentieth century, although I don't have any sympathy for him as a person. This film is probably one of the most notorious and acclaimed of his career, and rightly so. When it debuted, in the late sixties, it was scary and I fully understand why. More than other horror movies so far, it used the permanent tension to keep the audience in absolute discomfort, not to mention that danger around a baby is something that touches the emotional side of anyone. It's something innate. The story takes place in an apartment building and revolves around Rosemary, a young woman who impregnates after having had a mysterious nightmare, when something possessed her sexually. Finally, other revelations, and the attitudes of a couple of elderly seemingly loving neighbors, convince her that she expects a son of the Devil, the Antichrist himself. Terrifying, is not? With such a good script it was easy to succeed, especially when Polanski so cleverly uses visual and sound effects as well as cinematography, misty and dense. Everything was thoughtfully designed to make us tense. Rape scenes are worthy of anthology. Today, by themselves, they don't scare us, horror movies have been so full of gore and blood that these scenes have lost their strength, but if we embed them in the film, they contribute a lot to our discomfort. Mia Farrow was at the highest level during the film, perhaps the most controversial of her career, since neither her husband supported her. Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon glared at the Castevets, the movie's villains. John Cassavetes is more restrained but does very well with his role. At present, this movie may not scare you as much as it scared you in the past, everything has its expiration date, but it remains one of the great classics of horror and must have a place on the shelf of any lover of this movie genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not suspenseful and pointlessly drawn out,"After hearing from a lot of horror movie fans that this is regarded as one of the best horror films of all time, I was intrigued to watch this movie. I love a lot of old horror films, such as The Fly (1958), Night Of the Living Dead (1968), The Last Man On Earth (1964), and Carnival of Souls (1962) to name a few. I was disappointed in Rosemary's Baby, however. The only creepy and suspenseful scene in my opinion was the rape scene. Almost the entire movie was dedicated to showing the pregnancy, attempting to build it up for a big finale, but the only real adversity shown during the pregnancy was pain in Rosemary's torso. It didn't exactly add any anxiety to the viewer, in fact if not for the rape scene earlier in the movie, one would have thought the movie was just a drama depicting the everyday struggles of soon-to-be parents. Without giving any spoilers, the ""big finale"" was very anticlimactic, and the ""twist"" was easily foreseen in the first third of the movie. It was not a shock and even for back when the movie came out, other horror movies had more impactful, shocking twists, such as the aforementioned Carnival of Souls that predates Rosemary's Baby by six years. Mia Farrow's acting was terrible and way overdone. It wasn't believable and was over-exaggerated to the point of breaking immersion at times. John Cassavetes's acting however was pretty good, and the rest of the cast varied from okay acting to fairly decent acting. Although everyone except for John Cassavetes was way over-exaggerating to new levels in the very last act. In fact, the acting at the very end by everyone was so hammed up, it was both cringey and made me burst out laughing to think it was and is considered spooky. Again looking at other films around the same time and predating this movie, I can't see this acting being considered good even at the era's standards. Vincent Price always delivered great, believable performances, being in movies for a couple decades before Rosemary's Baby came out. I just don't see how Mia Farrow's acting was praised at the time. The ""horror"" of the movie is only slightly scratched on the surface and deals with themes explored in more depth in earlier horror films. They could have done a lot more with the horror aspects of the story. If they cut out the supernatural from the plot and made it a drama movie about a newly married couple, I think I would have enjoyed this movie more, and that's a type of film I've never been interested in before. It was 2 hours of disappointment and does not stand out from all the horror movies released in the 1960's. I would like to hope that the novel the movie is based on is better, but watching this movie does not make me want to read the book so I will probably never find out.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Friends don't understand,"I've had friends complain that this wasn't a horror movie because there was no brutality or gratuitous bloodshed. They also complain that they don't get a look at the baby. I tell them that they have to leave that part to the imagination, and they always say that they don't have imaginations, and that's why they watch movies, so they don't have to imagine anything. I'm really not sure how to argue that. If anyone can help me on that, I'd be much grateful to you. About the movie? It was satiric, sardonic, sexual and eerie.

Rosemary's Baby - Movie Review,"Rosemary's Baby is a work of sheer brilliance that left me in complete awe.

Speaking of Mia Farrow, shes pretty damn amazing in this and one of her best performance I've seen from her. The same goes to the rest of the cast, especially John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon.The movie is a slow burn, but the pay off is satisfying and I always like that in movies when everything adds up to the end.

Great suspense,"I watched this older horror movie with an open mind, knowing already it was very popular in years past, a bit before my time though, yet I found the movie interesting and easy to watch, especially as Mia Farrow, thin and quite sexy, holds her own as a great actress.She was just 22 years old in this movie and that was back in 1968. Not bad acting for a girl so young.Anyway, the suspense builds up very slowly and by the time Mia chops off her cute hairdo for that dreadful reddish looking butch style hair cut, the story darkens as her suspicion grows about the strange neighbors next door.Mia's dream sequences, caused by drinking the neighbors concoction seemed more like a sixties style LSD trip then anything else. That was all cool and so was the surprising nude scenes that I didn't think they did back in these kinds of 1968 movies. I hope more people watch this great suspense, its a real classic.This movie really surprised me, in lots of ways. I gave it a good rating of 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
9.5/10,"Rosemery (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassavetes) Woodhouse have just moved into a new apartment. Life's going pretty decent for them and they are happily married. When Minnie Castavet (Ruth Gordon), their apparently friendly neighbor, starts to intrude a little to much on their privacy Rosemery, who has just gotten pregnant, starts to experience more and more unusual behaviors from the people around her and starts getting suspiciously sick.That is all the plot details I will let myself reveal for this film, I know that they are incomplete, but I also know that many people still have to watch this film and since it is so crucial to go into this one truly knowing as little as possible I will limit myself in the review too, in order to leave you the pleasure of experiencing for yourself the greatest horror film ever made.Almost fifty years from its release ""Rosemery's Baby"" still stands high as not only my favorite horror film, but one of the greatest films ever made, one of those that when occasionally adding up a top 20 features ever made, keeps being brought up to the top spots. This is a treasure of a film, one from which I have learned the most about filmmaking and one that I hope to convince you to watch if you haven't yet had the fortune to. This is an experience, a film that crawls into your head and body and doesn't leave you for a long time after having seen it.What distinguishes this film immediately, the element that truly makes it terrifying is its theme: this film is about true horror brought to life, this film is about the terror of a mother fearing the loss of her baby before it is even born. Now from that incredibly harrowing idea, Polanski builds up a film void of any clichés or any horror tropes: there aren't jump scares, there aren't actually any scares at all; this is a film about paranoia, about madness and stress, about your life being taken away from you and that is exactly what drives your mind crazy in watching it.The anxiety levels that are built up through the long takes used throughout the whole film are off charts. You feel as though weight is being put on your body and the more you go on the more pressure you feel as you struggle to shrug it off of yourself, but you just don't manage, the film keeps going on, keeps building, it even has a double climax which ticks you into thinking you are safe when in fact the whole stress and adrenaline you have built up for two hours is brought back to you in the final sequence which is as tense as I have ever been watching a film, as horrifying as anything you could experience and as surprising as you could believe.All of that is not just coincidence, the craft put into this film is stunning, what Polanski managed is unrepeatable and it is the mark of a great director in his prime state. He uses constantly long wide takes to capture everything going on in Rosemery's life, for two hours you witness her growing paranoia in brilliant little ways. Polanski plays with audience expectations and messes around with traditional filmmaking efforts to make the audience grow paranoid at the same pace of Rosemery. There is just one sequence in the whole film that could be considered horror, the rest of it is just apartment life, or is it? The attention to detail here is what make the difference, the little ways the actors move, the gargantuan and brilliant performance by Ruth Gordon who drives you crazy, the little information packages that are slowly delivers to you, the incredible sound design that shows how simple horror can be and how the fear of the unknown is what drives humans mad.As I said Ruth Gordon is brilliant in the film, half of the box office revenue should have gone to her for making the character of Minnie Castavet come to life in its fullest and most unsettling form. Yet all of the actors here are giving lessons into acting. Everyone of them contributes as a piece of the puzzle and once the whole picture is unveiled to you, you will appreciate their work for how glorious it is.The screenplay too is something to be studied. Interestingly enough it is considered one, if not the one, script to be the closest adaptation to a book ever written. Apparently the book lent itself easily to an adaptation because on a script level too the film is just flawless. Dialogue is absolutely incredible and every single line is layered with more than what meets the ear. Moreover, the character work is pitch perfect and does not lend itself to half of a dull moment, every person in the picture is on screen for the right time and function, you manage to digest the perfect amount of information for you to understand further developments and never too much for the whole ordeal to collapse.I have nothing but admiration for this film, even after multiple viewing it just keeps getting better, I keep discovering details and the paranoia I get from it just keeps growing, but don't worry, when it is all said and done what you will remember and take away from it is actually the adrenaline the film manages to fuel into your body, the experience you are given isn't worth a price it is just glorious cinema that uses the medium of visual storytelling to its full, top-most advantage and delivers one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

From the opening score, i could tell i was in store for one hell of a film. I just finished it ten minutes ago, so i'm pretty lost for words. It's amazing how such powerful films can leave you so breathless and speechless. I would try to write a review now, but i'm too in awe to say anything meaningful.Fans of this movie should also see Harold and Maude, which stars the late, great Ruth Gordon in another charming performance. She won an Oscar for Rosemary's Baby for Best Supporting Actress, and deservedly so.The music group Fantomas (created by Faith No More's Mike Patton) does a spectacular cover of the Rosemary's Baby score; it's eerie, haunting, and intense. Be sure to check that out! Also, for your own sanity, please try to avoid In-awe-of-the-masters' review of this movie. It is so ignorant, full of mistakes, and will probably make you really mad.

Ruth Gordon is Mesmerizing,"In the prime of a sexual revolution and an institutionalised fear of a crumbling of morals, Rosemary's Baby must have been terrifying, exciting and extremely relevant when it came out. It's one of the most bizarre horror films I've ever seen as it meanders between a top-notch soap opera, an art-house piece and an eastern horror film from the silent era. Mia Farrow is sweet and vulnerable as Rosemary and her descent from an up-and-comer into a paranoid young lady, terrified her neighbours are casting spells on her and her unborn baby. Whilst its extremely frightening, the performances and unorthodox direction is what carries the film. Ruth Gordon is mesmerizing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bathed in a creepy, brooding atmosphere. See it!","Is the occult enough to frighten us in this day and age? Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen may all be considered classics, but after all we've seen in real life since those films were made can the occult really still frighten us? Since the 1970s we've lived through wars, endless terrorist attacks, serial killers more gruesome than any Hollywood writer could imagine, you name it. So can someone just sit down and view a movie like Rosemary's Baby and be frightened by it? The answer is a definitive YES.I had seen parts of this before, but never the conclusion until sitting down and taking it all in the other evening. Though very heavily dated in terms of just about everything you'll see, Rosemary's Baby is still very suspenseful and just downright eerie. In the tradition of great horror films before it and a few since, this movie doesn't rely on buckets of blood, severed limbs, or cheap shocks when someone or something jumps into the frame. This one has a compelling story, and it lets its atmosphere smother the viewer in a cloud of doom and desperation. The story deals with a young couple moving into an old but stately apartment building on the Upper West Side of New York City. It is clear from the get-go that the other tenants of this building are just not right in many ways. Particularly the elderly couple next door as they have soon insinuated themselves into the young couple's lives in every way possible. After a while, the young woman finds herself pregnant, and things pretty much go downhill from there for her. By all means watch this film to experience the particulars for yourself.The writing, acting, directing and production design are top notch. Polanski was only getting started at this point, but still this is one of his best efforts. As the conclusion was approaching, there were three logical ways I expected this film to end. They chose my second ending. The first would have been the obvious choice of having Rosemary jump out a window to her death like the young woman earlier in the film. The third choice would have been for Rosemary to use the knife to stab the infant to death. But that would have been maybe too macabre. I think they made a good choice, but I don't really want to see the sequel which has nothing but poor reviews and was made by inferior talent. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dr. Sapirstein all the way!!,"If I have to be completely honest, I didn't really understand everything about this movie, I think it was about paranoia or something, I mean, half of what happens seems to be hallucinations and dreams, it's very confusing.But this movie has been very memorable to me thanks to one thing: Dr. Sapirstein. Now that is one doctor I wish was real.I've never had the courage to have a kid, and I'm starting to understand why... I don't have access to such a great doctor as Dr. Sapirstein. Like, if he existed and was my doctor, I would feel so much comfortable having a kid.

THIS will make you NEVER want kids,"Rosemary's baby is downright creepy.Mia Farrow plays a frail woman who unknowingly becomes the woman who will bear Satan's kid. And she finds out only when it's too late... I was disgusted when I first saw it, but a second watch made me see it's brilliance. The whole movie has a creepy, suspicious atmosphere,which puts you in the same scared place as Rosemary.None of the characters in this movie are the stereotypical ""EVIL"" characters which can be pointed out right away,there's no mise-en-scene to point out 'scary place!' for the audience. You really feel like there is no one you can trust, which is why this movie is so scary.The movie is also a good comment on a Catholic upbringing's effect on women. Rosemary is devout and goes along with what the Church and men say is best and right. A subtle hint is the fact that she uses the calender method, which is known to be very risky and unreliable. The best example comes with her submission during her pregnancy- It's 'take the pill, don't ask questions,don't worry your pretty head'. her dream also implies that the church considers you a sinner if you are raped. But whatever- I was scarred by my catholic upbringing.The best part about this film is the end. Rosemary has the baby, only to have it taken away by the satanists. But she accepts the child, thinking that god will triumph, and that she can change her child's fate. It attacks religion and motherhood in one blow. But evil wins, and that's refreshing for a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
ITS NOT A HORROR MOVIE,"I spent almost 2 hours waiting to horror scene and there is nothing ,It's a drama and mystery movie , So don't waste your time if think this Is a horror movie",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well-acted, amazingly directed, and with an atmosphere all of it's own.","Rosemary's Baby is perhaps the least violent 'horror' film I have ever seen.This is my first Roman Polanski film, and he does an amazing job. His screenplay is smart in really absorbing us into these characters' lives. The first half of the film can be seen as just a regular domestic drama in a way. He creatively directs the film so that by the time the climax comes it's just utterly fantastic. I won't say that the film was unpredictable though, partly in turns because whenever one sees a 'satan' film we hear about Rosemary's Baby. It's sort of like Psycho's big twist. It has had such a large legacy that it's shocking if you don't know what the film is really about.Saying that however, this is a meticulously detailed drama-turned mystery- turned thriller- turned horror film. It's also quite fascinating how little I got based on actual physical horror. I thought Mia Farrow was fantastic in this.",,Anonymous,Horror

One of the great horror movies!,"Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes), a struggling actor, move into what would seem to be the perfect apartment in New York City. Things seem to be going well for Rosemary; she meets some new friends in Roman and Minnie Castavet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) though she does find Minnie a tad annoying at times, her husband's career starts to take off even though as a result of a fellow actor's ill-fortune and on top of it all, Rosemary becomes pregnant much to her delight. However, Rosemary eventually starts to suspect that all is not what it seems and rapidly starts to believe that there is a fiendish plot against her, and her unborn baby.This movie, adapted from a novel by Ira Levin, was Roman Polanski's first American film and arguably one of his best. There is a certain intelligence to Rosemary's Baby' that is rarely found in a horror movie. Polanski is able to gradually call the audience's attention to the horror in the movie, instead of throwing it in our faces. Whereas other classic religious horrors such as The Exorcist' (1973) climaxed, if you will, part way through and then sought to underline the horror with multiple shocking sequences, this movie is different, in Rosemary's Baby' there is no real climax. Instead we have a gradual realisation of the truth developed wonderfully through some great direction and a remarkably strong screenplay (written by Polanski). While there can be no doubt in the audiences mind that something is indeed amiss, the feelings of fear are generated simply by the unknown. There are so many things that can lead you to a conclusion, but until the final twenty minutes there is no indication as to why these things are happening. Astonishingly the movie lasts in excess of two hours and yet does not feel as if it is dragging once. The opening fifteen minutes may cause the viewer to question where the movie is heading but after that Rosemary's Baby' becomes one of the most enchanting and engrossing horror movies ever made. Polanski created some rather disturbing nightmare sequences early on in the movie which mark the beginning of Rosemary's nightmare but are far from the end.Mia Farrow was nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance, and quite rightly so. Farrow's portrayal of the helpless mother desperately seeking to protect her unborn child is powerfully emotional. Ruth Gordon also put in a splendid (and Oscar-winning!) performance as the creepy character of Minnie. Gordon's performance gave an enormous realism to her character and portrayed her as being strange, but not in a necessarily evil way. Minnie's busy-body persona comes across as just that, a busy-body persona. The way Gordon plays her character shows an incredible tangency with similar people in the real world. Sidney Blackmer was also impressive as Minnie's husband. He portrayed the character as a kindly elderly man, so much so that during the final scenes his comments about the situation almost come across as making sense. The dying moments of the film are certainly dramatic as Polanski is able to play on maternal nature to finalise the horror aspect. The closing scene has an exceptionally eerie tranquillity to it and the viewer is left with a very strong thought in their mind. Undoubtedly, Rosemary's Baby' has one of the greatest endings in horror history and purposely fails to answer every question, which leaves the viewer to make their own mind up. The film's tangency with the real world, even though the movie's premise itself is somewhat absurd, allows for a rather chilling finale as the viewer is forced to ask - `what next?'  and only the viewer can answer the question. In some ways the cryptic ending of Rosemary's Baby' is one of its finest accomplishments.Rosemary's Baby' is one of the finest horror movies in the history of cinema and I highly recommend it to everyone. The movie is paced very well, impressively acted, strikingly scripted and very entertaining. This is not a particular bloody movie but maintains a sinister atmosphere throughout and the nightmare sequences are some of the most powerful I have seen. My rating for Rosemary's Baby'  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""All Of Them Witches""","I recently saw ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the theater (more on that later). As ""Rosemary's Baby"" (originally released in 1968; 136 min.) opens, we get to know a young wedded couple, Rosemary and Guy. They are apartment shopping, and are delighted to find a place in the Bramford building. Rosemary gets to know Terry, who lives on the same 7th floor with an elderly couple, Roman and Minnie. Then one day when Rosemary and Guy walk home, there is a commotion in front of their building. Turns out Terry threw herself out of the window to her death... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film marks the US debut of Polish director Roman Polanski, and what a debut it was. Now more than a half century since its release, and viewed as a timeless classic (it is currently rated 97% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), the movie provides a classic example where less is more (""Jaws"" would follow that very same ""less is more"" approach 7 years later, with equally superb results). I did not see the movie when it came out (I was only 8 years old at that time), but I have seen it a number of times over the years, although I cannot recall how long ago most recently-meaning, it's been very long ago. Other than the crucial scene where Rosemary sees the baby for the first time, I had very little recollection of the movie (for example: the scene where Rosemary gets the book entitled ""All of Them Witches"" felt brand new to me). My reaction to seeing it again after so many years is that this is a textbook example of outstanding storytelling, aided by a wonderful cast and made cheaply ($23 million production budget in today's dollars, truly peanuts in today's Hollywood). Mia Farrow was a mere 23 when ""Rosemary's Baby"" came out, yet she easily dominates the screen. What a shock it is when about an hour into the movie Rosemary changes her hairstyle ('Viddal Sassoon!"" she notes) completely, and not for the better, I might add. John Cassavetes (as Guy), Ruth Gordon (as Minnie) and Sydney Blackmer (as Roman) are delightful. Keep an eye out for Charles Grodin (as Dr. Hill)!I recently saw ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the theater for the very first time, of course the best way to experience any movie. It played three consecutive days at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati as part of the month-long ""Spooktober"" festival. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended just okay (10 people). I myself am very happy that I got to see this again, and in the theater. If you are interested in seeing one of the all-time classics of psychological thrillers, I'd readily suggest you do so (and in a theater if at all possible), and draw your own conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mysterious and creepy movie-deserves the title of a horror classic.,"I just watched this for the first time and I'm still juggling my full thoughts on this movie. I absolutely loved it, but the last half hour was juggling all these events with Rosemary that as she tries to figure it out, so did I have to.The movie's plot may be familiar to you. A woman gets pregnant, and she discovers that it is the spawn of Satan.But it goes deeper into that. I noticed something when the movie ended. Jesus is the son of God, and His mother was Mary. This baby is the son of Satan, and his mother is named RoseMARY. I wondered if that was done on purpose, and I found on IMDB's trivia page that it indeed was!I mentioned that I am still juggling my full thoughts on this movie. There are many plot elements in this surrounding the finale that needs to be dwelled on. I knew way before it ended that this would require a 2nd viewing. Usually that would make me want to not even bother, but I definitely will see this again. I borrowed the DVD from a friend but I will be buying my own copy! But as I dwell on it more, and I look at analysis videos on You Tube, Rosemary's Baby clearly has more in-depth meaning than what meets the eye.There could be more things about the thought-provoking aspect, but instead, I will say that this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. If you are a horror fan, or a fan of classic movies in general, than Rosemary's Baby is a definite must see.Note: There are a few scary moments, such as a rape scene and the finale, but most of the horror is psychological than jump-scare, and that is the best kind of horror!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Evil Triumphs over Good,"I never saw Rosemary's Baby when it first came out in 1968, but I heard a lot about it. So, 56 years later, I finally thought I would check it out. What a disappointment! Since it's so obvious what is going to happen in the film, there is no excitement, no surprise, nothing scary. The only feeling I come away with is that it's really sick. As I said, ""evil triumphs over good"". And what does that do for the audience? Shakespeare had a lot of evil in his plays, but it was seen for what it was, and the audience is better for it. Here, are we supposed to be happy with this totally expected conclusion? Given that, by now, we know that Roman Polanski has ""problems"", why on earth would anyone consider this a ""great film""? The characters are uninteresting, the plot is uninteresting. It's hard to believe that Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for her performance in this film. Her acting is fine, but the character is two-dimensional, superficial, no depth-an annoying neighbor. And that's the way she came across: annoying. She should have received the Oscar for Harold and Maude.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby,"Rosemary and Guy, a newly married couple, moved into an apartment in a building with a very bad reputation. However, everything was wonderful. They wanted to have a baby and their neighbors were really kind and friendly but perhaps too much.Roman Polanski, author of masterpieces such as Chinatown, is one of the most controversial directors. He portrays an atmosphere of suspense and gives some clues as to the film's dark edges. Nevertheless, there are no sinister looking locations or creepy characters.Mia Farrow performs brilliantly as Rosemary. She is an innocent young woman who only wants to please her husband and have a baby. However, everything changes when she gets pregnant. Guy becomes distant when he succeeds in TV and her neighbors become overly caring. She grows suspicious of them because she realizes that she is strictly controlled.This is a masterpiece of horror. Everyday situations have an undercurrent of evil. These skilfully hid details haunt the viewer. An odd closet, a suicide, her neighbors' extreme interest As the date of birth gets closer, the film grows increasingly claustrophobic. The development of the plot gets interrupted abruptly in the last scenes, when the intrigue is revealed. The ending is spine-chilling but predictable due to the innocent and caring Rosemary's nature.I have seen this film many times but I always have the same terrifying feeling; the anti-Christ is ascending to power surrounded by an atmosphere of friendship and neighborliness. I would recommend it to all horror-loving viewers who are tired of inane plots and special effects.",,Anonymous,Horror

Reviewer Violetmoreviolent (""Terrifying, A Timeless Horror Classic That Still Evokes Chills"", violetmoreviolent from Portland, Oregon, USA, 30 August 2007) has a good commentary that parallels the review below. Finally, reviewer Poseidon-3 (""Virtually flawless piece of storytelling with Farrow's best work"", Poseidon-3 from Cincinnati, OH, 16 August 2005) has good background about the casting.***""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968, Roman Polanski﻿), a chronicle of the arrival of Satan's spawn conjured up by a witches coven﻿, is sublime. Polanski's film is an elite supernatural experience. With only two major scenes of genuine horror, most of the tension is building around moments, if removed from context, might otherwise seem banal. This is possibly why ""Rosemary's Baby"" has so much public appeal: It teases us by delaying the switch from the conventional to the surreal. Also, the central betrayal on display smacks harder because we are living with these characters.Rosemary and her struggling actor husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavettes), move into a centrally-located, New York City﻿ apartment. (The building is the Dakota, where John Lennon﻿ later lived and was assassinated.) Guy's difficulty in getting his career established is postponing their intention to raise a family. While doing laundry, Rosemary makes friends with a recovering drug addict who also lives there thanks to the generosity of the Castevets, an elderly couple. The untimely demise of this laundry friend leads to Rosemary and Guy forming a relationship with Minnie and Roman Castevet. Rosemary finds the eccentric pair intrusive, particularly Minnie (who among other transgressions is always handing her mysterious concoctions to drink). Although he is initially reluctant to meet him, Guy immediately takes an interest with the worldly Roman (Sidney Blackmer). As Guy and Roman become close buddies the chief obstacle in Guy's acting career is suddenly removed. Tasting success, Guy and Rosemary decide the evening she is most fertile that it is time to create their baby. Minnie interrupts (yet again) by providing the couple a chocolate mousse. Rosemary doesn't like hers and shortly afterwards passes out. She then has a very odd nightmare where she is being raped by a demon while her husband and her neighbors watch. She wakes up, and imagines she has uncovered a Satanic conspiracy which involves everyone around her.The dream sequence is incredible, one of cinema's best. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is great visually. Polanski superb color choices throughout. He blocks actors superbly. While never appearing staged, his mise en scène is very detailed. The result is uniquely watchable, and can only fully be appreciated in a movie house.The cast, led by Mia Farrow as Rosemary, is excellent. Farrow deserved (but did not receive) Oscar recognition as the resilient young wife with a penchant for noticing small details. Farrow handles the task of conveying Rosemary's encroaching madness exceptionally well. She accomplishes this performance despite her real-life husband, Frank Sinatra, serving her with divorce papers which were delivered by a big-shot lawyer with the cast and crew observing. (Polanski offered her a day off to compose herself but Farrow gamely refused. The party scene where a crying Rosemary is on the kitchen floor being consoled by her friends was apparently filmed shortly after she was humiliated by Sinatra.) Another standout cast member is Ruth Gordon (who won an Oscar) as the scene-stealing Minnie Castevet. Minnie simply won't say no; she is the epitome of annoying friend who Rosemary knows she will never be able to get rid of. Sidney Blackmer as Roman is a very convincing Satanist. Ralph Bellamy is also effective as Dr. Sapirstein, a charismatic and manipulative physician who does not actually relieve Rosemary from the unusual, recurring pain of her pregnancy. Reviews are a bit mixed on John Cassavetes as Guy, with some complaining that he appears about 15 years older than his character. However, Cassavetes is a convincing betrayer. By the way, when Farrow phones the actor who had the role that suddenly fell in Guy's lap, she recognized but couldn't fully place the voice (Tony Curtis). Polanski kept the surprise from Farrow to bring out more confusion in her voice.Cinephiles should wear a good luck pendant containing some musty (but charming) Tannis Root and head over to revival theater showing this to observe this exquisite horror classic unfold on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic in the true sense of the word.,"I have never been frightened by gore but can be made to jump by something as simple as a door banging (The Others and The Bone Collector for example). The mind can conjure up images which are far more frightening that anything ever seen on film and if the mind is nudged along a certain path and given suggestions then it is more than capable in filling in the gaps and creating dark and scary landscapes to get lost in.This film slowly peals away layers of normality so that it is all too easy to accept what is portrayed (or rather for most of the time hinted at) and as the layers are pealed away so more and more suspense is loaded upon the viewer.It is an extremely well crafted film (in every area: the script, the direction, the cinema photography, the acting and the music score) and personally one of my favourites and in my opinion certainly one of the best of its kind. It shows that sometime more (a lot more) can be achieved by leaving things out rather than putting them in and those directors who carry on insisting to load their films with tomatoes ketchup would do well to sit down and really study this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lingering Horror,"While this horror film isn't one that I think modern audiences would find particularly terrifying, as psychological horror piece, it still works wonders. This is the kind of film that might not scare you as much as films like ""Hereditary"", but its one that you'll have a hard time forgetting. Even as I lay down to sleep last night, my mind still running over the horrors I'd just revisited... What did Roman say to Guy to convince him to join in the ceremony? How could Guy participate in such a thing? And most importantly, after Roman revealed that Rosemary's baby was the antichrist, did Rosemary stay and raise the baby, that is to say, does she raise the antichrist? After all, she his mother... Those lingering questions stay with me longer than a modern splatter film ever will.

Hail Rosemary,"You can see what attracted Polanski to this script. It recalls his earlier Repulsion - the apartment which becomes a prison, the gradual disintegration of the young woman who inhabits it, even the increasingly unpalatable contents of the fridge. In formal terms, Rosemary's Baby is a gleefully blasphemous parody of the Life of the Virgin (whose name, of course, is entangled in Rosemary's own) - right down to a travestied Adoration of the Magi in the devastating closing scene, in which one of the wise men from the East appears as a Japanese tourist with a Pentax. But this blackest of comedies everywhere bears the imprint of Polanski's nightmarish fugitive childhood in the Poland of the Holocaust. Betrayal awaits at every turn; prying neighbours mean only harm; the uncomprehending and incomprehensible normality of the outside world seems the cruellest taunt. The evocation of evil is all the more chilling for its hilarious banality - the coven of old dears next door are as devoted to knitting and soft furnishings as to the Prince of Darkness. And at the film's heart, beyond the mockery, is Mia Farrow's harrowing transformation from Mary Quant mannequin to a gaunt and suffering spectre from the concentration camps, shorn and hollow-eyed - as if the film were haunted by the memory of the director's own mother, murdered at Auschwitz. Polanski coaxes a performance of aching vulnerability from Farrow as the not-so-bright child bride impregnated by a distinctly unholy ghost in hubby's Faustian pact - as pure in her simple, dogged saintliness as Bresson's Joan of Arc.Incidentally, the most telling shot in the film - Minnie Castevets glimpsed through the bedroom doorway as she phones Bad Obstetrician, our view disconcertingly half-obstructed by the door-jamb in the foreground - is one that Polanski used again, and to the same troubling effect, some 20 years later in the opening scene of Frantic.",,Anonymous,Horror
Well some people say,"that this is not a real horror film, because it has nothing in it that makes a real horror film, a real horror film. No gore, no slashing, no blood, no scare tactics. Then again I have to say, this is just graphic BS that doesn't really help develop and carry the story. That's why most horror films of such nature are naive and barely watchable.There are only a few real horror stories out there. Now horror takes place at the same location that sex takes place: in your head. The question is what do you need to get stimulated? To get the ball rolling? The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby are by far the best horror films ever made. They stimulate you on the intellectual part of the spectrum and create an unmatchable horror experience within you, there where it hurts the most. Not the outside, the flesh and gore part, but the psyche, that part that never rests. The part that haunts you at night when you're all by yourself, all alone. Rosemary's Baby terrifies you long after you've watched the film. And it'll come back to haunt you again and in reality it will never disappear.As opposed to gore stuff, which you forget within the next few days after watching such a film. Visual effects are very weak compared to psychological effects. In my opinion every film company should have a psycho-FX department, because that's where the story really lives, the horror, the nightmare, the possibility of such a horrible thing actually being real.Save your pigs blood and use your imagination, just like when you think of some one else while you're having sex with your girlfriend. Isn't that the best? That same place is where the true horror takes place. And this film totally hit the bullseye!(To finish the comparison: gory, graphical films are like masturbation. This one is like having sex -just because on this board I can't use the graphical term for it -. You decide whether you do it yourself or whether you do some one else...)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Able to Be Truly Reviewed for Its First Year...,"This movie is so good, so believable, and so natural that Polanski was actually BLAMED for by the tabloids my mother read religiously (sorry) for the Manson murders!! ""Well, what can you expect after making that movie? He glorified Satan and said God was dead."". This ignores the fact that he - Polanski - merely made use of an early 60s TIME magazine cover article that in fact read ""IS GOD DEAD"" about declining American church attendance. And before Manson, America blamed Polanski for Mia Darrow's new Auschwitz hairdo, which was really just a hip European female cut. So Rosemary's Baby couldn't buy an impartial review except in that too-brief span anchored between THE HAIRCUT and THE MURDERS. And this doesn't even mention Polanski and the Holocaust and the fact that he really wanted Tuesday Weld in the lead because Rosemary-in-the-novel was described as a healthy milk-fed all-American blonde beauty.
Well, now let's hope the dust has settled enough to call this movie what it is: one of the best horror movies of the 20th century, a regular Val Lewton
A-list big budget movie, if Lewton had ever been given A-list actors and writers and time AND an A-list budget. Of course, A-list money, talent, and time wouldn't have meant squat without Roman Polanski at the helm. Private life aside,he will always be one of the top-five directors in history. After all, he re-invented and improved film noir. Who among us can claim the reclamation of TWO genres, much less

Dated But Disturbing,"34 years after the fact, ROSEMARY'S BABY is still a disturbing masterpiece of the demonic. But sadly, time has not been kind to this film. Throughout most of it's running time it all looks so 60's: the clothing, the hair, and most noticably, the music. In fact, a scene near the end that should be edge-of-your-seat terrifying ends up becoming merely nerve-wracking due to the distracting music.The plot, however, remains razor sharp. As Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy move into a new upscale New York City apartment, strange things begin happening all around them, things that may in some sinister way be related to Rosemary's budding new pregnancy. Equally perturbing, but not as obviously demonic are Rosemary's new neighbors, a nosy and intrusive elderly couple who seem determined to interfere with her personal business.The movie moves at a very slow pace, (in fact, for the first hour and a half it's difficult to accurately describe this as a true horror film) but everything in this movie has a purpose. Scenes that seem to have no relevence come full circle by the end. Despite it's plodding storyline, ROSEMARY'S BABY almost demands a repeated viewing.All of this builds up to the terrifying climax that is undoubtably one of the most disturbing and horrifying in cinematic history. But, in another way, this movie is a portrait of a simpler time. When it was released in 1968, ROSEMARY'S BABY was a shocking and contraversial movie like nothing that had been seen before. Over the decades, much of the shock has worn off. And maybe what's more frightening is that the notion of a ritualistic Satanic cult is no longer packs the shock value it once did.(***/****)",,Anonymous,Horror
rosemary's baby,"The song at the beginning of the movie evidences that something mysterious will happen, but not frightening. Therefore, I do not agree with the statement that ıt is a horror movie. And also I found the acting a bit lacking for such a scenario. Even though the plot includes many emotions and thoughts, some parts, requiring a bit greater acting, is a kind of failure.No matter how many faults the movie has, the fiction is still one of the best. If you do not have any information about the film, you can expect a movie depicting a happy family with their baby. And when I started to watch it, I also expected something more normal. But during the movie, the clues help you to figure out what will happen. The house, the old couple, being blind of Guy's colleague, the death of old couples daughter, their friend's (Hutch) death, and then some troubles even a pregnancy may not include These are the clues that help us to find out what will happen.A statement like ""even though it was made in 1968,... "" is only an excuse.It is because humankind is always the same humankind. All the people have been sharing the same feelings for ages. So the movie is very successful in portraying anxiety, suspect, duplicity, mercy, and many more. You can be mixed up with your ideas, for example, you can think Rosemary is really getting mad, and she is just making up absurd stories, or you can really be aware of everything and whisper ""Rosemary! Hutch is right."" or ""Poor Hutch, he couldn't tell everything, if so happened, Rosemary would be free now."" Yes, the movie urges us to think like that. As I said before, the movie is very successful in depicting, so we can even find ourselves thinking and justifying Rosemary's behavior right. Or we may find ourselves saying that even it is for an unbelievable creature, it is still maternal instinct.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What is a horror film?,"It's really ironic that ""Rosemary's Baby"" is so often cited as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Because, when you watch it, it doesn't really share much with what many consider horror films. There is not one menacing villain versus several main characters, of which those with faults succumb to grisly deaths, while those with virtues survive to the end. In fact, there is hardly any violence, or even scenes of immediate tension, such as those when a victim hides out in some dark area, isolated from the rest of humanity, with no weapon, while a violent, supernatural murderer haunts (usually her) the victim. The horror in this type of horror film is of course short-lived and short-lasting. Thus, a modern horror film generally comprises several such scenes where the tension is permitted to artificially rise and then is released when the violence occurs. I say ""artificial"" because the formula is so known to the audience that the audience members can practically predict where the tension will rise, though they may still experience it. The tension in modern horror is formulaic and often constructed out of absurd situations.""Rosemary's Baby,"" Polanski's first American film, is different. It is the story of one, fragile individual who, at her most vulnerable (during her pregnancy), descends into psychological hell. The tension here is absolutely real, even though the premise is absurd. (The premise, by the way, is that Rosemary's husband agrees to let his wife be host to the son of Satan in exchange for a successful career). However, the realism of the general premise is absolutely unnecessary for the film to work, precisely because it is psychological.""Rosemary's Baby"" begins like a bad romance film. A couple buys an apartment, chats with the neighbors and talks of making a baby. Then, Rosemary, in a nightmarish vision gets impregnated and things start to go wrong. She has dreams though she feels they are real. Her neighbors persuade her to switch to another doctor, one who ignores her complaints about the pain she feels. She finds mysterious scratches on her arms. A friend who had something important to tell her ends up dead. She hears voices and slowly, but surely, the coincidences start to add up in her head. They form a *believable* reality - and the reason it is believable is because we follow Rosemary's logic and fears. We can't help but draw the same, terrifying conclusions.Thus, ""Rosemary's Baby"" terrifies precisely because it makes an absurdly-horrific situation believable and genuinely upsetting. A lot of factors, of course, aside from the story make this work. No doubt, Polanski's expert direction helps visually and psychologically construct a claustrophobic, alienating and alien world. John Cassevetes is great as Rosemary's husband, Guy, who's masculine innocence carries dark undertones. And Mia Farrow, or Rosemary, is the perfect victim for this little scheme - innocent, naive, steadily growing more exhausted, more paranoid, Farrow plays Rosemary perfectly. And, without Rosemary's believable psychological reaction to the events unfolding around her, the film would lose half its strength.In ""Rosemary's Baby"" Polanski explores some of the themes that would preoccupy him for the rest of his directorial career. The idea of alienation, de-humanization and schizophrenia (the ultimate psychological fracture and collapse) in the face of a gradual advent of evil is the central theme in the story. Rosemary's environment, for reasons unknown to her, becomes inimical and harmful and she is helpless in the face of it. And it happens so gradually and subtly, it's easy to forget that everything used to be peaceful in the beginning.Upon a third viewing (I believe) Polanski's direction still appears expert. However, I realized that ""Rosemary's Baby"" is simply extremely well-made pulp. It's at the top of the pulpy scale and it almost approaches art, but not quite - ""Chinatown,"" however, does. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a film about paranoia and perhaps feminism, but it doesn't come close to the existential horror of ""Chinatown.""And it isn't Polanski's most terrifying pulpy horror. I do put it above ""Repulsion"" of which I was never a fan, but ""Rosemary's Baby"" pales in comparison to a much darker, later film, ""The Tenant."" ""The Tenant"" stars Polanski himself and is a story not unlike the story of Rosemary. A man rents an apartment in Paris and things around him go very wrong - the apartment, Paris and humanity turn against him. He is a victim of circumstance, coincidence, much like Rosemary, but the ambiguity of ""The Tenant"" leaves far more terrifying implications. It leaves the viewer wondering whether the tenant is actually sane and whether what he witnesses is real or only a schizophrenic hallucination. ""Rosemary's Baby"" has similarly ambiguous elements, but I think the question of Rosemary's sanity isn't as central to the film as the change of her physical and psychological reality.But in ""The Tenant"" you never really do know. Whether the tenant is sane. Whether you're sane and what sanity is anyway. It's all stripped to terrifying darkness, in which you can't see anything. And that darkness, losing one's mind, is far more terrifying, and realistic, than giving birth to Satan's child.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"In an Era of 'Go-Boo' Horror, Polanski's Baby Endures as An Unnerving Tale!","Rosemary's Baby is an ingeniously deliberated dramatic thriller that delivers the slow-burn, taut story of a young couple that has just moved into the upper class sector of New York. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) land a spacious apartment in a building with an extensive history of ghoulish occurrences. No sooner have they been acquainted with their eccentric neighbors Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) than Rosemary gets pregnant and the couple sees an up-tick in their fortunes, both professionally and personally. Very soon, every old crone in the building starts intruding Rosemary's life, from steering her toward their chosen obstetrician to forcing down her throat a vitamin drink of their own concoction. Just a few bites of their chocolate mousse give her woozy nightmares and start a hellish tempest in her womb. She has strange dreams of participating in arcane rituals. Soon a horrifying sexual fever dream renders her incapacitated by fear and paranoia. She begins to suspect that her neighbors have nefarious goals and are planning to harm her baby and gets curious why her husband is allowing them to do so.The apartment takes on an entire life of its own that hides its own pulse and underbelly but is completely free of exposure from the outside world. All the while once Rosemary catches on to her neighbors' ploy and decides to flee for her life, there's the sense of claustrophobia as she discovers everything she assumed she knew in her life has been a facade right from the word go. Rosemary's Baby is inundated with Polanski's trademark style and preoccupations. It draws viewers gradually into considering the possibility that the movie's series of strange coincidences and accumulating sense of dread are only subjective representations of Rosemary's unraveling mental state. And Polanski's ability to prime the audience into questioning Rosemary's suspicions gives it an unnerving quality. Polanski (who also wrote the screenplay) is more interested in creating a crawling sense of discomfort by making everything seem plausible. He expertly winds up the paranoia with spooky atmospherics and morbid humor.Cassavetes is deliciously smarmy as struggling actor Guy who will do whatever it takes to become a famous. Gordon plays the garrulous, nosy menace Minnie in her inimitable style. But the real star here is 23-year-old Mia Farrow playing the mousy title character, who uses her timorous space-child vulnerability remarkably to underscore her terror and solitude.Even after all these years, the movie is still a terrifying thriller that is held up by its incredible ensemble cast, and clever premise. In this era of go-boo and CGI suffused horror movies, Rosemary's Baby continues to be celebrated as a cautionary tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Remains at the high standard Polanski intended.,"Rosemary's Baby, unlike the vast majority of horror films, remains decades after its release as terrifying and unnerving as it must have been when it was first shown to audiences. This is due mainly to writer/director Roman Polanski and the universally believable and creepy performances of the cast. Having never read the book, what becomes apparent almost immediately is the overwhelming sense of dread hanging over these characters, despite the fact that the story starts out so innocently.Being Polanski's first Hollywood film, it remains astonishing how in control and consistent his direction of this film is. Never straining for cheap thrills or exploitative emotions, Polanski shows here why he is to be considered among the best of directors. Each shot sets up what will happen next and the screenplay does not create a situation in which he characters are acted upon by the impersonal force of the plot. Rather, it is the characters who inject the plot with occurrences, making the end result that much more believable and unsettling.As for the performances, Mia Farrow may never have found as iconic a role as she did with Rosemary Woodhouse the sweet, innocent, somewhat naive but very observant and intelligent young housewife who finds herself caught up in situations beyond her control. We empathize with her because her motivations are pure and she is as likable as a screen character can be. This is offset by the warmly creepy presence of the Castevets, played brilliantly by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. Even John Cassavetes, better known today as America's first independent filmmaker, gives a quietly disturbing performance as the loving husband who turns out to be something we could not imagine.Over forty years after its release, Rosemary's Baby continues to send chills up the spine and remains a watershed in horror film history. It needs no special effects or ugly creatures to inspire dread and fear. It does this the old-fashioned way: acting and direction.",,Anonymous,Horror

One of the most appalling things is Polanski's realistic understanding of motherhood that produces the shocking final turn in Rosemary's trial.

A happy couple moves into an apartment and the room which they get belonged to that of a woman who died there of old age. They get acquainted with their neighbors and since then things start to get murky.I am watching this in 2016 and I was scared of watching this movie given the rating it holds. I am used to the horror movies that are made nowadays which hold a maximum rating of 6.5 and not more than that. I was also afraid that I will not like the movie and considering the fact that I am a movie lover, it would be really sad to not like it because it is a classic. The meaning of classic is that it is not tainted by time. It just becomes better.I haven't seen the actors so I know little of them. They were fantastic. The movie was centered on Rosemary, so it was important that the audience feels sad for the condition of Rosemary and the actress makes us feel for her. Guy is conflicted about what he is doing and he shows it in every decision he takes. He is just one bad moment from bursting out. Other side-roles are average, a bit stereo-typed, especially the neighbors.The story is pretty straight forward and the best thing is that the reveal is slow. We are confused that what is real and what is not. The dream-sequences really make you go dizzy. It is a slow burner but the pace is worth it. You are almost forced to rush to the end but then something pulls you back to stay alongside Rosemary till the end. I enjoyed it immensely. I think horror movies should be made like this instead of investing in jump scares and gore.

But, no positive points aside from that.Maybe it is just that I am not a fan of old(er) movies...Though, I do know to appreciate a good one when I see, no matter when it was filmed ( I believe).This one is not really interesting ( though it is not completely boring). For the first 45 minutes or more, nothing happens. Other hour and a half, things are rather ... hmmm ... silly!?Don't know... I would definitely not recommend this movie to others. Four from me.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Book was just as boring,"First off I have to say that when I read the book about 6 years ago I was looking forward to seeing the movie to see if it would be any better.  Well, I was wrong.  I don't understand all of the praise this movie has received. I am not one of those into schlock horror where it has to be gory to be scary.  I have seen many movies that are more suspenseful than this, such as the remake of House on Haunted Hill, Frighteners, The Exorcist, The Haunting, and I could keep going.  I like suspense, I am a fan of the 1940's ghost and haunted house movies which hold more suspense than this movie.Yes, I read the book so I knew everything that was going to happen, in fact the movie did not deviate from the book one iota. The screen writing had nothing to do with Roman Polanski, and everything to do with Ira levin's book.  The movie was so slow that I was bored to tears.  Yes, the cinematography was gorgeous, the apartment building was beautiful, and the elderly neighboor couple had an underlying sinister quality to the seeming ""dotty"" exterior.  But, that does not make a movie.Because the movie was trying to be ""normal"" the supposed suspense was not there.  At no time in the movie, except for the dream sequences and the very end was there any suspension of disbelief.  The Main character did not progress into the unreal till the climax and the climax was so fast in the resolution that there was no satisfaction.  The slowness of the movie so put me off that I was cooking dinner at the same time and knew exactly what was going on without even looking up at the television.  I also thought that the ""rape"" scene was a little creepy, but at no time did Mia Farrow look horrified.  I have had a rape dream and even in the dream I was fighting and kicking and trying to get free, I can't believe that someone would be so out of their mind that there would be no fighting back, even if it is verbal protestations, which there were none. I don't understand the extreme praise of this movie, it is slow, boring and goes nowhere till the last 25-30 minutes.I also did not like the movie for a more personal reason.  I am a practicing Witch, and anybody who is a practicing Witch will tell you that Satan is a Christian Icon, not a witchcraft Icon.  I felt like Mr. Levin and Mr. Polanski read the Malleus Malefictarum a little too much and believed that what is contained was how Witches really were.  The pagan community has been trying to live down the stereotypes of Witches and Pagans that this movie and others has perpetuated.  No witches and pagans do not worship Satan, nor pray to him, or acknowledge him in any way, shape or form.  I know this is deviating a little from the main subject, but if the movie had been about say, blacks or hispanics, or any one of another race, or color, there would be uproar, especially in the late 60's, but no, let's write a book, and make a movie about Satan worshipping Witches, because you know, they don't matter.  Well you know what folks, we do matter, and we are starting more and more to stand-up for ourselves, and the Christian right-wing be damned. (Sorry for the little tirade there, but it just burns my A** everytime).",,Anonymous,Horror
Watch out from them Witches,Roman Polanski has created a masterpiece of an occult horror genre. Mia Farrow gives an amazing performance throughout her nine months towards birth. Slowly but surly we watch Rosemary get lost in the consistent occurrence of unfortunate events that are consuming her life. Although it seems like she if getting more sick as he pregnancy progresses she is encouraged by her gynecologist recommended to her by her very nosy and suspicious neighbors Roman and Minnie that she is is fine and prescribes her an all natural drink made daily by her neighbor Minnie. When she protests to her Husband that she will no longer see her Doctor or stay in contact with their neighbors he is quick to take their side on the matter. Eventually everyone has become a suspect in the case of Rosemary's baby.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best aspect of Polanski's film is that it is plausible enough to be taken seriously.,"Lured to America to direct the screen version of Rosemary's Baby, a novel by Ira Levin, Roman Polanski took the opportunity to launch himself as a star director in Hollywood. Famous in Europe for his thrillers such as Knife in the Water (1962), Repulsion (1965), and Cul-de-sac (1966), Polanski's work in Rosemary's Baby is hailed by critics as pitch-perfect. The film is also consistently mentioned as ""one of the scariest horror films of all-time"" and ""a horror classic"" by film magazines and polls.Now, I am not quite favorable with these lavish praises on a film I would classify as a psychological drama rather than horror (in the purest sense of the word). But really, what is horror? What makes a film ""horrific""? Is it scares that make you jump? Or is it the dreadful atmosphere of suspense? Or is it a conceptual idea that chills you? Are these definitions so subjective that it is only right to discount them? Or are they distinct parts that describe an increasingly vague genre?Rosemary's Baby tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) who lives with her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), in a newly bought apartment flat. Guy is a struggling television actor who, to the delight of Rosemary, finally wants a baby. They have an old couple for neighbors who are caring and generous, but their actions become more suspicious over time. Soon, a pregnant Rosemary starts to hallucinate, feels pain in her abdomen, and begins to suspect a cultish plot against her baby, or does she not?The ""horror"" comes from elements of Satanism and witchcraft. In a dream sequence halfway into the film, Polanski employs surrealistic images of what I would describe as the ritual raping of the protagonist by the Devil. In the final act, which I will not reveal in its entirety, Satan is hailed. However, it is important to note that Polanski's film is not a ""glorification of evil"", but an inquiry into a person's psychological well-being and self-awareness.Polanski's fine direction allows the film to grow in psychological creepiness, and he does a steady balancing act attempting to suggest supernaturalism while retaining a strong sense of reality. Perhaps the best aspect of Rosemary's Baby, apart from the very faithful adaptation of its source material, is that the film is plausible enough to be taken seriously.The all-round excellent acting by the cast plays a large part in creating believable characters. Farrow, especially, gives us a character whose fears we can relate to. We are with her till the very end, to that famous and ambiguous last scene of her rocking the cradle. What lies inside the cradle is clearly the stuff of nightmares, but Polanski refuses to give us the money shot – the devil baby – which makes it all the more ""scarier"" by leaving it to our imagination.Generally, Rosemary's Baby is a decent film. But moments of cinematic brilliance that we have come to associate with a skillful director like Polanski are few. I find something lacking overall, of which I can't quite pinpoint. Perhaps it didn't live up to my expectations of a ""horror masterpiece"". Or maybe the feeling of satisfaction was replaced by a sense of queasiness I felt towards its ambiguous ending.In a nutshell, Rosemary's Baby is good but not great. For some reason, it didn't ""haunt"" me as much as it did for many others.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Pinnacle Of Psychological Horror,"Being a humongous fan of Chinatown, one of my all-time favorites, I had contrived myself with massive expectations for Rosemary's Baby-which I have been anticipating for many many months-and I'm completely appalled that this film somehow, effortlessly exceeded them. The biggest compliment I can give this movie is that the characters provided in the story don't feel like actors/actresses portraying a part, they feel like real people attending their everyday lives. I felt like I was baselessly peeping into the lives of real people experiencing real traumatic events, and that's saying a lot since some seriously berserk stuff goes down in this film. Rosemary's Baby is doubtlessly one of the most persuasive, and unsettling dramatic thrillers I have ever gutted. It's parallels to difficult and more burdensome themes that other films wouldn't dare explore, are boldly risky yet decidedly respectable. Rosemary's Baby is the upholding standard (or literal definition) of flawless ""psychological horror."" Despite my considerably negative feelings towards Polanski as a person, as a filmmaker, I can give him top-credit for his masterful direction and perfect writing that can simply not be compared with against any other household name during the era in which Rosemary's Baby was released (AKA, the 60s). (Verdict: A+)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poorness at its best,"This is not a horror movie, it's a psychological thriller attempting to explain the effects of a single person inside a scary, abusive and controlling system.I found this movie very disappointing, it's so poor in story and acting that many people had to create their own theories and alternative versions of what went on.It doesn't has any layers or hidden messages, everything there is to be known is shown in the movie, there's not even a chance for reflection, the audience is given an irrefutable end.The only interesting thing happening with this movie is how it became a classic and only within a very specific group of people, possibly due to the hype created by those easily impressed with predictability.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

whose baby?,"I watched Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and I think it is one of the best horror films I have ever watched. It has well organized subject that may attract anyone else watched this movie. When we look at 1960s'movies, we should put this movie apart from the others. As Rosemary's Baby's images and musics are perfect.While watching the movie;I ,as a female,put myself in Rosemary's shoes. I understood her very well,because being a mother only special to women.When we think about Rosemary's husband named Guy,he sold his upcoming child for his career. He did not challenge for his wife and baby. The point that we should understand here is not to trust even your wife or husband. Guy preferred to believe in people who live in his apartment instead of his wife. I want to mention another topic about the movie,Rosemary's Baby.While watching the movie,spectators like me,notice that there is not blood that generally used in horror films.Also the film does not contain violence like the other horror films.One of the most marked points in the movie is that the wicked characters of the movie are not scary face as usual.On the contrary they have kind words and a smiling face.In recent days'films have also bad characters.They can be easily realized that they are really bad.For instance; Rosemary's neighbors Minnie and Roman are seen very helpful,very kind and generous people.So they managed to affect Rosemary and especially his husband,Guy.Guy believed them easily but not Rosemary.To sum up, the film is very nice as a whole.However I expected the ending a bit different from the real.I was not shocked because the film did not finished as I supposed to.The film should shock the viewers at the ending part as they want to know whether all these things is genuine or just a Rosemary's dream. I recommend this movie to be watched by everyone. It has its'own history.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Most Pure of Evil Triumphs,"Rosemary's Baby is a film that is not meant to be a terrifying movie per se, but when it comes to a film that puts you on edge, kills you with tension, and simply steals your human attention to the point where suspense is at an all time high, there are few movies that compare.When watching this movie I was already put off during the opening credits. It lures you in with potential happiness and joy between our two leads but that is harshly and violently reversed with a simple yet effective tone shift. This movie doesn't screw around, when it decides to get dark, it embraces that darkness with absolute conviction.Is Rosemary's Baby as horrific as people say? No, it's actually more.Normally when a movie is created with so many spiritual themes and concepts being introduced it often fails to deliver with a creative and frightening end game. But when you see the ending of this movie you will suddenly be filled with a sense of dread that cannot be put into words. There are scenes that literally shock me into silence so that I can't find humor or any sign of light whatsoever. It's as if there is only evil within this movie which makes our connection to Rosemary that much more powerful. Throughout this entire movie I feel a sense of dread with the exception of maybe a few scenes in the beginning and that party scene, but even then I couldn't find myself happy, just holding in nervous laughter. With this movie, you're mood is just killed and you are punished for having any sort of hope. This makes the climax all the more effective: I thought I was prepared, but I wasn't.My only nitpicks might be that some of the scenes are kinda dated with the movie makers not having complete knowledge of cigarettes and alcohol and how these just don't appear during pregnancies, ideally, but now that I think about it this might have been intentional as another way to show how something is wrong.This is one of the most terrifying movies I have seen and an absolute must for he/she who wants to venture into the horror that is Rosemary's Baby. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""This Is No Dream! This Is Really Happening!""...","Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) move into their new apartment. As they get settled in, odd things start occurring, including an untimely death.

Of course, when Rosemary and Guy decide to have a child, their lives become... very interesting.Director Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY is a masterpiece of paranoia, building dread, and occult conspiracy. It came out at the point between old, ""chaste"" (aka: censored) Hollywood, and the newer, more experimental cinema of the late 1960's and early 70's. The underlying satire of Ira Levin's book is quite evident in Polanski's screenplay, taking on marriage, motherhood, religion, and a rapidly changing society among other things.Ms. Farrow plays Rosemary in a completely unaffected manner. She goes from being naive to suspicious, to terrified, all while attempting to protect her unborn child. In the end, in spite of the unspeakable events, she adapts to the impossible.Ruth Gordon's Minnie is amazing, a ball of pure energy! In fact everyone is great in this weird, scary gem.

An Urban Nightmare,"One of the rare standout scenarios in art: the supernatural in the big city. In the hustle and bustle of the big metropolis things that go bump at night and the shadows of the unknown are drowned away by the lights, the sounds and the sheer energy of electricity and life. But when the primal, ancient, hidden dimensions of myth and the dark side emerge in such an environment the terror can be even more horrifying and all too real.With it's vintage color and hazy, nauseous vibe ""Rosemary's Baby"" oozes with its time. Nudity, drugs, flashbacks, illusions and the occult are the themes that swirl amidst the mounting suspense with New York City as the looming backdrop. A nostalgic glimpse into late-'60s New York as the city passes in a time capsule comveying the fashion, things, and the mood and the vibe of the age. A ditzy and luminous Mia Farrow is the blonde top who's the beacon of innocence railing against age and tradition. ""The Trial"" as supernatural, the film disturbingly unsettles as it tensely conjures the rising madness that ensues when sanity is gone and one is left with oneself and infinity. Moving at times in glacial obsolescence, the film is chilling in its monotony. One of the definitive and landmark horror films - modernity and a scream in the dark.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's, as many people have said in passing in regards to the film, the un-immaculate conception of the Antichrist on an innocent married woman. But the story isn't that simple. The great director, Roman Polanski, keeps you second guessing yourself the whole time. Is it all the work of witch craft? or is Rosemary just crazy? Was her visit from the devil just a dream? or did it really happen? You're left on edge, until the very end, when it all tragically makes sense. Polanski's direction is startlingly good.

A Complex Scare,"Understanding that the horror is internalized within the story itself and expressed through the mundaneness of the actors' expressions, I was not successfully horrified, yet I was successfully enthralled. I found the villainy and situations to be tense and even irksome, which is a word one doesn't often use when referring to a reaction to a film. The film's later revelations are not necessarily scary but alternately intense and almost humorous, almost like a Charlie Kaufman script.Whatever the intentions of the film, whether to be a horror film, an off-putting blend of genres and techniques, or a thriller, it has an effect above that of many of the scariest horror movies, not because it's a more consuming effect that being genuinely scared in the way that Psycho or Saw scare, but because it's an effect that is more complex, thus more complex to achieve. At first, I was put off by the scale of the film-making, which expresses its big budget, large cinematographic scope, and less of an insular or atmospheric environment one would imagine being necessary to be successfully creepy. Now I can see that it was all a part of Polanski's vision.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby,"At first sight movie seems very ordinary and conventional, but after watching for a while, it is easily noticed that it has a very different topic.

After researches, she realizes that her husband makes a deal with witches and he will give their baby to them. She tries to escape, but Guy and Dr. Sapirstein find her and take her home. After baby is born, they tell her that baby dies, but she does not believe them and finds her baby in Roman and Minnie's flat. She looks baby, and his eyes are very different. Witches say he is son of devil, and she sits and starts to cry. At the end of the movie, when baby starts to cry, she cannot wait for his crying and gets near to baby.

Atmosphere of dread,"Like all directors of great thrillers, Roman Polanski understands that our greatest fears rest in the unknown. In ""Rosemary's Baby"" he preys on these fears by showcasing the mind of an uneasy young pregnant woman who has just moved into a new apartment full of kooky strangers. Everything around Rosemary appears okay on the surface, but gradually little ""clues"" begin to indicate that something more sinister may actually be taking place behind closed doors. Or perhaps it isn't. The scary thing is that Rosemary doesn't really know, and perhaps she can't even trust her own mind.I have heard allusions to ""Rosemary's Baby"" for years, so I had some idea of what it was about, but I wasn't really prepared for this film. Most of the terror in this movie lies in what is not seen but only suspected. Rosemary's fears seem justified, but are they? The tension builds as we realize that Rosemary is completely alone and doomed in her struggle against something which is possibly unspeakably evil.I wonder if religious and nonreligious people view this film differently. Well, as a Christian, I could accept the premise as possible and truly revolting. Days after seeing this film, certain scenes still come to mind which make me shudder.As a movie devoid of gore but nevertheless successful in creating an atmosphere of dread, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the most elegant horror film I have ever seen and one of the very best.

chilling minimalistic horror,"***1/2Roman Polanski's classic `Rosemary's Baby' stands as one of the films that ushered in the so-called `second golden age' of Hollywood cinema.  The story centers on Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (the late Cassavetes), two rich New Yorkers who move into a flashy downtown apartment complex with a checkered reputation.  The apartment is also inhabited by two odd older neighbors (wonderfully played by Gordon and Blackmer).  How of course, may be more than they seem.What ensues is not so much horror, more like sustained psychological tension.  Polanski does not cheat us with showy effects and creatures that jump out of the wall, instead he relies on mood, innuendo, and above all the magnificent Farrow.What strikes a viewer twenty-five years after the films release is the fact that a film like this would have little chance of being made today.  It is almost like a stage play, as the action unfolds almost exclusively in the cavernous apartment of Rosemary.  The mastery of Polanski is that he uses this too his advantage.  The viewer himself feels the same claustrophobia Rosemary experiences.  We are trapped with her and this raises questions towards both hers and our sanity.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Masterwork of suspense and paranoia,"Pregnancy and eventually the bond between mother and child is a powerful thing. Hormones, attachment, sometimes postpartum depression -- even the mystery of what's growing inside -- Roman Polanski channels all these things into storytelling elements of suspense and paranoia in his superbly written ""Rosemary's Baby.""Played by a 22-year-old Mia Farrow, Rosemary is the young wife of a struggling actor (John Cassavetes) who moves into a new apartment house in New York next to some strange old nosy neighbors, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer). Under strange circumstances she becomes pregnant and starts to believe there might be some conspiracy surrounding her baby.""Rosemary's Baby"" is not really a horror movie. There are no frightful images, only the illusion that you might see one, which is Polanski's best trick. Its chock-full of suspense and creates the helpless feeling of not knowing what to believe half the time. The French-born and currently exiled director delivers his first big hit with this plodding script that is never too challenging but takes hold of its audience.Farrow as Rosemary is this wonderfully cheery and naive spirit who we see crumble before our eyes as her intuition and gullibility are at odds with each other. She does the first half- Rosemary quite well but shows some room for improvement in the more dramatic half of the film. Ruth Gordon is an effectively irritating scene-stealer, helping build Polanski's slow dramatic momentum by arousing our suspicions early.It's not altogether poignant other than underscoring this precious bond between mother and unborn baby, but the execution of suspense is second to very few other films of its kind.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I think the movie may have had Vincent Price in it but I am not 100% certain. There was a oval giant bird bath shaped water container outside of a house and if I am remembering right there was a body or something in there.

Classic Gem ;),"""Rosemary's Baby"" is a classic example on how to make a horror film realistic and super natural, all at the same time. It's also been a really long time since I've seen an excellent classic, and ""Rosemary's Baby"" did it for me. I started watching it at 12 in the morning and I was in shock, all the way till the end, wondering and thinking about what I just saw.Being brief, the film is about a woman and her husband who move to an apartment where the man becomes an actor but struggles with it, and the woman soon becomes pregnant. The apartment is also filled with crazy people and Rosemary's nightmare becomes a deranged reality. Even the husband starts going cuckoo.I really enjoyed this a lot. It is a classic and I don't think it needs to be remade. I love how we go through the perspective of Rosemary in her dreams and her wildest, darkest fantasies as she can not tell what's going on or what is happening around her. I also like the sense of dread throughout as that the neighbors become much more evil and more psychotic as we look at them more. Even the husband, Guy who suddenly goes crazy, day after day reminded me of ""The Shining"" when Jack Nicolson's character went ballistic. I also like the unreal aspects like when she got pregnant, witches and demons.This is a masterpiece and possibly up there with some of my other favorite horror films. It's creepy, eerie, dramatic, horrifying and sometimes dark in every way.I also thought that the actors were excellent in their roles. Each actor was very believable. Mia Farrow as Rosemary is superb in every way possible. She makes us feel sympathy and sorrow for her. It's like we are really with her, trying to fight off all of this nasty evil which is attacking her.Another thing to give thumbs up to is the amount of violence referenced or shown throughout. There is one death, but it is never shown, nor are there are anymore deaths occurring throughout. No BLOOD or GORE is reveled which is FINALLY good because it leaves us to the mystery of how and why these strange things are happening.Even my friend told me about this film last year and I rejected the film (silly me). After people kept telling me about how classic it was, I am glad that I gave it a try. I do wish I could have believed him ages ago though.I've heard Platnuim Dunes is gonna remake this and say ""they're gonna be extra careful since it's a classic"". We'll just have to wait and see. I mean I don't mind some of PD's films but ""Rosemary's Baby"" doesn't need to be touched.I'm gonna top this review down, giving Rosemary's Baby a 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Polanski's work of art,"I love horror movies.  I love this film.  Maybe you love horror movies. You will love this film.

The people you cheer for and hate will change by the end of the movie and I love it because it was so uncalled for.

Effectively unsettling,"I've always thought that horror films work best when we aren't fed all the details. Spielberg did it in 'Jaws' - we never really saw the shark until the end, but we still held our breath as we heard John Williams' chilling score when someone was in the water. We don't have to see something in order to be frightened of it. Don't get me wrong - I love a good slasher film, but they don't affect me as much as psychological horror films. In most slasher films, we get used to the killer's technique; we know when they are about to claim another victim. A film like 'Rosemary's Baby' shows us that murders aren't necessary to provoke fear from an audience. Rather, we learn that mystery is the source of fear: the things that we can't see, or don't know about.Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young couple who move into a New York apartment building, with plans to start a family. Their neighbours are Minnie and Roman Castevet, an elderly couple who are strangely fascinated by Rosemary and Guy. They are nosy and a bit stubborn, however they seem like very kind and generous people on the whole. They are not without their eccentricities; for example, Minnie gives Rosemary a 'charm necklace', which contains a mysterious herb known as 'tannis root'.After Rosemary falls pregnant, the film takes a rather ominous turn. Rosemary unusually loses some weight, experiences sharp pains in her abdomen and develops a taste for raw meat. It becomes clear that Guy and Rosemary are having some marriage problems, and we are led to believe that this is because Guy is struggling with his career as an actor. The Castevets become increasingly concerned with the progress of Rosemary's pregnancy. There is an extremely disturbing rape scene which occurs within a dream, whereby it looks like Polanski experimented with surrealism, as if he filmed a scene out of a Dali painting, and added his own sinister touches to it .Polanski does an outstanding job at creating an uneasy atmosphere for the audience. Rosemary's complexion becomes rather pale, as does the film's colour palette. Rosemary no longer wears the bright, pretty dresses she wore before her pregnancy; instead she begins to wear a lot more light blues, whites, greys and browns. One of the most effective devices in a horror film is the 'Me versus the rest' storyline. That is, when one character believes in something, but practically every other character in the film thinks that they are delusional, even though these characters are well-aware of the truth, and are all conspiring against the lone person. A common convention of this plot device is the 'false friend' - the person who you think is there to help the lone person, but is actually 'all in on the act'. Another convention of the device is the 'glimmer of hope' character - the one person who listens to the lone person, who finds some truth in what they are saying, and is of some assistance to the person. Usually, this person will meet some sort of fate throughout the film. 'Rosemary's Baby' is a 'Me versus the rest' film, however not from the beginning, but after Rosemary falls pregnant. Mia Farrow's performance is outstanding. We see a lot of films about the trials and tribulations of motherhood, but not as many about the up-and-down process of pregnancy. Rosemary becomes Polanski's plaything once she falls pregnant. Even as a male, I felt as if I WAS Rosemary, as if I was going through the same harrowing experience as she was. We witness her decline from a beautiful housewife to a paranoid and lonely house...(we begin to get the impression that she isn't married, even though she is).I didn't give this film 10/10, as I thought the ending could have been so much better. The payoff will either shock you, or be exactly as you expected, depending on how you follow the film. I just thought that such a chilling atmosphere was built up, only to be let down by an ending which had me confused over whether I should fear for Rosemary, or whether I should have one big laugh. The film ultimately preaches that a mother's love for her child is unconditional. I admire Polanski for expressing that message in such a daring way. In essence, 'Rosemary's Baby' works because every character is used to their fullest potential, and they don't look like they know they're in a movie. The film plays on our innate fear of the unknown, and doesn't rely on blood and guts or special effects, but rather on a young woman who is fearing for her own wellbeing, as well as that of her unborn child.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Timeless horror,"Roman Polanski arrived in America with 'Rosemary's Baby', a classic horror (about a woman who fears that a satanic cabal want to steal her as yet unborn child) that relies on no special effects but entirely on the mood of paranoia and suspense it manages to create. The idea of pregnancy as a time of special helplessness is skillfully exploited; the brilliance of the piece is that it avoids commitment as to whether anything supernatural is actually happening. In places, the 1960s-ness of it all makes it a bit hard to watch, but one really only notices this in the scenes that are filler; when the tension rises, the feeling is timeless. Mia Farrow does well as the eponymous ingénue, and while some of the other actors are more wooden (another fine director, John Cassavettes, plays her husband, yet his acting feels as if it belongs from the 50s not the 60s), but it doesn't really matter, so masterfully does Polanski turn the screw. It's an irony that Polanski's wife subsequently died at the hands of a cult; Polanski himself returned, much less convincingly, to Satanic themes with his lame movie of 'The Ninth Gate'.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy classic psychological thriller,"Rosemary and her newlywed husband Guy move into an apartment - but not all is well as Rosemary experiences troubling physical pain and soon realizes that she is pregnant - but with what, exactly, inside her? She soon begins to believe that her soon-to-be-child is evil - and the odd behavior of her husband and new neighbors only confirms this theory.""Rosemary's Baby"" is a classic thriller, probably the start of the creepy psychological thrillers we see today (or at least the disturbing sort). The real breakthrough was of course ""Psycho"" eight years earlier but this has a hard edge that is reminiscent of many films today - it is in no way better than ""Psycho"" but it is still very good and influential in its own way.It was Roman Polanski's first US movie and he proves here, his earliest mainstream effort, why he is continually a great director - despite what may have occurred in his private life he's a great visionary director and evokes some extremely scarring images in ""Rosemary's Baby.""

"Acclaimed, yet underrated urban horror...","If there is one talent Roman Polanski has, it is creating confusion on-screen.  ""Chinatown"" is littered with moments where you're not at all sure what is what or who is who.  ""Rosemary's Baby"", his first major American work, is a masterpiece of gothic horror primarily because of the confusion the lead character faces throughout.  Are her neighbors witches?  Could her doctor be evil?  Is her husband a part of it? Even though we pretty much know these answers ourselves, the web of intrigue created by Polanski, and Farrow's convincing performance, makes everything that happens seem all the more creepy.Based on Ira Levin's bestseller, the film no doubt exceeds the novel.  There are no ghosts, poltergeists, or possessions.  Just the overwhelming presence of evil in the Dakota apartments where Farrow, with her husband played by John Cassavettes,  live in what should be a safe-haven.  Farrow has nowhere or no one to go to in the biggest of cities.The rape scene is one of the most spellbindingly scary scenes ever done.  We never do see the creature in full view or on top of Farrow, we only see the eyes.  They say it all.  Most horror films would use a quick long shot for a scene like this.  The sequence is very much like a nightmare Farrow believes she only had.  The scenes shot in the huge entrance to the Dakotas are accidently eerie because we know this is the exact spot where John Lennon would be murdered within 12 years.One final note:  According to Roger Ebert, the voice of the blinded actor on the phone with Mia is that of Tony Curtis.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gothic Gold,This is Gothic Horror at it's best. The fact that as a viewer you never see any thing actually horrifying is what makes this such a scary film. Mia Farrow puts forth her best performance by far. Then there is of course Ruth Gordon who delivers one of the greatest performances ever by an actress on the big screen.  From her first scene right up to her last (check out how she uses  her finger to try and remove the knife mark from the floor). Rosemary has no allies on her side except the viewer and there is nothing we can do to help her.  Roman Polanski's greatest achievement.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I heard so much about it until I finally saw it...,"Have you ever heard about a movie so much that sometimes even pretended to have watched it while you haven't yet because you made up your mind to but kept waiting for the right moment. The right moment came at last and I finally watched Rosemary's Baby which to my surprise was a delightful one.I don't consider it a horror specially that I am a huge horror fan but it is definitely a good movie that has to be seen. However, it should be seen way before you have seen The Omen, It's Alive, Grace, and all the movies that came within this same line. Trust me you will be bored if you have seen all these movies and then you do Rosemary's baby unless you paid attention to the smart details inside this movie. The casting of the old neighbors is just brilliant. For me, they're the best element in this movie. The first time Rosemary and her husband are invited to the old couple apartment for dinner, I wondered how would I have reacted if I were in there shoes trying to eat that disgusting food cooked by that old lady... it surely needed lots of guts.The movie is an enjoyable experience because it's original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An exploitation film in self-denial.,"As a piece of visceral filmmaking this is a gripping film. It has a lot of scares and because of the direction a deeply unsettling atmosphere. Farrow and Gordon give two really powerful performances. I never had a chance to watch this in the theatre but I wish I could have. It is a great supernatural thriller. But alas that is all it is.The obvious comparison point here is the superior The Exorcist (1973)-which used its supernatural story to tell a parable about dealing with the problem of evil; there is a compelling *human* story of a priest losing his faith in that film. No such analog is present in Rosemary's. It is merely about a woman being forced to carry a demonic spawn. As such Rosemary's is fundamentally silly.I found the final film very frustrating on this point. There are ways of telling this story such that it is capable of having real world parallels drawn to Rosemary's plight. Abortion-which gets an offhanded namecheck for mere shock value in pre-Roe America-is the obvious example. But other things-i.e. Concern over a child being born disable etc. Etc.-are possible. But there's no greater meaning to a campy sequence punctuated by literal ""Heil Satan!"" Shouts.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Masterly,"Seen several Polanski films and this is undoubtedly his best apart from Chinatown. Nothing to complain about here, really. Amazing acting, photo, suspense, dialog, sound... A thrilling story too. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.5 / 5",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a scary movie,"Suspense and subtlety are these are this movie's main strengths for most of its runtime. It's slowly and carefully carrying a tray full of crystal glasses. Every element feels meticulously crafted, with small, subtle clues keeping the audience on top of what's going on. There are no loud screams or startling sounds. The movie continues to carefully carry this metaphorical tray until the end and then...it just drops and smashes everything onto the ground with its comically ridiculous ending.Although this film laid the groundwork for modern horror movies, it is in many ways the opposite of those movies, because it is not a horror movie. It is not even a thriller. Instead, it is a mystical psychological drama and, boy, is it a slow burn. While this restrained approach may appeal to some, many viewers expecting a more traditional suspense-driven experience may find this movie tedious. The person I was watching it with left halfway out of boredom, and I completely understand.At least, before that happened, we had a few laughs about the over-the-top acting. The dialogue writing for the main character was rather poor as well. The dialogue, especially for the main character, was rather poorly written, and Mia Farrow's delivery left much to be desired. The moment her voice started breaking into high pitch, as she was getting more neurotic, I wanted someone to strangle her a little.This movie is all atmosphere with suspense and nothing else. It is nice to see something that attempts to approach the occult material with subtlety, but it is poorly acted and very slow. And that blunt ending is absolutely dreadful.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic horror,"A classic horror movie. Those are words you don't hear often, because horror movies are generally dime-a-dozen formulaic crap. However, with Rosemary's Baby Roman Polanski crafts a slow-burning, horror-as- undercurrent, drama that defines how horror movies should be made.Polanski's script is subtle and his direction even more clever. The movie starts slowly, and very innocuously, but you can sense the gathering momentum and evil. The final scene brings everything together, and justifies the ""horror"" tag.Great performance by Mia Farrow in the lead role. John Cassavetes gives good support as Rosemary's husband. Ruth Gordon almost steals the show as the elderly, seemingly-innocent, neighbour. She well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Realistic yet paranoid,"The strength of Rosemary's Baby is in its slow, deliberate realism. At the beginning, we see the meanderings of a couple moving into a new apartment and dealing with annoying neighbours like a sitcom. It is actually much later in the film that we get any indication that it's supposed to be a horror, when the phantasmagorical dream sequences come to life like flickering shadows. These shattered vignettes reflect the scattered emotional state of Rosemary as she tries to come with the pains and how nothing is as it seems. The twist about witchcraft is handled well as the film still treats this in a subtle way without much explicitly shown. It's only at the end that the final revelation comes across as black comedy and ""narm"" with bizarre shouts of ""hail Satan!"" coming from the elderly undermining the tone of the rest of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Chilling and effective horror film, one of Polanski's best","After putting this film off for some time, mainly due to my strong dislike for any religion-related material, I finally pulled myself together and watched it. I'm glad I did. Very, very glad. From the opening credits, which feature a chilling lullaby, I was hooked. The film is effective without actually showing us anything particularly scary... which is quite an achievement. I don't believe I've seen something like this outside of a Hitchcock film. The basic idea behind this movie is great. The way everything is merely hinted at, never shown directly is incredibly effective, and the film is thoroughly chilling and disturbing. The plot is very good, very involving and interesting throughout the films running time of just over two hours. The pacing is great, in fact, this is arguably Polanski's best paced film. Then again, I haven't seen all of his films, but still... I was never bored, not for a second. The film didn't overstay its welcome. The acting was mostly great, but there are one or two performances by the supporting cast that seem... off, somehow. Nothing big, though. The characters are very well-written, interesting and credible. One thing that bothered me a little was how the only truly likable character was Rosemary... even her boyfriend was annoying, I thought. Maybe that's just me, though. I loved how the plot evolved, and really enjoyed all the little signs given throughout the film, leading up to the end... which still manages to surprise the viewer. I certainly didn't see that ending coming. I haven't read the book which this film is based upon, but from what I hear, it's a very close adaptation. Do yourself a favor, don't ask anyone what the film is about, because they might reveal too much, and just rent or borrow this and watch it. Any fan of atmospheric horror should love this film, despite of the few shortcomings it has(among them is Polanski's love for long takes, which at times get tedious and some of the dialog being somewhat... poorly written). I recommend this to any fan of Roman Polanski, atmosphere in horror flicks and/or any of the actors. Just be prepared for some seriously disturbing stuff, even if it isn't explicitly shown. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wildly Overrated but Worth a Watch,"I think the deference that is paid to Rosemary's Baby is utterly absurd. Rosemary is a ridiculously childish and submissive woman, seemingly still maybe 16 or so when in reality she's a young wife in her 20s with a baby on the way. She's tricked and misled so many times that I find it hard to swallow ...and I know all women weren't like this in the 1960s. The entire plot absolutely hinges on Rosemary acting like a sitting duck.Still, there are glorious scenes including the suicide of the young prostitute taken in by the elderly neighbors towards the beginning of the movie, and the general atmosphere was highly influential on later films that I strongly prefer like The Sentinel.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There are horror elements but they are too weak, too few, The movie is submerged with too much realism for a witchcraft and horror standard, do not forget that this is a movie about witchcraft and the supernatural elements are too weak, the movie sounds more like a drama, too often.

"""It's alive, it's moving""","Is it too soon to sing Roman Polanski's praises as a director? His 1968 feature, his first American production, Rosemary's Baby cements him at the forefront of true auteurs. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes join with their odd chemistry to expose the deterioration of a couple who moves into a Gothic style apartment in New York City with an unsavory history. Utilizing exceptional spatial relationships, Polanski weaves a near-perfect psychological horror movie for the ages.Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) are a young couple ready to make a home and start a family. Once they view a Gothic style apartment in Manhatten, they fall in love with the property and move in, in spite of the warnings against moving in from their current landlord who warns them of the scary history of the building's past. Immediately after moving in, an older nosy couple that lives in the building, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) and (Ruth Gordon) befriend the young couple. At first, the couple laughs off their quirky behavior until Guy becomes fascinated by Roman's stories and begins spending a great deal of time at their apartment. Rosemary remains skeptical about their idiosyncrasies but becomes distracted when she finally becomes pregnant after a strange dream she has. The further along in her pregnancy Rosemary gets, the more strained and distant her relationship with her husband becomes. When Roman and Minnie take an obsessive interest in her pregnancy and child, Rosemary becomes convinced that the couple and their friends have demonic interests in her baby.The directing prowess of Roman Polanski in this faithful adaptation of the book by Ira Levin of the same name is one that will impact the audience and stay with you long after the film concludes. He absolutely nails the overwhelmingly claustrophobic mood of the film by confining most of the film to being shot in the young couple's apartment. Confining the shots to just the couple's apartment was even more pronounced as Polanski placed the actors in such close proximity to each other that they bumped into each other as they were roaming around the new home. He also compiled among the film several well-executed long shots further exposing the deliberate movements and the close proximity of the actors. I just can't get over how well Polanski filmed Rosemary's Baby, I thought I had seen it all when I saw his Chinatown, but Rosemary's Baby was far superior, and to think it was his first American film. Some directors just have ""it"".The whole time Rosemary was preparing to be a mother, she was being manipulated by other people. She was doing her absolute best to protect her child, even though it meant putting herself at risk. Rosemary had wanted to become a mother since she and Guy's marriage and was overwhelmed with happiness to finally get the chance. As her pregnancy progressed, Rosemary realized something was vastly different with her Dr., recommended to her by the Castevets. She was gravely ill throughout most of her pregnancy even though she was taking the special drink prepared daily by Minnie. Once she was finally convinced that a demonic episode was taking place with her baby as the pawn, Rosemary did her best to escape, but all her efforts were thwarted by her husband and the Castevets. At the film's conclusion, Rosemary knows what has happened to her child and must make the ultimate decision on whether to parent the child she always wanted or abandon what had become of him.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A masterpiece,"I have watched this film so many times and never get tired of it. It is a perfectly executed horror film where the best material met the best director. Polanski can suggest menace with just an open doorway and a cloud of cigar smoke. He lets the audience imagine, which is what computerised terrors never do. Mia Farrow was the epitome of vulnerable beauty. Ruth Gorden is malevolent and funny, grotesque but believable , like some awful clucking hen that feeds on human flesh. Of course Polanski was handed a brilliant idea, but he tells the story with such craftsmanship. The supernatural enfolds within an everyday domestic setting but still remains credible. Brilliant.

Nightmarish accompaniment to a decline,"A young couple, a new flat, a desire to have children, perfect happiness. Wait, one of the details isn't right. The new four walls, or rather the strange neighbours, the whole new living situation. And this torpedoes all the other positive pillars. The first negative highlight is the surreal procreation scene, to put it bluntly. From now on, everything is different and one bitter question in particular comes to the fore: what role does the other half play in the growing disaster? But the negative feeling goes beyond the burdensome mistrust in the supposed next person, deep into the psyche of the better sex. Polanski certainly doesn't believe he can fathom this, but he starts at an essential point of being a woman, the miracle of life creation. External determination, insecurity, fears, physical ordeals. True, at best these are just side notes alongside a great deal of happiness. Rosemary, however, finds herself alone in a hostile environment. The viewer is drawn into a suspenseful puzzle and confusion of circumstances. We see what we are supposed to see. Or what Rosemary sees? What is reality, what is just evidence of Rosemary's mental decline. Madness or not, we suffer along with her in this increasingly hopeless battle against everything and everyone.

Unsettling horror,"There's something really ugly about this film, and I mean it as a compliment. From the production design to costumes, the gaudy and superficial look illustrates that something isn't right just below the surface. In particular, Rosemary's nosy neighbor, Minnie. There's something really odd about her tacky dress and clown-like makeup that screams ""I'm not to be trusted."" It's a creepiness that the filmmakers weave into the rest of the production that makes this slow burn horror boil to a grand paranoid climax.

Timeless horror on so many levels,"If you have only really heard of 'Rosemary's Baby,' by its considerable reputation then you may be inclined to believe that it simply finds its horror through a tale of demonic possession. After all, its central premise is that a young couple move into an upmarket apartment block in New York, only to find that their new neighbours are more than a little bit satanic. Maybe it was just a film about devil worshipers when it was released back in the sixties. However, watching it now, there's a secondary level of 'horror' written into it – namely how women are both portrayed and treated.Mia Farrow plays the titular 'Rosemary' as she's basically pushed, pulled, ordered and generally manhandled through both her attempts to get pregnant and the subsequent pregnancy itself. If this film doesn't bring a shudder down most women's spines at how little control the central protagonist gets in her life and body then nothing the devil himself will.But, of course, speaking of Beelzebub, he does do his best to make an appearance and generally make things even worse for our helpless heroine. The devil-worshipping scenes are pretty dark and Roman Polanski's chilling direction gives the whole film a clinical and bleak feel to it.'Rosemary's Baby' is still as watchable today (and, of course, deeply horrific and disturbing) as it was all those years ago. It doesn't need gallons of fake blood or computer-generated effects to be scary. Everything here feels a little too real and is a credit to how films can be made. Don't expect a roller-coaster ride of scares and guts – it's much too 'foreboding' to succumb to anything so cheap and easy. If you're in the mood for something horrible, dark with an every-increasing sense of dread then give this one a watch before it gets remade with too many special effects and no soul (and I'm not counting the 'Astronaut's Wife' in that!).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

IDK which boomers rated this movie and gave reviews here, but if you're looking for a horror movie, and you come across something as high as 8 (very high for a horror movie), you'd think it would be phenomenal horror movie.

"""Witches... All of them witches!""","""Rosemary's Baby"" is widely considered one of the most influential and popular horror films of all time. The film has cemented itself into public consciousness. It is truly the magnum opus of 1960's horror cinema, it uses horror as a vehicle to reflect many contemporary and social concerns of the time. It deals with many themes related to women's liberation, paranoia, Catholicism, and more overtly the occult. The film was nominated for two Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Supporting Actress (Ruth Gordon). In 2014, deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965), Rosemary's Baby (1968) and The Tenant (1976) formed ""The Apartment Trilogy"" - about the horrors of living in an apartment.The incredible taut atmosphere continues to disturb audiences to this day. Krzysztof Komeda's ""Lullaby"", sung by Mia Farrow is chilling, and it adds to the foreboding atmosphere of the film. Mia Farrow's performance was outstanding, anxiety-inducing, and utterly compelling. Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow's marital breakdown during the filming helped her give the performance of her life in ""Rosemary's Baby"". In essence, ""Rosemary's Baby was a massive success, but it wasn't without its hardships, and just like ""Poltergeist"", ""The Exorcist"", and ""The Omen"" - it was purportedly cursed. The film was beset with tragedies including Krzysztof Komeda's death, the horrifying tale of the Sharon Tate murders, the John Lennon connection and other weird coincidences.Well over 50 years since its release, it remains a prevailing influence in the horror genre, it helped to establish horror through supernatural metaphor's. It is a film saturated in anxiety and paranoia, and that can still frighten audiences to this day.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Polanksi's Masterpiece? Maybe...,"'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) was master director Roman Polanski's first American film and is a thriller/horror based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. The film follows Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) as she moves into apartment 7-E in New York City with her actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes). After making friends with elderly couple Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) who also live in the building, Rosemary falls pregnant, to the delight of many. However, as Rosemary's health begins to deteriorate during pregnancy she starts to become suspicious about the actions and behaviour of those around her.Staying extremely true to Ira Levin's novel, Polanski has created a slick, smart thriller that is, at times, genuinely terrifying as we follow the tale of the beautiful and perfectly cast Mia Farrow as she strives to protect her unborn child. Ruth Gordon, gives an Oscar winning performance as the nosy Minnie, and while you become more and more concerned about the safety of Rosemary as the film progresses, there are still genuine funny moments to be had, a credit to Polanski's script and Mia Farrow's timing.Right now I am still debating whether to give it a 7 or 8, as there are certainly problems I have with it. Most notably I felt John Cassavetes was not as convincing as the other 3 main cast members, which lets down the story slightly as he is integral to the final scenes. I am however to give it the latter score, mostly because I saw this film having been given a full description of the film and its climax beforehand, which, undoubtedly lessened the impact. Overall, 'Rosemary's Baby' is a must-watch, as it shows how true terror can be created without the need of blood and gore, a feat that horror/thriller directors of today have struggled to achieve.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautifully Unnerving,"If I had to pick a horror flick that perfectly captures that disturbing feeling of paranoia, then 'Rosemary's Baby' would be a perfect example. It's the type of paranoia of which things are not really what they seem or if you're just thinking way in over your head by creating this make-believe scenario.What I love about this film is that it perfectly captures this despondent atmosphere as the story progresses with the subtle nuances of the music, but to me, I think it mostly boils down to Mia Farrow's performance of Rosemary Woodhouse. She consistently conveys that paranoid feeling and you can feel her emotions when she is dealing with surroundings that are progressively provoking her suspicions, based on her perceptions.And that is basically where the 'horror' of the movie comes from which is the mood and it takes a lot of work just to use that as the only source of causing a feeling of dread in the viewer. It perfectly falls in line with the New Hollywood genre in that it relies on subtle nuances instead of huge melodrama, surprisingly creating something that is far more effective than your average blockbuster affair. There's only some disturbing imagery, but as Rosemary grows more weary of the other characters, you can feel that same dread as well. Other than that, there are no special effects, cheap high volume scares, or fast paced horror, just outstanding performances, especially from Ruth Gordon.Rosemary's Baby is a work of art in that it shines in creating horror that is bare and minimal, yet surprisingly still being able to retain a strong, brooding atmosphere that pulls you in and never lets you go until the end of the movie. 5/5",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

pretense of reason,"Drawing upon a feminine sense of horror, the film adopted the axiomatic horror film principle: never trust intimacy. The betrayal was conducted by Rosemary's husband in pursuing personal fame, while the completion of this Faustian Pact thoroughly destroyed the intimacy displayed from the beginning of the film. This typical element of contemporary horror/detective films was remarkable under Polanski's direction hitherto, for it directly attacked the pretension of an age of innocence, in which the feminine sensitivity of truth should not only not be deserted, but trusted by themselves. A fascinating demonstration against the cult of truthfulness and the pretense of reason.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A True Thriller,"I watched this film in class for my German minor requirement, and it definitely exceeded my expectation of the intensiveness of this class. The theme of Faust is quite vague in this film.

I will recommend this film to those who are interested in thrillers but are afraid of blood or corpses. This film does not contain any, however, will make you, very afraid.

A more grounded horror film,"Rosemary's Baby was recommended to me by a friend who is fan of horror cinema. I am personally not a horror fan, but this does have Roman Polanski directing it, and I do like films like The Exorcist and The Omen. I prefer those films, but Rosemary's Baby is still pretty good, taking a more down to Earth approach, despite its more supernatural themes.Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young couple living in New York. Guy is an actor, who had some work in plays and in TV ads. They find a nice large apartment in a more historic building and move in quickly. They befriend an elderly couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). But Rosemary's old friend tells them of weirds things that happened in the building. Rosemary and Guy try for a baby. She becomes pregnant, and ends up seeing one of best doctor's in New York. But it is a difficult pregnancy, suffering a lot of pain, becoming very weak and pale and Rosemary even ends up doing strangle things like eating raw meat. Rosemary ends ups suspecting a conspiracy, hearing weird chanting and seeing people getting hurt. She does whatever she can to protect her unborn baby.Rosemary's Baby is a watershed film in the world of horror cinema. It proved that horror films could be very well done, and led to The Exorcist and The Omen being made: film following similar themes. It also shows that proper filmmakers can do horror films. Polanski takes a more subtle approach to the film, making it more as a thriller then a horror. Most of the supernatural elements can be logically explained. This is a film that makes you think and linger in your head rather then getting scared throughout it. The ending has an excellent twist ending to the film, giving Rosemary's Baby a haunting quality. Like any good horror film, there is a major fear that people could relate to. The theme out this is about what could go wrong with a pregnancy and doing everything you can to protect your child. I sure any parent could relate to that. There is also the theme of paranoid, with the feeling that the world is out to get you. There is also the use religious ideas, like Catholicism, the Occult and Witchcraft, and of a marriage which isn't that stable. Another major feature of any good horror film is compelling characters which you actually care about. You do care for Rosemary who is a nice woman who is forced into a dark world. You want her to succeed in protecting her child. You know something is wrong with the other characters in the film, and slowly see their game. They are villains you can truly dislike.There are good scenes, and excellent camera by Polanski. I like scenes in films where the camera follows the character. There are some haunting scenes where you think about the horror of it later. Polanski did not go for cheap scares.A pretty good film. 4 out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Astonishing Roman Polanski!!! One hell of a devilish horror-thriller.,"Rosemary's Baby (1968) :
Brief Review -Astonishing Roman Polanski!!! One hell of a devilish horror-thriller. I came to know about this film after watching Vishal Furia's Marathi Horror-thriller 'Lapacchapi' (2017) and its Hindi remake 'Chhorii' (2021) as i learnt that Vishal Furia's film was inspired by it. Thankfully, my doubts are cleared. Furia's Lapacchapi is not adaptation of Rosemary's Baby, it's a completely different film with the only similarity being that both the films have a soon-to-be mother in the centric role. Well, let me start by saying Roman Polanski's film is Astonishing! I don't have any other better word to describe it. It's not just horror psychological thriller but it has that astonishing climax that will leave every viewer stunned for a moment with a positive thought. But then you realise that the entire Idea was based on a negative thought and you feel like, how on earth Polanski made us love this devilish thing? The answer is simple, Motherhood. You don't need any explanation for that. Even a small child can understand that because the universal appeal of this word is beyond any measurements. A young couple trying for a baby move into an aging, ornate apartment building on Central Park West, but find themselves surrounded by peculiar neighbors. The suspense gets more intense and chilling as it moves forward and despite the long runtime of 135 minutes, the film literally glues you to you seat right after the first 30 minutes. What a cracker of a performer Mia Farrow is! How amazing she is in the role of Rosemary Woodhouse. And she wasn't even nominated at the Oscars? Phew.. John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer, Maurice Evans, Ralph Bellamy are equally great and this is not an exaggeration. Polanski's direction is Flawless. No complaints at all, just claps. In short, a Classic Psychological Horror Thriller for smart viewers. Timeless!RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite Good!,"The only thing that I'm not incredibly fond of in this film is the lack of any real excitement.

When Rosemary becomes pregnant, it is uncertain to us who's baby she's carrying is up until the very end.This really is very similar to ""The Omen"", but as we know, this is the more original as the Omen series was made long after this.I will say, though- those eyes and that conspiracy are the scariest elements in this film!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Strange things start to happen: a woman that Rosemary meets in the washroom dies in a a mysterious death, Rosemary has strange dreams and hears strange noises.

Can you call it horror?,"Personally, I may be a little too accustomed to actually creepy, checking behind and turning on the lights out of discomfort type of horror, so this was what I would call a ""calm"" type of horror movie, not my usual watch, and definitely not what I'd call the best horror movie or the scariest. Nothing jumps out at you or sends shivers down your spine, but the atmosphere created keeps this unique tension all throughout the movie. Rosemary's worries and suspicions as if pull you into the movie yourself, having you guess what's actually true and what's either a lie or Rosemary's own hallucinations. The way different special effects are used in this movie is excellent as well, you get to see what seems to be Rosemary's dreams but in a way - what's actually happening, however neither you or her can tell apart the difference.All in all I'd say this movie isn't the type you could call scary or creepy or anything of the sort, but, not trying to make it fit into the horror movie stereotypes, it's a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbingly believable,"A wonderfully disturbing story about a woman who fears she is carrying the Devil's child, it sounds a difficult task to make a convincing movie out of it, but under Polanski's direction and with an amazing performance from Mia Farrow as Rosemary, this is an absolute gem.Tales of witchcraft are as old as the hills, as are many of the witch-type characters whose heads surface during the course of the just over 2 hours running time.  The claustrophobic atmosphere and paranoia that engulf Rosemary as she realises exactly what has been going on is palpable.  This is a definite precursor to The Exorcist in terms of brooding suspense, and although there is very little visually that is horrific, I came away from Rosemary's Baby with a real feeling of sickness in my gut and feeling genuinely unnerved.Excellent 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

She's like the typical horror movie actress the characters in Scream make fun of. Clueless and helpless. Maybe they call this a classic because it's classically bad and campy.

A unique horror classic.,"This film was boring at times but the ending was so dramatic and interesting that it can never be forgotten.  The movie is filled with confusing yet eerie scenes and I would suggest the book before diving into this film.  However,  the second time I watched it,  I could understand the parallels and the curses that were placed and I fully understood what John Cassevetes did for his successful career. The last 30 minutes of the movie was exciting and suspenseful and it is something so unique that it can never be duplicated--sorry Hush.   The performance of Mia Farrow was marvelous.. She was beautiful,  innocent,  dramatic,  and it was someone that the viewers could really sympathize and excite for.  The motherly song sing by Mia herself seemed so bizarre--the innocent lullaby was turned into such a question and the fact that they placed that motherly song in between all the witches and pills was so bizarrre.  I would agree that Ruth Gordan certainly played up her part over the top but I liked Mia so much she seemed somewhat of a distraction.  Kind of like a cranky neighbor from The Simpsons that you just want to go away--you're too cookey and you bother me. This movie really presented the question of what will happen now but to make a sequel could certainly not be as good as this.  God is Dead,   All of Them Witches, curses, Satan,   and a world full of drugs and cultist and motherly scheming make this one of the most interesting horror films ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Skillful Horror,"Roman Polanski has used very skillfully methods to make a creepy horror film.

I liked especially Mia Farrow. She was great. Also the title music was fantastic!Rosemary's Baby shows how to make a good horror film, without any cool special effects. Many movies have been spoiled with too many effects so I'm glad this one is made in the 60s when it was impossible to make decent effects, at least compared to what you can do nowadays.

Lullaby,"I just saw Rosemary's Baby from beginning to end after not having seen the film from what I can recollect as more than seventeen years. When the singing started in the beginning of the film, I found it quite reminiscent. For some reason I thought someone I knew had played the track. Hmm. I realized this was one of the first movies I had retold just after seeing it. I specifically remember recounting the beginning theme song as I started the retelling and reiterating the lullaby on the retelling's ending. Upon finishing the film, I had to replay the ending to confirm the period of the recollection. Pulling from the building and bridged with the lullaby, my recollection was confirmed. As I listen to this film while the visuals are hidden under these text, Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet sounds like a low key Thurston Howell. The lullaby track was haunting, yet fascinating as it was used throughout the piece. I must say, I love Roman Polanski's soundtrack choices. Call me an old fart for liking the Ninth Gate soundtrack but there's something awesome about the orchestra in that one. At any rate, if you pop in the Konigzucker album from Stein, track two ""Camilla"" sounds so very close to the same lullaby. Compare them, it's fun. And if your lucky enough to have a copy with the featurette of the film you may love Mia's chart and Polanski's chart called ""Mia's chart"". She keeps track of who has been nice or mean to her while Polanski keeps track of her acting behaviorism. And one final bit of excellence about this poetically narrated featurette is Polanski's commentary on Concentration & Relaxation and M.O. to allow the actors to go. Ending this for now.

It is disturbing, thought provoking, and incredibly well written movie and it is a good example of horror done for the sake of story rather than a few simple scares. It has a terrific cast, and amazing story. This movie is a horror classic which tells the story of a young woman who is manipulated and subjugated by her husband and ultra-creepy neighbors until she carries Satan's baby to term. The final scene is one of the more disturbing in any film and there is not a true hero, leaving the world in doubt which is rare for a film like this. Furthermore, it was directed brilliantly for optimum suspense. Although it was made in 1968, scenes of films are very effective. For example; the moment that breaks my heart is Guy helping Rosemary to bed after the poison dessert and she falls in the hallway. It is the most dramatic and effective scene of the film for me. In addition to these, families should keep their children away this scary classic movie. Because this film deals with pregnancy and adult sexuality. The characters practice satanic rituals, make bargains with the devil, drink alcohol. If you have not watched Rosemary's Baby, you should watch it right away. This film should be watched.

One of the best horror and thrilling movie,"The movie is a masterpiece in the category of horror and thrilling movies. The film made me excited from the begging.

And the other thing is that the sound of the movie affected me deeply. So, I think one of the reasons that the movie influence audience is its awesome sound.The movie centers on Rosemary Woodhouse whose husband is a struggling actor. This young couple move into the Bramford which is mentioned that there was a disturbing history involving witchcraft and murder. In spite of this rumor, they determine to stay there.

Rosemary has wanted a children but her husband thinks that it is early for this responsibility. And he tells to Rosemary that they will make children after he is more established.

"Nightmarish, scary, and disgusting- and that's just the leading lady!","ROSEMARY'S BABY is an interesting, well shot, and occasionally scary movie dominated by the icky, talent less actress Mia Farrow. Her presence taints this movie in my mind, as it does any Woody Allen movie she appears in. After her character becomes pregnant others comment on how terrible she looks and how much weight she has lost, but she look exactly the same! If she did loose any weight she'd be about the diameter of a pipe cleaner. Was there a fashion trend in the 60s where emaciated corpses with bad haircuts were all the rage?There are good things in this movie, though. It's definitely the best collaboration between the producer of STRAIGHT JACKET and the director of CHINATOWN. The scene where Mia gets knocked up is nightmarish and beautiful, and the surreal ending is okay, if a little anti-climactic. Ruth Gordon puts in another great performance, joining her stellar roles in HAROLD AND MAUDE, EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, and ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN. The woman is hilarious, and sexier than Mia Farrow. There's also able support from John Cassavetes as the jerk husband, Ralph Bellamy (best known for the Fat Boys' magnum opus DISORDERLIES) as the doctor that gives illogical advice, Maurice Evans (Dr. Zaius), the great Elisha Cook, Jr (THE KILLING), and a pre-BEETHOVEN Charles Grodin as another, more competent doctor.

What the old witches did was pretty effed up, and it would only be fair for Rosemary to FSU and grab the baby out of the black bassinet and maybe make a run for it, sacrificing her life as well as the demon child's life and possibly jump out the window considering there was no where else to run without someone grabbing her.

This film doesn't rely on gore or shock tactics for its scares, which is partly why it's so great. It relies on pure atmosphere and a mounting sense of dread and paranoia. The other reason is that it is the subtlest horror film ever made. There are many subtleties throughout the film that as a viewer you have to pay close attention to if you want to get the true greatness of this magnificent film. This is a must-see film for fans of horror movies and fans of cinema in general. Not only a contender for best horror film, but also a contender for best film of 1968.

Creepy,"I watched Rosemary's Baby for the first time last night. I was surprised to find that it surpassed my original expectations. The film is very creepy, emphasizing psychological fears, but not violent or gory at all. Mia Farrow looks so small and frail, almost deathly and I really felt sorry for Rosemary. I liked the ending, but I still wished we could have seen Rosemary's baby. Overall, this is one of my favorite horror movies, but The Exorcist remains my favorite Devil movie. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's boring,"So boring that it genuinely infuriated me, this was one of those films I decided to sit through just to say I've watched it, as I know it's very popular. After watching it I don't see why in any way it has such high popularity, gotta be the most overrated thing I have ever watched in my life. I also decided to give this a watch as Apartment 7A is being released in a month or so, therefore I wanted to watch it before I watched that, like I said absolutely boring and dull and genuinely painful to sit through on another level...If you're gonna watch a film to do with cults than I highly suggest ""Apartment 1BR"" or ""The wicker man"" other than this utter bs. This movie genuinely wasn't for me and I don't see why there are so many positive reviews which actually makes me laugh to be honest.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby Review,"Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is an early great horror film that I particularly enjoyed. I think the difference between horror films now and in the past is that the plot of older films are generally more scary than the plot of horror films today. I think in many horror films today, the loudness and ""pop ups"" scare you more than the actual story itself. This is not the case in Rosemary's Baby. The story follows the ancient tales of sacrificing young children in return of certain promises with evil and good characters. The constant reference to Satan worshipers and the overall feel of evil give this film its greatness. A part I thought that was interesting was the lack of settings in a way. It seemed as though Rosemary never travelled far and was always in reach of her apartment. Many movies I enjoy have a variety of settings but this was different and I enjoyed it. Overall, this movie is significant to the truly horrifying plot and the way the story is told.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Outdated and boring,"Saw this when it came out. Was a hot film for all of us in high school. At the time, it was a pretty good thriller with all the religious Catholic dogma shoved down our throats from the old Christian Catholic Doctrine days. Nice to see how I remembered NYC from the 60s and 70s. The acting was good and of course a lot of great actors from our youth. Now years later it's about as thrilling as some Walt Disney film for kids .IMDB in today's world at least gives most of the information on the actors , location filming etc. Personally, reading about Farrows life reveals she's as wacked out as I always thought.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nothing about this movie was even the least bit anxiety inducing. You can forget about scary.I can see how, for the time that it was released, it would have shaken things up a bit.

attractive but not very good for me,"The film is very old for me. I watched the film at my English class thanks to my teacher. I am not used to watching old films like this.

When they learned that she had pain, she started to bring a drink to heal her. It was a strange drink. During her pregnancy, she ate raw meat. It was a disgusting scene. I could not look at this. She started to have bad dreams. Some strangers were coming towards to her in her dream. She was scaring a lot. Her old close friend warned her they could be witches.And she started to search something about them. She gave up drinking it which the neighbors brought. Their neighbors suspected that she realized that they were witches. When she had a baby, they took her baby. She realized certainly they were witches. But she could not do anything about it.

WHy do people love this movie?,I love horror movies and I had heard about this one for ages. I don't expect them to all be masterpieces of film. I had heard and read about how wonderful Polanski was as a director & so I looked forward to a chance to see this film. I eventually saw the movie it and was very disappointing. From my standpoint it lacks any tight directing. The pacing crawls without any meaningful suspense. The main character looks like she has no idea what she ought to be doing. The cinematography looks like it was done by a film student who had never seen a horror movie. At some point you are supposed to start making things look and sound frightening.Now many of the actors in that film were quite talented but they were used poorly by the director & frankly the script is lacking. The basic concept is sound but I found this rendition sorta sad.So at that point I tried to learn more about Polanski and his work. I watched more of his stuff. I was underwhelmed. In my opinion he's in the same category as Woody Allen. Overrated. Not that talented. Pervy & creepy as a person.It most probably was trying to lay down a parallel to an actual NYC cult that owned their own building and had famous members (Sullivan Institute) but with satan added in for a big scare; which never really comes. Ido think that the plot relies far to much on Christian religious indoctrination rather that trying to do things that are scary. I think that people who weren't indoctrinated as children to believe in and fear satan won't find the film scary or the plot very sensible.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Maybe I Missed Something.,"Having just watched Rosemary's Baby for the first time I figured I should write a review right now. FOr the most part I was disappointed and felt that I had missed something and had an empty feeling after finishing seeing it.For one thing the idea of witchcraft being possibly involved was actually a good idea. I just think it was poorly done. THis movie could have been a lot scarier and I thought it would be but it was not scary at all. It got disturbing towards the end to see everyone who worshipped Satin but it was not scary.A lot that goes on is going on inside of Rosemary's head. So it is a supernatural type of thing going on. So this is a supernatural horror film. A lot of people have bad things happen to them because of witchcraft but still this film just seemed to be missing something. It was not the acting, the acting was fine. Just the plot and events that happened just were not exciting and this film dragged too much.So this is a horror film that I felt was too long, not scary, and had a boring plot. I do not recommend it but a lot of other people do.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

There is a newly couple. But there are some strange situations.,"I am Cansu Ay from Çanakkale/ Turkey. There are some movies. You can't forget them. Because you like them. They are so marvellous. But there are some movies. You can't like them. Firstly, the title of this movie attracted me. I really wondered the movie. But movie was complicated and strange. I didn't understand in the beginning of the movie.There is a newly couple in the movie. Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day.The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant.But this pregnancy was not normal.Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner, and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying.She was so thin and weak. There was not ordinary actions in this situation. Then it is understood that witches prepared a plan for poor Rosemary and they deceived her husband. This movie was a different movie as always. In fact i don't like these movies .. about witches, satanists. So i didn't appreciated it. Maybe it can be ended in a different way.It can be ended with nice, happy ending. These couples would run away another country together. Maybe it can be more satisfying end.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boring,"I would put this movie with Stephen King's Misery and The Shining as one of the most boring movies ever made. Much like Misery and The Shinning it moves very slowly and does not seem to progress towards anything significant, exciting or scary. It is more so a story of Rosemary's pregnancy, which is an uneventful pregnancy. It attempts to be a conspiracy, mystery, touch of supernatural thriller but has a very Leave it to Beaver feel since it was made in 1968. The Ghost and Mr. Chicken staring Don Knotts was a better film than this. There is one sequence that could be really creepy. However since the movie was made 1968 and how the scenes are shot it feels less creepy, evil and provoking a sense of impending doom and feels more like a strange drug experience.I had this film on DVR and it was 3 hours long with commercials. I skipped the commercials and watched 2 hours and then went to bed for the night. I woke up the next day and debated if I really wanted to finish watching an decided I should and it went nowhere and ended with a feeling of having accomplished nothing.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
No Surprises Here,"Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) move into an apartment next door to an older couple rumored to be witches.

She has an intense somewhat psychotic dream except it doesn't seem like a dream at all. It was scary, erotic, and other things and the result of it was her pregnancy.Rosemary was not too bright, a little too trusting, and all too meek which made me both pity and hate her. Clearly, things aren't right with her neighbors, with her pregnancy, and even with her husband but she continues to associate with them all and even trust them all to a degree. The movie wasn't really scary as it was mysterious-like what's really going on. In the end we find out what was going on and it's not truly surprising.

And so she has a difficult pregnancy, suffering a lot of pain, becoming very weak and pale. And one day she read a book given by Hutch. And she understood there is something strange with her baby. When her husband begin to understand that he took the book from her. But she found the book and read it. Everything was clear at that time. She did everything to rescue her baby but she couldn't be successful. And baby borned. When he borned they lie to rosemary they said he was dead. But rosemary found her baby. When she saw him she was shocked but it was time to sleep for him. I think It was not a horror film but like a supernatural film. It was not scary.

Could have been done better,"It was hoped that the passage of time would have improved my opinion of this movie. However - it made it worse. Because - Mia Farrow did a lot of acting like a dazed space cadet. Now - it's appropriate for this movie - however - It also gets on my nerves too much. Perhaps - a few short scenes of spaciness would do - then - snap out of hit and hit back! The movie ""Exorcist"" does this nicely - making it more of a chess game between good & evil. At the time I first saw ""Rosemary's Baby"" - it aggravated me that all the electricity & Union wages were spent to show a spaced out girl. I could run down to work - see all the spacey people I want & get paid for it !! That could have been kept to a minimum. At least ""The Exorcist"" people snapped out of it.Also - it was VERY bothersome at the time that lies & deception seem to be useful to get things done. Regardless how true this is - just for once - I'd love to see truth & honesty gets things done. Tons of movies are made with the use of lies, dishonesty, deception, disloyalty & etc - even when I was little - it was aggravating to watch bullies & liars get their way on screen. Even with a ""Hollywood Ending"" - it would be nice to view movies with the best forces being honesty & truthful dealings. (perhaps - I'll never become a lawyer).But - with the passage of time - my view of this movie deteriorated badly - never want to see it again.

Rosemary's Baby,"Rosemary's Baby In my opinion, this movie doesn't suffice to call ""Rosemary's Baby"" a horror film; that implies something corny. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is anything but corny. It is actually creepy. The plot of course and different scenes of this movie have weak-looking Rosemary Woodhouse getting pregnant and discovering that the father is Satan; Rosemary's husband Guy is colluding with Satan's beliefs neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet so that he can get a part in a play. Everything looks normal, but as the story progresses, you begin to get the feeling that something's not right, and then you find out the horrible truth.Most notable of course are the character portrayals, and those many special moments one immediately realizes were created not to drive the story, further the potential success of the movie or the fame of anybody involved, but to plainly create atmosphere and entertain us. Rosemary's Baby is an extraordinary picture in that it conveys so much information, it illustrates so much of its motive, and makes anxious its truths long before Rosemary knows them herself, but yet somehow it can fill a viewer with constant and complete suspense. And Rosemary's predicament isn't exactly something new in the realm of storytelling; in fact it's formulaic in many ways. When you go into a film knowing it's supposed to be horrific, but are not given any strong shocks or scares for almost the first hour – that alone creates tension to me. But it is this particular fact about Rosemary's Baby that makes many question its 'horror movie' standing.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

You do however find yourself second guessing yourself about who is doing what to her though.I could cut out about half an hour at least from this one and I'm sure a good editor could trim it down further.

Horror classic,"After starring in the Peyton Place television series and making all of America believe she was as sweet, innocent, and well-rounded as Allison MacKenzie, Mia Farrow showed an entirely new side of her when she starred in the horror classic Rosemary's Baby. There's an abundance of trivia you can read up on—from how many actresses were up for the part to the infamous divorce papers served to Mia while on the set—which might be even more famous than the film itself.Well, probably not. Rosemary's Baby is incredibly famous, and not just for sullying Mia Farrow's screen innocence. She and her screen husband John Cassavetes move into an apartment and subsequently make friends with their neighbors, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. Strange things start happening to the young couple and those around them, but by the time Mia figures it out, it might be too late. . . While there's an arguably slow beginning, you can tell there's a sense of dread in the air, and once the scary parts start, you're buckled in for a non-stop horror fest until the end.If you like horror movies, you might not be very fazed by this one. But keep in mind, in 1968, Rosemary's Baby was a really big deal. For lightweights, like me, you'll be really spooked by this cult favorite. I only sat through this one because I like Mia Farrow so much.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Not holding up against times?,"I had high hopes when watching Rosemary's baby, by the fact that so many regard this piece so high.In my honest opinion, I have a few things I would like to share.Firstly, i liked some of the acting here, by that I mean Mia Farrow. She is the star, alongside perhaps Ruth Gordon who also makes a good appearance that holds up with time.Story wise, it is a good piece, that makes you think. There are many not so subtle hints throughout the movie, that I think wouldnt have been so appearant in a newer piece from modern times. But that is just my viewing of it. This movie truly, by many means, are predictable. But, I sure wouldnt think it were predictable in 1968. I really love unpredictable movies though, so I'm sure I'm a bit colored by that fact in my regards to this one.There are more than a few reactions from the star Rosemary, that just doesnt hold up in todays world, but then again it depicts 1968, where the man did nothing in the house, except do what he want with his belongings. Meaning wife as well.To summarize my experience with this movie, I would like to call it a good, movie that didnt hold up well, but it is worth a watch.

I always come to the same conclusion about Rosemary's Baby - it is the absolute worst not just of what I call The Great Catholic Horror films (aka Exorcist, Amityville Horror, Omen) but of almost any major film of that era or any era. Polanski had every resource with which to make a great film (as he has many times) but any time I watch it I always end up saying to myself, ""Why the hell do people act like Rosemary's Baby is great?""

Good cinematography but no surprises,"The movie is clearly well done from a directorial standpoint and the setting is a 10, along with Mia Farrow's near-perfect portrayal of an innocent waif housewife who is ensnared in the devilish plot.Where it fell apart for me is that the direction the movie was going was all too obvious and yet there is 90 minutes of waiting for Rosemary to catch up to the viewer's knowledge of what is actually going on. Repetitive scenes revolving around whether she will or won't eat, drink and wear items given to her by the neighbor is a joyless slog.It gets a bit more interesting in the last half hour as Rosemary FINALLY comes to some realization of what the viewer has known all along, yet she still makes foolish decisions as a result.Maybe this was a groundbreaking movie when it came out and it does a decent job of showing how to do 'horror' without gore through a slowly developing tension build. In 2023 I want to watch a show where I am finding things out along with the protagonist, and at least some of those things are a surprise.

"truly, truly creepy","This movie truly frightened me.  What was so interesting about it, though, was that the true horror of the movie (disregarding the ending, which I simply could not watch the first time) is totally understated, yet there the whole time.  The horror comes with the audience knowing what's happening, what really is going on with the neighbors and with Rosemary's demise, and not being able to do a thing about it.  In its own way, this movie is incredibly tense and nerve-racking.  It's the ultimate last word in ""I have a bad feeling about this"" movies.  Roman Polanski is great at creating that underlying horror -- I can't even THINK about the opening and closing music without a shiver.  The music in general was effective, and the direction, especially the ""dream"" sequence, was dark and very Polanski-esque.  The acting was good, understated, exactly what the movie called for.  So much scarier than any of the teen ""horror"" movies out lately.",,Anonymous,Horror
Most horror movies wish they could be this creepy!,"Tired from all the recent slashers, this classic is a breath of fresh air. Although there is not much blood and gore, is is suspenseful and that is what keeps you glued to the screen. As far as I am concerned, what makes a great horror movie is the absence of blood and gore. Take for example The Exorcist- a great movie filled with suspense and insanity, yet it also didn't have any unnecessary graphicness. Mia Farrow portrays Rosemary with just the right amount of fragility and Ruth Gordon is goofy & insane as oversolicitous neighbor Minnie. Polanski's direction leaves the image of the ""baby"" open to the imagination, and the characters develop when you don't expect it. This should be on everyone's top ten horror movies of all time list.",,Anonymous,Horror
"genuinely unsettling and uncomfortable to watch, but great","there's something about ""rosemary's baby"" that makes it hard to articulate and yet elevates it to the level of one of the best horror movies ever made, if a little slow paced and at times monotonous. as with all polanski films, the movie has a weird flavor to it and at times makes the viewer really feel uncomfortable. the plot is relatively simple:a young couple, rosemary and guy, move into an apartment complex with very friendly and, uh...unique, neighbors. the first time rosemary gets the sense that's something is not quite right is after a neighbor's seemingly motiveless suicide, and her husband's odd rage when she mentions that she wants another doctor to replace the one he chose, a strange dude who gives 'natural' prescriptions for rosemary's occasional physical pains stemming from her pregnancy. one of the most terrifying scenes is a 'dream' sequence that may or may not be a dream, although it is very likely that it isn't, in which rosemary is undressed and surrounded by her buck naked neighbors on an altar to satan while they chant and hover over her. she is also very disturbed when her husband decides that since they had planned to make love on a certain night and she fell asleep prematurely, he'll go ahead and do it anyway. the ending is the most horrifying and fearful part in the film, even surpassing the dream scene, and rosemary finally learns what her husband and her neighbors have known all along, although i won't ruin it for you. let's just say that her husband's self interest and long standing ambition to be a famous actor motivates him to make a less than savory deal with someone you probably shouldn't bargain with, whatever the reason. this is an absolute must own for serious students of film and casual fans of the horror genre. surreal, stylish, and geniunely disturbing, ""rosemary's baby"" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made.",,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent film with great performances,"A near-perfect adaptation of Ira Levin's book, Rosemary's Baby remains today one of the best horror movies, not for its use of gore, but for its use of tension and surprise.  Of course a lot of credit for this movie goes to Mia Farrow who makes Rosemary a very real person, not to mention good performances by John Cassavetes as Rosemary's shady actor husband, and Ruth Gordon, as the overly nosy neighbor (who won an Oscar for this performance). The story itself is simple, a young couple moves into a New York apartment building with a very sinister past, and after the wife becomes pregnant she begins to suspect her neighbors are more than just friendly old people.  The film does a great job playing up Rosemary's isolation and the creepiness of the apartment building.  Many scenes and dialogue are taken directly verbatim from the book.  Be sure to go out and rent this one.",,Anonymous,Horror
Frightening!,"I read the book for the first time when I was fifteen. And then I waited about ten years until the film was shown on TV so I could see it at last. And it's great! One of the few movies that is as good as the book! You're always wondering, if she's right when she's worrying about her husband, her neighbours and her doctor or if she's just stressed because of her pregnancy. The actors are very good although I think that Rosemary's husband should seem more harmless than Cassavetes is (he's always a little bit too demonic).And the end of the film is better than the book: you never see the child, you only see how Farrow nearly loses her mind when she sees the baby for the first time. In the book the child looks like a devil en miniature: red hair, long fingernails and little horns. I always wondered how such a goat-looking-baby should be raised up without the whole world watching it! Polanski made it better than the author.AND ONE LAST WARNING: Never read the Levin-Sequel ""Rosemary's Son""! It's the worst sequel with the most idiotic end I've ever read!",,Anonymous,Horror

Mia Farrow fits the role perfectly, well supported by John Cassavetes and Sidney Blackmer; Ruth Gordon's irritating and befitting performance; the occasional Fur Elise in the background; to finish things up a good ending.What more can you ask for? 9/10 and a must watch.",,Anonymous,Horror
Rosemary's Baby,"""Rosemary's Baby"" starring Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, and Ruth Gordon was a great film for many reasons. This was a good horror film for the 1960's considering what they had and what they were working with. They made it work though because this was a great horror film especially for this time period. The setting in this movie was great and the acting was excellent as well. Everything that happens in this movie is what you would expect to be in horror films. The objectives that Rosemary has to go through are extremely haunting. This horror film kept you on edge at all times and that made it really exciting yet really suspenseful. This movie was excellent and I would highly recommend it to others.",,Anonymous,Horror
Riveting modern day horror chiller from Polanski,"""Rosemary's Baby"", adapted by director Roman Polanski from Ira Levin's (""The Stepford Wives"") novel, tells the tale of awe-inducing, mind-numbing witchcraft in late 60s Manhattan. Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse (John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow) move into the grand Dakota, and are immediately seen as the All-American couple: He's an aspiring actor, and she is a dutiful young woman hoping to conceive a labor of love. They are immediately befriended by the Castevet's, Roman (a terrifically menacing Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie (Best Supporting Actress scene-stealer Ruth Gordon), who lead the pregnant young woman through dis-invigorating hell. A terrific script, score (by Krzysztof Komeda), and minor supporting roles from Patsy Kelly as childish Laura-Louise, Charles Grodin as Dr. Hill, Rosemary's seemingly good-natured obstetrician, and Dr. Sapirstein (a stern, Ralph Bellamy) round out this incredible ensemble. Only complaint: Where was Mia Farrow's Oscar nomination? Or Best Picture? ****of****",,Anonymous,Horror
Great horror film.,"Slowly percolating tension in the first two thirds of the film gives way to nightmarishly terrifying last third in this Roman Polanski's highly effective horror film. MIa Farrow and John Cassavetes play newlyweds Rosemary and Guy Woodward who move into an apartment in New York where their seemingly happy lives take a strange turn when they befriend kooky old neighbors, Minnie and Roman Castavets.Polanski does a great job of creating an ominous atmosphere throughout, with a  disturbing sense of unease in the viewer created by a series of strange events and suggestions via subtle shifts in the characters' moods and behaviors. Mia Farrow is perfect in the role as Rosemary, innocent, vulnerable and uncommonly fragile. Ruth Gordon is fantastic as the garrulous and nosy old neighbor with an annoying habit of inviting herself unannounced and uninvited to her new neighbors.There are some interesting dream (or are they?) sequences in the film that are surreal and highly symbolic. They are effectively employed at right moments in the film, punctuating the increasing dread in the unhinged world of its protagonist. Excellent.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hell Cometh As a Child.,"The first horror film that dealt directly with Satan instead of some conjured up manifestation was Roman Polanski's atmospheric and highly disturbing ""Rosemary's Baby"". A film that definitely paved the way for other great horror films of the next 20 years or so (most notably the superior ""The Exorcist"" and the equal ""The Omen""). A young couple (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) has moved to an apartment in New York City. Everything seems fine, but the elderly next-door neighbors (played by Oscar-winning scene-stealer Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) seem a bit strange. Soon more elderly people start hanging around and after a very odd dream Farrow becomes pregnant. It seems that Cassavetes is the father of course, but the audience knows much better. The most unholy one of all has come up from the fires of Hell and impregnated Farrow in reality. Now the tension builds as Farrow is guarded by her husband and elderly friends as they all try to keep the real truth from her. Polanski's tone is the real thing that keeps ""Rosemary's Baby"" highly entertaining and very difficult to sit through at the same time. The finale is a bit of a let-down to some (including myself to an extent), but overall the film does enough good things to become a cinematic horror classic. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great occult thriller!,"""Rosemary´s Baby"" is a highly scary film that deals with the elements of paranoia and occultism perfectly! It is far better than the overrated ""The Exorcist"", because the dark menace of the omnipresent Satanism is much better developed and more frightening. There´s no gore or explicit violence, but the suspense is murderous! One of those films that hold you in its grip from the first to the very last minute! I really enjoyed the great performances of actors like John Cassavetes, Maurice Evans, Ralph Bellamy or Ruth Gordon, but outstanding Mia Farrow has the role of her life time with playing the innocent victim! Sometimes her part reminded me on the one of Catherine Deneuve´s in Roman Polanski´s ""Repulsion"", because both women suffer from urban fear, neurosis and an invisible danger. The scene when Rosemary´s raped by the devil is a classic! A film a could watch again and again!",,Anonymous,Horror
"An overhyped, disappointing ""classic.""","Don't get me wrong-- I love creepy, atmospheric, non-gory horror films.  I get a huge rush out of suspense.  But I'm not sure why people seem to rank Rosemary's Baby among the top horror films of all time; to me, it comes off as about as creepy, threatening, and atmospheric as a f***ing Scooby-Doo episode.  One of the ones with Scrappy in it.  AND the Harlem Globetrotters. The ""God is dead! Hail Satan!"" alone moves it from any semblance of horror to Adam-West-IS-Batman camp.  I felt no sympathy at all for Mia Farrow's character, partially because she was a whinging moron for the bulk of the movie, partially because Guy was right about her haircut.  The elderly couple were supposed to be sinister ringleaders hiding behind a veneer of annoying; they were such corny hacks that they never moved past the annoying bit.  My main reaction after I saw it for the first time was, ""wow, I didn't know they even *had* crack back then."" _Halloween?_ Terrifying. _The Exorcist?_ Nightmare inducing. _Rosemary's Baby?_  Dude, Where's My Car was far more upsetting to me.",,Anonymous,Horror
The way a REAL horror movie should be,"I watched this on ""Bravo"" last week after wanting to see it for years, and I have to say that I was very impressed. The acting is wonderful - Mia Farrow is superb as the terrified Rosemary, Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon are wonderful as the enjoyably evil (or is it evilly enjoyable?) Roman and Minnie Castevet.""Rosemary's Baby"" is, like I said, the way that a real horror movie should be. There's a story, a plot, and not a bunch of blood and gore, along with a big-breasted girl who can't act running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door. The movie grabs you in, and it doesn't let you go until the end.Rosemary Woodhouse is fragile. She's a scared young woman who's not sure of what's going on inside her. She describes the early stages of her pregnancy as 'feeling like there's a wire inside her that's tightening'. Minnie, the sweet old lady across the hall is nurturing and maternal, bringing Rosemary an herb-spiked drink every day. She's seeing the best OB/GYN in New York, the kindly old Jewish doctor.

Really scary to watch nowadays!,"Ordinarily, this would be a fairly spooky film to begin with.  But ever since one night in early December 1980, and thanks to a man we all ""know and love"" named Mark David Chapman, this film will be even scarier, especially for a young man named Sean Lennon and his mother Yoko Ono.  Unless I am mistaken, at the very beginning of the movie, in the scene where the apartment manager is showing Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes around, we get to see the very spot where, about 12 years later, John Lennon would be savagely gunned down.  Sean Lennon was deprived of his father, and Yoko Ono was deprived of her husband. So we can now all thank Mr. Chapman for making this movie even scarier for us.

Rosemary's Baby final scene is appropriate and truthful,"I'm a Polanski fan and I'had read some reviews""complaining on Rosemary's Baby final scene(as in CHINATOWN some people think that 'the ending' is wrong,I just can believe!) I just want to tell them this:The best part of the film is the final scene or' the climax scene',why? Well, as you know it RB is a mix of Psychological  and supernatural subjects But more important,RB is a GOTHIC film from a Gothic minded absurdist:ROMAN POLANSKI Ok, you are,I guess, aware of all of this ,the final scene is part of a polanskian universe-his filmography and the characters of his earlier films from the sixties came from this `universe'-- according to which the probability of the facts leans in a particular logic of the characters. In his pre-.RB film, CUL DE SAC(1965),POLANSKI present us a particular scene:We see a car beached in a coast starts to be invaded by the water, even in this situation, the man does not leave his car facing the risk of suffocating, perhaps he thinks that nothing bad can happen to him or not to conceive the possibility on the matter of doing something without the aid of his companion who, being kilometers away of the place, obvious  cannot listen to his cry for help .or another scene the couple that lives in the taken castle accepts the interference of the new guest as something inexorable that simply must be assimilated. With the code maintained in the absurd one, Polanski installs the possibility of any situation that, NO MATTER its degree of absurdity, will not be questioned by the protagonists. This attitude is use in an inverse way  in Rosemary's baby(1968)at first she fights against the adversities that alter her normal course of her life.(contrary to Cul de sac character,she even seeks help to her former doctor But ,he,of course,doesn't believe her'story').Remember her as a Gothic heroine,To me ,'the crib scene' got to do with that inexorable acceptance I've mentioned you before(the absurdistic VIEW) and about  her strong motherhood instinct almost obsessive even if the child she nurtures would be the son of the devil(supernatural)To show this at the end is not a treason because we already  got `hints'of witchcraft in earlier scenes,Remember the absurd theory? Of course the `paranoia' mentioned is interesting for the plot,To me it's difficult to believe that people didn't knew(back in the sixties) that at the end her suspected paranoia is not precisely a `paranoia'In the  absurdistic gothic world nothing is safe or logical or `realistic' even if it looks like For that reason Rosemary's Baby final scene is appropriate and truthful to this particular universe. The pessimism just fits very well too because in all of Polanski films the protagonist's isolation is one of their characteristic.As TERRENCE RAFFERTY said : Rosemary's Baby"" seems less a lurid shocker than a kind of boldly stylized existential fable: Hell really is other people, especially when they are people determined to impose themselves on weaker creatures. Poor Rosemary is like a sick lamb separated from her flock by a pack of ravening wolves.'Is John Huston's character in CHINATOWN one of those old wolves too?(`Hire myself to whom? What beasts adore?

Great Old school Horror,"Rosemary's Baby is a cinematic version of what we believe many births have resulted in during this present day. As the woman should feel happy about the new which she will birth into the world, she is plagued with he child being the son of evil. As I stated just like children born today. Watch in suspense and horror. The build up of negative energy around the happy couple is trumped by their intrusive neighbors. The elderly actors will not allow for personal space that continues to escalate the expectant mother's, Rosemary, depression about her unborn child. The story line is long. Yet the buildup of the climax is worth it. The husband, who we finds out things about later, presents as the typical husband of a hormonal woman. You can see he harbors more in allow the continued intrusiveness. Finally Rosemary gives in. The result is a wonderful horror. It is classic to be cherished as films today only classify as semi-horror.",,Anonymous,Horror
There is a place horrifying to women...,"And that would be ""Rosemary's Baby"".  No matter how effective of a script it supposedly has and despite good acting, the movie collapses under its own weight at the end.  The whole experience could've been one terrifying event, but Polanski is not a horror maestro and the movie just lags into a humungous time-waster.Part my apparent sexism, as I mean this comment with total sincerity, but the whole plot concept just isn't terrifying to someone who knows that pregnancy for his gender is impossible.  However, just about every woman I know who has seen this has had nightmares from it.  Oh, well, their loss. ""The Omen"" did a far better job of being both creepy and shocking. Nonetheless, for those looking for so-called classic horror, go ahead and waste your time with this.  If you want REAL TERROR, go to back to Jaws.Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.  There is all the set-up, but none of the delivery here.",,Anonymous,Horror
Psychological Horror At Its Very Best.,"Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a masterwork of outstanding direction, polished screenplay & stellar performances that may lean towards the supernatural in small doses but what truly makes it an enduring masterpiece of its genre is the seamless manner in which it employs the psychological elements of horror filmmaking into its premise by creating a chilling sense of dread, paranoia & suspense over the course of its runtime.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Rosemary's Baby takes place in the year of 1966 and concerns a young couple; struggling actor Guy Woodhouse & his lovely wife Rosemary, who move into a notorious apartment building in New York and are gleefully greeted by their elderly but eccentric neighbours. The main plot concerns Rosemary's pregnancy as she becomes more n more paranoid & suspects her neighbours to be a part of an occult society.Written & directed by Polanski, the film marks his American film debut & he really couldn't have asked for a better start. Rosemary's Baby works as an effective thriller in the first watch but it's the next viewings where one truly discovers just how expertly the director has managed to make the smallest of details play a crucial role in shaping up the whole picture. Deftly scripted by Polanski in his first stint as a writer, the film follows the book very closely and is one of the most faithful adaptations in motion picture history.Cleverly shot from start to finish and employing excellent use of long takes & camera angles, Cinematography beautifully serves its purpose of encapsulating the entire feature with an eerie, tense & insecure atmosphere which escalates further as the film progresses. Editing is immaculately done as every sequence feels relevant to the plot. And the lullaby that bookends the film is a haunting piece while the other tracks have an unusual presence that ultimately works in favour of the film.Coming to the performances, Rosemary's Baby features a very reliable cast & benefits greatly from their committed performances. Mia Farrow is immensely convincing as Rosemary & her gaunt appearance only adds more flesh to her character. John Cassavetes doesn't get enough credit for his role but if one looks closely, his action kind of hints at the sinister ending this film has in store for the viewers. Sidney Blackmer & Ruth Gordon capture the essence of their characters in an authentic manner and the contribution from rest of its cast is no slouch either.On an overall scale, Rosemary's Baby remains one of the most unsettling films of all time that still hasn't lost much of its potency despite being over 45 years old & continues to reveal more of its brilliance on subsequent viewings. Its real strength lies in its ability to keep the viewers immersed into its intriguing story that wonderfully balances its elements without ever relying on any sort of gore or violence. And the final payoff is absolutely worth the wait. A laudable work of precision craftsmanship & a timeless classic in every sense of the word, Rosemary's Baby comes strongly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.",,Anonymous,Horror
cursed apartment?,"Rosemary's baby suggests INDOOR as a place for evil plots. Buildings as the VILLAIN. Something sinister happens in close doors. At the beginning the film introduce us to the apartment's reputation:During a dinner invitation with their friend Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins (Maurice Evans), he warns them of the apartment building's notorious, sordid and unsavory reputation for witchcraft and cannibalism over 50 years earlier:Are you aware that the Bramford had a rather unpleasant reputation around the turn of the century? It's where the Trench sisters conducted their little dietary experiments. And Keith Kennedy held his parties. Adrian Marcato lived there too...The Trench sisters were two proper Victorian ladies - they cooked and ate several young children including a niece...Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft. He made quite a splash in the 90s by announcing that he'd conjured up the living devil. Apparently, people believed him so they attacked and nearly killed him in the lobby of the Bramford...Later, the Keith Kennedy business began and by the 20s, the house was half empty...World War II filled the house up again...They called it Black Bramford...This house has a high incidence of unpleasant happenings. In '59, a dead infant was found wrapped in newspaper in the basement...Another similar `cursed Buildings' we find in films like Suspiria (1977) and especially Inferno (1980) portray buildings in some form of supernatural collusion against the protagonist. Phenomena (1985) picks up on the dormitory persecution theme with a different, inverse-Psycho (1960) explanation. In Phenomena, we expect a monkey to be the killer and transfer our suspicion to the son because they are similar in size, only to find that it is really the mother who is the killer.",,Anonymous,Horror

Well done!,"Rosemary's Baby stands as possibly the best suspense/horror films of all time and is frequently referred to as such for good reason.  Director Roman Polanski clearly knows his audience and how to keep us entertained as he artfully transforms Ira Levin's novel without missing a beat.  The scenes are brief and to-the-point which keeps the pace enjoyably taught.  Mia Farrow was ideal for the role of the young and gentle Rosemary Woodhouse; in fact, I can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  John Cassavettes is also phenomenal as Guy Woodhouse, the impetuous struggling actor who becomes willing to undertake desperate measures in order to save his waning career. Of course, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer turn in stellar performances as the nosy neighbors who are actually more imposing than Rosemary initially suspects.Set in Manhattan, the movie has a very realistic base that fares well with the enigmatic witchcraft elements that gradually creep out of the woodwork. Polanski invites us into a believable situation involving a likeable young couple.  We can all identify with the process of choosing a new apartment, putting up with annoying neighbors, coping with career related stress, and the prospect of bringing a child into the world.  Rosemary is not the typical helpless idiot prevalent in many of today's horror films, but is, instead, headstrong and determined not to succumb to her surroundings, even as they become overwhelming.  We can see ourselves in her situation and feel for her as she is made to feel isolated.  The supporting cast is also highly talented.",,Anonymous,Horror
Terror and irony,"This film is quite scary even today.  It's the mysteriousness and the fact that everything seems normal on the surface that makes this movie so riveting.

"One of the All-Time GREATEST; or: ""How To Make A Real Horror Film In One Easy Lesson""","MORD39 RATING:  ****  out of  ****Forget today's music video style of filmmaking, and all the unnecessary junk that goes into it. This indisputable classic from the ingenious Roman Polanski is a vital lesson to be learned, and the direction Hollywood needs to go in if they are to save a dying genre.This is one of the best Horror films ever made. PERIOD. It's flawlessly scripted and directed by Polanski, with dead-on performances by the entire cast, not just Ruth Gordon (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for this).There is no need for gore and blood here; the terrifying story is told with reliance on the conspiracy that develops in the magnificent Dakota apartment building in New York City. The seemingly ""normal, average people"" living across the hall from the innocent Rosemary are actually cult leaders, and very undetectable given their advanced ages and grandparent-like qualities.John Cassavetes is perfectly smug as Rosemary's husband - a struggling actor desperate for success who throws all loyalty and decency out the window by allowing himself to become tainted by his neighbor's sinister influence.There is an aura of evil that permeates throughout ROSEMARY'S BABY. We identify with Mia Farrow's unsuspecting character as she gradually becomes the only sane person amidst a den of hungry satanic lions.I'd like to praise Ralph Bellamy here as well. A mainstay of the great old Universal Horror Classics, he is outstanding here as the pricey and reputable doctor with a decidedly morbid idea of leisuretime activity.A perfect film, from opening credits to closing credits. If you're one of the growing many who only want exploding heads with rock or rap music in your horror movies, you're better off watching c**p like FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.

Polanski's colorful classic,"Normally, I'm not very keen on diabolical films, but ""Rosemary's baby"" is a good film and possibly even a classic in its genre. Talking about genres, I think this is not really a horror movie as there's simply no gore to be found whatsoever. Roman Polanski made a fine thriller in which a young woman experiences the great but somewhat mysterious hospitality of her neighbours. At first she accepts everything what has been offered to her. But after a while (and certain suspicious happenings later) she starts to reconsider.The storyline of ""Rosemary's baby"" isn't bad, but there are other and far more impressive things about this film. For example: the way how Polanski builds up the tension by adding some very nice twists to the story now and then. Not to mention the great camera work as well as the use of different colors to create a certain atmosphere in the film. Much of the film is shot in close-up. This is another typical Polanski characteristic. By doing so, he points out the expressions on the faces of the different characters in this film. This is done in a truly magnificent but nevertheless dramatic way.Another aspect of the Polish director is the way in which he represents a dream or a hallucination by the use of amateurish images.  This is all brilliantly mixed with a dreadful silence that lasts through the whole sequence. These are often the most realistic scenes in the whole film as no steady-camera was used for such shooting. Polanski's directing is one of the main reasons why this film was so successful. He's really made a difference here.What about the acting then? John Cassavetes is all right and Ruth Gordon as the nosy and annoying neighbour is even better. But the star of this film is, beyond any doubt, Mia Farrow. Her acting is so life-like that I felt sorry for her at times; even when I knew that she was only playing a character in a film.Tragically enough, Polanski's wife was brutally murdered by Charles Manson and his cult members.  This horrible incident happened right after this film had been released.  I guess some people shouldn't watch films at all.",,Anonymous,Horror
OK,"I would like to review this film. The following is nothing more than my personal opinion. But hey, so it's yours.I understand that Polanski's work was very innovative for 1968 standards. I actually am a big fan of Polanski's work. The Tenant is my favourite Polanski film.I would like a bit more of what he did with The Tenant to be evident in Rosemary's baby. The subtleties. The dark undertone. Nowhere to be found in Rosemary's baby. Instead, this is more of a shouting statement to the society I guess. And it did work miracles for him didn't it? It was his big break. What a way to shock the audiences back then. It really is a good film. But not too good.That's because Polanski didn't go with what the film needed in this one. He went with what he did - and his career. Good for him. Bad for the movie. This movie good be a 9 but now it's a 7. This movie is a horror film that doesn't feel like a horror film.

A Chilling Masterpiece of Horror,"Really Creepy. Even Today.  This 1968 Roman Polanski directed classic of the macabre is a brilliantly terrifying excursion into modern day NYC & the lives of a newlywedded young couple.  What makes this movie work so well is the off-beat, hippie-ish way in which its told. It made it seem so much more believable & it made the commonly seen, cliched horror films of the day looked uninspired & unsophisticated by camparison. Both this film and the best-selling novel by Ira Levin were phenomenally popular with the masses back in the late sixties. I can remember my mom reading the book & telling me how scary the movie was - which I was too young young to see owing to its rating.  I thought Mia Farrow's portrait of the title character was finel y etched and that she put a lot of ""feeling"" into her unusual role.  John Cassevettes does fine as Guy.  Ruth Gordon, hammy and hilarious, steals the show as Minnie Castevet, the eccentric nosey neighbour. She won her best supporting AA for this: ""I can't tell ya how encouragin' a thing like this is at my age"" should told the academy during her acceptance speech.  Her playing of Minnie, when seen today, borders on being overdone in some respects, especially when she makes those animated faces while eating & serving up cake in her apartment.  Her apathetic attitude toward the death of the dope addict girl cracks me up: ""Oh, yeaah"" * but her ""nude"" scene is a creepy turnabout for her character. Sidney Blackmer is excellent as her ""fascinating"" husband while Ralph Bellamy easily gives his finest latter-day performance as Rosemary's ""concerned"" doctor.

Good Horror Film!,"When I first saw this film it scared the hell out of me! I ain't kidding. Especially when Mia Farrow was being raped by that animal-like creature(Devil)!! But eventually I bought it at my local video store and I wasn't scared ever since. Anyway, I liked this film because it gives you the chills and it isn't as violent and overdone like the Exorcist was. I don't understand Mia Farrow's voice in this picture it so mousy and sounds like an English accent. There is an inside joke when Mia is in the basement doing the laundry when she says to Angela Dorian that she looks like Victoria Vetri, when it is Victoria Vetri! Angela Dorian is Victoria Vetri's psuedonym and Playboy Playmate Name!!!!! I will always watch this at midnight in the dark living room and fall asleep. I agree with most people, that this is better than today's Horror films. I highly recommend this film for a true horror fan. Watch it alone though.10/10",,Anonymous,Horror
A view to a ... up to you to decide,"I could wonder if the film is a psychological drama with the hints towards the maternity psychosis or a mainstream horror movie. But why should I ? All included is the load impressive enough to make an interesting reading /a quote from Basic Instinct; words of sympathy for Mr.Eszterhas, he's made me quit smoking/. I cannot sympathize with girls like Rosemary, because it's in row with my convictions, but the actors are really good here, and all of them. The theme of love was overpowering. Love for husband, child. Hmm, the child above all. The independent love with the sacrifice of the very own personal grounds upon which all had been built in past, was touching and hurting. It's so hard to bring it here in our lives. Farrow and Cassavetes made me believe they were in trouble as well as their support did /Gordon, Blackmer, Evans/. Occasionally Mia Farrow was overly realistic so that I was ready to sign off but I didn't. /though I must confess, the name, Mia that is, has a reservation for a soft spot in my heart/. And the final moments, with the baby crying in the cradle, were tears bringers as no other film had done so. With Krzysztof Komeda's lullaby came comfort and ease. A great movie mostly underestimated.",,Anonymous,Horror
Astonishing!,"This movie is absolutely breathtaking.  Mia Farrow is so easy to identify with.  There were times when I wanted to scream at the characters on the screen.  That is how well-acted this movie is.  Some parts may seem a little campy by today's audiences but for me there was not an unreal moment. Ruth Gordon definitely deserved that Oscar, as did Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes. I absolutely loved that Scrabble scene.  I found myself thinking 'Come on, Rosemary! Figure it out!' This is my favorite horror movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Truly a Fine Classic,"A Very Original and Clever Movie that Grabbed onto Me From Beginning to End. The Acting and Script were just as Good as the Well Thought out Plot. Although Many Movies have tried to Recreate the Pleasure and Enjoyment Found in This Masterpiece of a Movie, I Personally Doubt that Any Movie Will. In Addition, the Musical Score at The Beginning and End is in my Opinion as Much of a Classic as the Movie Itself. Also, Very Well done for Being Made in 1968.The Picture and Sound Quality is Very Well Perfected. Why would Someone Not like This Movie? They Watch it and Expect Blood and Guts. People! Do Not Watch this Movie expecting a Blood Bath or anything like It. This Films Masterpiece Lies in It's Script, Plot, and Originality; Not How Gory it is!Why Would Someone like This Film? Too Many Reasons to List! If you are Doubtful, just Read the Plot or View the Trailer, Which should help A Lot.10 out of 10.Also Recommended: Puppet Master, Carrie, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Blood Dolls, Hideous!, Head of the Family, Scanners, House on Haunted Hill, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Castle Freak, and Slumber Party Massacre.

"Imaginative, if slow, film making","Rosemary's Baby is a story about a woman named Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her husband named Guy (John Cassavetes). They have moved into a new house, and decide to start a family. Their neighbours Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon, who won an Oscar for this role) at first seem nice, if not overwhelmingly so, but eventually Rosemary suspects that they are up to something... something evil.Not far into ""Rosemary's Baby,"" we see a chilling sequence of Rosemary having satanic nightmares. This sets us up for what we think is going to be a terrifying and intense movie.Then something strange happens: nothing. The momentum is killed by nearly an hour of meandering as Rosemary argues with her husband, visits her friends, throws parties etc. etc. It is not until late in her pregnancy that she begins to suspect something is up. She begins to put together pieces that add up to something very wrong with her baby. Perhaps her neighbours are preparing to sacrifice her baby in some sort of satanic ritual... or worse, maybe the baby is Satan himself.The final act of the film is some kind of genius. Throughout the movie little things provide Rosemary with theories about her baby. Roman Polanski leaves us in suspence because the ending is always in doubt. Her stories make so much sense, but at the same time, its hard to believe such evil could be occurring right under their noses. The final scenes are chilling and ominous.""Rosemary's Baby"" has sustained periods of brilliance, but there is an hour long void in the film. Is it worth seeing? I think so. A lot of people walked out due to boredom. I thought about doing that too, but the fantastic ending made me more than happy to have stuck it out.",,Anonymous,Horror
la la la,"Today, Satan has become boring.  His name no longer sends shivers down your spine because you know next week, something far scarier will be mentioned. This movie's different, I watched it alone and it touched me eerily.  I've been told when you have a baby, some women grow so attached to their lump they never want it to be born.  Can you imagine figuring out that the being inside is evil, before it has said or done anything.  That it belongs to that biblical monstrosity you hear about everyday?  I couldn't, I've tried, but it is basically impossible to fit into those shoes.  Rosemary is having a baby, one great milestone in your life.  She and her husband Guy move into a beautiful apartment and she just befriended the neighbour girl.  The neighbour girl commits suicide a few days later.  She has a strange nightmare about being molested by a beast, and the neighbours who were taking care of her friend are visiting daily, dropping off special herbs to eat while she is pregnant.  During her pregnancy, she starts to get suspicious of the helping neighbours, she hears them chanting at night, Guy is always next door and she is getting unbearable pains everyday.  Could it be Satan at work, see for yourself.",,Anonymous,Horror
A non-gory B horror flick.,"They have flipped the Jesus Christ birth story. This time the devil selects a earthly woman to impregnate with HIS baby so that the kid can go on to fight for HIS cause. They brought the controversial idea into the modern day (1968) which increases the scare by half and used an underground society of aged pagans to set the situation up. Given this obvious 'Stephen King' type reversal the creativity ends.The Husband as audiences see half way through or earlier chooses a successfull career in the movies with the assistance of the group over a love for his wife a first born of his own, not to mention the ethics involved in knowingly bringing about the son of the hadies lord. When the idea was first conceived by the author of the book they knew they would get praise from the people who would not pan the daring concept. This flick was nominated for it's writing adaptation and the sour life-offputting performance of the head pagan lady won for her Supporting Role.This is maximum negative mind candy, the base idea for which is an obvious concept, neither profound nor moving and if you are willing to play along with it, it can be a little scary, the ending also is just anti-pleasant, I can see little justification for it. For a non-gory B flick I give it 7/10.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It's not Gothic Horror, it's a Severe Black Comedy!","Everyone has it all wrong. It's not a Gothic Horror movie at all....although it has all the elements on the surface, sure. But if you look at it from the screenplay and situational side you'll notice a lot of stuff that's just evilly hilarious, and smartly adapted for the screen too. I think Cassavettes decided to play his role really smug because he just got finished shaking everything up in the film world all over again with ""Faces"", and Mia Farrow's downward spiral was really cool to watch unfold up until the very end, where she just decided, probably after going catatonic, to keep the demonspawn. Everybody's said enough about Ruth Gordon's great performance already. But this movie really is black comedy, from the stereotypical (at the time) ""asian-with-a-camera"", to the scrabble piece fun, to the hilarity of a 75 year old woman screaming ""Hail Satan!""...It's just funny. Really.",,Anonymous,Horror
"stunning, but give the author his due","rosemary's baby remains a brilliant crafted, beautifully acted and shot work..a thoroughly haunting and riveting modern horror story. my only quibble...literally every line,  character and production design detail from the film is lifted directly from ira levin's novel.  shouldn't he have been given some credit on the screenplay, along with roman polanski? i don't think there's a word in this one not taken from the book. bravo, levin! and how wise of the filmmaker to realize it so faithfully.",,Anonymous,Horror
Classic chiller,"Adapted from the book by Ira Levin, this film is so scary and suspenseful that it becomes nearly unbearable to watch. Production values are extremely high; the direction is just about as good as it gets and the performances are brillant. A very well done horror film which deserved to win more than one Academy Award. The best film in the horror genre. 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
You don't need gore to make a great horror movie...,"..and this certainly proves that. There are no sudden shocks, no blood (ok, hardly any), no guts.Just a stunning story line through which you gradually feel more and more uneasy. A truly great horror such as this will not scare you outright but it will disturb you.To me the most chilling aspect is how Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) develops through the film, fading from an attractive and healthy young woman to a mere shadow of her former self, and of how she can't trust anyone, not even her doctor.It's strange how the Cassavettes are such a likeable couple, but turn out to be evil. This unexpectedness is one of the many great things about this film.The only bad thing is Rosemary's husband. Someone I took an instant disliking to even before he got mixed up with the Cassavettes.Overall, a superb film. So nice to see a great American movie which does not conform to the talent-suppressing Hollywood formula.",,Anonymous,Horror
Shambolic mixture to be honest,"Pardon my ignorance.When an actor of Mia Farrow's calibre decides to act in a movie after a year from his previous release, and when you have a massive production house backing your movie with a director whose had two back to back hits, You tend to expect a lot from a movie.But instead what you get is 2 hours of absolute rubbish.The facts are simple. Add a Lil bit of humour to a pathetic story and publicise it well and let the cash registers ring, because its the year end and there a billion fans of Farrow, who have been waiting so impatiently for his next movie for over a year, so anything she signs is bound to be an instant hit. And that has been the case for most of his movies for the past decade. Even THE GREAT GASBY cashed in a lot in the first week.What mystifies me more is the way Polanski went about publicising this movie? I am still confused and a bit dazzled as to what was the link between the story of the movie and Farrow touring NYC as your everyday people.What mystifies me even more as to what made choose her this movie. There was nothing even close to what you would call challenging in this film, considering her previous performances.Lets start with his character Rosemary, a college student . Lets be honest, she has played that in so many movies that she could now do that in her sleep. A free thinker who studies and preaches education by her own rules and practicality. Funny why does ""Zinda Laash"" just keep springing to my mind. The only difference being Deeba Begum and Rosemary was that Deeba was practising medicine in that movie and Rosemary is a housewife.There were many one-liners that i heard giggles in the theatre, but not many of them realise that they are so 2 thousand late.Like for instance the NASA pen scene or even the best gag of the film the Satan speech are lifted from either stand-ups or foreign movies.It was like watching a blend of Zinda Laash, Rang De Basanti,Patch Adams, Munnabhai (the 1971 one because that too was inspired by Zinda Laash), Patch Adams & Taare Zameen Par together.And it was Shambolic mixture to be honest. Even the theme song ""give me some sunshine"" is inspired by an old Hindi ghazal. And i am really annoyed that nobody else realised that. Probably because the language has changed. So i will have to spell it out to you, compare the lyrics of this song and a timeless classic by jagjit singh, ""Woh Kaagaz Ki Kashti"", and u will begin to realise, that every bit of this movie is either inspired or lifted from one or the other, in the same manner Ghajini was inspired from a certain Christopher Nolan film.Yes i did find something that i liked in the movie, and that is only one shot from the entire movie, although very predictable, but the scene in which the infants eye is revealed to be a reptilian really blew me away.With THE PIANO PPLAYER , Polanski stamped his mark of brilliance in many ways. As a director, a story writer and a story teller. It was refreshing and unpredictable. Even the first of the Apartment series had plenty of laughs and frowns although that too was mostly an englishised version of Zinda Lagaan.Mr, Polanski, move over the Zinda Lagaan hangover now. Its high time.I am sure you might find many other movies in Bollywood, that still haven't been Englishanised.And once again pardon my ignorance.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not a light comedy,"I saw this film in the States when it first came out.  In a rush to get into the cinema (and having read no reviews), I misread the title as ""Rosemary, Baby"" & therefore imagined it to be a light comedy.  No surprise to me, then, when the opening scenes had all the hallmarks of a typical American married couple light-hearted romance.  Imagine my surprise, as they say, when the film started its descent into paranoia and worse.  Truly remarkable - Polanski at his best.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Classic horror, but not really scary","This is certainly a chilling tale, but don't expect to jump from your seat or scream.  It is scary in a different fashion, because you know what is going on, but all of it is not displayed on the screen. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a very odd, but brilliantly unfolded story revolving around a young New York couple (Farrow & Cassavetes).  She is desperate to have a baby, he desperate for success as an actor.  Their neighbors are a lovable, but peculiar couple, who just happen to be Satan worshippers. You can figure the rest out without me spoiling it for you.  Ruth Gordon, in an Oscar-winning role as ""Minnie"" is just one reason to watch this.  Earns 4 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror
