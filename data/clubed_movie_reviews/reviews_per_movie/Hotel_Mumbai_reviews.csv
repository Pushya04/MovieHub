Were the other reviewers here watching the same movie I was?,"No one should ever expect any movie about such a carnage to follow the actual events in real time. Estimates are that nearly 60 died at the train station (shown first in the movie) and more than 30 perished at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Although the train station event could have better represented in this film, the segue to the situation at the Taj was fairly seamless and leaves the viewer with little to ponder.
What follows is nothing short of gripping, as ordinary people face extraordinary situations just to stay alive. The screenplay license taken by the film's makers shows in vivid (often horrendous) detail the scope of the attacks on innocent people by this group of terrorists. I don't think anyone who lived through this event can quarrel with the realism portrayed in the film, let alone the outcome. I found this movie to be fine cinema and I watched it twice before returning it to Red Box. I don't regret watching it a second time. Strongly recommended, but be prepared for a lot of blood and violence.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Unbearable tension from the beginning,"This movie is brutal, let me just say it on the outset. Based on the real life Mumbai terrorist attack which happened on 26 Nov 2008, this is also a very claustrophobic undertaking, because you are trapped in small confined areas when seeing the characters just trying to survive the horror of a terrorist attack, just takes a lot out of you. For almost 2.5 hours, the movie amps the stress level one notch at a time, maintaining a nerve breaking cat-and-mouse type of tension when the movie's myriad of characters attempt escape their situation by hiding in closets, kitchens, club rooms and bathrooms. You will be straining at every scene.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Tense and taut, Hotel Mumbai is a gripping thriller","It's never an easy task making a feature film of an horrific real life event, here in Hotel Mumbai the dramatization of the 2008 terror attacks that shook the country of millions and the world, but Australian director Anthony Maras manages the tricky balance of making a film that educates viewers about this terrible occurrence, while also shining a light on the many heroic actions that brought out the best of humanity in an otherwise dark and evil time.Instead of trying to encapsulate all of the terror that took place in Mumbai during these events, Maras instead focuses mostly on the horror that unfolded in the renowned and upmarket Taj Hotel, filled with guests and staff from all over the world, who were facing a battle for their lives for a number of hours as gun toting and grenade wielding extremists infiltrated their grounds and acted out a bloodthirsty and cowardly planned attack on the facility.By doing this Maras is able to build up a number of different characters we begin very early on to care for, from Dev Patel's kindly staff member Arjun, Anupam Kher's head chef Oberoi, Nazanin Boniadi's and Armie Hammer's newly married couple Zahra and David and Tilda Cobham-Hervey's nanny Sally, all of whom are based on real life victims of the attacks or a combination of real people that found themselves in the hotel on that fateful day.In doing so Hotel Mumbai finds an almost constant feeling of tension and unease as these people we've got to know find themselves face to face with the very worst kind of religious violence, mindless and unwavering in its blood-lust and Maras handles the expansive cast and more close quarters confinement of the horrific attack with aplomb as he covers all bases of the incident.Wisely for the film we also get to spend time with the man behind the murderous plight, while they are showcased as what could be perceived to be the generic version of a Muslim terrorist, its unfortunately just how it was as these brainwashed men (or really teenagers) believed they were more than justified and within their rights to enter into the sacred grounds of Indian soil to unleash their hell on earth for its unsuspecting citizens.There are moments in Hotel Mumbai that feel a little forced and out of place, moments of dialogue that are a little heavy handed or character actions that scream big screen box ticking (people moving out of hiding spots for no good reason or unbelievable shootouts) but overall much of Hotel Mumbai provides a hold your breath like insight into a terrible day in Indian and world history and a reminder to us all of the often amazing human bravery that shines forth in such dark moments.Final Say -A confronting and unwavering feature length look at one of India's darkest days, Hotel Mumbai is an impressive Australian backed production that acts as a taut and tense thriller and an insightful exploration of a true life terror.3 ½ pairs of work shoes out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,History
It's a true story,"I dislike much of the reviews here. If you cant deal with watching a story of a horrific event, then dont. You know straight up front what your getting into. It's a terrible tragic situation. Yes it's frustrating watching people react that gets them killed. But we weren't there and aren't in their shoes to say we would do differently. They are afraid and desperate for a chance. The movie does a great job of telling a story and making you feel the emotions of what happened. It's awful, but that doesnt make the movie awful.

The movie is violent and you can't predict who will survive because it's masterfully presented. The movie is intense and you get caught in the trauma and emotions depicted. It also honors the staff of the hotel who stayed behind to help the guests. This is like 9/11 for Mumbai and if you are too young to hear about the what happened, this is a good watch.",10.0,Anonymous,History
true and frightening,"Greetings again from the darkness. A group of quiet and focused young men with backpacks arrive by boat and then split into taxis. We hear the calm voice being fed into their ear buds. The voice assures them that ""God is with you"" and ""Paradise awaits."" Of course, since this is based on true events from 2008, we know the horror that is about to be unleashed by these terrorists (more than 170 killed).This is the first feature film from writer-director Anthony Maras, and with his co-writer John Collee (MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, 2003), we are taken to CST, the train station which is one of the 12 terrorist targets. Actual footage is mixed in, leaving no doubt as to the panic and violence that unfolded. As the individuals in the group divide into their well-orchestrated terrorist teams, we flash to the morning routine at a nearby home. Arjun (Dev Patel) is frantically getting prepared for work before heading to his pregnant wife's place of work. He is dropping off their young child since the sitter was a no-show.Arjun is part of the staff at the prestigious Taj Mahal Hotel Palace, affectionately referred to as ""The Taj"". The service is impeccable ... to the point of checking the temperature of bath water for one of the guests. Those who stay here are accustomed to and demanding of the very finest. However, on this stay, they will experience the sharp contrast of ultimate luxury and raw terror. As viewers, our guts sense the feeling of dread, even as the hotel managers and staff are welcoming arriving guests such as a retired Russian Special Forces officer turned wealthy playboy (Jason Isaacs) and newlyweds David (Armie Hammer) and Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi, ""Homeland""), along with their newborn baby and nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham-Hervey).As the cold-blooded attack is carried out by the terrorists at The Taj, we witness so many innocent people mowed down with precision - some execution style. Many hotel guests find hiding spots, including an exclusive club in the heart of the hotel. The staff, including Arjun and renowned Chef Hermant Oberoi (Anupam Kher), courageously try to survive while also protecting the guests. David and Zahra get separated from each other and from their baby, leaving the nanny desperately trying to keep the oft-crying infant from being heard.We also witness the local police - undermanned, under-armed, under-trained - try their best to defuse the situation, knowing that Special Forces are ""hours away"". Courage is on display throughout the film, but this is no Jason Bourne or John McClane scenario. These are cooks and waiters and hotel guests caught in one of the most frightening situations imaginable.For cinematic effect, the attack seems to take place over the course of a single night, whereas the actual events were over 3 days, resulting in 31 deaths at The Taj. The level of tension is maintained throughout ... it's a well-made thriller centered on actual events and real people. The filmmakers seem to go out of their way to avoid any political, social or religious commentary or insight. We only know the terrorists are told to take American prisoners and ""Go and do Jihad"". It's described as ""indiscriminate terror"" and that they are reclaiming what has been taken from them over the years. It is a difficult film to watch, though we understand there will always be bad people doing bad things for what they believe are the right reasons. Fortunately, there will also always be courageous and good people. More than once we hear the staff mention ""Guest is God"" ... but not all of these guests were welcome.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A reminder of the power....,"Sad to say, but this is a detailed & graphic reminder of what happens all too often when fanatics of one specific religion get together with hate in their heart and time to plan.Whether it's a beach on Tunisia, or a concert in Manchester, or in Paris, or it's a western 5-star hotel in beautiful Bali, an upscale mall in Nairobi, attacks on festivals in Paris, Nice, Canada, America, Boston Marathon, San Bernadino, Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, 9-11 etc. This movie is a stark visual reminder of the power of evil and what fanatics of this particular religion are not only capable of, but continue to plan.

Brutally tense but such stupid people,"One the one hand, it is a very powerful drama. As the violence escalates, so does the suspense, and the interspersing of real news footage from the actual event (I assume) is a nice touch.But besides the main characters being uninteresting, I've never seen a more stupid bunch! I can't speak from any personal tragedy to what I would do in such a situation, so I mean no disrespect to survivors of extreme violence, but these people act so irrationally that you'll feel like they deserve it. Some just boldly make their presence known instead of remaining in hiding and waiting for the coast to clear. There are seemingly plenty of unwatched back exits (a handful of cops eventually enter through one), but the victims decide the best course of action is to flee across the hotel from one room to another. In the meantime, a couple of gunmen are going down hallways, knocking on the doors and subsequently shooting the occupants when opened. Apparently no one can hear the stream of gunshots outside, but can immediately respond to gentle rapping at their door. And since peepholes don't seem to exist, it's common courtesy to just blindly open the door to strangers without inquiring their identity/purpose beforehand.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Typical, formulaic Hollywood revisionism","For the true accounts of exactly what happened at Hotel Mumbai (and around the city) during the terrorist attacks, watch any one of the many documentaries available. This is just a fantasy version trying to mix ""Die Hard"" with ""hotel Rwanda"". It's bad. Of course, because it was marketed to American audiences they had to have an American protagonist who has to show an act of bravery...but not enough to actually result in anything, since that would prompt people to look him up and realize there were no Americans killed during the Hotel siege. And there has to be a ""western"" muslim to balance out the terrorists to show ""see? They're not ALL like that!"" And while this character was portrayed as a hot, rich Persian chick, the reality is she was a dumpy, old turk (and her husband); both atheists/secular who quickly pretended to be muslim (the woman put her sash around her head) to show the terrorists ""look! don't kill us! We're one of you!!!!"" and subsequently lived.Yes, gang, the reality is far more horrible and there really were very few heroes or likeable characters at all...save the waiter and head chef portrayed who really did help many to safety.

Forget the negatives! Be sure to see it!,"Can't figure out why this film has such negative reviews here! A large group of us went to see it, and afterwards, all were positively breathless and exhausted from the non-stop intensity of the film. It moved several of us to tears and we all agreed it could be an award winner! The actors, including Dev Patel, Anupam Kher, Nazanin Boniadi, Jason Issacs, Armie Hammer were excellent. There was not one moment that didn't have all riveted, both by the pathos of the individual stories as well as the excellent and effective direction of action sequences! Though not Indian, I am still well-acquainted with the fact that many films and documentaries have been made on this subject and have seen many of them. This one holds its own!
Also, having stayed in Taj properties allows one to agree that ""Guest is God"" is indeed the supreme mantra there. The true fact that over half of those who were there at Taj Palace at during the horrific attack were real-life employee heroes who stayed to help guests is a story well-worth repetition. It's also is a testament not only to the sincerity of that maxim, but to courage and determination often present in much of Indian culture in general-fierce even when pitted against insurmountable odds. Highly recommend this film, particularly for westerners new to the story.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"To understand the devil, you have to look into his eyes","There are few movies that have moved me as much as Hotel Mumbai. Based upon true events, it shows how Pakistani Islamist terrorists attack numerous locations in the Indian metropolis of Mumbai. The showdown takes places in the prestigious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel where personnel and guests fight for survival.The film offers a short and concise introduction that gives us an idea how the terrorists proceed to attack as many places as possible to assassinate as many victims as they could. We are also introduced to numerous characters that will end up in the hotel from a rich family over escaping backpackers to a dedicated server from a poor neighbourhood. The events in the hotel start taking place about thirty minutes into the film and the following ninety minutes are filled with incredible tension, brutal acts of violence and an oppressive atmosphere of despair. The film only slows down in the final few minutes that offer a brief tearjerking conclusion. Once the credits roll, the audience will be shook and speechless.This movie is a statement against terror by showing how incredibly devastating such acts are. In its intensity, it reminds of Roman Polanski's The Pianist which portrays the horrors of the Holocaust best. Hotel Mumbai is so brutal, intense and thrilling that it shouldn't be watched by children or teenagers but only by adults with a very strong stomach. Despite the obvious violence, the movie is equally emotional and intellectual. The audience empathizes with the desperate victims. The conclusion leads us to think that no other species in the world does as much harm to its own kind than human beings do to one another. The only way to stop such horrible actions is through peaceful education. Ironically, this honest movie contributes to such peaceful education by exposing such sickening degrees of violence.

Extremely violent, but considering it's based on a true event, it's understandable and was within expectations.

They managed the cinematography to avoid ""direct gore"", but rather show it as ""off camera"" horror that didn't need to be seen in its worse way.

Real and terrible: A modern parable of international mayhem.,"""The guest is God,"" motto of the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai.Based on a series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, Hotel Mumbai captures the siege of a city besieged by gunmen doing an efficient job of killing at least 100 people and shutting down a modern metropolis. The focus is on the fabulous Taj Mahal Hotel, a fitting symbol of modern depravity for these four Pakistani Muslims bent on doing Allah's vengeance.Director Anthony Maras, along with other writer John Collee, give s personality to a few of the staff and guests: head chef Hemant Oberoi (Annpam Kher) is courage personified as he guides guests out of the mayhem; head waiter Arjun (Dev Patel) has the smarts and valor to do the same; rich American guest David (Armie Hammer) is fearless defending his family. Throughout, class distinctions between guests and staff are preserved, lending another level of accuracy.Beyond these notable participants are the other usual stereotypes such as the shady but redeemable Russian, the conscience-stricken terrorist, and the scared sister protecting David's baby. However, the use of real news footage on TVs keeps us grounded in the reality.While these formulaic victims are unavoidable in any disaster film, the filmmakers create tension by cutting between the terrorists randomly and coldly dispatching anyone in sight and the besieged hotel denizens. When David's baby cries in a closet, we fear the terrorists will hear. That's real tension, real terror.It's hard not to place ourselves in that situation and not empathize with the helpless victims and wonder what courage we would show.
Although the women too often cry and many men are cowardly, no way can you leave the theater and not be a little more aware of the vicissitudes of travel abroad and the marvel at your courageous fellow human beings.Here's a successful, scary thriller and cautionary tale: Danger is out there, no matter where you go.",,Anonymous,History

Rather to watchable in many ways,In terms of the film and general performances was all quite good and the pace was fine had I not known as we all do that this was based on real events I would probably have been quite enjoying the film to a larger extent. The violence and how it was carried out especially with the soundtrack at one point however made it feel rather trivial and glamourised to much for me at times. Often I felt like I was watching a Michael Bay film so much was the high pace and hollywoodised violence. Furthermore a few clearly added Hollywood moments further removed you from the realness of the events. I did not hate this film and do not feel this was intentional but feel it somewhat missed the tone that should have been intended. A film based on events such as this should leave you feeling sombre and horrified rather than that you are just watching a Friday night thriller.

"Flawed narrative but compelling from start to finish, with an array of well-written characters! [+66%]","What makes 'Hotel Mumbai' an engaging watch is the way (debut) director Anthony Maras has treated the rather sensitive subject - a real-life act of terrorism that sent shockwaves across the city of Mumbai a little over a decade ago. 'Hotel Mumbai' borrows inspiration from the documentary 'Surviving Mumbai' in its retelling of the ghastly terrorist attack that took place at various points in the city, most importantly, the Taj Hotel.Director (& co-writer) Maras and screenwriter John Collee have chosen a docu-drama style of storytelling for 'Hotel Mumbai'. It presents a host of characters that are either working at the hotel (Anupam Kher as Headchef Oberoi and Dev Patel as Arjun, a bearer), guests who have arrived at the hotel (Nazanin Boniadi and Armie Hammer as Zahra and David, respectively, in addition to Jason Isaacs' unlikable-at-first Vasili!), and some who take refuge at the hotel after the city is taken under siege by terrorists. The screenplay spends just about enough time to shed light on key characters before placing focus on the horrific events. It also bothers that the killings shown in the film are quite in-your-face (the exploitative nature of the theme is questionable) and every bullet fired from a terrorist's gun pierces through your cores.The main characters are reasonably nuanced (and humanized) at all times which make the proceedings compelling. In an unlikely situation of a terror attack where everyone, regardless of whichever societal strata one belongs to, can become a victim, the film builds this palpable tension in an effective manner. Also, there's a baby on the scene whose silence plays a key role while in-hiding and the probability of the toddler reuniting with his family keeps viewers constantly on their toes.That said, there are certain things that the film (purposefully) retains as cliches. For instance, families getting separated during the most unruly circumstances, religious/racial profiling creating rifts between surviving characters, egos at play between individuals, and many other plot devices appear rehashed from other thrillers. Editing work by the director himself and Peter McNulty ensure a crisp 2-hour run-time while the cinematography by Nick Remy Matthews lends the film a claustrophobic feel as the frames shuttle between hotel rooms, corridors, lifts, and emergency staircases for a good part.The film, however, makes a subtle mistake of not disclosing more details on the terrorists (the characters do engage in banter between themselves in addition to being supervised by 'Brother Bull' over the phone) even as footnotes during the end credits. Therefore, aside from the solid performances put in by Patel and Kher, it would feel less factual for an Indian viewer and more thrilling for other viewers. The director's intention here is to put viewers in the shoes of a victim or a survivor and feel affected by the goings-on. The film, without a doubt, delivers on that aspect. Having shot (partially) in real locations also helps to a great extent.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"No political drama, just the truth!","Hotel Mumbai is one of the finest movies I have watched in recent times which shows the real sequence of events in the scene of crime (scenes in this case). Its brutal, very dark and heart-wrenching, but its the truth. It is what us Indians faced 10 years ago. The ordeal of the people stuck in the attack and the trauma entire nation faced.The story tells about the courage and kindness people showed while facing this ghastly terrorist attack, however the story doesn't shy back from showing the loopholes in the security system and the darker shades of human nature.I am not sure what can I say about the actors because I didn't see any. All I saw were ordinary people who played their parts, be it the culprits or the victims. Everyone seemed to be perfectly placed in their roles and essayed their part with absolute honesty and perseverance.What I enjoyed the most about this movie was that there was no high end political drama driving the whole situation. The director talked about the real situation about how all hell broke loose, so the movie is deep in all aspects and doesn't shallow down at any part.Honestly, I had a tough time watching it because every bullet shot in the movie made my heart go out to my innocent people who suffered this insanity.

Gripping recounting of the Mumbai terror attacks and in the Taj Hotel,"One of my vivid memories in October 2008 watching the live news coverage of the Mumbai terror attack against the world-renown Taj Hotel was of a newsman saying that the Indian authorities were fighting a terrorist inside the hotel but the problem is that they didn't know how many terrorists were inside. This movie answers the question, more than one of course.
I'm suspicious of the many, low, one-star ratings posted on imdb which leads me to suspect a clandestine campaign to undermine the movie for opaque reasons. As a moviegoer from last night, I can definitely tell everyone that HOTEL MUMBAI had me sitting on the edge of my seat. Contrary to negative reviews, I didn't encounter any tedious, slow points in the movie. Everything was well paced if it didn't pertain to the actual terrorist attack itself. When the terrorists strike Mumbai and then the Taj Hotel, the movie moves into high gear and you're on a fast-moving amusement park ride which you cannot get off. You experience almost first hand the terror of the guests and hotel staff, many of which could not avoid their violent deaths, so sudden was it. It is a tale of survival against the odds and the ability to cope with such a life-and-death situation in which impromptu leaders have to be agreed upon and quick decisions have to be made that result in either survival, even if just for the time being or instant, violent death. There is no time for the movie to go into character development and that was not its purpose, but to give a quick snapshot of the lives of ordinary people, celebrities, the wealthy, and the hotel staff just trying to earn a decent living in an overcrowded, smog-choked, polluted Indian city with a long historical past. The movie, I believe does its best to avoid clichés while being forthright about how people would behave in such a life-and-death situation. You feel sympathy for the main character, an experienced, polished Sikh waiter played by Dev Patel, a man living in the many overcrowded Mumbai slums with his wife and infant son, doing his best to eke out a living, lucky to have a good job as a high-end waiter in a five-star Mumbai hotel, thinking only of his wife and child all the time. The movie even makes you feel sympathetic for the wealthy British Iranian woman, Zahra, who is initially presented as a stereotype spoiled, rich diva, who gets her bath water temperature measured precisely at 48 degrees by hotel staff but we quickly learn is a nice diva, not a nasty one. She married out of love for a tall, blonde, blue-eyed American architect, David, obviously below her social station and her love is deep and true as will be her tragedy.
So I write, disregard the suspicious naysayers with one-star ratings and short reviews that are one sentence or less. See the movie for yourself. I go to movies for the entertainment, not to be bedazzled by some, deep-thought, existential, cosmic Hollywood wannabe that critics feel obliged to rate highly. If I walk out the theater feeling entertained, then the movie succeeded. A movie can succeed in its intent to disturb and HOTEL MUMBAI will no doubt leave you disturbed by the violence and malevolence of its portrayed, heartless terrorist killers, that were accurately described by one reviewer as, being like the android terminators of Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Too Real To Be Entertaining,"Well made but ultimately disappointing because it defies the expectations for this kind of movie. John McClane never shows up, and we aren't even given the kind of desperate, suicidal resistance of the passengers in United 93. Instead, the characters with which the American audience identifies -- which is to say the rich, mostly Western, mostly white ones -- behave all too much like real life. They sneak about in fear and confusion, and when caught by the frighteningly well supplied murderers, they are either killed outright or herded about passively at gunpoint. The only act of defiance by one is late and futile. The guests who survive do so mostly by chance or by slipping out the back way pointed out by the Indian staff.The movie does make the young murderers seem human without ""humanizing"" them. Through the cell phone voice of their commander safe in Pakistan, we are never in any doubt that they are driven by seething resentment and have been thoroughly taught to see all non-Muslims as subhumans to be killed without remorse. Nonetheless, small bits of business show them to be all too believable young men rather than robots. One plays a practical joke on his partner involving room service food. Another is such a puritan that, despite his commander's orders, he can't bring himself to put his hand inside the bra of a woman he has murdered in order to retrieve her identity papers. A third calls his family on the cell phone -- they are proud of what he is doing, he is concerned that they haven't yet been paid the money they were promised for him doing it. We are reminded that they are all too human.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"At times hard to watch, Hotel Mumbai reminds us of the dark times we live in, but also humanity's innate ability to prevail.","""26/11"" is a date many people will never forget; perhaps as many as a billion people. It's the day terror struck the heart of India through separate but coordinated attacks across various parts of the Mumbai metropolis. Even now, a decade later, the very mention of that tragic event can open wounds that have barely healed. Debut feature director Antony Maras knows and respects this, which is why Hotel Mumbai is not only a gripping thriller based on those events, but also one with an unusual perspective.Maras also knows that as a docudrama, re-enactment of that terrible day can hardly pass for popcorn entertainment. Having co-written the script based on interviews with eye witnesses and news reporters, Maras also avoids offering any political commentary other than what is already known. As such, we know very little about the ten young men who infiltrate the Mumbai slums on nothing but a rubber dinghy. The film doesn't even say where they have come from except for implied clues in their Punjabi accents and extremist ideologies. What is certainly clear are their instructions to inflict maximum carnage for the whole world to see. And so it begins - civilians from the Chhatrapati Shivaji railway terminal to the popular Leopold Café, and ultimately the Taj Palace Hotel are gunned down mercilessly by perpetrators armed to the teeth. In nail-biting detail, the film goes to great lengths to depict the fate of those victims - panic, terror, and massacre - in that order. Editing teams have also done a bang on job in seamlessly blending the film's dramatized events with real news footage. There is also restraint applied in not going over the top with what could have been gruesome but exploitative violence.And yet, Hotel Mumbai is far from perfect. In reality, over 170 people lost their lives in twelve separate attacks over a period of three days. In the film, the bulk of the narrative centers on four assailants who terrorize guests and employees of The Taj Palace. The perspective shifts from them receiving cellular instructions from a voice referred to as ""The Bull,"" to the opulence of the famed hotel, followed by its systematic destruction from within. Opposite these four terrorists are a few key people handpicked to either survive or perish - Dev Patel as an eager young waiter and father, Anupam Kher as daring head chef Hemant Oberoi, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi as newlywed hotel guests and Jason Isaacs as a Russian businessman, among few others. With the only interjections being brief TV footage of other areas under attack (including a shot segment showing terrorist Ajmal Kasab detained in hospital following his capture), you start to wonder why the narrative doesn't shift from the hotel to the remaining ten or eleven other places hit. This is followed by absurd and misplaced humour depicting these terrorists as fresh off the boat (no pun intended) and naïve to modern amenities of civilisation - a stark contrast to their otherwise unsympathetic and deadly composure.Hotel Mumbai doesn't raise the bar if perceived as an action thriller (especially for a global audience). To be fair, I doubt this film was intended as such. But if the film is intended to showcase an outburst of humanity, resilience to persecution, unimaginable selflessness, and the miraculous will to survive, then Maras, along with the cast and crew, have crafted a heart wrenching film that will become a crowd-pleaser, albeit unintentionally. And adding to its merit, there isn't a single character that can be defined as either a hero or a villain. Patel himself is back to his career roots, but is masked out (along with Hammer) in all the ensuing chaos, that there isn't an actual lead character. But as the title suggests, Mumbai's sons and daughters were slaughtered along with foreign visitors. The fact that the siege culminated at the Taj Palace Hotel is of no consequence given the diabolical nature of pure hatred. The film gets this right without being too on the nose. And then some. In the wake of recent and similar atrocities in Christchurch, New Zealand, the horror and the realism in the act of snuffing out innocent lives can be hard to watch. It's a reminder of the dark times we live in, but also that we prevail because we are human.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Oscar Worthy,"Electrifying Film !! The incredible true story of the deadly terrorist attack at Hotel in 2008 starring Dev Patel .

Disappointing,"The hotel is introduced with the arrival of a recently married couple, their baby and a sister/friend. The couple is downstairs eating dinner when the terrorist enter the building.The movie turns bad after this point. The movie focuses on these characters mainly but they are bland and you don't feel for them. The movie is too slow paced, nothing really happens till halfway through. The pace would not be an issue if the writer gave at least some attention to the character development.. There are some meaningless filler scenes.The best performance and most compelling character is definetely played by Dev Patel and he saves the movie for what it is.The movies has to compensate with alot of graphic killing. If you are sensitive to this kind of action, the movie is way more of a thrilling ride. If you can see through the violence, the movie is not good.",6.0,Anonymous,History
When is it too soon to exploit a recent tragedy?,"Throughout my life I've always been bothered by films--particularly fictional--that use historical events, like the Holocaust--to prop up an entertainment and not earning or giving the respect due to living survivors. ""Hotel Mumbai"" is a good demonstration of why it bothers me. The incident has been the subject of many documentaries that keep their distance from exploiting the sensationalism of seeing innocent people slaughtered in a mass murder. This film jumps right into the horror of the situation and never looks away at the terror and mayhem.It's a combination of the 1970's disaster films like ""Towering Inferno"" gathering an all star cast in the ""Grand Hotel"" model, and then setting it aflame and blowing it up, all the while murdering people nonstop between the more traditional disaster film explosions.Even if you can resolve the moral dilemma this raises for the viewer: Getting a thrill at the cost of reconstructing a live terrorist attack, we're both invited to marvel at the luxury of one of the most famous hotel in the World and then have to witness the guests and staff summarily slaughtered. I'm not an opponent of explicit screen violence. I do mind watching ""what it was like"" for the victims of this massacre for no other reason than being a voyeur..There's an attempt to weave a narrative thread that intersect or ""hook"" us emotionally into identifying with certain members of the cast. But it all unfolds so quickly we don't time to really gain an attachment to the ""characters"" we're given. The film wastes no time into getting down to what we're there to see, tacking on the devotion of the staff to their rich clientele, in a self-sacrificing manner that raises the point the terrorists are there to make. It's a very mixed bag of compromised values and motives that in there repetition give the viewer time to ask why you bought a ticket and is this something that is edifying or exploitive.The filmmaking itself is mainly set in a soundstage in what we know is actually a famous spatial paradise that the soundstage can't recreate. So we feel boxed in and claustrophobic, but we also can't ever get our bearings on where we are or what's happening where. The use of the actual dialogue between the terrorists and there handlers is chilling. And raises, unintentional sympathy for the perpetrators because they're brain-washed and naïve, being promised payments to their impoverished families for their self-sacrifice. If this was done purposefully, I question whether or not the survivors from the incident would find much solace.Despite the effort to make this a ""nail-biting thriller,"" anyone even cursory familiar with the incident knows the outcome, and due to the repetitiousness of the killing, my interest flagged several times and I found myself looking at my watch. I suppose I was waiting for the filmmakers to give us a reason they did this project other than to market a recent, actual tragedy and turn it into an action movie.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Surprisingly Fabulous!,"Was worried this would be a bloody/gory typical action pic, but was immediately struck by the early scenes with visual storytelling & cinematography to set up the disparity between the horrific urban slums & over-the-top wealth.

The characters are really well written and easy to become invested in, making it all the more devastating when something happens to them.

And those who are innocent they were killed. Here I am not talking about why the women's life is forgiven, here I am talking about those insane , heartless, devils 😈 terrorist.
I believe that India at time is the weakest country, because our the military arrived after 12 hours and this is insane.

A real-life thriller,"Based on true events: in November, 2008, ten young jihadist terrorists from Pakistan went on a murderous rampage in Mumbai, India, killing over 160 people. A fictionalized account of the events is re-enacted focusing on the terror inflicted on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. (""Hotel Mumbai"" is an Australian/Indian/USA co-production.)The film begins well setting up the audience as it introduces various members of staff and guests and their personal lives. One staff member is Arjun (Dev Patel) who has a happy family life even though he, his pregnant wife, and young daughter live in a home whose limits make it lightyears away from the luxurious hotel where Arjun works. In getting to know the various characters, the viewer is later left wondering who will survive and who will not.The directing (by Anthony Maras) and the editing (by Maras and Peter McNulty) contribute to a superb thriller which is all the more powerful as it is based on a true story. Some situations increase the tension including the fact that the Mumbai police department was never equipped for such a catastrophe. Similarly, the dialogues between the young terrorists and their leader mastermind are a shocking example of what happens when evil is bred with ignorance. At times, the battle of ideology creates a conflict in deciding who is killed and who is not - adding even more tension to the climax.The many fine performances also make a solid contribution. Among the standouts is Anupam Kher as the hotel's main chef. His controlling, persnickety attitude is amusing in the beginning while it is later used to great effect in the more dramatic elements of the narrative.A moving finale is the perfect conclusion to this stunning thriller. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,History

Armie Hammer, Dev Patel, Jason Isaacs and the entire cast are absolutely perfect as guests and staff at elegant Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai. The actress who portrays Armie's wife, and the actor who portrays the chef who saves many guests are superb.
The movie is violent, and graphic in it's depiction of the horrors of the terrorist attack. The director deftly cuts between hotel guest characters and what is happening to them and the young terrorists who believe in the jihad they are on while being directed every step of the way by a never seen ""Brother Bull"" leader to kill all.

Hotel Mumbai (2019),"For some reason, the tragic events that occurred in Mumbai in 2008 is something I can't recall ever hearing of. I was a stupid 18 year old college kid at the time and had no knowledge on world news. I was semi interested in seeing this just because I am kind of a film junkie and go out and watch releases just because. I thought this film was surprisingly great. Its really tough to watch at times and will incite an angry and somber reaction at times but there's no denying the effect that this film leaves on you.The film is about the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, namely on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. The film follows a group of attendants and customers in the hotel and their struggle for survival as they are attacked by a terrorist party. The events at the hotel coincide with 12 coordinated attacks in the city. They must find a way to endure while special forces arrive to Mumbai as they are 100s of miles away. The film stars Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, Jason Isaacs, and Nazanin Boniadi.The film does such a good job of eliciting a reaction in you. Weather its grief, anger, confusion, or uncomfortably; the film draws you in from the very beginning. Its not an easy watch at all, innocent people get murdered and its an absolute shame to think that people can actually go and do this in real life. It made me so angry. You really start feeling for the characters and root for them and want to see the perpetrators suffer the absolute worst. The film is unflinching, and the editing and sound of the film will make you feel like yo are right in the mix of the events.Hotel Mumbai is not going to be for the people with a weak stomach but if you are a film lover who wants to see a good film based on true events, you should see this. Trust me, I can easily watch almost anything in a film and rarely feel like its a tough watch but I felt it here. I think its just important to be aware of things that have occurred that we want to turn away from, its how we learn to grow better and see what the evil in this world is capable of.

Hotel Mumbai is incinerating from start to end. You must know so many movies lead the viewer to the edge of a pit, leave the viewer there and then resolves the tension with the movie ending soon after. This film, however, leads the viewer to virtually innumerable pits from beginning to end; the stress is never relinquished.My dear wife tolerated this film; it is not precisely a ""chick flic"" and she endured it only because we were together. She disliked it for all the reasons I enumerated above. Diane thought that it was too violent-actually nonstop with very few quiet points in between.Regardless of these two very divergent opinions of Hotel Mumbai, I think it is well worth seeing.

This movie is like to show us the reality of this world is not safe at all. We are under terror in any way, it could be technology or cyber or conventional war. Somebody or any group out there are still planning their actions to any countries. It could be your country, it could be my country. Such horrible thing. In this movie Hotel Mumbai, first of all I want to thank the ideas coming from the writers (John Collee&Anthony Maras). In the film making of course we could thank the Director Anthony Maras and all the actors involved. They really act like real people in that tragedy. To relive and to remake the hard moment of 10 years ago, it needs a lot of hard work, many properties, preparations, and of course deep understanding about the actual event. This movie bring back us to tense and real terrorism action that happened in Hotel Mumbai November 2008. Never forget the victims and their families. In deep respect for this film-making effort, I suggest all film festivals this year to do screening of this movie, because this movie is part to remember the efforts of good and kind-hearted staff, police officers, special forces, and all men who tried their best to help other people around them, especially women, children, old people, disable people, etc. The plot and scenes are so natural that could make the audience to close our eyes, scream, or curse several critical moments. This is not children movie, but if they are getting bigger, they must watch this movie to know from victim's perspective on that event. We could see that the hostages and staffs, they were really united under Humanity.

"Heartbreaking movie, watch with patience","As the name suggest and as can be seen in the trailer the movie depicts the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, however the movie revolves only around the shooting which took place in Taj Hotel.I have watched couple of movies which are based on the same event. Hotel Mumbai is different from all of them because it is circumstantial. Although the plot is unsurprising, the direction keeps the audience engage. Taj was under attack for about 9 hours in real time and the movie length is about 2 hours so, be prepared for continuous gun shooting and people dying.The actors both American and Indian have done a remarkable job. The lead actor, Dev Patel has emerged to be a fine actor, who demonstrates how presence of mind can help you save your life.

The film captures the horrors of 26/11 with unflinching brutality however a few characters it opts to foreground is rather problematic.Touted as a true story of humanity & heroism, Hotel Mumbai recounts the siege of the famed Taj Hotel by a group of terrorists in Mumbai, India that occurred on 26 November 2008. The plot focuses on the staff members who perform above & beyond the call of duty by making unthinkable sacrifices to keep their guests safe until help arrives, and also concerns a desperate couple who take grave measures to protect their newborn child.Co-written & directed by Anthony Maras in what's his directorial debut, it's a good start to his filmmaking journey as the film retains its tense atmosphere from start to finish, and is a competently crafted thriller. But his inexperience is also why the graphic violence seems excessive & repetitive as if existing only for shock value, in addition to his struggle with what characters to keep at the forefront, for so many of them & their subplots were unnecessary.The first act is where Hotel Mumbai is at its best & most effective. The production design team's recreation of the interior of Taj Palace is impressive to say the least. Editing only worsens as plot progresses. Pacing also falters in the middle portion. Performances from most are serviceable at best, with Dev Patel delivering better input than the rest. And also worthy of mention is the background score that ably heightens the film's grim mood & foreboding aura with its brooding tracks.On an overall scale, Hotel Mumbai does get a few things right, and is a well-made example of its genre but for those who witnessed this horrifying tragedy from up close, it is only going to open old wounds. It never for once feels like a tribute to the staff who risked their own lives to protect their guests and unfolds more like a fictional thriller with heavy body counts made purely for entertainment purposes which still would've been fine if it was by all means fictional. But it's not. I can see why some may love it but I'm definitely not one of them.",,Anonymous,History
"Excelent recreation of what happened there, good film well made","I was hosted 200 meters from the Taj that night, the narrative is so realistic, I recreated the events watching the film. Nevertheless the other hotels also attacked are not present at all, although I understand the story focuses on the Taj, the film would have been even better. Mumbai was under siege that day, streets closed by the army, nobody in the streets, persons or vehicles, all these are not present or even insinuated in the film. Although I miss how the terrorist avoided shooting muslins asking them to pray to confirm.I really enjoyed watching it either way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
No Escape meets United 93,"Yes, the first thing I thought about is Paul Greengrass' UNITED 93, about 9/11 events and the flight attack against White House, a movie showing the terrorists side as well as the hostages one. Interesting point of view. And that feature also reminds me the atmosphere and screenplay structure of another film: NO ESCAPE, back in 2015. Not the same story though, but similar on many points. Yes, this movie I am talking about now, is not flawless but much interesting and I don't understand why so many reviews are against it. there were other movies speaking of this tragedy.

A Tragic Film Which Explores A Lot Of Subjects,"Most of the movies based on a terrorist attack either have the pov of the terrorists or from the Security force but this film uniquely narrates it from the view point of the brave Taj Hotel staff who sacrificed their life for the guests. A nice debut from Australian director Anthony Maras who has done a better job at depicting this tragedy than all Indian ones.While most movies don't show the backlash of a terrorist attack, Hotel Mumbai does a great job of showing how Islamophobia is rampant even in the midst of an attack. The scene where a Sikh staff played by Academy Award nominee Dev Patel confronts a woman who fears him was really touching and well shot. The performances of the rest of the cast is very good with Nazanin Boniadi being the film's true star.Maras also explores foreign policy and imperialism of super powers in this film, and how radical organisations exploit it for their own benefits. Though this movie may seem as a tribute to Taj Hotel staff and Indians, its a must watch for all of us too in the current climate.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Resists many of the problems films like this have,"I was really taken aback by how good this film is. Films dealing with terrorism are often little more than propaganda pieces that are designed to inflame the passions. A lot of films released after 9/11 treat Muslims at best as boogeymen, sometimes with incomprehensible motivations. This film does what it can within the time frame of the attacks to avoid doing that. You spend a great deal of time with the same group of attackers. Each is shown to have a different motivation. Critically, some are shown to be more interested in economic reasons for the attacks, some are more devout, some are attackers are there due their family. This extends all the way to the ring leader coming across as cynically using Islam to further his ends. The resulting picture of the group is a collection of human beings who did a terrible thing. They are not monsters, just terrible human beings.Films like this also have a nasty habit of inserting a white guy to be the savoir. The film does follow one group of Americans but thankfully the white guy isn't anymore of a hero than anyone else. Indeed the film resist lionizing anyone. The man who saved the most people is, before the attacks, the largest jerk in the film. Some of the survivors are shown to be bigots; there is a really interesting scene about a white woman trying to be comforted by having a Sikh offer to remove his turban. Really the script making the characters human beings is the film's best feature.This is not to say that the film lacks other merits. The technical direction is quite good and the film effortlessly builds tension. The geography and the logistic of the attacks were easy to understand. Best of all the director shows restraint and does not always go for the shot with the most blood in it. Yet he also shows enough violence to drive home the brutality of the attacks. Like the script the film's direction is finely balanced.The acting is quite good. I didn't realize Armie Hammer was in the film until the credits. Patel gives a very good performance in this film and his character is the emotional heart of the story. I was just impressed with how everything came together.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Emotional, thrilling and a reminder of the terrible events","I loved watching this film. It definitely made an impact on me. The events themselves are a tragedy, with an exercise in hatred and this movie portrays that extremely well. It is grounded in reality and the movie dramatically portrays the events. It is sometimes hard to watch.
But, this movie does manage more than drama - it manages to make you care for the characters and is indeed thrilling to watch. The way people try to stay alive, the many new challenges they come across and the evolving situation in hotel, all create an interest in how the events will play out and who will make it out alive.
The only negative trait I noticed is that some actions of characters come across as very stupid. But, the movie does a good job of portraying events and such stupid decisions by characters are within the realm of realism (such as being made out of panic, or irrational thought), so I can forgive this in the movie.
Also, I really felt interested in some of the characters. I ended up wanting them to stay alive, rather than simply waiting to see their fate, as sometimes happens for me with historic dramas. Indeed, this movie transcends being a drama and manages to be thrilling.
I think the movie is an excellent, realistic, dramatized depiction of the events and is definitely worth watching! It is not boring at any point, like some dramas end up being. Go ahead and watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,History

Solid and unemotional retelling of a true life horror story. Well judged and well made.,"This Sky Original movie simultaneously released in theatres and on Sky and we watched it on its opening night, free from either having read reviews or expectations.To be honest, the real life incident that spawned the movie had actually faded in my memory so common, now, are such mass-murder terrorist events.That didn't really matter though, because whether or not one is familiar with this event, there are plenty others that it might have been.It's an ensemble cast production with stand-out, but un-showy, performances from Armie Hammer, Dev Patel and the head chef, played beautifully by Rohan Mirchandaney - all are trapped in the high class Taj Hotel in Mumbai as it is laid siege to by a group of Islamic terrorists acting under instruction from an off-screen telephone dictator known only as ""The Bull"".Whilst the terrorists enjoy a fair amount of screen time, it's their prey that the movie, rightly, focusses on rather than glorify the terrorists' actions.It's utterly chilling, pretty much from start to finish. The head count of close-range and strafing machine-gun deaths is colossal, brutal and completely emotionless. Indeed the film strangely fails to emotionally engage; rather it leaves you horror-struck at the ability of a less than elite bunch of assassins to wreak havoc, with little or no police/military intervention for many hours, making their killings become almost sporting-hunt-like.The story is peppered with crescendos of killing and then quieter periods where the prey take stock of their situation and gradually formulate plans for their escape.It's cat and mouse throughout and gripping in its intensity.I very much doubt this will trouble major awards juries, but as a piece of thought-provoking 'entertainment' it does its job without resorting to cliche, heavy emotional bribery or OTT special effects.A good job, well done.",7.0,Anonymous,History

In today's world this could happen anywhere anyday-,"My Review- Hotel Mumbai.Another terrific collaboration from The South Australian Film Corporation Screen Australia the Indian and U.S.A Distribution. Company's .Their previous great success was Lion,which also starred Dev Patel and 30 cast and crew from Lion also worked on Hotel Mumbai.The quality of this production is obvious in every frame and the interior shots of Hotel Mumbai are all filmed in the studio in Adelaide and are lavish ,outdoor locations were filmed in Mumbai and Maharashtra India.Based on the terrible terrorist attacks by Islamic terrorist organisation based in Pakistan which took place in Mumbai in November 2008 where 12 separate attacks took place in the city resulting in at least 174 civilian deaths .Most of the action involves the siege at the Hotel Mumbai and is so realistic it's frightening and very disturbing at times to watch The entire ensemble cast of fine actors give such convincing performances that you feel you have witnessed an accurate account of the terror and total disregard these monsters had for human life.
Stand out performances by Dev Patel again ,cast as Arjun a Hotel Porter ,who just sets off for a normal day at work and is catapulted into a nightmare ,it made me think of the hero of The Martin Place siege Tori Johnson,who did exactly the same thing and never returned home in December 2014.Dev Patel has developed in to a fine actor since his debut in Slumdog Millionaire ,which was made in 2008 when this film is set.
Also impressive performances by Zanin Boniadi as Zahra and Armie Hammer as David her husband involved in the fight of their lives to try and escape with their baby. As mentioned the whole cast is top rate especially Anupam Khmer as Oberoi the Hotel concierge,who try's to maintain calm and the film shows the truth that the heroes of this shocking siege were the Taj Hotel courageous staff.This film is the first full feature movie for Adelaide born Producer Director and co writer of Hotel Mumbai ,Anthony Maras and I hope if this film is any indication of his talents that there will be many more to follow.Go see this movie it's certainly not The Marigold Hotel and it's confronting at times but full of Action ,great script and Production.I felt entertained ,informed and now more knowledgeable of events today in a very scary world,where no one can take anything for granted and in a world ,where we turn on the news to hear of similar atrocities and have become almost immune to the human suffering that these cowards and madmen inflict on human kind for a misguided sense of Religious Superiority.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"At its core, Hotel Mumbai is a celebration of human resilience and courage in the face of overwhelming evil","On the 26th November 2008, a group of young men armed with explosives and AK-47s stormed the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, the result of a terror spree sweeping across key locations in Mumbai. With instructions being fed to them through an earpiece, the amateur terrorists succeeded in laying siege to the hotel, spreading a trail of chaos and destruction across each floor, in a tragedy that remains seared in the minds of all those who survived.In capturing the intensity of the siege, director Anthony Maras effectively splits the film's focus between the staff and guests of the hotel in their fight to survive and the role of the perpetrators in co-ordinating the attacks. With the Mumbai police forces completely unprepared for an attack of this magnitude, the reign of terror lasted three days and the film is relentless in its display of gratuitous violence. Near the beginning, bullets scatter across a packed lobby as bodies drop like flies and the attackers continue their march to the upper floors where, room by room, they shoot unsuspecting guests. Thirty-one individuals lost their lives during the chaos and by not shying away from the ugliness of the act, Maras paints an unnerving picture of the callous disregard the terrorist showed their victims.However, the film's perpetual forward momentum means that the violence slowly becomes desensitising and at times teeters on the edge of exploitative Hollywood action territory. The film uses a fair amount of dramatic license to keep events thrilling and sometimes it seems to paint a real-life event in very broad action strokes. Luckily, any detour into action hero territory is quickly dispelled by a screenplay that presents heroes in all shapes and forms.Indeed, what stands apart, is the strength of the character portraits that emerge amongst the violence. Dev Patel and Anupam Ker play hotel employees who stand by their colleagues and guests at all costs, while Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi play a married couple who risk it all to protect their child. While the characters may be fictional, it's not hard to imagine numerous stories just like theirs having occurred in real life. Moreover, by interspersing their stories with first hand news footage of the siege, Maras injects an extra element of realism that convincingly ties the film together.At its core, Hotel Mumbai is a celebration of human resilience and courage in the face of overwhelming evil. By focusing on the humanity amongst the carnage, Hotel Mumbai honours all those who risked, and lost, their lives in the attack.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Suspenseful and intense thriller.,"Hotel Mumbai (3.5 out of 5 stars).Hotel Mumbai is a suspenseful thriller that adapts the true events of the Mumbai attack in 2008 and the people in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. It can be a very tough film to watch with the realistic shootouts. Especially, the film being a true story and there are many horrible shootouts and tragedy events that can make this film scary to watch. The film does a great job in having an intense and fast paced direction. Putting the audience at the edge of their seat throughout the movie.The plot follows the victims that went through the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India. When there was a group of young terrorists who were designated to several locations in India and following orders from some unknown guy who has been preaching their religious belief and delivering a message to the world by causing such a horrible tragedy event. Arjun (Dev Patel) is a young adult and a waiter at the restaurant in the hotel. David (Armie Hammer) and Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi) is a married couple who are visiting the country and staying at the hotel with their newborn baby. Vasili (Jason Isaac) is a high class VIP guest at the hotel. When the terrorists attack around the city. And several terrorists are on a shooting spree in the hotel. The survivors band together to avoid the attacks and trying to survive the night.I did feel like the plot is just the retelling of the events of 2008 Mumbai attacks with several characters trying to save their families and trying to escape. The characters being real life people. The script did feel a little uninspired to develop the characters in the film. You have a high-class couple David and Zahra. David feeling a little out of place with living the high class lifestyle. David will do whatever takes to make sure his family stays safe. Even with their nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham-Hervey). When an intense scene with the terrorists going room to room and she is trying to hide in the closet with the baby. And her trying to cover the baby's mouth to stop him from crying. It gets suspenseful and it does not stop from there.The film picks up the pace real quick. Seeing people and tourists in a restaurant. And their terrified reaction. When they see a grenade drop in the floor randomly. And the chaos that goes on from there. When the victims are stranded in the hotel with no support from the police and waiting for the Special Forces to help out.One thing I did have issues with the film. There are like six to nine terrorists in a big hotel. And plenty of people who are hiding. And avoiding them. A few strong victims who are capable of fighting back. But no one grabbed any kind of weapon to fight back.Overall, Hotel Mumbai is a pretty fair film. The direction is intense and suspenseful. The horrible tragedy is a tough one to see. The cast did great with what they can with their characters like Armie Hammer, Dev Patel, Nazanin Boniadi, Anupam Kher, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, and Jason Isaacs. The film may have some weak developed characters and poor choices with the actions on the characters. It is definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"An intense, unrelenting look at this cowardly act of pure evil and the selfless heroism of those who tried to help","Hotel Mumbai is a crime thriller film based on the Mumbai terrorist attacks of 2008. Starring Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, and Jason Isaacs, it is an intense, unrelenting look at this cowardly act of pure evil and the selfless heroism of those who tried to help.In late November 2008, a group of ten terrorists arrive in Mumbai, India by a small boat. Upon splitting up, the terrorists travel to various locations around the populated city to massacre as many innocent people as they can. After taking out several civilians in smaller locations, the surviving members of the group meet up at the luxurious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel to finish their act of terror. While they shoot their way through the hallways, the hotel's staff put their lives in the line of fire in an attempt to save as many guests as possible.As unflinching as it is jarring, Hotel Mumbai is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that successfully showcases the heroism of the titular hotel's brave staff members in an earnest, collected manner. Despite the film's two hour runtime, not once is it ever boring thanks to the creative direction of Anthony Maras, who puts his audience right at the forefront of the conflict. The film's violence, while not too graphic, is extremely intense as no one is spared from the terrorist's gunfire, not even small children or the elderly. If one can stomach enough of the bloodshed to appreciate this otherwise well-made movie, then it is certainly worth at least one viewing. However, being that this is not for the faint of heart, viewer discretion is strongly advisedI rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not White House Down,"And maybe that's a good thing. Hotel Mumbai is not an over the top action movie in which one man single-handedly takes down the terrorists with gusto and a pack of gum. But, it is full of drama, tension, heroics, and tragic moments. It is real life.Not every character is based on a real one, but they are all inspired by actual footage, interviews and calls of real staff and guests trapped during this 4-day siege. And it's the reality of it all that makes it so dramatic. That and the senselessness of the terrorists.There will be moments when you second-guess a character's decision. Should they make a run for it? Should they fight back? There is no right decision. Each one comes with a risk. And that's what I like about the film. It doesn't put a Hollywood gloss over everything. Even the cops on scene struggle with their decisions. That said, I do wish they would have shown more examples of individual heroism (baking pans as protective vests, lowering people to safety, etc.).

Shockingly True,"Hotel Mumbai Review:Hotel Mumbai is based on the true story of the Taj Hotel terrorist attack in Mumbai. Hotel staff risk their lives to keep everyone safe as people make unthinkable sacrifices to protect themselves and their families. I didn't know much about this film. I saw the trailer once in February but didn't think much of it since I figured it wouldn't come to our area. Once it came to a nearby theater I decided I should see it having not much of an idea of what it was about. I thought this was a very suspenseful and great true story film. Some true story films are made with no reason for me to care as much as I should for other events. For example (and this will spark some controversy that I don't want to hear) the movie Unplanned isn't necessary to me even though it's a true story (I might go see that movie just to see if it's as bad as everyone is saying it is). The plot as a whole was amazing yet shocking that these events happened, and they were pretty recent (2008) and this is the first time I heard about it. I don't think there was a single bad performance in this film. The standouts for me were Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, and Tilda Cobham-Hervey. The scenes with Tilda were the most stress enduring for me, some parts even putting tears in my eyes. There are two people in it that if you think over the whole thing didn't have much of a purpose showing their story. It wasn't a bad decision but there wasn't a purpose effecting the story as a whole. This is Anthony Maras's first major film as a director and I hope he continues to do work with such films like these. The score composed by Volker Bertelmann (nominated for his score for the amazing film Lion) was good and captured the mood. The cinematography was fine but a little too shaky at times, especially the beginning. Also the editing at the beginning was odd to me. It kept switching abruptly changing the tones which I know was intentional for one of the scenes but it kind of bugged me when it wasn't really intentional. Another problem I had was though we got scenes with the antagonists I didn't quite catch what their motivation was to commit such an awful attack. I think it would benefit if it was a little clearer. Overall I would recommend this film. It's intense, shocking, and emotional. This is a relevant film and one of the best of the year so far. Definitely see Hotel Mumbai.My Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,History

Good thriller with some flaws,"I really like the movie. I do not understand the haters. Maybe it is not strictly based on the facts,

Brutally Disturbing,"This is a dramatization of the horrific terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, in Mumbai in 2008, (one of 12 sites attacked on that day). In my opinion, there is way too much emphasis on the constant brutal cold blooded killings of innocent men and women throughout the movie, only occasionally relieved by the heroism of those living the nightmare inside the hotel.For those viewers that like constant close range mass indiscriminate slaughter and bloodshed then maybe this is your movie. But there's enough depressing events going on in the world on a daily basis, so I personally don't need 2 hours more of this.Overall, look for strong performances by Dev Patel, Jason Isaacs, and Anupam Kher but this film was far too disturbing for me.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Getting to relive a real-life ordeal,"This film manages to put the viewer in the thick of action during the attacks on Mumbai in November 2008. You follow the terrorists as they move from the harbor through the city and into the plush hotel, wreaking havoc wherever they go. In the hotel, you follow various guests and staff members as they try to hide and escape from the perpetrators. A truly compelling experience, like as if you are part of what is going on. The whole siege is well re-enacted and chillingly depicted with accuracy. By the end, you feel relief but also sadness over what had unfolded. The acting is uniformly superb. Dev Patel and Armie Hammer provide some star power, but everyone is impressive down to the bit parts.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Powerful and horrific,"I read a bunch of the reviews claiming the movie was boring and it almost made me not want to see it. But I am glad I decided to make up my own mind. This movie was definitely not boring. There was a lot of action but heartbreaking to watch. It was horrifying to realize this actually happen. The way these scumbags just innocently shot people, based on what their controller, safe and far away, told them to do, makes me nauseous.
Why do filmmakers make these films? Maybe to educate people about the story. It happened a decade ago and I forgot about the other targets until I saw the film. They interviewed 40 survivors before making the film. Not all the characters are real people, but they are based on parts of the real victims and heros. Learning that the head chef was real gives me hope about the good people in the world.
I hope India now has special forces stationed more around the country. I am sorry if this movie opens wounds for some. I visited the hotel and Cafe Leopold in 2012. I wish I knew more details of the attacks when I was there. Maybe this will educate and help some.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Gut-wrenching!,"#FinalVerdictHotel Mumbai shows us the terror we find in terrorism. One relives the emotions while watching the horrifying events unfold on-screen. That's precisely why it triumphs as a feature film. Thumbs up!Hotel Mumbai, based on the 2009 documentary Surviving Mumbai, is more or less a true story, with a gripping and gut-wrenching - at times, almost too gripping - screenplay by director Anthony Maras and John Collee, which leaves you stunned and traumatized. It is a ticktock of horrific violence, which began in Mumbai's main train station and shifted to the Taj. The movie grabs your attention from the inception itself. Each and every sequence that unfolds on-screen gives you goosebumps. It's chilling!Hotel Mumbai is an unsparing clockwork thriller, which depicts that the worst of tragedies can inspire the best in its victims. The callousness with which the terrorists operate is palpable and conveyed with a degree of verisimilitude that borders on sadism. Director Anthony Maras makes sure he doesn't skip a beat while narrating the vital episodes. Sure, the skeptics may argue, we have read and seen it all through various forms of communication, but what the director accumulates is beyond words. The film is skilfully made and co-writer/director Anthony Maras clearly wants to pay tribute to those who risked their lives to help others. One relives infuriation, distress, grief & helplessness while watching the dastardly events unfurl on-screen.That tension is the most problematic - and therefore interesting - thing about Hotel Mumbai. There's a quiet radicalism in making a movie that is, at its heart, all about people who sacrificed their lives in saving others. It makes you salute & respect them. Director Anthony Maras must have faced the challenge to reconstruct the events and replicate the gruesome acts on celluloid. Hotel Mumbai is one film where the real-life episodes take precedence. And I avow that the outcome is absolutely spellbinding.The screenwriting (Anthony Maras and John Collee), the dialogue, the cinematography (Nick Remy Matthews), the shootouts, the background score (Volker Bertelmann), the set (Scott Ashenden) and the edit (Peter McNulty) add credence to the enterprise that attempts to portray the carnage.Hotel Mumbai is a film that is completely performance driven because it's not a rescue thriller, it is subtly-crafted drama meant to celebrate hope and resilience. Special mention to the casting directors here - Ann Fay, Leigh Pickford and Trishaan.Anupam Kher delivers an exceptionally restraint and mature performance. DevPatel stands out completely. Nazanin Boniadi, Jason Isaacs, Armie Hammer and Tilda Cobham-Hervey translate the panic and agonising fear of those hours through their solid performances.On the whole, Hotel Mumbai is akin to watching the barbaric act in rawest form. It's a gripping, hauntingly unnerving and emotionally draining watch. It also reminds us of the extraordinary courage of the ordinary people. Do not miss it! Bravo!",6.0,Anonymous,History

A WELL MADE DRAMATIZATION OF TRAGIC EVENT !,"HOTEL MUMBAI REVIEW :-26/11/2008 is one of those horrible night for all Mumbaikars and the entire Nation when we saw cruel face of terrorism striking innocent souls. There were plenty of books on it and one film was also made in Bollywood. We all know the events, we all saw some real footage but most of us doesn't know what happened inside Taj Hotel that night. Hotel Mumbai by Anthony Maras focuses on all the incidents happened in Taj Hotel. Apart from cruel face of terrorism the film deals with the humanity and shows us how people supported each other while they were fighting for thier lives that night inside the hotel. Although the film is based on Documentary called ""Surviving Mumbai"", ofcourse there are some fictional changes to make it relatable and dramatic.On 26 November 2008, young waiter Arjun (Dev Patel) reports for work at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai, India, under head chef Hemant Oberoi (Anupam Kher), who reminds his staff that ""Guest is God"". The day's guests include British-Muslim heiress Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi) and her American husband David (Armie Hammer), with their infant son Cameron and his nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham) as well as ex-Spetznaz operative Vasili (Jason Isaacs). That night, 10 terrorists, directed by a man known as ""the Bull"", launch a coordinated assault against 12 locations across Mumbai, including the hotel. As the local police are not properly trained or equipped to handle the attack, they can only wait for special forces to arrive from New Delhi. How do all people fight for thier lives, thier struggle, thier pain, thier courage and lastly thier unity are the part of this beautiful script.When the script is strong, you know the screenplay and execution should not take it down, and that fear is well very handled here. Almost 130 minutes of the screenplay are engaging enough, doesn't matter if some scenes goes quite lose. Climax takes care of the content that we wanted to be in safe hands. The presentation of Breathtaking sequences, explosion, gun fires, blass is done in proper manners. Additionally, Background Score is terrific which takes those scenes little higher. Director Anthony Maras does what Indian director failed to do with the same content. His sensible mindset doesn't make Hotel Mumbai look like a forced drama or over the top bravery tale. He has given a realistic touch to the film and that works.It is hard to forget those screams and lost lives of that horrible night but Hotel Mumbai coming after a decade is a perfect showcase of that tragic event. It lacks some other events happened at Kama Hospital and Girgaon but we have atleast seen them or read about them somewhere, what we didn't know was brave decisions made Taj Hotel Staff members and the film brings them in spotlight. Overall, Hotel Mumbai is definitely a one time watch for it's brilliant writing, execution and direction. Mumbai's audience will connect with it quickly and we hope the entire nation also connects with it so Go for it...RATING- 6/10*",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Violent, Yes","Some would say there was too much violence, but my counter is that 165 died & 300 wounded in this attack on 12 places over three days and it would be a disservice to those affected to minimize it. Even so the director chose not to glamorize the shootings & killings, but showed a clean version relative to what was possible. The reality - some were tortured & disfigured.
After this 11/26/2008 attack the Taj Mahal Hotel was repaired & reopened to show that they would not be defeated by terrorism. Some terrorist leaders & helpers were found up to years later, but supposedly the prime leader is free. Again, history has shown us uncountable times that religion is the source of wars, conflicts, killings, subjugation, or as terrorists say, ""God is great.""Researched & filmed in Mumbai, India, and in Australia.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Not convincing at all,"Do not like the movie. It fails to tell the real story with reasons.The terrorists are driven by their belief or money? What is their plot and aim? Why the bombings are in such a sequence? Why they fail to destroy the hotel finally? Where is the hotel security personnel? Why the local police are so few and weak in such a major city? Why the military come so late?No one tries to fight back or defense in an organised way, even the American husband & the Russian tycoon (both are stereotyped as hero in the genre). Everyone just run and hide and being killed. It is no drama at all.The waiter is the lead actor, and he acts well and earns the 4 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Leaves you feeling hugely affected!,Had just arrived back from NZ when Christchurch happened. We had booked this movie a couple of days before and were concerned going to see it. It was hugely impactful because of those events. It does leave you feeling somewhat traumatized as you are given a lot of the story from the view of the terrorists themselves. And the cold unfeeling methodical way they go about their vile work is what really grabs you. Beware going in as this movie could easily distress some.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Startling terrorism drama will test your nerves,"The 2008 Jihadist attack on the prestigious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai is vividly recaptured in this film. A group of young Muslims recruited out of desperate poverty are sent on a mission to attack various prominent targets in the city one of which is the vast and labyrinthine hotel. As this ghastly event unfolds, hotel staff and guests alike are forced to adopt their own survival instincts as Mumbai has only a minimally-armed local police force and no military presence close by.I was struck by how this thus-far underrated film portrays terrorism and its unyielding thirst for blood. It's both fascinating and disturbing how such a young group of people could be driven to such a mindless excursion of unbridled rage and savage violence. That aspect of the film was extraordinary. There are strong performances throughout the film. Dev Patel is a waiter who is raising a young family in the city. Anupam Kher is a head chef with strict standards for his staff. Armie Hammer and Nazinin Boniadi are a young married couple with their infant child and babysitter. Jason Isaacs gives a scene-stealing performance as a Russian businessman. A plush hotel becomes the venue of a vicious attack and ensuing battle for survival.Very well-directed and amply suspenseful, this film might be at times a bit punishing to sit through, but it's not without moments of heroism and humor. The intensity level puts you right there and makes you feel like one of those desperately trying to escape. Although it's not for the faint of heart, anyone who watches will be in awe. Strongly recommended as a memorable film experience.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Flawed but terrifying reconstruction of tragic true life events,"There seems to be a slew of negative reviews of this film recently, some for ridiculous reasons such as the time it took for the special forces to arrive or the lack of fightback by the civilians, it is almost as if they do not realise it is based on a true story. Some even claim it is boring. But what you have is a gritty reconstruction of truly horrific events, a non-stop carnage from perpetrators whose only purpose is to kill as many as possible. The main characters are fictional amalgams of true life characters with the exception of Hemant Oberoi who, because of his fame, would be impossible to hide. Dev Patel leads an impressive cast that convey both the fear and astonishment at their predicament.
The film has its faults, a crying baby scene is a straight out cliché and Armie hammer's character is just a bit too much of the American hero. You do get the feeling that Paul Greengrass could have made a much better film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Expected more tension and dramatic scenes.,"This type of film always falls between reality and fiction and you are constantly pondering (exactly), how accurate the scenes and characters actually are. The action whilst trying to be realistic was a tad one dimensional and I did not feel the right amount of tension, where there should have been naturally heaps. Obviously a true fact in the movie, was the Indian Special Forces where eight hours away in Dehli; which gave the terrorists ample time to shoot everyone up! In life the most bizarre true facts, are way harder to believe than the ones we make up.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Harrowing depiction of the tragic event that is worth watching.,"It is a movie based on the true events of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. One thing I appreciate is that this movie does not shy away from how horrific the attack was. The violence is brutal and honestly difficult to watch. The film is incredibly suspenseful, tense and gripping to watch. There is terrific acting from Dev Patel who plays a staff and Anupam Kher who plays real-life head chef Hemant Oberoi.Where the movie falters is when it focuses on the couple. Their characters make so many infuriating choices and was genuinely frustrating to watch. I wish the whole film had just focused on the Hotel staff trying to protect the guests.Despite that, this is an incredibly well-made movie and a harrowing depiction of the tragic event that is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A timely reminder and a well directed movie,This is a clearly told and very scary movie about the Mumbai terror attacks. It's so much more effective than a typical thriller because it's a true story. There is no Bruce Willis type hero to burst in and rescue everyone. It was a tragic end for so many. The heroes are everyday hotel staff like the one played by Patel and under equipped policemen. Sometimes you wonder if Armie Hammer's character's foolhardiness was just a fictional composite to show different events and places in the hotel. The best point is how well directed the movie is. Everything that happens is clear and even the Pakistani terrorists are distinguishable. Often thriller action movies can be confusing.There have not been many movies about terror attacks of recent years. It isn't exploitative it's a reminder of the threats innocent people all over the world face from terror.,10.0,Anonymous,History

The one positive thing I will stay about the movie though is the cinematography, which is insanely good and deserves to be praised. Unfortunately... great cinematography doesn't make a great movie.There was no character development whatsoever, no backstory to the characters either except for Arjun. I didn't feel connected to them and didn't care about their fate. Arjun was the only character that made the movie worth watching, him and the terrorists who were easily the next best thing about the movie. Toward the end I felt more curious about and engaged with the terrorists' storyline than all the other characters, but even their storyline was underdeveloped so...Many parts of the movie are cliché and predictable, many events happening are too convenient and are just there for added drama.

"Good direction, but gets trapped in the same old notions about India","As the movie opened with its first few scenes, I was reminded of the endless list of movies that came up with the idea of depicting India in hue/tint of yellowish brown as if the colour of the sky is very different in India from the western world, almost like on Mars or Venus. Another movie depicting the south-asian region in a shade unreal and unnatural (an example on top of my mind - Extraction). I get it.. people are in the western hemisphere (and Australia in this case) want the movies to conform to their pre-conceived notion of how India is. Can't see India with a better lens.The acting is on the point by Dev, Anupam Kher and the others. While I dont know how much of the story-line of different guests/staff in the hotel was true to the reality, one thing that can't be denied is the honor, courage and 'guest-is-god' belief of the hotel staff at Taj, of which many instances are depicted in this movie. Kudos to that. The heinous crimes of ruthless, merciless firing by jihadists at innocent lives is sometimes too hard to believe, too bad to be true..

The chef was also great.The movie had me on edge the whole time. It definitely brought up my anxiety but I was gripped from the beginning. I shed some tears. I was scared.

This movie captures all of that very accurately. The important point is the culture clash that is behind all terrorism, and this movie certainly grasps that-how innocent people have their lives snuffed out, not because of anything they have done, but simply because of who they are. From the very beginning, the action and the terror take hold of you. There is no quiet delay while character development is explored. It gets right into the action.

Real life emotional thriller.. excellent direction,It's a true story. Glad the makers paid so much attention to the details. Intense and thrilling. Even though I knew the story but it was a surreal experience watching it on screen. At the time when this Pakistani terror attack happened there was not much knowledge about what was going on due to lack of social media and biased media. So if was eye opening to know how the media outed counter terror measures live on tv. Everybody should watch the movie to experience how much the world is suffering by these pathetic terror attacks.

Unoriginal film lacking depth,"HOTEL MUMBAI is one of multiple films covering the subject of the November 2008 Mumbai Attacks.

Saw this because of Armie Hammer,"And he did not disappoint. However, during the film, not sure how much creative license was taken -apparently this is based on a true life story, but as I watched I could not help to notice the ineptitude of the masses that lead to the continous carnage. First, one can't help to wonder how with such a crisis, the local law enforcement was not equipped or trained to handle something like this. These men went around with gun all over the place killing, and it took what seems to be a day before armed forces arrived. So it was a free for all for these killers taking people out like a video game. Then we get to Hotel Mumbai where many poor choices lead to even more deaths. There were so many bad decisions being made, it made it hard to care for any of the characters. It felt more like watching a video game as the assailants cleared rooms with their guns. The Russian businessman seemed like to one who might have fared the best to live until he himself made some poor choices. Now, it is easy to look back from a movie theatre perspective and judge whats going on without actually being there for real in such a situation because the camera let you into every angle of where everyone is - both the good guys and the bad guys. I could go on and on, but it would be futile. There was a gentleman sitting in front of me and he kept yawning the entire time. Not sure if he was just tired, or the movie was boring him to tears. Anyhow, I made it till the end. That's all I can say.",5.0,Anonymous,History

I guess that rules out just about everywhere in the world these days.It's a movie that had to be made and one that should be watched if only to get a glimmer of understanding as to what terrorists are capable of.You can't really blame anyone but the terrorists themselves and there's no doubt in my mind that they should be summarily executed if taken alive, just like you would a mad dog.Very well put together with high tension from the getgo.

Oscar worthy and brilliant film of the year!!,"In India's history, there has never been a terrorist incident that was as spine chilling as the one that happened in Mumbai on November 26, 2008 in terms of scale and sheer audacity. The entire country could not believe their eyes and were glued to news channels. 😡 This incident was India's 9/11.This brilliant film takes us on a journey of how just 4 terrorists took siege of the landmark Taj Hotel, killing indiscriminately and destroying portions of the hotel with grenades till the NSG commandoes finally barged inside and shot them dead. It also highlights how the head chef Mr. Hemant Oberoi along with the brave hotel staff shielded a lot of guests and finally rescued them. 🙏Let me firstly say, that this is the most realistic film I have seen in a long long while. It is not for the faint hearted and contains some really violent and shocking scenes. At many times, the movie gives the impression that we are watching the actual Mumbai terror attacks LIVE from within the hotel. 😱 That's the kind of movie it is. Not even a moment of relief and edge of the seat, white knuckle thriller.I must say, that the director has done a fabulous job in making this outstanding movie and won't be surprised if this movie gets nominated in ""Best Picture"" category at the Academy Awards.

compelling telling,"It's November 26, 2008. Ten terrorists arrive from rural Pakistan to launch attack across Mumbai. Arjun (Dev Patel) is a waiter at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and Hemant Oberoi is the head chef. David (Armie Hammer) and Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi) are having diner in the hotel while their baby is in their room with their nanny Sally. Former Soviet special force Vasili (Jason Isaacs) is also a guest when the hotel is infiltrated by four attackers.Like Unite 93 and others like it, this brings the real life terrorist attack to the big screen. Arjun is the perfect compelling heroic character. It doesn't seem to take too much liberties with the true story. Of course, there are always some inconsistencies.

One relives the horror and horrible terrorist attack on the beautiful city of Mumbai and the Taj Hotel. You can feel the frustration and despair of people and real footage is used a number of times for realism. A truly heartbreaking event and absolute act of cowardice from the terrorists. Some great moments of triumph and moving on were captured as survivors and dignitaries honored the victims and paid homage to Mumbai and the great Taj hotel that still stood strong.The moral is the Taj and its people will not be brought down. The Taj stood proudly in its glory before the attack and it stands proudly after. 8/10,8.0,Anonymous,History

"Gripping and Disturbing, But Excellent.","Although extremely disturbing, this film is one of the best I've seen concerning a terrorist attack and how it affects so many people. The film's authenticity has a lot to do with my rating. I felt the abject terror and confusion that gripped those victims who survived the initial attack. The acting was totally believable. The quiet heroism was especially noteworthy. There were no super-heroes who save the day and manage to avoid being hurt themselves no matter what is thrown at them. That's a fantasy action film. This was about everyday folks who had the courage to try and save themselves and as many others as humanly possible. I'll never forget this film.

"Great but another movie that makes India look really, really bad","Watched this movie this weekend and frankly, it was more of an indictment of Indian society than anything else. Just like Michael Mann has movies set in the same location that seem like they are part of the same universe, Hotel Mumbai seems to be set in the same sort of universe as Slumdog Millionaire, which Dev Patel also was in. The audience sees the crushing poverty India's working class lives in, how they are treated by their superiors who are kind of still living in the past going above and beyond obsessing over their staff's appearance and treating every guest, and they said it, like a God.One thing that made my head turn, even do research, was the fact that Mumbai didn't have a SWAT team and needed to procure one from New Delhi hours away. How incompetent does your government have to be to not have a team like that in Mumbai of all places? One of the world's largest cities! Did crime not exist until 2008 there or something? I have to imagine that at some point they had a crisis that warranted trained SWAT officers with modern equipment. No one ever watched a movie and thought ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have guys like this on the local police force?""I do have some criticism of the leads. For starters, Hollywood needs to stop hiring Dev Patel whenever they need an Indian actor. He was born in England and just exudes that London schoolboy snobbery in every role he's in. He can't act! I can never sympathize with him. The other Westerners in the movie were also insufferable, especially Nazanin Boniadi. Armie Hammer feels absolutely wasted in a bit role in this film. He seems to make a nasty habit of taking stupid, pointless roles that don't help his career and it's baffling.Pretty sure they won't be showing this movie on flights to India. Well done film, better casting would have put it over the top.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Thrilling, heroic, and important","There is never a dull moment in Hotel Mumbai. You cannot look away for a moment. Innumerable close calls and riveting moments of tension make this movie the easiest watch I've had this year. There are plenty of other astute and exciting movies about actual terrorism. 6 Days (2017) is a British movie that comes to mind. However Hotel Mumbai, in terms of the violence and terror is probably closer to Elephant (2003). How odd that Hotel Mumbai is also, like Elephant, ascribed to Australian Production. 6 Days is ascribed to New Zealand. Hotel Mumbai and Elephant both try to convey the sheer senselessness, stark terror and tragedy of a determined rampage. Hotel Mumbai has to be congratulated for putting together a movie which has so many moving parts, and in such a realistic and moving style. It is top shelf movie making and deeply honours a subject which causes so much concern. Absolutely heroic.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A day of Infamy: 26/11,"Think of a socially relevant film and this one is way up there near the very top of the list. One gets to have a ringside view of the mayhem,
violence and murder that engulfed Mumbai in those fateful days in November 2008.One wonders at the meticulous planning
that went into it and the cold-bloodedness in the execution of the attacks. In the end, 174 were killed, 31 of them trapped and defenceless people at the famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.It's a compelling narrative that opens one's eyes to the dangers of religious extremism, and inadequate measures to prevent such incidents.The story is centered on the head chef of the hotel, Hemant Oberoi, and a waiter named Arjun. It tells about the courage and heroism of hotel staff who refused to escape and instead did all they can to protect their guests even laying their lives for them.Oberoi is portrayed by veteran Indian actor Anupam Kher while Arjun is a composite of several real-life waiters who were there during those dark days.It's a well-researched film that attests to the writer's and director's thoroughness in putting together a factual film with drama and pathos.Actual TV footages are inserted in the film to add to its authenticity.

More or less gets the events right as they transpired and just how much the the terror outfits get a kick out of sadism under the guise of a holy war,"This Australian film had a lowkey release in the US this week. However, it really does do justice to the flow of events concerning the brutal sadistic siege of the Hotel Taaj in Mumbai, India back in 2008 by a terror outfit based in Pakistan. For me as an Indian, it brought back memories of being glued to the TV screen following news channel updates that detailed every plight by the police to contain the situation (which in retrospect actually was a deterrent since the terrorists also had access to the TV stations and got all the info they needed to plan their each and every move). The action and violence was REALLY intense and the movie's strongest pointMy chief complaint is that Mumbai was depicted from the point of view of a Westerner who, despite making overall a great film, also thought to stir up the conventional views of the city by a Western audience which primarily involves visualizing the city as still clinging on to the colonial times with a stark contrast between poverty and the uber rich, with no middle class involved. But again, I would still highly recommend the movie if you are looking forward to enjoying an action thriller in a theater.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Commitment to service meets terrorism,"Hotel Mumbai - The dastardly terror attack on the heritage property of Taj Hotel finds a sombre, balanced yet gripping narrative through Anthony Maras' direction of Hotel Mumbai. The film steers clear of any overt demonstration of heroism and patriotism, but does justice to the employees' integrity and dedication to their customers' service, keeping their safety, security and well being before everything else. With a running time of 118 minutes, Hotel Mumbai sets of its business straight from the word go and never returns a dull moment. It wastes no time to dive deep into anyone's life, but does create an ensemble of core characters that represents the indomitable spirit of the metropolis and the unflinching commitment of Taj to secure the release of the hapless hostages.Hotel Mumbai is a hybrid of a drama and a documentary without allowing the tension drop for once. The perpetrators are evidently a bunch of ultraviolent, brainwashed youngsters working on the principles of religious faith, the local police are under prepared and the guests are at the mercy of the killers who neither show any compassion nor remorse. The situation is grave and the director keeps it edge of the seat.

Hotel Mumbai,"I knew someone who survived the attacks that took place in Mumbai in 2008. I reckon they would be thinking who this film is aimed at.The director of Hotel Mumbai talks about all the hours of research they did. He then inserts fictionalised characters into this exploitative drama.You have disparate multinational characters assembled like it was a disaster film such as The Poseidon Adventure. There is a lecherous and arrogant Russian businessman who is arranging escorts to be delivered to his hotel suite. A newly married couple who have had a baby. For dramatic purposes we have a scene where the baby is in danger.Instead of the ship hitting a tidal wave, Muslim terrorists cause carnage by indiscriminately shooting at guests and staff at the Taj Hotel.The focus is on waiter Arjun (Dev Patel) with his ill fitting shoes and head chef Hemant Oberoi (Anupam Kher playing the real life chef of the hotel) who try to lead some of the hotel guests to safety.The film consists of people being blown away. You keep having to remind yourself that 174 people died and someone has made a spectacle of it which includes news clips and mobile phone footage of the real events.It might have been better if the film took a critical stance at the events that took place over three days. The failure of Indian intelligence agencies and the slow response of the counter terrorism forces who were stationed in Delhi. Also what were the motivations of the terrorist and the planning that took place for these attacks. The young men we see look like they are poor, uneducated and have been brainwashed.However I cannot get over that this is an uneasy film to watch.

Mumbai Attack is a bunch of meaningless and bloody terror acts. 175 people were killed by terrorists. They choosed different objects to make chaos but in movie accent is on Hotel Taj.
Taj is a perfect place where main rule is ""our guest equals God"". Safe, beautiful building which like fairytale and paradise. And this atmosphere was until scary events of 2008.
Hotel Mumbai works like hermetical thriller and hostage drama but it's masterpiece. Mostly because of soundwork. Every gunshot seems to be scary and realistic. And screenplay here is just a truth mirror. And truth doesn't care 'bout people's psychic.

For people claiming this movie is more drama, would probably be better off watching the real 1.5 hr footage that was filmed back then, while people asserting its too gory might be better off watching something else.
Lastly, I found the movie wonderfully done portraying the chaos that went rampant that night. Pity it took 10 years for this movie to be made that too as an Australian production.

REAL-WORLD ATROCITIES TOOLED FOR SENSORY IMPACT,"Despite its fierce punch, Hotel Mumbai - pulled from release in New Zealand following the Christchurch shootings - hits shaky ground as it couples real-world terrors with disaster movie conventions. Maras keeps the focus sharp initially, ranging with controlled fluency from instructions heard on Islamist militants' headphones to the meeting of disparate characters at the hotel. Employees include Dev Patel's steady waiter Arjun and his boss Oberoi (standout Anupam Kher); guests include spouses Nazanin Boniada and Armie Hammer, with baby and nanny (Tilda Cobham-Hervey).
When the attacks begin, the staging is nerve-shattering. DoP Nick Remy Matthews' tight-knuckle framing turns hotel corridors into sites of claustrophobic terror; meanwhile, the nanny's struggle to quieten the baby in hiding generates horror-grade chills. Yet this show of genre proficiency starts to seem over-calculated. Comedic asides are utilised for tension-andrelease effect, awkwardly. Geopolitical contexts receive less attention than Jason Isaacs' wobbly Russian accent, while white characters' deaths draw more attention than non-white ones.
Even if Oberoi's ""the guest is God"" mantra nods to class themes, Maras seems more intent on serving perceived audience appetites for dramatic immersion than exploring them. As the in-the-moment impact increases, so does the queasy aftertaste.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Better than some reviews make it sound like,"First of all, lets address the ""based on true events"" that some people complain about. It's based on real events but being a film it's dramatised with added bits/people that didn't really happen, it's not a documentary. If you want a 100% accurate account, a film is probably not the best place to go.On that understanding, if you have a little empathy you still get a clear idea of the terror the real guests and staff would have felt, the bravery of the staff who chose to stay to help their guests and the brutality of the terrorists.
It is a 2hrs film and most of it covers the attack on the hotel so for some it may seem long but in reality it was a very long attack so they had to represent that. I personnaly felt there was plenty enough tension not to feel the time go by and enjoy (if we can use that word) the film.Jason Isaacs playing a Russian was odd and the couple (Boniadi and Hammer) and their nanny were cliche, hard to believe in and ultimately you may struggle to care for them.

"Nail-Biting, Heart-Pounding,","A striking, shocking exhibition of one of India's most horrific attacks that shocked not only the nation, but many tourists who were left with a battle they never expected to fight.A hotel staff risks everything to keep its patrons safe during a terror attack, especially a British heiress, her husband and her infant.Slumdog Millionaire is where Dev Patel made his name - from an interview that his mother had to encouraged him to attend to countless productions, the English-born actor has featured also in Lion, Chappie and The Personal History of David Copperfield - Patel is a controlled actor, who takes care in the roles he performs, considering the key emotions of the character. Portraying quick-thinking staff member Arjun, he remains as calm as one can in such a devastating situation, neutralising the feelings around the hotel at the time. In a pragmatic manner, he diffuses a chaotic cacophony of gunshots and leads the charge towards salvation - offering hope to the innocent victims.The film is best credited for its unnerving tone and building tension towards an nail-biting climax. Inspired by the real life 2008 events, Hotel Mumbai is an anticipation of heart-stopping drama, the movie progresses at a severely fast-pace proving little moments for pauses of consideration.

Mixed feelings but powerful,"Hollywood has become an odd place and critics have become even stranger. Many of the meta-critics weren't impressed with Mumbai (the film), and they have the right to their collective views. To draw a contrast, Avengers Endgame (a different genre to Hotel Mumbai) was highly praised by meta-critics. I'll compare the two films in this review.
Both films involved a lot of violence. Mumbai was far more graphic to give realism rather than glorify horror.
Mumbai had relatable characters who behaved like normal human beings (although Patel in Mumbai was unnatural and Hollywoodish and failed to capture working class Mumbai's rough charm. Also, Hemsworth mostly behaved like a human being in Endgame). Most of the endgame cast behaved like ""soapie stars"", more like plastic mannequins with equally plastic emotions and dialogue.
Mumbai feels gritty, real, you almost expect to smell the putrid and spicy drifting through the streets.
I normally dislike violence in my movies. I like Hollywood's intense sex politics even less. Mumbai doesn't even entertain sex politics (it's real people, not Hollywood). But, Mumbai have a purpose to their violence, even if it is graphic. Endgame has sex politics (it's Hollywood) and nothing sincere or genuine (although Johansson shows glimpses of her pre-plasticised charm, like. Her Lost in Translation days when she put the effort into genuine acting).
There's a good Twilight Zone (obviously that means the 1960s series) called ""number 12 looks just like you"". It sums up Avengers Endgame and most of the meta-critics beautifully. In our new age of diversity where we are ""all individuals"" (ala Life of Brian), Mumbai has the nerve to say ""I'm not"".
Mumbai: justifiably violent ""R"" rated to capture horror, mostly solid acting (more Isaacs, far less Patel), real people in real situations. Or If you like extremely sanitised (but still violent) plastic culture, watch Endgame instead.",8.0,Anonymous,History
You don't get to value what you have until you are tested against the odds and challenged,"What worked:
It's based on the true events that happened in Mumbai; one of the series of attacks. It's haunting and terrifying to assume that many of the things that is shown in the movie actually happened. The movie kept me anxious and thrilled throughout most of the scenes, and made me empathize with the victims. Although it's a Hollywood movie, many of the casts had Indian origin, making it as Indian as international. The movie was heartbreaking, sad and disappointing to actually see the series of events. The whole team is worth praising. It needs at least one time watch to understand the basics of what happened.What did not work:
The movie is glorified and glamorized at times making us question is it movie from Hollywood or a Bollywood movie because the pulse sometimes leans towards Indian narrative style . Many scenes are complete cliche, stereotypical and some prejudiced. The movie as a whole works but some scenes felt repetitive so I think the overall length could have been shortened. The movie also somehow feels like a propaganda or an tribute to the people working in the hotel and their valor. It's not a bad thing but as a movie, we want to see the whole clear picture rather than a linear perspective of the good vs bad guys.Final verdict: recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Be able to enjoy life, because it can be fleeting","The movie ""Mumbai Hotel"" somehow passed by my list of films to watch, although I pay attention to high-quality novelties. My brother advised me to watch it, saying that the picture was shot based on real events. And I'm always interested in such projects. And thanks to the annotation to the picture, I suddenly realized that this movie would be necessarily heavy. Having tuned in to the viewing, I devoted a couple of hours of my life to immersion in this terrible tragedy, which director Anthony Maras so competently conveys on the screen.The production immediately sets up a gloomy mood, when in the first frames we are shown people approaching from the sea with stone faces. Scene follows scene, and the audience gets acquainted with the main characters of the picture. The dialogues and narration are written so competently that for me during the subsequent events there were no questions about who is who in the film. Although there are probably about two dozen active heroes here. But each of them is a personality that you perceive thanks to their actions, which determine the motivation of the characters.The history of terrorist attacks that are shown on the screen is mainly formed on the actions in the Mumbai hotel. The world of luxury and rich guests, the staff of the institution crumbles to dust overnight when an attack by armed men takes place within the walls of the hotel. An unprecedented sense of panic falls not only on the characters, but also on the viewer. You suddenly realize that before you die, everyone becomes equal, whether you are a successful American with a family, a rich Russian businessman or an ordinary hotel employee from India. And this realization gives rise to a sense of insecurity, because the terrorists are armed, they came here specifically to deprive people of their lives, and they absolutely do not care about your nationality, wealth, worldview. For them, people are just a target that needs to be hit.The obvious decision to escape from this nightmare away from the hotel is not the right decision in the current situation, because the city is attacked by other terrorist groups. And staying in your room may well be the right decision. But it is possible only until a certain time. The scriptwriters and the director guide us through their project, making it clear that any little thing, any event, any action of a particular person or group of persons, in one way or another can affect the life and death of the characters themselves and other people. After all, every action of the heroes in the frame generates a chain reaction, which leads to certain events. And you, as a spectator, are completely immersed in every little story that permeates this film. Unlike the usual projects with ""good"" and ""bad"" heroes, there are no those who are guaranteed to stay alive, whom the tragedy will bypass. And famous actors appear in the role of the most ordinary people who happened to be in the epicenter of this nightmare.The cast is impressive. Each of the top officials coped with his role with dignity. Armie Hammer, Dev Patel, Jason Isaacs are well remembered, convincingly performing in their assigned roles. But I was especially impressed by the actresses of the first plan. Nazanin Boniadi and Tilda Cobham-Hervey simply tore their souls with their performance, allowing them to truly understand what a nightmare their heroines had to endure. Anulam Kher, Angus McLaren, Natasha Liu Bordizzo and Carmen Duncan were also convincing. Their heroes made up the very group of people that are remembered in this picture.The film was very impressive. For the two hours that the picture lasts, I was in quiet horror, watching what was happening. It's like a tragedy that happened in 2008 snatches you out of the familiar world, but passed by (fortunately). However, thanks to this quality of paintings, people can imagine what horror the participants of those events have to go through. And then you start to feel life differently. After all, you never know what might happen to you or your loved ones. The usual way of life is quite capable of changing overnight, destroying everything you are used to. This film is a reminder of such a possibility, as a warning, as a tribute to all those who struggled with death in those days. And this picture is a good reason to just look at your loved ones from a different angle and maybe once again tell them how dear they are to you, how much you love them. After all, it will not be superfluous, and such an opportunity is a real gift of fate. Those who were victims of the terrible events at the Mumbai hotel and other terrorist attacks have lost this opportunity...10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The attack that shook India and the world!!,"Hotel Mumbai is an action thriller film directed by Anthony Maras. The film stars Dev Patel, Armie Hammer, Nazanin Boniadi, Anupam Kher, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Jason Isaacs, Suhail Nayyar, Nagesh Bhosle, and Natasha Liu Bordizzo.The film is based on the attacks of 26/11.The attack of 26/11 is one of the most shocking and devastating attack on the Indian soil by gun wielding coward terrorists who didn't even spare small children and being an Indian i pay my sincere homage to the people who lost their lives in this cowardly attack.The film which displays the horror through the eyes of the survivors who have to face this deadly attack so convincingly that at some movement you yourself start feeling that you are also at the attack site. The panic, fear, anxiety, anguish, sorrow has been depicted with utmost perfection and few of the scenes are so convincing that you'll feel that you are watching the live attack and not a film.Acting is superb and Dev Patel who plays a butler who helps in saving the lives of many guest was terrific, Anupam Kher one of the most talented Indian actor plays the role of Chef Oberoi was perfectly fitted in his role. Armie Hammer and Jason Issac too were impressive and also Nazanin Boniadi.The screenplay of the film is intense, disturbing, gore but gripping, the film carries a sense of discomfort watching so many innocent lives getting killed and director deserves an applause for making the film look so realistic. Climax of the film could be of a mixed emotion with a sigh of relief for those who survived this gruesome attack and pain and sorrow for those who lost their life in the attack.Hoping that one day the humanity will rise and this type of coward terrorists gets wiped out from the earth.

Would have been good to see the other attacks in more detail too to connect it with them.,9.0,Anonymous,History
A cleverly executed film.,"I am late to this party, but it was worth it. As much as i would strongly want to defend all those reviewers shooting the movie right at the temple, I'd rather shoot back the words. Hotel Mumbai has been on my watchlist since forever, and I am glad that I could finally put my brains to it.
This is one of those movies that I did not constantly judge, being a professional script writer, myself. The start to the movie is crisp, it gets to the point without beating around the bush, what I expect almost all the movies to do. The faster the problem, the better the screenplay. It gets very interesting with the initial violence. And for those complaining about it, please note that this is what has actually happened over those hours. As the screenplay progresses, it gets very very intriguing with the ways the characters are all settling down. An interesting aspect about the characters is that none of them reveal their attributes with their actions, it is often by the description or a remark that another character makes about them. This continues almost throughout the film.
The protagonist,Dev Patel has done a commendable job, however I wish he made a tad bit more impact being the conventional hero to the audience. Anupam Kher played an underdog, diligent, yet leaves an impression of a true hero. The other characters, each with their own inner and outer conflicts, specially the terrorists have an appreciable role.
It is very interesting how the director has staged everything in a confined space of just one huge hotel, though a task, it was well executed. However, the loose ends are quite visible themselves. Towards the end, the screenplay gets slightly clumsy and the most ""dangerous"" of them all fall flat every now and then, it almost seemed foolish.
Barring the flaws, it is a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. There are a few nail biting scenes, and some unexpected situations that were detangled very cleverly by the writer. Overall, it is a must watch, and I give it an 8/10 stars.Keep your cine mojo on.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Compelling Story,"Another great movie based on true events. Just like United 93, this story of a real-life terrorist attack gives you the event through two different angles - both through the eyes of the terrorists and the hostages.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"How would you feel, when you stand at the deadly end of a Kalashnikov?","I asked myself this question a lot when watching Hotel Mumbai.A movie that is not like any other movie ""based on real events"", but it is a very difficult experience and is not for the faint-hearted, a film that will make your heart beat like never before, a film that raises tension, hate and fear, when you see what point humanity can reach at the bottom of the abyss.The real events are... the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008. At the hands of Takfiri terrorists, whose only goal is...to take as many lives as possible. A very difficult film and I repeat not for the faint of heart.It seems that the director (Anthony Mars) intended to direct the film in this way to put the viewer in the heart of the terrifying event.",9.0,Anonymous,History
