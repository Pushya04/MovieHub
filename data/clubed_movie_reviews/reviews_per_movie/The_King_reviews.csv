Not historically accurate but well done,I enjoyed this movie because of the performances and the cinematography. It is not historically accurate and I wish it would have been. The main battle scene was wonderfully done. I enjoyed it overall and it is well worth two hours of one's time.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Gritty tale of Henry,"Not sure what to expect when watching this. Truley gritty film. The acting was superb.
The battle scenes were truly realistic. Nice change from Netflix terrible films they've put their name on.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Historically inaccurate for no reason,"Firstly the film ticks lots of boxes- acting, costumes, direction all good with a decent budget.
But why another film which changes history for no actual reason. The story of Henry V needs no surgery. Without trying to sound like a history snob, Henry was 27 when he acceded the throne not 17. He had reconciled with his father. He had 3 younger brothers (born 1386,1387,1389 and 1390) and as such great material for the complex relationships of family loyalty and personal ambition. Thomas of Clarence, a suicidally brave soldier did not pre-decease his father but died in 1421 well after Agincourt. Henry Percy 'Hotspur' was over 20 years older than Henry and was not killed by him...the Dauphin did not die at Agincourt...Henry V was a seasoned warrior with the claim to the French throne ingrained in him. He was not a pacifist in any sense, that was his son Henry VI - and that is a whole other story...
Anyway off my high horse. A very watchable film for non history buffs!",7.0,Anonymous,History

special,"Obvious, it is a special film. For different motifs, from the performances, suggesting a new generation of actors ready to propose great roles to the realism of fight scenes, from the politic and the grew up of a young prince becoming an admirable king to the expected John Falstaff. In meny senses, the film of Timothee Chalamet . And one of splendid works from Neflix. So, just a great film, a wise storytelling, beautiful performances, fair atmosphere and something escaping to definitions. A film about power, maybe out of expected Shakespeare but profound inspired portrait of the battle of Azincourt. So, just special, in all of senses, at each level.",,Anonymous,History

Epic,"Yes it's not historically accurate blah blah but it's a damn fine piece of filmmaking. Great script, direction, performances, cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. The casting is spot on. And though I've seen it a number of times now, I still get a knot in my stomach before the battle. THAT says something! Patterson's portrayal of the Dauphin could have so easily have been clownish, but it is tinged with menace and works so well. He chews up every scene he's in. This is very good cinema indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Make historical movies historical again.,"I have mixed fillings about this movie. First of all it's a very nice piece of cinema with an epic and realistic medieval battle.But ... bloody hell ... when you try to make a movie about an historical caracter why can't you get your facts straight.The historical facts, as related in this movie, are all wrong.I know that Americans don't really care about the worlds History and try to make it entertaining instead of relating true events as they actually were.The battle of Agincourt was a military masterpiece, there is no need for stupid inaccuracies.Even Shakespeare was more accurate than this.Make historical movies historical again.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A very different take from Shakespeare's.,"A very different take on the story of King Henry V from the one we're used to seeing; you know the one a certain Mr Shakspeare has served up. As might be expected from a director who as already given us ""Animal Kingdom"" and ""The Rover"" there's a whiff of the gangster to be found here. These are the courts not of the high born but of the common, men who have fought their way to the throne through muddy fields of blood while Michod's vision of medieval Europe seems wholly accurate without being overdone.Of course, this is a Henry far removed from the nobility of an Olivier or a Branagh. Chalamet's Henry is certainly noble but he's also much more of a pragmatist, prepared to think first and act later, unlike Robert Pattinson's over-the-top and somewhat camp Dauphin; the contrast between them is beautifully delivered. The other main character is, naturally, Falstaff who, in Joel Edgerton's superb performance, is a much more subdued presence than we have seen before. Indeed the acting throughout is outstanding as is the screenplay co-written by Michod and Edgerton, while the Battle of Agincourt is as fierce and as bloody as any battle ever put on film. In an age of Marvel movies ""The King"" might seem like a fish out of water but it's unquestionably one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Best Regarded as a Work of Fantasy-Fiction,"I found that the cinematography, costumes (chain mail everywhere!), acting and fast-paced and suspenseful plot of The King all combined to produce a satisfying and fairly gripping film.After reading some of the negative reviews, I see that a significant contingent of people are quite angry about the historical inaccuracies. ThatÂ´s always a problem with fact-based films. There are so many people who believe themselves to know all of the details (I presume because they read a lot of books? Written by other people who read a lot of books?), and they are going to be annoyed at whatever is changed or omitted for the sake of the film and at the behest of the director/writer/producer (in this case, all three are probably complicit). It is true, too, that Shakespeare wrote a very famous play entitled Henry V, and some people appear to be angry that this is not that.My best advice would be to watch this production as an action-adventure film created in the 21st century. Thinking of The King in that way eases some of the quandaries which will surely arise in inquiring minds, such as: why was a young metrosexual male with the body of a pre-pubescent girl cast in the role of Hal? It stretched credulity, to put it mildly, that an adolescent with a toothpick thin body (his torso was displayed naked in more than one scene...) could have prevailed in any hand-to-hand, knife-to-knife battle to the death with such thick-necked, seasoned warriors.Ultimately, The King is a fantasy tale in which a slacker with pacifist leanings eventually undergoes a transformation not unlike that of Michael Corleone in The Godfather.",7.0,Anonymous,History
It's hard to find a fault,This was epic. The acting was amazing. Near perfect writing. The actor who played Henry (Timothee C) should be a big star. Great presence. Take the time to watch this. I'm glad I did. High quality stuff.,10.0,Anonymous,History
The King is one of the greatest if you can follow him.,"I first turned on this movie seeking epic medieval battles and battlefield glory along with drama in the royal court, and I got what I was looking for, just not in the way I expected.This movie is based on the play Henry V by William Shakespeare, which is in turn based on the real Henry V. It is not 100% accurate, but I would argue that it's still educational. We find a drunk Hal living the partying lifestyle, when his father suddenly dies and leaves the crown of England to him, he doesn't seek the crown, which makes him suited to wear it. He swiftly and successfully unites England, but when he is taunted by the king of France, he is advised to invade him. And invade France he does. What follows is a beautiful (despite the gaps) story with betrayal, battles, and (maybe?) love.The story is the definition of slow-burn, accompanied by a minimalist classical score and beautiful cinematography highlighting the soft sky. The production design is minimal but still looks expensive. The film highlights the complexities of war and the burden of leadership in a brilliant way, visible in the amazing performances from Timothee Chalamet and Joel Edgerton and the accompanying cast.If you can't handle slow paced drama, I can't recommend this. For me this is a mood based film, I can't watch this on a summer day after a day at the pool. This movie just kills that mood. But if I've had one of those days and I'm listening to the patter of rain in the window, this movie lifts me up. If you have the patience to watch it, this could be in your list of top ten favorite movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Thoroughly Enjoyed,"I wasn't sure what to expect while watching this movie but I was thoroughly impressed. Timothee C. (Henry) did an incredible job fulfilling his role. You could clearly see what his desires were as King of England and it made you fall in love with his character. Really great movie all the way from the actors, battle scenes, cinematic shots, props, and storyline. You truly get an inside look at to what it's like being King and the decisions that have to be made. Very enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
WOW,"I went into the movie with modest expectations. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I absolutely wasn't expecting this. I was blown away by this movie. It kept me interested from start to finish. Even though the movie contains a lot fewer battle scenes than previously expected, it was still intriguing and made any battle scene that much more rewarding. This could be the movie that helps Netflix win their first academy award for best picture. I highly recommend that anyone with a Netflix account watch this. You won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not great, but a solid movie that is worth a watch","It isn't a film that I think many people will be adding to their all time favourites, but regardless its a good film with a compelling story line. Truth be told, with one hour left to the movie I would have rated it a 6, it was a bit slow and I wasn't fully engaged, but the final battle and the twist at the end make up for that to make this film a solid 7. It's important to note that I'm not somebody who cares about 'historical accuracy' and I am more concerned with how good is the story and the quality of the mise-en-scÃ¨ne. After all, I'm not watching a history channel documentary but rather a piece of entertainment. Some people also complained about the dialogue and about dimly lit scenes. It is true that some lines are hard to comprehend even for native english speakers and there are certainly some dimly lit scenes. Its a minor issue and doesn't take away from the film. To conclude, as I said, its a good movie and worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Timothee Chalamet.... a smouldering superstar in the making.,"Brilliant, well-paced supremely-acted bopic of the young Henry V. Slow-paced but in a good, thoughtful way, with a great and haunting score, and the Battle of Agincourt was realistically portrayed. Took me a few minutes to recognize Joel Edgerton as he was middle-aged, portly and with a brilliant Lancashire accent. However, undoubtedly, Timothee Chalamet dominates this movie with a tour de force performance. What a screen presence for someone so young, especially when he isn't speaking. I have no doubt he is going to be huge, the next Leonardo DiCaprio I suspect.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I also felt they didn't quite capture the significance of what was going on in the plot. I think the decision to go to war with France should have felt more like a big thing.Overall, a good, entertaining film that maybe could have done with being a bit shorter.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Shakespeare for non Shakespeare fans.,"Perfect cinematography, visual effects on a cinematic scale. Performances that are emotionally engaging, the sheer beauty of it. This does not play like a Netflix movie, more like a blockbuster epic.
I always engage with Falstaff in Henry V, and find the actors who portray him fascinating, and Joel Edgerton does not disappoint, this is one of his career standouts, easily his best since Warrior.
TimothÃ©e Chalamet is scintillating as Hal, who goes from wayward prince to King of England in a journey that is filled with anguish, blood and grief.

Impressive performances and script but lacking soul,"'The King' was definitely a step above most recent Netflix releases. It's films like this and 'The Power of The Dog' that give me hope that the platform is not actually in a sharp decline of quality.Netflix bashing aside, there was much to like about this film and a few areas that were lacking. I found the performances in 'The King' to be pretty impressive across the board. The standout's being T. C. And Joel Edgerton. Robert Pattinson, although not a lead role in the film, gave a unique take on the character. His accent work unfortunately took me out of the film as it was far too much of a charachiture and I struggled to believe the character was French.The script was also impressive, well written and able to carry the film in a very dialogue heavy feature. Much has already been said in reviews about the battle scenes and fight scenes so in brief they are well choreographed and get points for being realistic as opposed to flashy and stylised.My main issue with the film was that I felt it lacked soul and heart. Despite the film being technically impressive I struggled to find a sense of care in regards to the story and characters. There were very few moments of mirth to break up the often heavy and sometimes teadious scenes. If you are not a fan of slow stories or films that take their time getting to the meat of the story this is not for you.Ultimately I found the film to be worth the watch and a well developed, well written, acted and directed new interpretation of Shakespeares play, however lacking soul and at times quite a slog to get through.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Not Shakespeare, not history - rubbish","I will start positive and say that the battle scene was unhistorical but v good in its own right. Clearly inspired by the Game of Thrones battle, it gives us the brutal grappling style of warfare of this period. EDIT: I should also add that the score is excellent.Now to the negative:This movie is boring and spineless. Apparently based not on history but the plays of Shakespeare, the screenplay is utterly uninspired by both. It consists of people sitting in small rooms mumbling modernist platitudes in faux-shakespearean - shot, reverse-shot. Why is Falstaff, one of the most celebrated jovial, care-free characters in literature, a mopey, mumbling, shell-shocked, bearded hipster? When they are not in rooms (or tents) King Henry is at the head of his slate-faced zombie army of Englishmen without personality. Where is Fluellen and Pistol? Where is the conversations with the soldiers the night before the battle? We do, however, get a terrible attempt at a speech - but I will get to the performances later. The film is spineless in its portrayal of Henry V. How do you give this rather bloodthirsty historical figure a character sympathetic to modern sensibilities? Why, make up a conspiracy behind his invasion of France. This is not Shakespeare's Henry either. It seems the writers only made it based on the plays rather than history so they could include an unhistorical riotous youth, and can add Falstaff - in this version, a man of the people who can spout both philosophy and battle-winning strategies. It is certainly not history, but it is not Shakespeare either: it is a painfully dull plot languishing in abject fantasy. While Timothee Chalamet's perfomance occasionally rises to mediocrity, his best attribute is that he looks almost identical to Henry's famous portrait. However for most of the screening time they would have benefited from just using the king's funerary effigy. His performance is risible, and his accent embarrassing. While Robert Pattinson's performance made my skin crawl (I think this had more to do with direction than ability, which is usually strong), he was at least charismatic, unlike everybody else in this film.It is clear nobody knew what they were making with this film. Rather than draw from Shakespeare they came up with their own witless banter that occasionally struggles into archaic form, then plummets into anachronism (Thomas of Clarence refers to Hotspur's head as the 'prize scalp'; obviously not an English cultural notion until encounters with the Native Americans some centuries thence). I won't even mention the historical liberalities in the plot, since it is basically all of it.If you love history or Shakespeare, stay far, far away from this mess.",,Anonymous,History

Superb script, superb acting, superb photography.Young Hal, the reluctant new king Henry V, Just wants peace - an end to all the civil strife. But the best way to bring England together turns out to be war - a war against France. Well, the French are literally asking for it.The film itself is beautiful, raw, thoughtful, impressive. There are many words and images to savour. The grim medieval realism is reminiscent of (bizarrely) Monty Python & the Holy Grail. But the tension and conflict brings to mind the best Game of Thrones episodes, like Battle of the Bastards.So far: this one's a keeper.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Michod returns to form with The King,"Since making his stunning debut with Australian classic Animal Kingdom in 2010, director David Michod has struggled to deliver a project to the same high standards he set for himself, with the good but not great The Rover and the genuinely lacklustre Brad Pitt starring War Machine failing to showcase the director we saw unearthed initially.It's pleasing then to see the Netflix released The King show more than its fair share of promise of the director we know exists, in what's a well-filmed, acted and staged epic that at times transcends itself to become a moving and contemplative examination of power and leadership as it shines a light on King Henry V.Teaming up with his long term friend and collaborator Joel Edgerton (who also makes his mark on screen as the no fuss John Falstaff), Michod and Edgerton craft a grim and grey insight into the time in which England found itself at war with France and under the leadership of a previously reluctant leader in the shape of Timothee Chalamet's Hal.There's nothing surprising about The King's narrative movements, one that feels similar to any other similar medieval epic, but Michod and Edgerton explore some interesting themes in amongst all the betrayals, beheadings, battles and bloodshed, that's expertly played out by a very capable cast.Continuing on his hot form that has now gone on for a number of years, Chalamet is well cast as Hal/Henry V and the way in which Chalamet moves from drunken slacker to a man determined not to make the same mistakes as his father is perfectly constructed, a performance that is backed up by the reliable Edgerton, a solid if underused Ben Mendelsohn as King Henry IV and a scenery chewing and thick accented Robert Pattinson as the detestable Dauphin of France.For a Netflix film, The King also feels a cut above a number of its other counterparts with Australian D.O.P Adam Arkapaw's cinematography capturing a mixture of beauty and horror effectively, while Nicholas Britell's thoughtful score ensures that Michod's vision is enhanced by some moody and atmospheric accompaniments.If there is a notable issue holding The King back from reaching a higher level of accomplishment, it would be that throughout, many of the films characters remain cold and unreachable, even Hal is a hard figure to completely fall for, while many of the films other players are never allowed to grow fully enough for us to invest ourselves in, had the film managed to instil itself with more of a beating heart (say like a Braveheart), its likely Michod would've finally had another Animal Kingdom on his hands.Final Say -A step in the right direction for director David Michod, The King is a well put together epic that should appease historians and fans of sword and sandal extravaganza's, that also features a number of solid acting turns that help maintain a constant level of engagement, without ever fully hooking us completely into its time and place.3 Â½ rain predictions out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,History

Great movie - a touch long,"Just saw this film and it is captivating. What ever you do don't believe the low rating some others have given it because it is not accurate and you will need to question the motivations of those scoring this film so low when it is worthy of much more. Maybe a touch of jealously cause it is a Netflix film. The acting is superb with a great script, crisp cinematography and wonderful sound. The director transports us in the 15th century and we are captivated by the situation King Henry V finds himself in. Surrounded by corruption and men who are willing to kill each other for property and status.All the cast was brilliant and the two lead actors were exceptional.The only negative is that it is a touch long. I say that it was long but I can't see anything that could have been left out.

English period drama with story we've seen before,"In keeping with the surge of medieval dramas - popularized by Game of Thrones - Netflix has released another period film ""The King"" that sheds light on the lesser-known history of King Henry V of England during the early 15th century. One of the biggest issues with this movie is it last for more than two hours and I'm are still trying to understand protagonist's motivation. How did Henry V go from a reckless youth all the way to calling out an enemy to fight in single combat? How did he go from refusing his father's throne to accepting it? etc. The reasons are a little muddled. At the end, movie is an admirable, albeit forgettable, retelling of a well-known (Shakespeare) character. While it does have its qualities, the flimsy character development hindered me from investing emotionally into this portrayal. I'm glad I saw it, but I doubt anyone (except some old English people) will rush back to see this in the movies.Rating: 7",7.0,Anonymous,History
7/10,"A reasonably enjoyable drama, directly inspired by the post-GoT era. Its strength, frankly, is in its writing and dialogue. The viewer hasn't a choice but to hang on every word of Harris, Chalamet, Edgerton, and Pattinson. Pattinson brings value to every scene in which he participates. It mattes not whether his accent is accurate. The man is entertainment. The dialogue and character relationships are what makes it a drama rather than an action epic or historical narrative of any sort. The action sequences themselves are dim and imperceptible, as I'm sure the budget dictated, but not much was lost in checking out of those scenes. I would watch more movies like this.

"Great production, but a stale, long, boring execution","The King possesses a few intriguing elements, but it just isn't as interesting or powerful as you'd expect. The result is a monotonous film that should've been exciting instead of dull. Setting and location production value was great, but the 140 min runtime was ridiculously and unnecessarily long, and felt even longer with the slow pacing. If this film was played at 1.5x speed, its shorter length and faster pacing would've made this film more entertaining. Many scenes were too long/dragged out. Director/writer David MichÃ´d needed to make some serious edits and cuts to bring this film to a more ""suspenseful"" level (and length) of entertainment. Casting was excellent all around, especially Robert Pattinson who showed the most energy in his character, but I feel TimothÃ©e Chalamet was a poor choice for this role.

A far more praiseworthy Netflix Original. Bravo!,"Well-directed. Some exact historical details were a little unbelievable, but the film at least maintained a moderate sense of realism. Edgerton and Harris were absolutely spot on, as was the overall casting. Effects and costumes were top-notch. This is the best role I've seen for Timothee Chalamet, though I still feel he lacks dynamic and intensity to the point that he simply should never lead a cast, and I am still outraged at how miscast and how much he ruined Dune. That said, that was another film, and Timothee should be given credit here for punching above his weight. The film's score and cinematography were typical of many Netflix Originals, that is to say, AAA, their gloss hardly ever being an issue for me so much as their usually abysmal scripts, but here the script was strong, and the influence of great directors like Ridley Scott and John Boorman resonated throughout the film's overall style most wisely. Credit where it's due, a truly bold and beautiful Netflix Original that must be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History

not quite a true history- but worth seeing,"This was on at the London Film Festival. It is loosely based on fact, though there are three inaccuracies one about Thomas of Clarence , one about Falstaff and the other about the Dauphin of France. but they get the result of the Battle of Agincourt right.
The dialogue attempts to sound slightly Shakespearian but there are various phrases that grate on an English ear like "" lets go visit with Henry IV"" and ""in order to have reform you need regime change"", and a reference to the archbishop tasking.
We saw it with the HOH subtitles and there was a bit where a horse ""nickers"" which I assume is the American or aussie for whinny. The graphics are good- computer generated sailing ships,and a fairytale castle , The sets were shot in Hungary and feel genuinely medieval, costumes, props, battle scenes all done well. The acting is pretty wooden except for the Dauphin- straight out of Blackadder. It takes longer than it needs to to tell the story but its an enjoyable romp through ( somewhat inaccurate) history with plenty of gore and grunting.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Entertaining but inaccurate,"This is not a boring movie but it's far from being an epic one. It basically lacks the emotion that makes movies like Braveheart stand out.

"Great acting, story, and a direction that will put you on the edge of your seat.","The King (3.5 out of 5 stars).The King is a pretty fair historical drama film about King Henry IV of England. About a story when Henry gives his distant son Hal (Timothy Chalamet) the role of being king after his passing. Hal was always a drunk and distant son which Henry preferred his other younger son. Hal trying to correct the conflict that his father has left behind. He receives an insulting message from France. And an assassin sent by the French King. Which Hal prepares for war with the French.The plot is entertaining and worth watching if you care for historical dramas. Especially the story and setting taking place in the 15th century. The script and direction may be a little too long or prolonged in the second act of the movie. Which made it slow and boring in some parts.The acting is great with the performances by Timothy Chalamet as Hal. Joel Edgerton playing Falstaff, Hal's best friend and advisor. Sean Harris playing William, Hal's advisor. Ben Mendelsohn as the ill King Henry. And Robert Pattinson playing the Dauphin, the French King's son. Pattinson's performance as a French prince with the accent was something different.The direction of the historical drama is worth watching. The story behind King Henry's son Hal and his rise to ruling England and making it a peaceful place was good. There will be some slow parts which the film could have used some editing some scenes to help with the pace.The battle sequence is decent. It was a bit confusing with the chaotic battle with both armies crowding in. Making the characters feel claustrophobic and buried underneath the bodies.Overall, The King is a pretty fair film. The plot is good. The performances are great. And the direction is decent. The film suffers from weak pacing and prolonged scenes but it delivered telling this epic tale of these characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Netflix's Gem,"As a period piece, this is a rarity. In virtually every aspect, this film knocks it out of the park.The writing:it is easy to follow, even to somebody who doesn't know the life of Henry V at all.it is historically accurate, for the most part. Even down to the language, which was so beautifully written to match both the character's intention, their stature, and the nature of the time periodthe character development is incredible.The acting:as long as Timothee Chalamet is in it, you can trust it to be somewhat good. Chalamet, like always, brings his A-Game into a powerful role, and sells a level of stature beyond himself. It's pretty cool.Joel Edgerton is outstanding. It is truly amazing to find an actor that will make you genuinely feel and relate to their character, and this man did it for every line. Completely different to his role in Exodus, and he nails it.Robert Pattinson was the surprise standout performance of the film. Yes, he's in it. Yes, he is AMAZING.Finally, the directing:every single piece of blocking is so intricately choreographed that you have no question as to what is happening... you just know. You are taken away into the world of the 1400s.the action sequences in this film are stunning. I can't say much without spoilers, but from a filmmaking standpoint, they achieved a level of proficiency and excellency in violence caliber to none. Just watch it.Of course, the cinematography was also one of the best I've seen in a long time, as well as the score and makeup and costumes and all that jazz. But I think you get the picture. This isn't just a movie, it's a film. It's quite possibly THE Gem of Netflix Original Films",,Anonymous,History
Mediocre semi-historical drama,"The early years of Henry V are depicted, from his ascension to the throne of England to the British victory at Agincourt and its aftermath, based partly on history, partly on Shakespeare, and partly on nothing. TimothÃ©e Chalamet is OK (albeit looking a bit millennial) as the warrior king and the rest of the cast is fine other than Robert Pattinson as the 'Dauphin' (Louis, son of Charles VI), a ridiculous, sneering sadistic character who looks and acts like a Slytherin no-good who snuck over from a Harry Potter movie (the actual Dauphin was a frail, pious lad who was nowhere near the Agincourt battlefield). Having drawn inspiration from Shakespeare's semi-historical tale, the film can be allows some deviation from the truth but the ludicrous depiction of the Dauphin and the pointless alteration of established historical facts (such as the death of Henry's brother) did much to lower my opinion (as did the horribly clichÃ©d 'spin-flourish' when swords are unscabbarded). The climactic Battle of Agincourt is well done (but also suffers for inaccuracies). All in all: OK, but if you keen on watching the adventures of King Hal, consider Kenneth Branagh's grittier, more realist 1989 telling, or for a more fanciful, theatrical presentation, you can't go wrong with Sir Laurence Olivier's 1944 version.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Slow but Rewarding Retelling of Henry V Legend,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A powerful battle scene and TimothÃ©e Chalamet's fine performance does not an epic make.JIM'S REVIEW: It isn't easy being king, especially if you don't want the job. But duty calls, and Henry, Prince of Wales, or Hal to his friends, must fulfill his destiny in David MichÃ´d's historical drama, The King. The film is given the royal treatment with good production design, panoramic vistas, and lavish period costumes, with special mention to Nicholas Britell's elegant music score which elevates the film's pedigree to nearly epic stature. Yet, despite all of the filmmakers' noble quest for accuracy, the final result is a bit of a prodding melodrama lacking a strong narrative, compelling characters, and any real excitement.TimothÃ©e Chalamet has the title role as the unlikely king and this young and talented actor adds another thoughtful and convincing portrayal to his fine repertoire. As his loyal friend and mentor Falstaff, Joel Edgerton plays his character with no humor and a far too serious edginess but Sean Harris has some nice moments as the scheming William Gascoigne. Robert Pattinson is Hal's chief nemesis, the Dauphin of France, and he entertains in his few scenes, but his borderline campy buffoonish interpretation and thick French accent just does not gel with the serious trappings and undercuts the conflict and the character's needed menacing nature.Still, Mr. MichÃ´d directs with authority and he crafts his film with much flourish. But his screenplay, coauthored by Mr. Edgerton, gets bogged down in too much historical details, politics, and court intrigue while failing to establish well-drawn characters and interesting dialog. Everyone talks in dry expositional conversations with no genuine emotional heft. Everyone pouts and stares. Everyone broods excessively. But then, is anyone ever happy in the 15th century?As the battle lines are drawn between King Henry V of England and King Charles IV of France, the film starts to build some interest, especially in its very well-staged mud-soaked action sequence of The Battle of Agincourt, but this overall thrilling effect comes a little too late.(And let's face it, Mr. Chalamet's rousing pep-talk on the battlefield, sans Shakespeare's prose, pales by comparison.)The King strives for greatness but settles for conventional storytelling with just a tinge of mediocrity.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Peace Forged By Victory,"The King is getting compared to last year's 'The Outlaw King' quite a bit. Released on Netflix, period piece 'epic' war film, reluctant hero, etc. While certainly a fair comparison on the outskirts, I think The King deserves to be praised on its own merits, though both films are quite good. With a much slower burn, The King is a film largely about trying to fix the sins & mistakes of the previous reign/generation so that peace can be brought to the world, and it succeeds on almost every level at telling the story in that way. I was worried about Chalamet and Pattinson's accents, with only the latter feeling a tad off. But overall, this cast is magnificent, both leading men are surrounded by an incredibly talented character actor based group who know exactly what is needed of them to tell the story (or at least the beginning) of Henry V. Joel Edgerton absolutely steals this film from the get-go, and the final 15 minutes contain just enough surprises for the casual viewer. Loved this one.8.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Mixed.,"Beautifully shot by the extremely talented cinematographer Adam Arkapaw & with a surprisingly evocative score which literally gave me goosebumps during certain sequences (courtesy of Nicholas Britell), ""The King"" looks & sounds incredibly impressive, additionally boasting numerous effective & understated performances from recognisable household name actors - most notably from lead TimothÃ©e Chalamet who is simply magnetic on screen...But unfortunately, none of this compensates for the noticeable missed opportunities; multiple important events occur off screen & the plot is progressed through verbal exposition instead of visibly depicting the story as it unfolds, immediately breaking the ""show, don't tell"" golden rule of filmmaking. Hence, scenes are disjointed, often misconnected & incoherently constructed; giving a sense as though the feature was condensed & edited mercilessly until what must've been a 4 hour runtime was sliced to 140 minutes.Dialogue is clunky, verbose & regularly provides the impression rewrites were required in order to perfect & streamline the narrative before shooting; after witnessing ""Boy Erased"", the main culprit for this error would be Joel Edgerton - who is continually proving himself to be unfit for helming the scripting process.Questionable directorial decisions are made too: for instance, providing a character with a distracting lisp... Tonally, in such a brooding & atmospheric piece, a comical pronunciation felt out of place.It's a good film... Not remarkable. There was potential for it to be - but that was unfortunately never realised.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Top quality from Netflix...........at last !!,"For a while now Netflix has been flirting with the idea of releasing a film which is universally loved by the critics and audiences. An also one that could be recognised and respected by the film industry. One film to make people take Netflix seriously when it comes to its own film content it produces. I'm happy to say that this is the first on the list..........for me anyway.Now I know this film has done a good job for one really good reason. It got someone like me to watch it in the first place. I will be brutally honest I don't care about any stories or films about medieval times or Shakespeare...........any of that stuff. Its just not my thing...........thats not to say there aren't any great films about this topic cause there probably are. The reason it got me to watch it was the cast first and foremost. The talent that was involved in this film really drew me in because it was a combination of new talent and stars we are accustom to.Timothee Chalamet is a very young talented actor.............I am a firm believer that he will be the biggest film actor in years to come, because not only is he great but he chooses such interesting projects to do. Being English I was obviously going to be more critical on the accent of his.........well I was gonna pay more attention to it..........but wow extremely good. Overall a really really good performance. The other big standout and again with a great accent is Joel Edgerton............my oh my what a great and understated performance from Edgerton. He fit very well into the part and definitely was a great presence in the every scene he was in. Obviously Sean Harris was really good as well..............and shoutout to BATtinson.........oh sorry I mean Robert Pattinson, with another great accent in some incredibly tense and uncomfortable scenes.But what also separates this film from others Netflix has released prior is the directing, cinematography and production design, they are off the chain in this film. From start to finish this film is extremely beautiful to look at..........a very grounded feel to the film, Adam Arkapaw has done a great job. But more praise should be given to David MichÃ´d because his direction is brilliant.........some beautiful sweeping shots of the battlefields are incredible, they are heart pounding chaos. Definitely feels like a modern shot film but at no point is there an overuse of CGI or silly aerial shots that would feel out of place. Everything is shot in person on the ground to make it feel as if you're there everything step.Overall I really enjoyed the film its really good 80% out of 100, if it can get someone like me to not only watch it but to come out loving it then I cant see why it wouldn't do well with its actual target audience. Although saying that there are probably some historical nuts out there taring this film to pieces, but oh well !! Trust me I'd give it a go! Finally some top quality film content from Netflix !!!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very decent but flawed.,"Another interpretation of William Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" quite modernized starring two of Hollywoods most -in hotthrobes.
The execution is quite good with many epic moments, great production design and costume work. The story itself is interesting however the story telling sometimes a bit slow moving with the tendency to bore the audience a bit.
Performance wise it was convincing most of the time. TimothÃ©e Chalemet was as expected very good. Sometimes a bit one toned but skinny Timmy had indeed some memorable moments where he could show off his acting weapons. I also really liked Joel Edgerton. Thomasin McKenzie had an appearance but rather unnoticed and unspectacular.
Robert Pattinson was the weakest part, I can see why he was cast but I found his French accent rather a bit ridiculous and performance wise also not the most convincing stuff he did.
I assume the film could have been a bit shorter and probably had the same or even better effect. Still a good historical epic with many good scenes and a great look and feel in general. Nice atmosphere. Could just have worked a little on the direction and writing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
All Hail! Great Cinema,"I had the opportunity to see this movie in a theater a few days ago. I'm pleased to say that it was not a waste of time.

Hell Yes! Every single performer in this movie gave it everything they had and its all up there on the screen. The filmmakers and the actors have my respect and gratitude. And kudos to David MichÃ´d for landing TimothÃ©e Chalamet to play Hal. This kid is something else. He is absolutely fascinating to watch.

The King has more strength than I Expected,"Hal (Timothee Chalamet) receives word of his father's, the current King of England, illness. Right now, Hal is leading a quiet life as he has turned his back on his family. Hal soon finds himself in a challenging position and feels forced to accept the life he once tried to ignore. After his father dies, Hal becomes King Henry V and must now take over from where his father left off or perhaps... Hal might even take a different path all together, especially regarding war and delicate topics such as politics. Thankfully Hal won't be alone. Hal invites one of his closest, most trusted friends from his hometown, John Falsaff (played by Joel Edgerton). In the past John was once a knight but in the present day he spends most of his time sleeping and drinking beer.For the history and Shakespeare buffs out there, I can warn you in advance to keep an open mind while watching the film. This film does in fact take a different path at multiple times compared to what the history books may actually tell you.The introduction to ""The King"" is a slow burn. We gain a basic understanding of Hal and his life, but the story goes back and forth as he talks with his father and mopes around in his current life. Needless to say, once Hal is crowned King Henry V, I found myself rather curious and wishing to progress further into this film.Visually, The King is a great looking film. Cinema buffs who own the latest high resolution TVs will be impressed with the film. The image quality for Landscapes and Costume designs should also be praised here.As for performances, ""The King"" is generally loaded with positive experiences. Actor Tim Chalamet as the lead role was generally fine but I felt he got better as the film progressed (and no, I'm not just talking about his character). Robert Patterson I would say for most part was also fine. Solid praise should go out to Joel Edgerton who manages to deliver a fun and heartfelt performance and was easily one of the best elements of this film.As a plot, apart from the slow start (20-30mins in), I generally found myself enjoying the film more as it progressed. Naturally the film builds up to a bloodbath finale.Overall, The King has more strengths than weaknesses. Praise goes out to the supporting cast such as Joel Edgerton. As a plot, it's a slow beginning but worth while if you can push through it. The film's visuals are also enjoyable and solid considering this is now a Netflix exclusive in Australia.6.6/10

Expectations weren't met,"This film had high praise and quite good review from various film critics coming from film festivals. So at first glance the film seemed to be filled with a great cast and a promising director. Many of the cast members had proven to show great performances so acting wise I had expectations. However, I felt that TimothÃ¨e Chalamet was the wrong choice for Hal. His accent wasn't convincing and didn't feel natural throughout the film. At times you could even hear his American accent which lost the authenticity of the character. Whereas I thought Joel Egerton was very good and provided a good side character that was needed. The standout for me was definitely Robert Pattinson. His french accent was on point and very authentic, at times some of the pronunciations of words didn't seem right but overall was good. My only issue was that the he was in the film for a very short time and didn't show his presence enough. The dialogue was okay for him but there is one joke made by him that evidently was funny but didn't suit the atmosphere of the film and how people would actually talk during the 15th century. I also disliked the way his character eventually dies. And if it is accurate to history then fair. But his death was extremely stupid and removed any prowess that he processed as a character. But his performance saved the character. The script was messy at times and that's shown when a actor writes and script and not a proclaimed screen writer who could have easily elevated the film on many levels. The film was quite long and slow paced. It definitely could have cut down the film by 15-20 minutes. I thought that the cinematography was good and the battle scene at France was excellently made. It felt gritty and historic to how war really was depicted. Chalamet was extremely good in this part showing his excellent training that really paid off. For me the film is being praised and disregarded in the wrong areas. Chalamet is getting positive attention to one of his weaker performances and Pattinson is being overlooked even when he is clearly the standout. The battle scene is being overlooked for being 'too muddy' which is wrong in every sense. Also a true historian wouldn't like this film based on the inaccuracies in the film. But if you are not into history. The inaccuracies won't bother you.
But overall this is a watchable film but not at the standard some people are putting it to be. With better acting choices such as Dacre Montgomery who was also up for the part of Hal would have been the perfect choice based on his audition tape that really showed brilliant acting that Chalamet didn't in show.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Unfortunately it could have been put to much better use had the writing been more subtle, maybe the writers could have taken their time to reflect on Shakespeare's writing, who knows, maybe they even did. Henry's drive and ambitions could have been much deeper than merely the maturing of young rebellion.
Without getting into spoilers, Catherine's scene could have been dealt a lot better and given real depth to her, much of what she said could have been acted out instead, as would befit such a conversation, and such a time.",6.0,Anonymous,History

An excellent screenwriting in my opiniÃ³n, gets elevated from the simple of the argument to the highest thanks to the actors and actress performance.
The photography and customs are on point and the sound i found it considerably outstanding.

Passable movie,"Historically Inaccurate even by Shakespeare's standard. The armor Henry wore during the battle of Agincourt reeked of 'we need to show the actor's face'. I mean come on! he has a mail hoodie which he didn't even wear on his head. I do give props though for not using swords as the Knight's main weapon during battle.The acting is good, although Robert Pattinson's french accent really bothered me and I couldn't take it seriously. The story though is different, it bothered me a lot. not just because of its historical inaccuracies but also on how the characters were portrayed. This is not an acting problem because as I have said the actors did well it is more on the directing or writing side of things where this movie fell short.

We need more period pieces these days.,"If you have a problem with historical inaccuracy, just straight out avoid this film. Having said that, The King is a valid fictitious portrait of actual historic events and lives such as that of Henry V, appreciably portrayed by TimothÃ©e Chalamet, in a correct performance that doesn't strike at first but slowly begins to entice. Historical subject matter is dealt with care and attention to details, minus some historical facts which history buffs are not even done complaining about.When I was watching the film, it felt slow and tedious in some moments, unable to grab my attention to its full extent. The pacing can be quite damaging to this film, although it's easy to confuse slow pacing with slow tension-building moments, which are done purposefully to generate impact at certain points in the film.Perhaps you could compare this film with Kenneth Brannagh's 1989 film Henry V, which was adapted from the Shakespeare play, and its dialogue is million miles away from the one in The King, but both portray king Henry V in different manners, in different tones even, with both title performances being up to par. Robert Pattinson's performance is excellent, if there is someone who shines in a role, it is him, without a doubt, and his French accent is delightful.Whether you are into English history or are a fan of Shakespeare's Henry V, you probably won't enjoy much of The King, but you could certainly try if you want to.

Slow burning and beautiful with strong performances,"Quite frankly, long battle sequences is like the most boring thing. And this film basically revolves around a war. But it's not what stays with me after it's over and essentially not really what I think it's about - to me it's more about family. Solitude. Responsibility.

It seems Pattinson would have fit the role of the King much better, especially when it comes to the action scenes, for which he is much more physically suited. I found Chalamet as the ""heroic knight"" figure quite unbelievable simply because of his tiny frame and somewhat sickly look.

Slow and Dark,"Inaccurate portrayal of history, it is still engrossing at times. Chalomet's broody emo Hal does not appeal to me. He looks like he belongs in a Twilight movie. It is very visually dark and best viewed in a dark room. It takes concentration to follow.",6.0,Anonymous,History
What A Mess,"Let's get the simple stuff out of the way first:1) The people who made this film have never cracked a history book in their lives. They don't know anything about the period the film is set in, or the real people and real events they were trying to portray. Apart from getting some people's names and a couple of locations right, they fail at literally everything. It would actually be hard to get this much wrong if you weren't deliberately trying to do so. With so much going on, statistically one would be likely to get more right simply by chance if the script were being handled by chimpanzees.Shakespeare took his share of liberties with the story of Henry V, but then, his audience was literally Henry's descendants, so he had a particular motivation to portray things in a certain light. One cannot imagine what the writers of this mess had as motivation. The story they are telling is supposedly a blend of history and Shakespeare, but they utterly fail at being faithful to either the events or the spirit of both. I suppose I could have just left this portion of the review at ""they utterly fail.""Agincourt, the battle on which the entire story revolves, was a brilliant and incredibly dramatic battle. A faithful depiction of the battle would have cost no more resources, been no more difficult to portray or for the audience to follow, and would have been vastly more visually impressive and dramatically impactful than the bout of silly fantasy we are instead treated to. If you watched that and thought, ""This is what a medieval battle would really look like,"" your education is lacking and you should consider picking up one of Bernard Cornwell's excellent novels of the period as a primer.2) I cannot for the life of me fathom why there are two 21st century characters shoehorned into the middle of this 15th century story. It's not just that Prince Hal/Henry V does not even remotely resemble the real person- it's that even if this were a made up character in a fantasy tale he would still appear six centuries out of place. He is entirely composed of silly 21st century notions about kingship, war, relationships, etc. And Catherine of Valois is even more ridiculous than he is. ""All monarchy is illegitimate,"" says the future queen. If that wasn't a laugh line, I don't know why they included it.3) I could go on, but this is getting long already, so I'll summarize. The pacing is awful, the dialogue is often painful. I'm not one of those who enjoys Shakespearean language (I'd rather have a faithful modern version of the wording), but at least Shakespeare's dialogue is intelligent, unlike this nonsense. Some of the performances would probably have been impressive if they hadn't been wading through such utter nonsense. And why is Falsaff here? He's a fictional character ripped from Shakespeare, but entirely divorced from the actual Shakespearean character. He simply makes no sense, despite Joel Edgerton's herculean efforts.In short, fools may like this film, but it is bad history, abysmal Shakespeare, and poor film making. I highly recommend watching Henry V (1998) instead, for a much better telling of a similar story.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow and Inaccurate, but Solid Nonetheless","The King follows Henry V from his drunken antics as a prince through to his first victory in France. Of course first thing's first with this kind of movie; it's exactly that, a movie. This is not a documentary. It's a piece of thrilling entertainment based just as much on Shakespeare's play than it is on actual historical records. To treat it as anything other than that would simply be unfair to the film's intent. There's a lot in here that isn't accurate, such as the plot behind the scenes, or the strategies used at the Battle of Agincourt. But on the flipside there's a lot here that does feel authentic, and I feel like it struck the right balance between fictional entertainment and brutal realism.The movie can feel slow at times, as long stretches of time can go by without anything bombastic happening. The first hour of the movie follows Henry as a prince, resisting the crown and seeking solace in his own brand of peace, before being thrust into leadership after a dying father. While slow, I didn't mind this section much because it took the time to really establish Henry's character and his borderline pacifist nature. It gave him trauma and motivation in an abusive father, and laid the stage for the French campaign. It's not until halfway into the movie that the French campaign even begins, and even then it's a slow start thanks to a castle siege depicted as slow and uneventful as a castle siege would really be. It all culminates in the Battle of Agincourt and the French surrender, leaving ten to fifteen minutes for a coda at the end, complete with story-defining plot twist. Pacing is not this movie's strongest suit, that's for sure, but for me it never dragged and kept my attention throughout.Arguably The King's most visceral aspect would be its battles and fights. While the Battle of Agincourt lacks the historical accuracy of the strategies utilised, it worked because the focus was put on the press in the muddy field, complete with claustrophobia and brutal, ugly brawling. In many ways it felt reminiscent of the Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones, which is certainly no complaint. When charged by a vanguard of cavalry, the hero of the battle doesn't casually step aside and carve the horse in half, dismounting its rider. Instead the horse crashes into the line and the hero is catapulted off his feet into the line of men behind him. Similarly Henry's challenge early on starts out like knights in shining armour, but a sword fight quickly becomes a wrestling brawl on the ground, clanking armour plates, and exhausted breathing from both parties. Even the siege in its uneventful presentation still felt surprisingly visceral as three trebuchets launch flaming projectiles into the castle day and night, and the looming threat of hunger and disease is never forgotten.Another aspect in The King's favour lies in its pure acting talent. I didn't always dig it as sometimes it felt like certain actors were taking the film too seriously, begging for awards with gravely whispers erupting into dominating shouts, but that's honestly not much of a criticism. Hey actors, how dare you take your craft seriously and put out great performances! TimothÃ©e Chalamet was the worst offender for this, but he pulls off the role of Henry V so well, balancing the tender desire for peace with the anger and authority required to be a strong leader. His portrayal was definitely full of layers worthy of dissection. Ben Mendelsohn chewed up his small runtime the only way he can, Sean Harris played the advisor William with as much ingenuity as required, Joel Edgerton was the perfect best friend, tired soldier, and wise mentor. And then there's Robert Pattinson who took his role as The Dauphin as seriously as was necessary and had fun sinking into the role of a slimey, privileged villain. His French accent was not authentic at all, but deliberately so, mocking Henry and the English and insulting their language.The third big plus for The King comes from Nicholas Britell's domineering score as it sweeps high and low and keeps the plodding pace of the movie moving ever forward. It embraces the medieval setting with authentic-sounding instrumentation and composition, while also maintaining a brooding string section throughout. It is equal parts melancholic and bombastic, changing as required without losing its uniform tonal quality that brings the whole film together. Similarly Adam Arkapaw's cinematography once again proves he deserves to be up there with Deakins and Hoytema. Every shot is oozing with artistic merit worthy of being framed, and the Battle of Agincourt wouldn't have been nearly as spectacular to watch without his eye behind it. For me his most successful shots lie in the more subdued and tender moments, framing a solder against a sunset, or the montage of trebuchets in the siege, or the decidedly muted colour pallet in the royal courts.The King has some big problems, mostly in pacing, historical accuracy, and mumbling line delivery, but when it does something right, it goes the extra mile. Chalamet is great as Henry V, offering us an interesting character to follow and sink our teeth into, the battles and action scenes feel true to realism despite how inaccurate they might be, focussing on both the thrill and monotony of war and not hiding from the brutality of either, and in almost all technical regardless I don't have a single complaint. I give The King a good 7/10, pushing up the higher end to an 8, but not quite topping the crest.https://qyrosmovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History

This film is at its most masterful in the moments of silence,"A great film. Absolutely fantastic. A showcase for great directing and a showcase for great acting.David MichÃ´d - intentionally or not - creates a Denis Villeneuve feel in the directing of this film. Something I love and I wish more would emulate or expand on.It is a slow, calm, burn, and a brilliant use of subtle tension created by moments of silence between serious men. Something that must be challenging to risk doing in this era of endless public demand for overdone CGI, shakey fight sequences, frivolous narrative pushing, and talking racoons saving the universe.It is also excellently acted, and the first time I noticed that TimothÃ©e Chalamet, for all his petite size, has a hell of a presence when he taps into it. I later confirmed this with his part in Dune. Since watching ""The King"" I have now noticed him in other films where previously I hadn't.Joel Edgerton fits his role perfectly and plays it well, and even Robert Pattinson who I normally cannot abide, is fantastic in the role of the insipid and smoulderingly aggressive french Dauphin. So very him.Sean Harris also stands as one of the four pillars of this film. Presenting as a classic Englishman who has been through one King and knows the ropes, he is tired, he is old, and really just wants to retire leaving a legacy he can feel proud of, and yet he is capable of surprising us unexpectedly in the best, or maybe the worst, of ways.Ben Mendlesohn isnt really in it long enough to do more than set the film in motion, but when isnt he great in a role?I loved this film. Everything about it. It stirred my manly sense of self, and made me want to put on chain mail and go fight for England. It also highlighted the emotional connection between men of strength capable of violence, that so few seem to be aware of.More battles should take place in mud, filmed without jiggy camera movement, and be presented in the way the field of Agincourt was in this one. Intimate violence, filmed in full, and incredibly engaging throughout.To say anything more would introduce spoilers, but if you havent watched it, save it for a rainy Sunday afternoon where you are slowed down enough to appreciate a good film, at a realistic pace, a convincing film, and with not a single talking racoon in sight.Top marks, and a well-deserved standing ovation from me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A beautiful fantasy ... Style over substance.,"From a production and artistic perspective the film leaves a positive impression on the viewer. Beautiful cinematography accompanied by an impressive score, elevate the fantastic performances of the cast.The script leaves somewhat to be desired particularly because it is superficially inspired by the Shakespeare play rather than the historical accounts of the events depicted. The movie quickly departs from realism and into the realm of fantasy, taking massive liberties with the characters and events in the film.The depiction of Henry V as a young, naive and gullible boy, that is reticent towards going to war with France, is the complete opposite of the real King Henry V, resulting in an unfortunate main character that is lost and directionless. The performance of Timothee Chalamet was excellent but it was unfortunately sabotaged by the mediocre script.The final battle of Agincourt was a total dissapointment. Falling back into the same, overused and silly hollywood tropes (see archers shooting up in volleys), the scale of the battle and tactical brilliance of Henry V is completely lost.The legendary clash between 15.000 French mounted knights and the 8000 equally legendary English longbowmen was turned into nothing more than a brawl in the mud and a dissapointing ending duel that doesn't even take place. (Sidenote; Louis, the King of France's son, was never even present at the battle of Agincourt.)Overall, the film takes a step in the right direction, showing that film makers are starting to respect viewer's more by portraying the medieval period in a more realistic and believable way. That being said, it falls way short of being anything more than an average representation, with many flaws, errors, falacies and unwarranted creative liberties.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Agincourt - a bar brawl with punching and mud-wrestling,"Inaccuracies aside this film made a valiant effort to look, and sound historical and up until the actual battle of Agincourt (basically its climax) it was almost getting away with it. Agincourt, however was a huge disapointment.
I was a member of a longbow society, have been to Agincourt (now Azincourt) have visited the battlefield (virtually unchanged) and the impressive museum in the small village. I have read extensively about the battle and know what a mere 60lb draw weight longbow can do over 150 -200 yards [The archers of 1415 used between 90 and 120 lb bows)
This film rode roughshod (pardon the pun) over the whole progression of the battle - The desperate state of the English army, the squabbling and competitive lack of unity amongst the French nobles, the terrain of the battlefield, the use of swiss mercenary crossbowmen, the whole class divide between the archers and the knights they so ruthlessly slaughtered, all in favour of a jolly romp in the mud with chaps punching away at each other in suits of armour (DON'T try punching someone in a suit of armour, it hurts!) . Even the killing of the prisoners (still a sore point for the French) was portrayed as almost as aruthless, post battle act of revenge. The battle was stilll raging and the English just didn't have enough guards for what was in effect another army in their rear.",4.0,Anonymous,History

However, some seem to know what is in their presence and what step to take next - but it is so boringly written I cannot feel as much invested in these characters as I want to (and that is not because of the Shakespearean language).The pacing killed me. Though valuable for the film's style, it could've easily been shortened with more intriguing dialogue. I wasn't far off taking a nap several times...All in all, a 6/10 mediocre film with interesting characteristics. Had potential, but lost it several times.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Who recognizes the problems of wearing the crown during his reign as one of loneliness, who shows strength and courage. All of these qualities of restraint and strength to all be tossed aside in the last two scenes for a woman who he doesn't know, who acts like her brother (Dauphin character) did (Arrogant, dismissive, and berating).

Neither historical nor entertaining - A rather dull effort by MichÃ´d,"While I appreciate Netflix for still financing big budget historical epics in a time when no major studio does, I couldn't help but feel quite disappointed by David MichÃ´d's THE KING.Once you look past its stunning visuals, there is really not much substance to the film. Being almost entirely deprived of historical markings - e.g. location informations, time specifications or even just names of historical figures - and filled with inaccuracies, THE KING basically fails as a historical film. Now, that in itself wouldn't be a problem as shown by films like BRAVEHEART, which are highly inaccurate in their depiction of historic events and figures, but nevertheless work from a cinematic perspective. MichÃ´d however, who clearly wants his film to play out as a dramatic character study, never achieves depth, empathy or even a sense of urgency for his story to be told at all.Watching this film, its obvious flaws made me think a lot about last year's OUTLAW KING. But while Mackenzie's Netflix epic at least had an exciting core to it as well as somewhat compelling characters backed up by memorable performances, THE KING is ultimately a dull and sluggish two-and-a-half-hour drag. And who on earth thought casting Robert Pattinson as the (English-speaking!) Dauphin of France was a good idea? At a time when this man is starring in films like GOOD TIME and THE LIGHTHOUSE, MichÃ´d's script manages to craft a role that may be good meme material but is embarassing to watch and almost an insult to Pattinson as an actor.In the end, THE KING is a very average film, potentially boosted by great visuals and an undeniably high production value. Thinking about all the talent involved though, it's definitely one of the bigger disappointments of 2019.",5.0,Anonymous,History

TimothÃ©e Chalamet's Henry V matures from a long-haired drunkard to a powerful, but unusually pacifist, king, who sports a sober bowl cut. He grows further into a decisive, remorseless, wartime leader. Chalamet's expressive eyes expose these changes. Robert Pattison's Dauphin gives a few moments of light humour.

Ups en downs in gemiddelde film,"Toegegeven: Henry IV / V zijn niet de beste stukken van Shakespeare. Prima dat je ze eens in de zoveel jaar afstoft en weer eens probeert. Dat is met mate / gemiddeld gelukt. Henry wordt vrij donker, gepijnigd neergezet door Timothy Chalamet. Hij maakt er het beste van en overtuigt wel als koning tegen wil en dank. Zijn kompaan Fallstaff is een mooie rol die er uitspringt. Goed neergezet. Voor de rest vooral vrij rauwe scÃ¨nes in een vlakke film vol intriges en verhaallijnen uit de middeleeuwen. Meer van hetzelfde. Gaven geen nieuwe inzichten. Pattison als Franse kroonprins was om te huilen. Volstrekt ongeloofwaardig en tweedimensionaal.

Completely fictional account,"The film is a completely fictional non-historical film set in a 15th century England and France.

Kill them all!,"This is a dark movie, brilliantly photographed and acted, maybe historically incorrect...but who wants to watch a High School History lesson in cinema?Watching Chalamet as King Henry with his angel like face demanding to kill all the prisoners of war was a moment which gave me goose bumps all over, one of many intense moments this movie offers. The Battle scenes are spectacular.
Chalamet is the most talented and gifted actor of his generation.
I hope he'll be having a great career ahead, as long as he stays true to the seriousness and the depth of his acting. He has a wide range of emotions to offer, between anger, fear, sorrow and sensitivity.
And that wars have always been built on fake reasons and lies...thanks for the screenplay to make me realize that.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Balanced piece of cinema,"Some reviews criticise the historical accuracy and literary origin of this film, but is it claiming to be a documentary or Shakespearean piece? No. So why fuss about that.
The script and acting is splendid. The way that Chalamet brings the character to life with an old-style English feels natural and true instead of a stiff play. The lighting and the battles also stood out to me. The darkness within the buildings of the time is not often shot so accurately. Nor is the clunky, exhasperating fighting with heavy armour and weapons. Usually battle scenes are made up of flashes, so that you can't pick it apart. It's nice to follow the main character throughout the scene and really see what's happening. Also great: fightscenes where main characters do not posess superhuman abilities.
Some found The King too long or tedious. I say it is nicely paced, doesn't feel rushed to get to the action-filled bits, but takes the time to develop its characters and politics.

Very disappointed,"This movie takes itself too seriously, and not in a good way. It doesn't do the material justice, and I hate to say it, the most disappointing part is Chalamet. I really loved his performance in Call Me By Your Name, but after that something missing in his acting. This one, in particular, I have to say his accent is quite off in many scenes, which really bothers me. The way he talks (always low voice) and his performance in general needs some work. I watched the movie twice, once only listening without watching, and the problem becomes more obvious, especially compared to the other actors. He can't take the sole blame though, as the pace of the movie has some problems too. I applaud his courage to take on this role, but it doesn't provide the sparkle it should have.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Imperfect in some small ways, but overall a truly great telling.","Ok, there are a few artificial and modern devices and phrases thrown in that seem forced and a bit of PC nonsense. The do mar the surface of this screenplay and production a bit from perfect to nearly perfect. But so too do verbatim Shakespeare productions with his anachronisms, kowtowing to the then contemporary sensibilities and interests of the Tudor court, and his glossing of the Hundred Year War chevauchee warfare (going around the countryside and killing all the villagers and farmers when your 'noble' opponents won't leave their castles) -- which in modern times would be classified as a major war crime. So this is a ""based on"" story written by one side, just as all of Shakespeare and virtually all war stories are since the Iliad itself.
Even Hollow Crown, which is at least a star or two above this in quality, strains against the dishonesty in some of the source material.So aside from script writing/dialogue of this which is above average but does not excel, the rest shows talent and and an overall well done and entertaining work. Clearly they had to pick a young heartthrob actor for Henry V to have a prayer of getting the valued younger demographic viewer , but given so many of them are without talent, the lead actor, Timothee Chalamet, is quite talented and able to carry this film well. Sean Harris, has graduated from his whispering almost mumblecore Borgia days and is great. The rest of the cast is quite good, although Robert Pattinson seems to half play his part as camp and that is a tiny bit distracting.Overall though this is much better than Netflix's record of mediocre productions. Certainly accessible to all audiences as well, especially compared for example to the Hollow Crown, which as I noted is considerably better acting, but not really accessible to people not already familiar with the major events and characters from Richard II to Henry V.",,Anonymous,History

That being said, the acting and cinematography are excellent - albeit a cringey performance from Pattinson. It's really a shame that the story was lacking.

Better than Expected,"I'm glad I did check this out, because this film is certainly a step up from some of the Netflix releases I've seen from last year. To a point, I understand most of the middling reviews for this film. It's not perfect, far from it: it's a bit too long; Timothee Chalamet acts circles around everyone else on screen; and I will admit that some of the scenes in the first half of the film that feature Falstaff away from Hal are rather unnecessary. Some of the writing, too, feels a bit over-earnest, and at times a bit cheesy, but there are other moments where the writing soars (Chalamet's speech before the final battle). This film teetered on a 3.5/5 and 4/5 star rating the whole time I was writing my review, and I decided to give it a 4/5 star. There are issues with this film; I wont pretend there aren't. But this film also shows a lot of improvement over some of the direct-to-Netflix releases I've seen recently. I would much rather have films like this, that fall make a vie for greatness and fall just shy, than I would have a dozen more middling, soulless, committee-written-and-approved Marvel movies.

Crime against late medieval realism (specially early 15th century which period is depicted in the movie); avarage expereince,"I am a man who is quite knowledgeable in history, whose authenticity and accuracy are important. Obviously, a perfectly authentic film is almost impossible to make, I wouldn't expect it, and of course, movie is movie. But nowadays, there are plenty of options at your fingertips. Since this movie is a historical one, you need to test its authenticity!
First of all, I would start by saying that this movie is not bad, but unfortunately it is not good either. I'm a little disappointed... Just a little bit, because I saw in the trailer what the movie would be like... In my opinion Netflix wants to compete with the HBO Game of Thrones (which is a big mistake in such a historical movie) and the crew (and many others, unfortunately) are very misinformed about what the late medieval Europe was look like. There are many stereotypes...
I understand that the budget was fundamentally low, and that movie is partly based on Shakespeare Henry V's (which in itself makes the film in many ways inaccurate in itself, mainly in terms of events), but the former reasons do not explain the more historical inaccuracy. I've read reviews (both here and elsewhere) that sets and costumes are realistic... No, not realistic! The whole environment is too dark, the costumes are not authentic, understated and too colorless and for example I don't see any skinny dresses on man (which was very popular back then). Medieval people loved colors! From the points discussed above, Henry V (1944) is much better. And then there is the ""battle"" (of Agincourt) (which is not entirely bad, there are right moments), which is like the BotB in GoT (sad). The Battle of Agincourt in this movie is too chaotic, unrealistic, with mistakes, for examples: mounted men-at-arms have no lances, there is no French dismounted men-at-arms and infantry (crossbowmen), English and Welsh archers are ""shooting"" at the wrong angle with their longbows, no sticks, etc. And finally there is the siege, which is worse than the battle (very minimalist)... Some (major) mistakes of many: the besieged place (Harfleur) is not a castle, but a port city, instead of trebuchets should have been used guns, no mining, etc. Sad because I was expecting something from this movie, but it seems to be so telling.

Oh, and Henry actually looks like the real Henry. I can't tell the filmmakers how important that is. There's an overall darkness, that is, low light, to the piece.

The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, ""butter wouldn't melt"" image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn't really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by ""Bambi"" back in 1942.

You take the wins with the losses.,"The King is based on plays written by William Shakespeare ""Henriad"", which were based on actual events. The movie has taken some liberty to change things here and there to move the story along, most notably the character of Sir Falstaff, King Henry's most loyal confidante in the movie but was disregarded as a fool and jester with no clear ending in the play (boo! loved the right knee bit.) The haircut is real, the immediate marriage to Princess Catherine isn't (took five years later, lasted only five months, reuniting when he was on his deathbed.) All the politicizing must have been real, as you know one thing humans are consistent with is greed.Timothee Chalamet proved he has already earned his stripes tackling this role with ease, a testament to the great actor he's slowly becoming. He has proven 'Call Me By Your Name' was not a fluke and that he can go as far back as the 1400s to add a scrawny yet authoritative King Henry to his Filmography. Robert Pattinson was larger than life, as was intentioned by the writer but there were moments where he came off as trying too hard. But the commitment was there to see the character through and he deserves praise for that. Note that Chalamet whose father is French plays an English king while Pattinson who is English plays a French prince. Lilly Rose-Depp, Chalamet's on and offscreen partner was only in the movie for a short time but managed to make her impact. Dean Chapman (who we adored in Game of Thrones, right?) was cast again as a prince eager to prove his claim to the throne.The set design paled in comparison to big-budgeted films but it's good enough if we're not being too picky. That drone shot mirroring Jon Snow gasping for air in the Battle of the Bastards, they knew would elicit comparison which they didn't seem to mind. As far as historical war movie goes, this isn't bad, but it isn't the most memorable. There have been many Shakespeare adaptations before and there will be many more to come. Unfortunately, this might get lost in the shuffle just as Prince Dauphine did in the battle of Agincourt.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Beautifully shot but hollow,"First of all, I think a lot of Netflix historical efforts get short shrift. I have enjoyed Marco Polo, Medici, and even the Troy series which many people on  voted down. Outlaw King was an enjoyable yarn if a bit heavy on tropes we've seen too many times. All of them I had no problem finishing, however, this film from David Michod I could not finish. I tried to watch another film by Michod, the Rover, a year ago and couldn't finish it either. Both that film and this one are technically well executed, the dialogue is grounded, there are no obvious and irritating plot holes and yet I at least can never connect with any of his protagonists. This is strange because Guy Pearce in the Rover is quite sympathetic, so it's not whats on the paper but the execution of it that fails.It takes guts to rewrite a period in history that has already been covered by Shakespeare, and it can be done successfully but I don't think it's been done well here. If this is a success for Netflix I hope it leads to more high end historical productions but I felt the need to check the hype on this one.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

Only few things I liked about this movie, like catapult's effect and especially knight's armour, because it was so real and showed it's heaviness if you're the one to wear it. Acting was poorly executed and Robert did no more than others. Whole movie you're waiting for that last battle, 'till it happens - you're just bored or offline already.

Kind of boring but still watchable,"If you have enough patience to sit through it. There were lot of moments you just felt you'd give up, because there were so many moments that not just slow, staggering or even stagnant. But at least this movie was without disgusting CGI effect, explosions, crazy soundtrack, stupid over-the-top makeup. The tempo was extremely slow, but the dialog was still quite intelligent enough. Acting of all the actors was pretty good, they were just enslaved by a very slow script with very uninspiring conversation among the characters. The head chopping scene in early British style punishment looked quite shockingly real. If it's in 3-D, the head might rolling out of the screen and ended up on your lap.All in all, it's watchable, not great, not even would move you emotionally. Forget about what some of the reviewers' accusations about not matching the exact historical facts. Give it a rest, will you? This a dramatized movie adapted and roughly used some history as the background. You don't have to check your history textbook moment by moment, scene by scene, to see if it's correct. If you're so split-hair stubborn, try to find some BBC documentary stuff to satisfy you. Why can't you just put everything you knew or learned in the class aside, and watch it without any self-bondage or binding. It's just a movie, for Christ's sake!",,Anonymous,History
Slow moving historical drama,"If you're a history buff with an interest in seeing real life events dramatised on the screen then this film is for you. If you're looking for something with lots of action and excitement then you should look elsewhere. This movie tells the story of King Henry V of England's rise to the throne and his war with the French and decisive and important victory at Agincourt. The thing, of course, is that while the story is broadly based on actual events, it does not stick to the facts. Instead, it embellishes, changes and sometimes omits what actually happened in the interests of making a good movie. If you're wanting a history lesson this isn't it. There is no question that this movie is brilliantly acted and executed, but it is pretty slow going for the most part and takes a while to actually get interesting. I resisted the impulse to abandon it early on and by the time the battle scene came around I was glad I persevered. In the end though, I was left feeling pretty unmoved by it all and doubt I'd be bothered watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Dark and gritty take on Shakespeare,"The King is a suitably dark and gritty adaptation of Shakespeare's Henriad play's, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 and Henry V. Avoiding the warlike triumphalism of some of the previous adaptations, King Henry V is portrayed here as a reluctant monarch and quiet pacifist forced into a war he doesn't want. The film is probably more accurate to actual history than the sanitised version presented in Shakespeare's plays. The battle scenes are bloody, brutal and dirty. The key battle of Agincourt is presented as a muddy quagmire of hand to hand combat rather than the heroic battle of legend. The film shows the brutal reality of medieval warfare and ultimately its futility.Timothee Chalamet as Henry V and Joel Edgerton as Falstaff both put in strong performances while there are good cameos from Robert Pattinson, Ben Mendelssohn and Lily-Rose Depp. And the film is visually impressive.The one downside are the accents. French-American actor Timothee Chalamet struggles with the English accent while English actor Robert Pattinson makes a laughable attempt at a French accent in playing The Dauphin. One can't help but wonder if they might have been better off switching roles.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Total trash, ludicrously historically inaccurate, terrible casting","Timothee Chalamet has to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Nothing about his performance is convincing as a king, nor does he have any personality. All he tries to do is put on a practiced expression learned in a modeling cast. Whenever his mouth is opened, it betrays his lack of competency as an actor. His pre-battle speech at Agincourt is absolutely underwhelming and lame. He and other actors in the film are clean-shaven and pretty but in spite of what untrustworthy commenters claim, you can see that many men in paintings had beards at the time. The film tries to be a jack of all trades to attract girls to watch a movie that they're most likely to not have any interest in. It's ridiculous.It's absolutely historically inaccurate and lacking in charm. Last year's Robert The Bruce movie was really historically inaccurate too, but at least it was enjoyable. This one is just bad. What, in one scene, Henry V is walking point at the head of a column into an unknown village? Seriously guys? That would never happen, sorry! There is one scene at the end of the battle where a prominent ruler is killed that is absolutely ludicrous because he would have been worth a fortune in ransom.

Definitely Not a Film to be judged by it's Beginning.,"At the beginning of this film, I thought, oh no, a high school emo film *cringe*
However, from the point where Hal becomes king, this film just takes off. I guess, upon reflection, that these people were teenagers, and the rather childish scenes at the beginning are actually very clever if viewed as establishing a status quo which the course of events within the film thoroughly disrupts.
The action, especially the scenes of war, are dark and gritty and really exceptional. I am so pleased that these are in no way hokey. Too often films represent medieval warfare as a bunch of knights in gleaming armour, posturing with swords as though they and their armour weigh nothing; but this was so much more realistic. I'm a fan of compelling war scenes, and this film has them.
I thought the acting was really good across the board, even from people who I don't normally like. A special mention goes to Joel Edgerton, a brilliant Australian actor who always convinces. His portrayal of Falstaff was perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Just not sure,"Ok, as far as Netflix fare goes this is probably among the best it has to offer, although that's not saying too much. The King was ok - it looked good, and the acting was reasonable.

Most of us are quite capable of working that out for ourselves!I found the whole thing a little overblown, and even forced. When compared to something like Wolf Hall for instance this is rather pale fare.So 6 points out of 10 for Joel Edgerton for his accent, which was great, and for the overall look of the film, but that's all.

"Great Movie, awful history.....","This is a bit of a tough one. Part of me wishes to sing this movies' praises as a gripping tale, well told. It certainly is that. That said, the movie is completely a-historical. This just isn't, at all, how these events went down. It makes me wonder how we would judge a movie that simply, in a straightforward manner, portrayed WWI with Germans winning. That would be kind of weird... right?! As such I'm going to give it a compromise 7. As a more overt piece of historical fiction, I would give a 9 or 10. But given this drapes itself in a historical gloss, I'm subtracting points.Now I get those reviewers who will reply that this movie does not bill itself as a documentary... but historical quibbles aren't the issue here. This movie just makes stuff wholesale. You might as well call the king Jason the V, or Fred the V...

Hmm,"Ironic the treatment that this is getting by so many, considering everybody was bashing Mary Queen of Scots for being historically inaccurate - for all the same reasons. At least they were obvious about it and didn't try to hide it like this one, which only people reading up on it will figure out. It is quite wrong, to the point where it's weird they wouldn't straight up say ""inspired by real events"" or ""inspired by Shakespeare's fictional works"" because a lot of important plot points and characters are fiction, and the general audience won't even find out.
But I do suspect that the intense fanbase of the actors starring in The King, is much to blame for the many glowing reviews. Netflix' best? Try Roma, The Irishman (even though it came out shortly after this one to be fair), Mudbound, even Okja. I swear, they got more heart and realness, and don't rely almost solely on the popularity of the cast and the epic movie sets. That is just not good enough - not for history, nor for storytelling.",,Anonymous,History
Couldn't get past the dialogue,"The first most important thing for a film is whether viewers are engaged in the experience. It could be a bad movie, but if you're still engaged, you can get some value from the experience.For The King, the first thing that took me out of the experience was the dialogue. It felt overly archaic in an unnatural way. Lines like ""I will not allow this havoc to transpire. I have come to see it stopped"" feel like someone trying too hard to write medieval poetic phrasing like Shakespeare, but it doesn't come across as authentic. That took me out of the experience.The other thing that struck me was how Timothee's character is so depressed and moody without any backstory. There's just no motivation, so far as we know, for the character to be like that, so it also feels inauthentic. (I'm not super familiar with Henry IV, but it doesn't seem authentic to that either.)The movie tries to feel Shakespearean, but the dialogue is too fake, and the characters are completely different anyways. So it doesn't really stand on its own as a medieval movie, but it also doesn't respect the source enough to feel authentic.Sure, there's some good combat, acting, and production value, but the writing is not good enough to make it engaging.",6.0,Anonymous,History

He has to learn about politics and the war that comes but also he has to control his past and his emotions from his life before becoming a king.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true history events and shows the dark details of not only the palace politics and interests but also behind the relationships and friendships between the people of the palace. I liked very much the interpretation of TimothÃ©e Chalamet who played as Hal / King Henry V and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joel Edgerton's who played as Falstaff, Ben Mendelsohn's who played as Henry IV and Sean Harris' who played as William and they were all very good.

In this case, we have the depiction of the real coronation of the British King Henry V, and the stories surrounding that event.It's an entertaining movie. The historical aspect is taken very seriously. There is a very down-to-earth type of drama, very realistic, full of tribulations and weighty problems. Unfortunately the script abuses this element a bit, extending it too much, and leaving a note of boredom in the middle of the film.The action sequences are very good. Good practical effects are appreciated. The production design, editing and performances stand out.The King is a good exponent of medieval cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Ridiculously bad with some good moments,"Like so many movies it started out quite promising but it got worse and more ridiculous as it went on.
From a visual perspective, it is very well shot and there are some great, intense battle scenes, but there just isn't any substance to the film. The bigger (historical) context is never explained, the story and actions of the protagonists are confusing or make no sense at all.
The young king just stumbles from whoring around in the ghetto into being a considerate, brave and intelligent leader of men on the battlefield. A very unconvincing performance. It would have been a little better had they at least cast a strong Englishman as Henry, but for some strange reason they picked a 60 pound skinny-pants-wearing Israeli. The French prince is portayed as a complete psychopath and idiot. A caricature.

Moody movie,"I think I have outgrown this sort of film. I was aware of the overwhelmingly good critiques to this picture, however, it's not what I had expected. Nor what I wanted. I think the latter is the most accurate of my taste.I am not wanting to watch this kind of film anymore.The great direction, set pieces, costumes and detail are what makes the movie. It is not flawed as a period piece - in fact I go far to say it is better to represent the people as various ages, especially the young King Henry V. I believe it is a more accurate portrayal of what people were like during this period - however some have commented on the inaccuracies. So I am not a historian. I just liked those parts the most.However pretty it is, it is pretty dull for me. It takes its sweet time to move along, and I am up for that generally in films, but I am not up for this kind of pace to accomplish a moody movie.That's it I think - I am not into moody movie's at the moment.

A great piece of narrative cinema,"It is baffling to me that this film is receiving so much legitimate rancor for being historically inaccurate. I would think that anyone with a functioning brain would realize that this is narrative cinema and not a documentary feature film. If you want to learn the true history, take advantage of the existence of the totally real and separate genre of documentaries. It's utterly ridiculous that these stuck-up know-it-all amateur ""historians"" think that the director/script writer/etc. didn't do any research. The wikipedia page for the Battle of Agincourt or even King Henry V will give an accurate account of events; it's not exactly valuable, hidden knowledge that they seem to bandy it as being. I don't see anyone dumping on Shakespeare for writing a dramatization. The fact is, this is a story about The King, and this holier than thou contrarianism has no place in judging this film.To start, it's a great Netflix movie. In the vein of Outlaw King, the film does a good job of immersing the viewer in the setting. The acting was solid all around, and the musical score, while not particularly memorable, had its moments. The set pieces are good, and the props are even better. True armor-buffs will no doubt have something to say about the historical accuracy of the costuming, but the performance put on by the actors in these seemingly real sets of armor was very convincing. Above all, this movie gave us something that other media has repeatedly failed to give us: convincing armored combat. Gone are the wild swings of longswords somehow cleaving through a breastplate. Instead we finally get the good old grappling and knife fighting skills that proved to be so useful on the battlefield. The fights were a joy to watch for this reason. As for the plot; it's solid. Some moments approached melodrama, but all good stories should be a little over the top, or they wouldn't be worth telling.It may not be a true to life version of events surrounding Agincourt and Henry V, but the history is interesting to study, but not necessarily fun to tell your mates about. What we got here was a good story.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Entanglements in war,"Although quite predictable, the movie was very entertaining from start to finish. With a runtime of almost two and a half hours, I almost wished it was a bit longer. Since certain storylines felt a bit unexplored, especially Hal's relationships with his brothers and cousins. Timothy Chalamet does a very good job, but two actors steal the show and those are (of course) Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson. They give the movie some levity which is neck deep in seriousness at times.The few battle and combat scenes are a highlight. They feel heavy, dirty and authentic with a welcoming clumsiness in the mix. They include many little details that show how tedious combat under heavy armour must have been like. Well worth a watch for that alone and Ridley Scott definitely took notes for The Last Duel since he is usually someone who's either just filming shaky battle noise or highly staged action.And although historically not accurate at least the movie does a good job of illustrating how wars are perceived in public and how in reality they are born out of simple imperialistic greed. Something we never get taught in school, where all the 'casualties' are tidied up into numbers and neat statistics. Nothing much has changed since, and it was interesting to think about current wars and their false pretense how they have begun or why they are 'necessary'.Storywise the movie is a bit tame and predictable but still one of the better Netflix prestige movies. I would rank it above Outlaw King.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
How to ruin a perfect story by adding fantasy,"First I have to tell you that I truly love historical drama. I also don't mind if, for the sake of a more thrilling movie and an accelerated pace you take a historical tale and change it in fitting way.
However, this was not done in this movie, on no level. They ruined a perfect historical tale, which had all and could have taken a lot of inspiration from Shakespeare's work. But they just added the spirit of our current time and unnecessary changes which not just ruin the historical accuracy of the movie, but also the authentic atmosphere of Medieval times.
The dialogues were dull, even outright dumb and the language more appropriate for a modern bar than a royal court.
The French were presented as a total caricature of real people. The king was made a peace activist which constantly tried to kill and torture accidentally, while the background story of the father-son conflict and the war with the French became twisted in so many ways it hurts.Last but not least, what some describe as the climax of the movie: The battle.Horrible, just horrible. They tell at the start what was supposed to give them a chance, but beside some ridiculous scenes, the whole battle turns out to be some sort of mud wrestling. The true value and importance of the bowmen in the battle of Agincourt, the proper positioning and prepared defences of the English, anything of military facts was either ignored or downplayed in one big mud show.
The king going into battle without support, without body guards and anyone around him, like a modern animated action hero is completely out of the context of any battle at the time.I'm not just criticising the lack of historical accuracy in every scene, this would be not enough. They really made it a fantasy movie which lacks even the slightest touch of reality.Talking about the pace and suspense: Did the movie, with all the cobble up of historical and literary themes, make any lasting impression if being seen from a purely action movie perspective? Not at all. The pace was slow, the tension didn't build up and overall it is a forgettable piece of film making.The 4 stars being deserved by the music, camera job, outfit and acting. Yes, that were all strengths of the movie, but with this pace, dialogues, mingling of the story until it was strangled and nothing worth to talk about left, ruined a great historial theme.Kenneth Branagh movie lacked the eerie sound and the ""dirty medieval feeling"" somewhat. Its acting and language was to artificial in a way, since it was based on Shakespeare primarily, but still: It depicted real people, acting like humans do and presented the story in a relatable and historical more accurate way. Branaghs Henry V is on a different level than this piece which could have been great, but was, unfortunately, ruined by bad writing first and directing second.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Brilliant script and beautiful flow of chemistry between everyone involved...,"It's so very rare a movie can combine so many things, and so beautifully that it can almost leave your expectations as but fugitives to the gift you are witnessing before you. Whatever Netflix is inspiring in creative 'morale' alone is a pioneering effort. It has, in effect, raised the bar of movie making to a wondrous new level of creativity. Whether the genera here might interest you or not, the inherent talent involved in the final product of many of their films is simply breathtaking in the extreme. Somehow, Netflix has has been able to imagine, conceive, and execute many of the best films in just a few short years that even Hollywood hasn't been able to do in the last 30, and likely more. Constant re-makes of Hollywood films barely 20 years old do indeed tell that tale. As an artist, when you come from the GUT in your vision of exactly how it should be, and someone actually listens to you, and believes in your vision on a GUT level, then you often have such genius as this coming forth that damn near puts everything else to shame.

And The King somehow reminded me of the atmosphere in Bergman's movies. Also the way the bishops are carried in the French lands reminded me of Aguire: the Wrath of God.

"A good movie, but also....boring?","Let me just say, I think this is a good movie, the production, the directing, writing and acting are all brilliant, but the movie is also very slow, and drags a lot during the first and second acts, for the most part. With a runtime of nearly two and a half hours, something that begins to bore you that soon into the movie, that is a problem. The only thing that kept from from turning it off, was the amazing performance of TimothÃ©e Chalamet - despite his consistent whispering throughout the film.The third act is where the movie really takes off, and we get a very intelligent, and well shot action scene. It was very similar to the Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, and it served the movie well. The music in this film is also very good. One of the best things about this movie, was none other than Robert Pattinson. Who would think the emotionless vampire from Twilight would come so far. He shines here (pun not intended), despite his very minimal screen time. His French accent was also very good, I did notice a few off words here and there, but other than that, he was an intimidating villian to the movie. I just wish we got more of him.However, my biggest complaint, and anyone who has seen the trailer or the news, is that the movie kind-of tried to set itself up to be a romance. Well, that's what I got from it. There is literary no romance in this film at all, and Henry's love interest doesn't appear until very late into the film.Despite it dragging in tons of places, the King is still a good movie, abit very slow. If you don't mind those kind of films, then you will find a great deal of enjoyment from the King, if you are expecting an action-packed war film, or a love-stricken romance, this isn't your movie.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

Convincing performances,"Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Henry IV: Parts 1 & 2,"" and ""Henry V,"" David MichÃ´d's (""Animal Kingdom"") epic medieval drama The King lacks the Bard's poetry and soaring eloquence, yet its intensity, intimacy, and brooding power will keep you captivated throughout its 133-minute run time. Co-written by MichÃ´d and Joel Edgerton (""Boy Erased""), the film is marked by the convincing performance of TimothÃ©e Chalamet (""Beautiful Boy"") as Prince Hal, later King Henry V, whose growth from a rebellious and ""uncourtly"" teenager into a king who commands respect and even fear is astonishing. Though the film departs from the Shakespeare play and the historical record, it is easily the equal of the ""Henry V"" films of Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh in its ability to probe the depths of the royal mind.The King opens in court. Hal's rage against his father King Henry IV's (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Robin Hood"") obsession with internal wars in Scotland and Wales has caused him to leave the royal court and associate with John Falstaff (Edgerton) and his friends in the Eastcheap tavern. Unlike the cartoonish buffoon of Shakespeare's play, however, Falstaff is the king's trusted adviser and honest friend as well as a man of reason and deep military experience, serving to later remind the king of the ideals he espoused as Prince Hal. Though Hal's defeat of Henry Percy (Hotspur) (Tom Glynn-Carney, ""Tolkien"") in a sword fight saves his father's throne, his worthiness to become king is questioned by the dying King Henry IV who anoints Hal's younger brother Thomas of Lancaster (Dean-Charles Chapman, ""The Commuter"") as his successor.In the opening scene of the Shakespeare play ""Henry V,"" the Archbishop of Canterbury says ""The breath no sooner left his father's body, But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seem'd to die too."" When his father dies and Thomas is killed in Wales, Hal becomes King Henry V. As if the title brings with it a mythical power, Henry is transformed into a philosopher-king, more than ready to prove his right to rule. Determined to avoid patriotic wars, the new king ironically finds himself immediately embroiled in one. After an alleged assassination attempt and an insult by the Dauphin of France (Robert Pattinson, ""High Life""), Henry is ready to go to war with France.In the stirring epic battle at Agincourt in October 1415, immortalized by Shakespeare, the English soldiers are heavily outnumbered by the French led by the cocky Dauphin who taunts the monarch in a dubious French accent by saying, ""I enjoy to speak English. It is simple and ugly."" King Henry, however, relies on Falstaff's masterful military mind to win the battle against overwhelming odds, turning the conflict in his favor by use of his long-bowmen. Empowered by the cinematography of Adam Arkapaw (""The Light Between Oceans""), the costumes by Jane Petrie (""Suffragette""), and the relentless score by Nicholas Britell (""If Beale Street Could Talk""), the horrors of war are conveyed with graphic authenticity.Considered by some modern critics as a reckless warmonger, in MichÃ´d's vision Henry V is the personification of England's triumph over internal dissension and foreign threats. The film, however, does not glorify war or turn it into poetry to inspire the troops. Here there is no battle of Harfleur with the stirring exhortation, ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead,"" nor do we see the young king wearing a disguise to survey the troops opinions about whether or not the king's goals are justified.What we do see is Henry not only winning the battle but gaining the hand of French King Charles VI's daughter Princess Catherine of Valois (Lily-Rose Depp, ""Planetarium""). The outspoken princess boldly tells the English king that ""All monarchy is illegitimate"" and causes Henry to question his rationale for starting the war. In spite of England's success on the battlefield, however, Henry is an ambiguous figure whose manner of wielding power has raised questions as to whether he was a ruthless oppressor or a great liberator.Though it was within the rules of war in the fifteenth century, not a second thought seems to have been given to the order to put prisoners' heads on spikes, or to murder hundreds of French prisoners ostensibly because a number of English page boys were killed. Whatever our ultimate view of the character of Henry V is, it need not deter us from appreciating The King, a remarkable achievement and a big winner for Netflix.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Great action sequences,"The storyline, I can't say if it's true or not. I know nothing at all about English history, let alone Henry the 5th. Parts seem exaggerated or at least approached with artistic freedom. The political intrigues did not come over as realistic to me at least, the twists and turns were amateuristic and no king would fall for such a lame attempt at anyone undermining his power.However, the movie's greatest asset is not in its narrative (even though its it's a good story), but in the gruesome fight scene(s). It's bloody, its dirty and it's close and personal as any real battle would have been back then. It's a very uncomfortable watch to be honest, but I was still glued to my seat.I won't spoil too much, but even the death scenes are presented in a realistic way. People don't just drop to the floor, you actually see the life leaving their body. This is not something you would typically see in any R rated movie, not even Dredd, Punisher or Deadpool show it in this fashion.One of the best Netflix movies out there.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Heavy Lies the Crown,"The King dissects what it means to be a leader in a convoluted and amorphous bureaucracy more than it seeks to depict historical events accurately. It is easy to see why anyone who has a particular interest in the time period might be put off by some of its decisions, but I found it both an interesting period piece and a surprisingly deep character study of a man burdened and bolstered by privilege. The film begins with a kind of trite prodigal son narrative as a young Henry V, played by Timothy Chalamet, drinks to excess while cursing his father, King Henry IV, silently and aloud blaming him for the state of England. More interestingly, England is wrought with conflict, rebellions arise against the king and he is begrudged by many of the nobles who ideally should be united under his banner.The opening shot is one of my favorites in the whole film, it subtly establishes the setting and tone. When the film is as it is in the opening scene, it is superb, letting the cinematography do most of the storytelling. The shot begins slowly panning up and over a battlefield littered with corpses as several knights wander through the carnage. One knight, who we will later discovery is a noble by the name of Percy the Hotspur in service of Henry IV, walks helmetless as the sun sets behind him. He notices a wounded and suffering man crawling on the ground and approaches him. He speaks to the dying man in a calm tone, telling him he is crawling in the wrong direction, the wind he feels is coming from England, Scotland is in the other direction. He then strikes down killing the man with a stoic yet strained expression on his face.The scene displays several things at once in a concise and brilliant manner. Hotspur's amor is decorated and stands in stark contrast to the unarmored dying man, he is a knight putting down a rebellion of unarmored peasants, this fight should not be if England was under stable leadership. His exasperation indicates he shares something in common with the man he just felled, disappointment with his King. His brutality can be seen as a mercy but also displays how hardened and violent life is during this century. A violent time will demand violence from its king. England is divided, its nobles and peasants unhappy alike, and the sun is setting on the Henry IV's reign. All of this is displayed tightly in just under two minutes.The scene is excellent, but then we get to the biggest weakness of the film, its length padded by unnecessary dialogue and sequences explaining what otherwise was, or could be, subtly expressed. While expertly directed and with compelling set design and performances, the script could have been tighter and respected the audience to a much greater degree. The reiteration of all the subtlety of the first scene takes place a few scenes later when Percy Hotspur directly airs his grievances during an audience with King Henry IV. All the subtext of that first scene becomes pure explicit text in the confrontation scene. Henry IV even says that Hotspur will betray him, and then of course Hotspur does. The film makes several compromises like this that are totally unnecessary.The cinematography and dedication to the period make the film an engaging watch, but the Shakespearean drama plot is made more digestible and less intricate to a broader audience through the conversion of slow and dramatic implication into actual explicit dialogue. A prime example of this is a conversation shared by Henry V and his sister after he takes the throne, in which she explicitly states the primarily conflict of the film, as if people watching up to that point could not intuit it. A tight one hour and forty five minute (1:45) movie is stretched into a two hour and twenty minute (2:20) one, and the film is a weaker and less intelligent because of it.What makes the film compelling despite this is Henry V's struggle and the dedicated performance of Chalamet. The central theme is that of intense isolation that Henry V experiences as he assumes the throne. Chalamet conveys much with his struggled expressions and outbursts. He is a young king, he was used to having friends to drink and celebrate with, not advisors and noble courts all assailing him with different mentalities and perspectives. He seeks to correct his father's mistakes and unite England, but unlike the real Henry V, he seeks to do this through peace, rather than conflict. Circumstance betrays him.The central issue that drives the plot is France's perceived taunts and insults towards Henry V as he assumes the throne. The bloodlines of the nobility of both countries overlap, some in England wish to make a common enemy of France to unite the country and create a stronger national identity. The question Henry V must grapple with is how he can secure his young rule and justify his reign to all manner of parties both within and without. He leans on the counsel of several members of his court, but can he trust these people, each with their own differing ambitions and goals? Is the posturing of France legitimate, or is he seeing what someone wants him to see to stoke the flames of conflict?This intrigue is fascinating, and like Henry V, the viewer cannot be sure of what is and what isn't, who can be trusted and who cannot be trusted. The power of the throne attracts all manner of challenges. When the film erupts into actual bouts of violence, the tension of the drama overflows and is viscerally engaging. Henry V's duel with Percy the Hotspur is a real highlight and I would have liked a few more scenes like it, or just more battle sequences in general because the armor and weaponry appeared to me quite realistic. When Henry V gets to France, the film picks up momentum with the introduction of Pattinson's villain, the prince of France, who was entertaining to watch if somewhat cartoonishly evil. He is portrayed with an exaggerated menace which I think played into the addled justifications of Henry V's conquest. The battle of Agincourt is also compelling and really exemplifies how combat would often be a brutal melee rather than an organized affair.I think the film's only major error yet to be discussed in my opinion is that the ending could not rest on the ambiguity of its earlier drama. There is a confession, and an illumination of real occurrences, which brings closure to that chapter of the King's life. It felt too tidy for the rest of the film, and quite honestly felt generically Hollywood in an otherwise unique feeling film. However, The King was still an excellent watch, full of amazing performances, breathtaking shots, and contains a moody and severe atmosphere that is unlike much of the other period pieces I have seen. If you can forgive the historical inaccuracy and the longwinded runtime that at time treats the audience without intelligence, you will find much to appreciate. Heavy lies the crown, not from the weight of it, but from the burden of the body politic, a fascinating throughline for a film, executed excellently and worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Solid all the way around.,"Chalamet, Edgerton, and Harris are all excellent. Harris, in particular, is the standout. He's many things as Henry's advisor, and he approaches the role with a physicality that centered the performance for me. I've seen other films with him, but nothing to this caliber of performance.Great score, excellent long take in the middle of the Battle of Agincourt. I like that Michod and Edgerton decided to modify the Saint Crispin's day speech.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Henry V, Pretty Darn Great","The King is a beautiful movie, and the story of King Henry V is great history. You couldn't ask for a better story and this movie does it justice.Excellent cast (Chalamet, all grown up! Lily-Rose Depp, all grown up!), particularly the movie's writer and producer, Joel Edgerton, as Falstaff. Falstaff is not a historical character but a composition of several historical characters. (Yeah, he's Shakespeare's recurring favorite, along with his goat as incarnated in Henry VI's John Falstolf, who WAS a historical character). Everyone was just great, including Robert Pattinson as the doofus Dauphin. And Sean Harris, who is never not great.This isn't Henry's entire life story, just the highlights. Loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Netflix Movie.,"The script is simple & covers most of Henry's life. Am pleased Netflix took a chance with this historical drama, it's thought provoking & the battlefield scenes are realistic. Good acting.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A period film that hits on all fronts,"The king delivers another great film to Netflix's list of exclusives, the topics covered throughout the film like, man's need for war has a profound effect. Chalamet delivers an excellent performance which is now to be expected. The acting is the strongest asset to the film with Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson both adding weight to their characters. The score is fantastic as well as the cinematography capturing some well crafted battle scenes as well as the politics behind war which are all fantastic to watch.The only gripe I have with the film is it is somewhat committed to the Shakespearean language,but not entirely as it keeps swaying back and forth between regular English and Shakespearean English. Also some audiences might find the film to be quite slow at points, however I believed the battles needed this build up and politics to further heighten the reasons both these countries are at war.Overall I had a great time watching the king, Timothee Chalamet is one of the best actors today and it shows in this film. With a great supporting cast backing him up, direction which is passionate about the subject and a story that is extremely intriguing and exciting. Definitely a film you should consider watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it!,"I don't care what the critics said about TimothÃ©e Chalamet, he gave a great performance. I was enthralled with him. This was a great movie, the acting, costumes, the relationships and intrigue of the king and court. All great story telling. All the actors were believable. No B- or C- list acting here. Oh, and if there's a question about him moving into ""heartthrob"" status like Robert Pattinson (which I did read in another critics review) don't worry. He's a handsome young man. And his portrayal here as an intelligent and strategist king, make him and the movie even more appealing. Definitely will be watching it again; probably a few times.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The epic and magnificent production, visually stunning and a masterpiece","This will probably be the best costume drama of the year as it has the atmosphere, costumes and the sets that makes a great medieval movie. It's so believable, just visually stunning to experience and look at. It's also one of the most realistic medieval movies I've seen, the fight choreography was just brutal and real which made me sit on the edge of my seat as it was unpredictable and not the regular sword fights, it was something special. What also made it realistic was the musical score as it wasn't really any music at all but when there were music, it was really epic and powerful. Another thing which I noticed was the natural lighting that was used. Some people may find that a negative thing, see the Game of Thrones episode but it works here as it is a historical medieval drama, where there only were these kind lightning so what we see in front of us is natural lightning and a lot of darkness which also goes for the dark nature of the film. Costumes, props and the sets were some of the best things of the movie, for example just seeing the historical accurate armor that the actors wore was just an amazing feeling as it was one of those childhood fantasies and it is justified in how it's portrayed, clumsy but effective. The battle we get to experience is something I was expecting after watching through the movie, true mayhem of nothing other than blood and death, that whole sequence was just magnificent. How the last sequence of the battle was shot in one take made it so much better and realistic, superb choreography.David MichÃ´d did it again with his dark visual story telling with his spectacular directing and crew behind him, the cinematography is just stunning, wow. The script is great, a lot of dialogue which makes it really slow paced but it works if you take the time to see the artistic cinematography behind it all. I believe you have to re-watch the movie to get all the details as there's so much detail in each scene, just the wide shots are just incredible. The script which is written by David MichÃ´d and Joel Edgerton who also stars and produced the movie. I only have positive things to say about the script but the dialogue could have been more Medieval and what I mean is the profanity in it, other than that nothing else. This story is nothing that I have never seen before, it's amazing and sorts of breaks the old Hollywood way of making medieval movies. It's a beautiful thing.The ensemble cast all does a great job, an excellent job at that but there is a couple of them that stands out. TimothÃ©e Chalamet plays the title character, King Henry V. His performance is so strong that I would be rooting for a Oscar nomination, it was superb as I found it as great acting but also doing the character justice of the real life counterpart and Shakespeare proud. Joel Edgerton is the other actor I want to praise, I got this feeling that his character wasn't needed in the beginning but I was wrong as his character and performance makes the movie, the inspiration and help he gives to Henry V and the chemistry Joel and TimothÃ©e has is amazing. To the third and final actor I want to write about, Robert Pattinson. It was a really good performance but the thing everyone have talked about is his accent and it's bad but I think I know it is bad, through dialogue and character sake. The character dislikes England and mocks them with speaking with such bad English, it can be that? Who knows, it was laughable either way. Otherwise a good performance! This was seriously a really good movie, an epic one at that and one that is far from others in one way. Perhaps one of the best historical medieval movies I've seen. A coming of age story of Henrik V from his father's death to his adventure in France, a story worth told and executed perfectly.",9.0,Anonymous,History

What is outstanding are the production values THE ACTING ! , lighting, direction, script , locations - its all excellent.
The reason this film was made is Joel Edgerton realized that this part of European history is about as important as any in history, and defines the English.
Its a great story.
The English crown was anyone's for nearly 400 years starting with William 1st (1066).

Easily could have lasted another 30 minutes and to be honest, I kind of wish it did because it was that good.

An excellent adaptation and an even better film.,"The King does an excellent job in adapting its source material (William Shakespeare's King Henry IV & Henry V) for modern times. The dialogue feels realistic and authentic to the times, yet it never feels too Shakespearean for a modern audience to really connect with. The scope is grand yet not too overbearing. The story is provocative, but still rather personal.This is probably the best original film that Netflix has ever put out, it's gritty, it's epic, it has a lot of heart, and all of the performances are incredible, the standouts being, of course, Chalamet has the titular Henry V, and Pattinson as the Dauphin of France.

Enthralling,"I now feel I've been as close as I could come to Agincourt and survive. What a battle. Truly one for the ages. Showing Falstaff as a canny old warrior who predicts (and explains) the outcome, worked for me, however contrary it may have been to either Shakespeare or history.Speaking of Shakespeare, I WAS disappointed with Hal's battle speech to his army. Naturally, the writers couldn't having him spout Shakespeare's inimitable words. To have had him mention ""band of brothers"" or ""St. Crispin's Day"" would have destroyed the illusion of reality in the present movie. But I think Shakespeare's concept of Hal claiming to not want even one more warrior there, though they were greatly outnumbered, because then there would be less glory to share - I think that could, and should, have been stated in contemporary words. Also, the incredible pride which survivors would feel for the rest of their lives, and could share with grand-children (and the envy of anyone not present on that day.)I thought Robert Pattinson was fascinating as the Dauphin. I didn't know beforehand he was in the movie, and did not recognize him at first - only thought to myself, Who is that riveting and strangely handsome presence? In only a few scenes, he deftly projected a slimy evil that was a necessary counterpart to the not-totally-good English.One error, I think, was not to adequately introduce the audience to whomsoever became the disembodied head that the Dauphin had the little boy carry to Prince Hal. Who was it? A female? It didn't look like the sister. No other clues.I watched the movie as an English major who has read all of Shakespeare, and a history and battle buff who has read most of Churchill, and I was riveted to the screen for the duration of this movie (which is longer than movies I usually watch.) I was thrilled with this rare film, and came away feeling that I understood much better what happened at Agincourt, and the complexity and mystery which lie behind great events of history.Thank you to all who made ""The King"" possible.",10.0,Anonymous,History

England history and Shakespeare.,A historical film that tells the story of King Henry of England (Chalamet). The plot sounds classic and simple but you have to wait until the end to understand what the film wants to tell you. Chalamet manages to convey the power and suffering that he must endure as a king during the conflicts between France and England. The ending perhaps comes a little too quickly and the situation is resolved quite simply.

"By Any Means, Watch This Movie","This is a terrific film and, above all else, worthy of your time.Much has been made of its lacking in historical fact, or its failure to follow an accepted storyline, but to slavishly follow either of these courses would have delivered a movie we have seen many times before. What's the point of that?One word: adaptation. Any screenwriter worth his or her salt is going to play with historical fact or the essences of a work of fiction; after all, who wants to see the same stories copied over and over again?I remember thinking just this when so many people complained that a recent retelling of Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders, was so different to all the others. It had to be, otherwise we would be seeing the same thing repeated endlessly.This movie tells as much as we need to know of history and is a worthy addition to the many tv and movie adaptations we have seen over the years.If I had a prior reservation about this film it was the casting of TimothÃ©e Chalamet as a fighting King. Surely too slight a build to portray a warrior. Well, whatever this extraordinary young actor lacks in physicality he more than makes up for in sheer screen presence. A gritty and convincing performance. Maybe not an Oscar, but surely a nomination.Don't look for accuracy here. Go see a documentary or read a textbook if that is what you want.

A Crowning Victory for Netflix,"I thought this was a very well done and tense film. It does make you feel bad for Hal that he's thrown into this life he never really wanted and doesnt know who to trust. Who's really there for him and not just because of his status. I thought the battlefield shots were great too. Very bloody and dirty and makes you sad/angry about war. And stylistically I thought shot well too. One shot in particular I liked was this overhead shot of Falstaff getting lost in the field. And speaking of Falstaff I thought Joel Edgerton did a really good job of playing him and he also chose to make the character more sympathetic. He also is less cowardly than portrayed in Shakespeare's works. Its an interesting take and I actually liked the change.Acting wise, I thought the cast did a very good job. Especially Timothee and Joel. The one disappointment I had acting wise was Robert Pattinson. It's not the worst thing in the world but in comparison to everyone else, his french accent is a tad over the top, some of his mannerisms when you first meet him are a little silly, and then theres a scene later on where he keeps falling in the mud. Tonally, I felt like stood out like a sore thumb. Im sure that's also how he was written/directed to be....but ehhhh just didnt work for me.The only other thing to mention is that the film is over 2 hours long and does feel like it in places. There was times where I was wondering how much long the film was going to be. So, some pacing issues.Other than that though, I did really enjoy the film. No, its obviously not super historically accurate (especially since it includes Shakespeare's invented character of Falstaff) but the cinematopgraphy and the general story and acting were great. It is a quite dim story and if you don't like gore there are definitely gonna be scenes that make you a bit queasy.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Very well directed and excellent cinematography. Not an ""Elizabeth"" as the director lacks Shekhar Kapur's gravitas and of course Cate Blanchett has a leg up over Timothee.
But it has been a whirlwind, keeping track of Timothee's exalted ride from one marvelous film to another.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Well Put Together But Full Of Historical Inaccuracies,"As the movie opens, young Prince Hal (TimothÃ©e Chalamet) - the first son of King Henry IV of England - has left behind royal life and adopted his infamous ""wayward"" life. But soon thereafter his father's illness and eventual death brings him back to the court and ultimately puts him on the throne as King Henry V, immediately plunged into the complicated politics of the 15th century English court, with a desire to set right some of his father's wrongs, to establish the legitimacy of his reign and to achieve some of what his father had been unable to achieve - primarily to successfully claim the throne of France.Basically, the movie is well done technically. The sets and costumes give an authetic 15th century atmosphere, and the climactic Battle of Agincourt, in which the English (led by young Henry, by now King) defeated a much larger French army, is extremely well choreographed and it does accurately depict the use of the English longbow, which was in fact a much superior weapon to the cross bow used by the French, the use of which played a key role in the real Battle of Agincourt.) Having said that, the movie is also riddled with historical inaccuracies that are too numerous to recount here. Rather than being based on the historical record, ""The King"" is largely based on the relevant plays of William Shakespeare, which produces one of the greatest (because it was so central to the story) of the historical inaccuracies - the front and centre presence of Sir John Falstaff - who never existed, but was a fictional chartacter created by The Bard. So, if you're looking for a history lesson, you won't find it here except perhaps in very broad brushstrokes. Nor will you find a recounting of Shakespeare. This is more of a mish mash of some of Shakespeare's work, combined with a bit of history and a lot of historical licence.It's a tough slog at times to get through. I found it far too long at almost two and a half hours and there were times when it felt as though I could have skipped lengthy parts of this and not really missed very much of consequence. However the performances were good, and while I think it's a bit over-rated, I certainly wouldn't call this a bad movie, especially for those with an interest in the medieval era.

Most realistic depiction of medieval armored knights in battle.,"I've never seen a movie or anything that depicted medieval war so brutally realistically. Fully plate armored knights fall from their horse or are pulled to the ground where they are overwhelmed by lightly armored troops sticking long daggers into their visors, and other weak spots in their armor (neck, armpit etc). Hammers, axes and picks are much more effective (against plate armor) than swords that are basically used as long iron rods to hammer each other with. You even see knights holding their swords both at the handle and blade using their pommel to hit people in the face.Then there is the cavalry charge that's absolutely brilliant. Characters hit by the cavalry charge are hit super violently and are literally thrown on the floor due to the sheer power and weight of the cavalry charge. Never seen such a realistic depiction of a cavalry charge. Henry's friend whose name I just forgot stands in front of his line (bit dumb in my opinion) but when he is charged he is smashed into his own line and literally flies backwards due to the cavalry charge. In stark contrast with what we usually see on TV. Like with game of thrones where a certain person who ""knows nothin"" runs towards the enemy lines and then survives a cavalry charge while standing in the middle of the battle field on his own.That said, the movie should have been at least 1 hour longer. So much was not told and some parts were historically inaccurate. Like why is the movie pretending Henry did not want to be king? Or that Henry was this hippie type character at first? I guess it makes him more likeable. They are doing the whole insecure anti war boy becomes strong ruler. Which is simply not true. Henry had been leading men into battle since he was a child. He wasn't new to this.Like these are sorta my biggest issues with the show. Henry's friends give him blind trust but there is no reason why? Because he is better than his dad? He multiple times wants to slaughter all his captives, crucify.them etc completely opposite to the boy he was at the start of the movie. War sucks and it's a lot of pressure but we barely see him have to deal with any adversity and yet this dude goes from ""war is bad"" to ""let's kill all the French rats and crucify them""My point is. Even of they wanted to take so.e liberties with the story they should have at least prolonged it and given room for more character development.The movie shows parts of henrys life and makes a narrative out of it. Ignores a lot of stuff around it and never tells us what happens. There is no 3nf scene with ""Henry lived a couple of years more but then died, his son.never really ruled France"" etc.All that said. It is still a very good and interesting movie. And the battle is absolutely fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Dry, Bland and Disappointing","""The King"" is a long, boring but beautifully shot film that was rather disappointing to me. Honestly, I expected more going into a film that promises genuine character building in front of a medieval backdrop. The director clearly had great vision for this film but was unfortunately dragged down by a tedious and tiresome plot. Though I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet's performance as King Henry, he often seemed confused by his character's principles and motivations as the script insists of creating shocking, yet out of character moments, for him.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"I can't really advocate for the historical accuracy of this movie, neither I care. After all, nobody can assure that history books are 100% accurate.On the movie side of it (not documentary wise), it's excellent.Great acting, excellent production, with flawless costume and scenery design.The lighting, something that many complain about in reviews I've read, is part of what makes this so authentic, instead of lighting perfectly every corner of the frame, we get the natural light of the ages, casting sunlight through the windows, producing hard shadows and contrast, or little flames lighting faces in the pitch black night. Being a photographer myself, I have to say, excellent handling of that, this was beautiful to watch, I felt transported to that century.In terms of language (another thing people felt annoyed, apparently) it's another aspect that makes this piece more authentic. I hope filmmakers and studios keep going that way and stop listening to lazy people that want everything easy. This adds up for me, it's not a bad thing.Pattison's French accent was nailed, I live in London, I know lots of French people and the accent was perfect. Don't like it? That was the point exactly, he was meant to be irritating.The script is perfect for me, it's a slow pace that builds personalities and tension, up to the climax of the battle, which is overwhelming (in a good way) as I could feel the lack of air and despair of being in such situation, covered in mud, crushed by giant warriors, not knowing who is who, hopeless but kicking.I've also read how that annoyed some viewers of the kind that like to be spoon feed everything, such as perfect lighting and their own accent (not only their language), but It wouldn't be as realistic that way, and would be such a mediocre film. In terms of choreography, something that fails very easily in this kind of movies, not a single stoke looked fake, I rarely see this realism nowadays in a fight on screen, less in such large scale. Just perfect.The whole story wraps perfectly by the ending, again, I don't know how accurate it is, I'm not English, so I'm not interested in cheering an English hero, but as a story, as a movie, for me, this was perfect.I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about it, two and half hours that I enjoyed intensely and I would do again.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very emotional and good middle age movie,"Great movie and very good performance of TimothÃ©e Chalamet. I rarely watch middle age movies, but in my opinion every genre can make a good movie as long as they succeed to create some kind of emotional bond or to feel for the characters which they successfully succeeded in this movie. Throughout the whole movie you could feel this depressive dark age atmosphere which the middle age really was which was incorporated so good by TimothÃ©e Chalamet. He made you feel how dark and how depressive the middle age epoch was, a time about where life is not much worth, burden, sadness brutality, power, lies and so on rules the world.",10.0,Anonymous,History

There was consensus among his lords (17 intelligence agencies) that France (now Russia) was a threat, while she was not.

It's Hard Out Here for a King,"""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" was on TCM the other night. I re-watched a little bit of it, and then I had this brilliant idea that I wanted to make a new adaptation of it, but I don't like any of Edward Albee's dialogue, so I'm going to dump it all and write my own. It's going to ROCK, and I don't see how I could possibly fail. It's not like Albee's dialogue had anything to do with the success of his play.If you're going to give us yet another screen adaptation of ""Henry V"" (because apparently neither the Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh versions exist) but you're not going to use Shakespeare's actual text, then the least I feel I deserve is a ""Henry V"" that feels like it has some reason for existence -- i.e. relevance to our current times. But this film doesn't have that. It's just full of a lot of cliche ""it's hard out here for a king"" ideas about leadership, politics, and war that we've heard a million times in a million better movies. ""The King"" looks handsome, but its own sense of self-importance is so cumbersome that watching it is like slogging through the mud that mires the English and French warriors fighting it out in the film's climactic battle.The film is slow and ponderous and its solemn tone never varies. Timothee Chalamet (as Hal) seems bored to be in this film, and his performance has a curious lack of energy. The first time we see him in the movie he's sleeping, and it's like he never fully wakes up. I'm sure his bedroom eyes could make a tweener swoon, but my goodness someone give the boy a sandwich and a jolt of caffeine. My wife could body slam this dude, and she's about 5'4"" and 120#.Joel Edgerton, who wrote the screenplay, plays Falstaff, but his primary purpose for being in the movie is to look gross. The film wants us to think the relationship of Falstaff and Hal is critical to the plot's outcome, but it doesn't ever feel like more than a sketch. In fact, that applies to the whole movie. I saw one review that described this movie as being a bunch of plot developments on an outline that no one ever bothered to connect to one another with substance, and that's a pretty apt description of my own experience watching it.With about five minutes of screen time, Robert Pattinson shows up late in the film (because he's obligated to appear in literally every movie released in 2019) and tries his hardest to inject some life into it by way of a Monty Python French accent. It's like he listened to all of director David Michod's notes on how to play the character and then was like ""nah."" He makes fun of Hal's penis size before beheading a child and then slipping around in some mud, and appears to be having a blast doing it. I'm glad he had fun, because someone connected to this film deserved to.Grade: C+",5.0,Anonymous,History

Much of the dialogue reflects the spirit of Shakespeare, on whose work this film is based. Henry V is still one of the most revered kings in English history, though it didn't start out that way. Lead actor Timothee Chalamet does an excellent job portraying Henry's transformation from dissolute hellraiser to a young ruler of growing maturity.
His supporting cast is peerless. Sean Harris brings his usual intensity to his role as Henry's top advisor. Joel Edgerton gives a fine edge to his performance as Falstaff, and Robert Pattinson chews up the scenery as the French Dauphin, a nasty piece of work.

Nicely shot, characters inoffensive, Robert Pattinson was a joy but for the most part I was just losing interest.I wandered if it may be a bias I have against period pieces, however I loved me ""The last duel"". I'm also aware this some sort of adaptation or based on a story wether true or not idk? Maybe knowing more about its background may give me a better perspective with a second viewing. Until then it was all pale boring stares of a hot celebrity Timothy.I may change my rating if I revisit this film (doubt, my list is too long). First impressions is its boring.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Simply brilliant,"This has become one of my favourite movies.
Yes some people moan about the historical accuracy but unless you are particularly interested in that period of history or a professional historian/archaeologist I don't think you're going to notice.It was wonderfully written, fantastic dialogue, great story line, character arcs.
The casting was spot on
Everyone in it was bang on.
It looked great.
It had moments of suspense, humour, intrigue, and the end was quite moving.
The final moments of the movie were beautifully done.

Solid Historical Drama,"I loved the look of it. The acting was good. The stroyline was well conceived. Despite all this though it was OK. There was something missing from it. It wouldn't deter me from giving this a generous 8/10 but still, something didn't fit. It was poerful though in it's own way.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not every movie today is a political allegory,Good lord why have we become so dense to try to draw parallels to today's politics environment with every movie? It was a movie about a 15th Century King loosely based off of Shakespeare... and it was a great movie. I don't get the Trump this and Trump that talk... just shut up and make movies Hollywood and shut up and watch them America. Good God everyone's losing their bloody minds....,8.0,Anonymous,History
A very very pleasant surprise,"My expectations were definitely not high, I expected to watch the film for 5 minutes and get bored. However, the film sucked me in in the first couple scenes and I begun to see the talent of the creators of this film. The cinematography and acting were top notch and the well written and well paced scenes opened me to the characters and the world in which they reside.Confusingly, this film made me question my sexuality more than ever I've ever questioned it before, as the protagonist of the film was more beautiful than most women.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Yet more historical manipulation,"4 stars for production value, but why not tell the story as it is? If you want to make fiction, make fictional characters that do fictional things back in the day. Fine. But this film purports to be a 'historical drama' with depictions of real people, real politics and real battles. Yet what you will be watching is a complete distortion of the truth. Henry V was not some morose, pacifist teenager with daddy issues who only reluctantly invaded France because he was provoked again and again. He ascended the throne willingly and simply wanted more power and to exploit internal strife in France. The real history is fascinating, so why turn it into this Anglo-apologetic nonsense? 9 out of 10 historical dramas are like this, perhaps because the producers fear reality is not engaging enough, despite mostly being far more interesting than the twisted garble being churned out. I can recommend the podcast ""The Rest is History"" for those who want to hear the real story about Henry IV and V.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Wow,"I have never been into history. Tales of stories long past never really interested me tbh!

An Eye-opener and Call to Action,"This is a fantastic film with monologues of succinct wisdom and restraint by King Henry V of England.
Although as he was known as a bloody warrior in his quest to conquer France and the progenitor of the Hundred Years War; this film shows his great distaste in having been betrayed by his own family and counselors to be coerced into this Battle stance whereas he had been one who had sought only peace for his country.Is this not the same with us, we love our home and our families but are told by those whom we respect that we must war with others and that we must ever vigilant against adversity?A simple man once who fought in a ring for a living; who changed his name's for his belief, said 'I am not at war with these people no matter what color they are! I am not one of you either so why should I go to war because you tell me to? (paraphrased)....I think hearing Muhammad Ali's words as a young girl clarified my purpose to support peace and repudiate war.Is it not clear now -oh my countrymen, living in a land meant to be the paradise where all who come are to be welcomed in spite of their differences or beliefs? Is it not obvious that we are being driven by false counselors of the airwaves, and even more, so the false leaders we've elected that we should battle each other?Whereas if we but joined together in a collaborative mission to truly, in reality, provide support to each other, each in our own way, to focus our energies as one to heal and support all life, that of man, mammal, fish, fowl, and plant alike!WE ARE THE CHILDREN Of GOD!
WE CAN CREATE The PEACE we so desire deeply in our hearts and our beings so much so is that we have been burdened by discouragement depression and discordance for generations because it has not been so.
SPEAK YOUR TRUTH!
TAKE BACK YOUR POWER!
And so it shall be done
Blessing of love and peace unto you",10.0,Anonymous,History
Utter garbage!,This film is utter garbage.The casting is truly awful. ANYONE else but Chalamet & Pattinson would have done a better job.The whole film is a rank stab at the audience who love British history and or enjoy Game of Thrones. It fails miserably.,1.0,Anonymous,History
Intense and Serene at ther same time.,"This was a great film. I am biased because I am a history nut. But I enjoyed the characters they were all casted very well. The cinematography and the score is simply amazing. And the story was good. There were times when you were lulled into safety by the talking of politics and other underhanded endeavors but then you would be shocked at the brutality and intensity of the battlefield. I specifically love the way they portray medieval combat. Because it wasn't pretty like the stories say. It was bloody, brutal, and disorganized. I would recommend this for people that like a good drama or for the history nuts out there.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Great movie.,"I didn't expect this movie to be so good. Normally NETFLIX has a little bit low rated movies. But this one was great. The theme of the movie, costumes, etc. And the most I liked was the lights the rooms was illuminated with candles. That makes it very original.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Impressive Film in all areas better in a Cinema,"My Review : Netflix The King. My Rating 8/10Another fine movie denied a decent Cinema release by Netflix I couldn't help thinking how spectacular some of the sets and locations would look on the giant screen.
I know it's my soapbox but I view this latest trend as a form of censorship and I hate any form of censorship. The censorship comes in the form of exclusivity to Netflix customers only.
I digress but it angers me if anyone can explain how a film that obviously costs millions of dollars to produce ( Netflix don't divulge their production costs) can recoup the costs with no advertising on Netflix just from subscriber fees I'd like to know.The King is a beautifully produced movie I notice Brad Pitt is ons of the producers and of course it's the tale of young King Henry V and the Battle of Agincourt in France in 1415 which was just one of the battles of the 100 years war.William Shakespeare wrote his play Henry V in 1599 and now 420 years later Australian Joel Edgerton and David Michod have written their version of events and written them very well indeed. Joel Edgerton is an excellent screen writer as he showed us in 2018 with the excellent film Boy Erased in which he exposed the evils of gay conversion therapy.What impressed me about The King is that it's not a 21st Century dumbed -down version the dialogue is all believable and while not Shakespearean it still has almost an ""operatic "" feel without the arias.The performances are wonderful especially Timothee Chalamet as King Henry V a young almost metrosexual pale Prince who gives up his playboy Prince sabbatical to return home and take the throne after his fathers death.There's a lot of Australian talent in The King Ben Mendelsohn is impressive as King Henry 1V and of course Joel Edgerton is very impressive as John Falstaff the Kings most loyal friend and ally. It's also beautifully directed by Australian David Michod .
Robert Pattinson gives a good brief performance as the nasty threatening Dauphin of France who taunts the young King and ultimately falls on his sword.It's interesting that Timothee Chalamet and beautiful Lily-Rose Depp ,who is lovely as the French Princess Catherine are actually romantically involved because Timothee's meteoric rise to stardom reminds me of Lily-Rose's father Johnny Depp's amazing career start except I think Timothee is developing into a better actor with greater range .
I'm looking forward to seeing him in Little Women later this week at The Cinema on a decent sized screen in a movie that all film goers can see without having to subscribe to a streaming channel.The King is a long film 2hours 20 minutes,it's not a fast paced action movie but Australian director David Michod who also wrote and directed Animal Kingdom is an expert at portraying his characters personality and emotional state and I imagine he's a Dream director for actors to work with.It's interesting to see the role of English King Henry V played by a New Yorker of French decent and in contrast an English actor cast as the Dauphin of France The King is a very impressive film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
