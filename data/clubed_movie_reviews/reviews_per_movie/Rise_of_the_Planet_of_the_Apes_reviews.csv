Apes Will Rise!!,"Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (""The Escapist"") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (""King Kong"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"") for special effects. ""Apes"" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.As plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new ""altered"" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an ""Ape Sanctuary"" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.Technically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in ""Avatar"" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" and Kong from ""King Kong"") plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.Not only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch. Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film. One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees. While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground. This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.My only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to ""phone it in"" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
More than expected,"There are so many things right about this movie, the little things that are wrong are easily forgiven. Some slight plot holes, but the film and characters make up for it. The chemistry between Franco and Pinto is weak, however Franco plays his part. Lithgow is always a great asset to any production, and does a great job here.Albeit you know the chimps are CGI, their eyes look amazing, with depth and personality, and along with their body language and facial animations, you really do forget they are CGI. The music is powerful and tense, and I loved the way it builds up through out the movie. Starting with light orchestra at the beginning, while starting to feel very tribal without overdoing it towards the end.There are moments that are truly gratifying, and Caeser really steals the show with his evolution through out the movie. The journey Caeser takes really connects and you feel his plight. With moments of thought, heart and action, Rise really hits the mark for the audience it's aiming for.Excellent entertainment all round!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Rise"" is surprisingly good summer entertainment","When Rise of the Planet of the Apes was announced, expectations were not high. As a prequel to an awful remake of a movie that wasn't exactly an all time classic, its pedigree was sketchy to say the least. Thus came as a shock to nearly everyone when it became one of the biggest summer hits of the. Rise wasn't just watchable, or even pretty good; it's one of the best ""B"" movies of recent, entertaining and surprisingly human.The series of events that will one day cause a time displaced astronaut to gaze despairingly upon the ruins of the Statue of Liberty begins not surprisingly with science. Medicine to be exact. Young researcher Will Rodman, played by James Franco is on the cusp of developing a drug that can cure Alzheimer's, his father's included. It just so happens that this drug not only repairs damage to the brain, but makes the subject smarter, as shown in trials with chimpanzees. Due to unexpected complications these trials don't exactly work out in the end, and the test subjects are put down. But one of them had a child, Caesar Raised like a son by Rodman, Caesar shows remarkable intelligence beyond even his mother, learning hundreds of words in sign language, understanding human speech, even scoring higher on intelligence tests than human children of the same age. There seems no limit to how much he can learn, or to what the drug that gave him his intelligence can do for humans. But this isn't an inspiring story of medical breakthroughs. A tragic misunderstanding and Caesar's own animal nature result in him being separated from his family, a prisoner among his own kind. He is not happy with his new situation, and he has a plan to change it.The plot is hardly more complicated than I've described it, and is somewhat over reliant on coincidence and bad human decisions. Thankfully Rise is not driven by its plot, but by its central character. Caesar is quite simply a miracle of special effects. In only a decade CGI and motion capture technology has advanced to a degree that makes Lord of the Ring's Gollum seem almost listless by comparison. Caesar looks so real he could pass for a live chimpanzee if he didn't do things that no real chimp could ever be trained to do. Although he only speaks a few words late in the film, his facial expressions and gestures say more than enough.Early on you can tell that Caesar is not only a thinking being, but a feeling one as well. Like a human he feels love, anger, desire, and fear. He understands the concept of family, and based on one overly sappy scene he seems to have a fair understanding of human mating rituals. When he finds himself caged in a primate sanctuary, he understands just enough of the situation to feel betrayed. And we can't help but feel sympathy for him. As he establishes his leadership over the other primates and plans his uprising, part of us roots for him, even though we know what it will eventually mean for humankind.The first half is admittedly slow for an action movie, but when the action starts it really gets going. The sight of Caesar and his followers rampaging through downtown San Francisco makes for a wonderfully entertaining spectacle, which only gets better as the humans start fighting back. Much of what takes place is naturally ludicrous if you stop to think about it. Even with human level intelligence there's no way a hundred apes could overcome a major city police department, but their battle is so fast paced and cleverly staged that we're willing to suspend disbelief. If the ewoks could defeat the Empire then why can't Caesar's cohort make monkeys of the cops? Rise of the Planet of the Apes is by no means perfect. As mentioned the plot is standard B movie fare, and calamity could have been avoided if a few people hadn't taken unnecessary risks or just not been complete jerks. The human characters also aren't as well developed as their simian co-stars. Franco's boss in particular comes off as one dimensional and the film's attempt to make him something of an antagonist never really works.That said, Rise is well paced and more emotionally engaging than any Planet of the Apes movie has a right to be. Coming on the heels of Avatar it also further showcases what the latest in FX tech can contribute to storytelling when used properly. And it delivers all the excitement a summer blockbuster should. Even if you were never a fan of the originals, this one is worth checking out on DVD or streaming.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The most emotional Planet of the Apes film.,"To sum it up, a very powerful film falling just short of being a masterpiece. However, the only flaw in the film is that the film could have been just a bit longer! I am really hoping for a director's cut because there should have been a few more character development scenes between father and son, boyfriend and girlfriend, and even Ape and Human. I felt the movie was paced a bit too quickly but nevertheless, still contains very fleshed out characters driven by excellent performances throughout, from Lithgow, to Franco, to Cox and especially by Andy Serkis.Cesar is by far the best animated character in the history of cinema. His facial expressions tell it all! You feel his rage, his fear, and his child like innocence through his wonderfully animated eyes. Not only is the C.G.I. good, but the character is written very well in general. You will go through all of those emotions yourself as you witness his journey. All I can say is that I now know why I try to walk my dog without a leash as much as possible. This movie just confirmed it for me! Through the film, you will understand what Cesar is feeling and why. The invisible character of the film is humanity itself, and at times, feels like a study of human nature.Plot wise, it is very well told. I thought there was nothing cheesy about the script, although not as intelligent as the original, but not dumb either. There is some science fiction in the film, and other than the experimental drug, there was some other surprising Science fiction plot elements in it too which might lead into the sequel; if there is one of course, and I think there will be.For the skeptics who think the film would be cheesy seeing all the apes battle armed policemen then think again. I too, was a bit skeptical at first, wondering how the apes would defeat an entire police force, but when you watch the film your doubts would dissipate. Just remember the physical ability of apes and how powerful the apes are, and how much more powerful they would be if they had brains! The action was very good, but as good as it was, I'd trade it in for more plot development. There were a bit too many plot jumps in the last 30 minutes, but all in all, it was directed very, very well. Coupled with a good score, mellow at times, but highly dramatic which heightens the tension. Speaking of tension, there is a lot of it in this film. If you're an animal lover like I am, then be warned; You will be in tears 30 seconds into the opening scene.I also wanted to mention the original film even though it's tough to compare the two. This is an origins story that actually makes the original better. The original was more about the plot than the characters and they each stand apart and alone with their own merits and flaws. It was nice to see a few homages to the old classic, and don't be surprised if you see a character from the original as well. I highly doubt this film will disappoint the fans of the original and TV series! It will have you climbing trees!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Best Planet of the Apes film since the original,"There was a lot of hype going into this film. I was very excited to finally see another Planet of the Apes film. I am a big fan of the original and had fun with the sequels and even after Tim Burton's remake I was still excited for this film and I got to say this is the best Planet of the Apes picture since the original.This story is an origin story about how the Apes began to rise to power and about a man who is bent on curing Alzheimer's and raising an ape who has been past on the genes of the cure from his mother and what the effects this has on this one ape named Caesar.The very surprising thing about this film is how story based and character based it really is. From the trailers it looked like just another cure gone wrong and a lot of violence happens but I was truly surprised by this film's story and how well told it was. I do think it needed to be just a tad longer in the beginning showing a little more of Caesar's childhood but it's a small fault and can be overlooked. But it is something truly wonderful to see how truly well fleshed out these characters are in this film especially for a ""summer blockbuster."" All character motivations are known throughout the film. James Franco's character named Will Rodman really wants to make this cure so he can cure his father. So a lot of us can really connect with him and in seeing he is making this cure for the best intentions. And his boss is the classic wants the cure for money type of character. But the best most drawn out character is the character of Caesar. The chimpanzee that becomes increased in intelligence is the true star of the film. He cannot talk and he is a computer made image and yet you really understand him, love him, and feel for him. Caesar is played by motion capture actor Andy Serkis (his second film as an ape, the other one being King Kong (2005)) brings so much to the table. He breathes so much personality into this ape and it's just truly something to wow at and the writers are very wise to really shift the story over from Will to Caesar as Caesar gets sent into an Ape refuge. While there he gets smarter and learns of the true nature of how apes are treated inside there and decides to take action.I think it was very smart on the filmmakers to shift the apes from makeup to cgi. I wasn't thrilled when I first heard they would make the apes in the computer but after viewing the film I've realized this was the only way to go really. It would look incredibly cheesy if they tried to do what they did in this film with makeup. The motion capture is some of the best to date and the apes look very real. None of the makeups did as good as job as the motion capture did at creating real ape behavior and also by not making them talk I think was a smart move. I don't think making them be able to speak would make it very realistic which seems to be more of the way the film tries to go with rather than a fantasy.The action is all mostly at the end of the film which is mostly seen in the trailers. While granted there is a little bit here and a little bit there it's all really at the end. It all is very entertaining and the apes do fight like real apes. There are moments where the filmmakers truly capture an ape aggression and what they are truly capable of. Not a lot of people know just how strong and fierce they can be and the film does a good job of showing that.But something I don't think is mention a lot is that there a nice magical quality to it. The scene in the redwoods is a very magical scene and I really liked it and never liked how it isn't mentioned.The acting is all very good and is a driving point of the film. James Franco is great, so are John Lithgow and Brian Cox. Also Tom Felton and David Oyelowo are good. Freida Pinto is good and all but I wish her character was given a better purpose and is one of the few faults with this film.The Music I thought was very good too. It had a very magical yet dark and exciting feel. Composer Patrick Doyle really gives out his best score in years. It will by no means become be considered a masterpiece it just is an above the average movie score and is a score that I would buy when the soundtrack was released on CD.The Directing by Rupert Wyatt is very good too. He handles the story written with such care. His choices in camera movements and how to properly handle the story is makes him a great choice. Also he uses cgi to better the project and only really uses it when he needs too which is something I always respected in a director these days.The writers Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa have crafted a great story and pay so much tribute to the original films. There are so many nice nods to the original which Planet of the Apes fans will enjoy. They also really know how write convincing dialogue and leaves the door open for a sequel but it could be just an make you think type of ending.The Bottom line is this is a very good story driven film that includes great special effects and matches the original and is the second best film of 2011Final Score 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a thought provoking and emotionally driven thrill ride!,"If you're like me, you will be completely fascinated by the story of this film. I'm a big fan of Planet of the Apes and to get to see its origins is really great. Out of the entire series of movies, I think this one truly is the best. It was just absolutely spectacular! The actors delivered fine performances for their well developed characters; the writers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, didn't miss a beat with their fantastic and intelligent script; and the story was compelling, exciting and emotionally touching.The star of the film is an ape named Caesar (whose emotions were brought to life brilliantly by Andy Serkis) who is the baby of an ape that was tested on for scientist Will Rodman's (James Franco) research in an effort that resulted in a way for the brain to heal itself, and what could possibly be the cure for Alzheimer's; a disease very personal for him because his father (John Lithgow) suffers from it -- even though Rodman is warned not to let personal issues get in the way of science. The drug also had another affect... it lead to the development of intelligence in apes. As Caesar grows older and smarter, though, he becomes more aware, questioning who and what he is. It is during an incident that causes Caesar to be separated from Will, in a feeling of abandonment, and then being mistreated by Dodge Landon (Tom Felton) at a shelter that ultimately leads to a hurt and confused Caesar plotting for revenge.. what becomes a war for primacy.Unlike the Planet of the Apes films from the past, this one did not have people running around in ape suits but instead presented us with CGI primates, emotional performances captured from actors. If I hadn't known it were CGI, though, I would have sworn that they were real apes. They were brilliant! Director Rupert Wyatt did a wonderful job of connecting this prequel to the first film, really catching every little detail and even littered respectful homages to the original throughout the entire film. Honestly, I just loved finding out what lead to the great ape takeover. And as I mentioned before, the script was just wonderful and made for a thought provoking and emotionally driven thrill ride!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intense  and exciting film great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology,"Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . 7th movie in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by ¨Planet of Apes¨ that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years. It deals with Caesar (Andy Serkis , this is the second film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco ,Tobey Maguire was considered for the role) and a Primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) . Will is desperately looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease that suffers his father (John Lightow). Rodman gives a substance Caesar, designed to help the brain repair itself , as Evolution Becomes Revolution . The chimpanzee gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that gives rise to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape uprising . Later on , Caesar is locked at a zoo and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . Meantime , lots of simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas murder violently every human in sight . At the ending happens a spectacular , fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape.This awesome film contains thrills , noisy action , violence , breathtaking scenes and a sour denounce about animal mistreat and against scientific corporations . This is an entertaining , big budget sci-fi flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being , racism , genetic experiments , apartheid , though also packs action, intrigue and amusement . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the first live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling, self aware animal. Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Unlike the previous films, this is the first Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . The performers are very fine , particularly Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs , James Franco and Freida Pinto are pretty good , the characters are well drawn . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of Motion Capture they are still oddly convincing . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be an impressive flick full of action , battles and suspense . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . The screenwriters based the idea for this script from genetic engineering, to numerous reports of chimpanzees attacking their owners, and to the fact that people in the United States are raising various species of non-human primates. One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Patrick Doyle , it's full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Rupert Wyatt (Kathryn Bigelow, Robert Rodriguez, Tomas Alfredson and James McTeigue all were considered by the studio, or passed on the project before this director signed on).Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) and finally Tim Burton version (2000) with Mark Whalberg , Tim Roth , Helena Bonham Carter and special appearance by Charlton Heston .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Against all odds, this must be the best ""blockbuster"" I've seen all summer.","Summer 2011 will go down in history as one of the more disappointing seasons in many years when it comes to movies. This is the time of year that people rush out in masses to see the latest action extravaganza, and to be fair, some films have delivered on that promise -- ""Harry Potter,"" ""Captain America"" (though I have yet to see either of them and am simply relying on general reactions) -- but there's been a whole lot of disappointments, too, and the worst part is that people still seem to be flocking to them, almost out of necessity than wont (""Transformers 3"" and ""Pirates 4"" both made over $1 bil worldwide, which is amazing, because they both sucked).I think the last film anyone expected to reverse the trend this summer was a prequel to a franchise that has been consistently poor over the years since its original incarnation in 1968. Indeed, the first trailer for ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focused on ape carnage and mayhem, and although a subsequent one highlighted the dramatic underpinning of the film, it seemed like Fox was just trying to turn around its marketing and fool people into thinking there was more than meets the eye.Alas, the second trailer turned out to be a far more accurate reflection of the movie than anyone would have expected. ""Rise of the Apes"" is most likely the best film of the blockbuster season, full of heart, carefully crafted and professionally delivered on every level.Sure, the story has its fair share of clichés -- the ""evil caretakers"" played by Brian Cox and Tom Felton seem bad just because the film requires them to be, and Felton's performance in particular is so over-the-top that it's almost a caricature -- but because of how the film is packaged, and because it spends so much time focusing on the character of Caesar (played magnificently by Andy Serkis), you are willing to overlook many of the flaws. You care about the characters and the story, even when you kinda know where it's headed and feel like it's a variation of a prison break-out movie with apes in place of humans.The human cast, as has been noted by many critics, is nothing to write home about. James Franco doesn't exactly phone in his performance but it's not the sort of role that is going to be lining him up for any awards. Toby Maguire was originally lined up for the project before he was dropped (he reportedly came to Fox with script notes, and they promptly cut off discussions with him), but Franco does seem a more natural fit, and does well enough in a role destined to be sidelined by the apes.And the apes are awesome. No, we haven't quite mastered fully realistic CGI yet -- especially when it's mixed with live actors. (WETA claims that the technology here is superior to ""Avatar,"" but it's not as convincing, perhaps because the CGI so rarely interacted with human actors in ""Avatar,"" and thus we were able to accept the fantasy world more willingly.) However, this is some of the best seen to date. Serkis (who previously played King Kong in Peter Jackson's remake) translates a brilliant performance, for which the film owes a great deal; Caesar is really the crux of the whole thing, and a poor or less realistic performance would have undermined the whole thing. It's the subtle stuff here that makes a difference -- the emotions captured in Caesar's facial expressions, or the glint of sympathy in his eyes when John Lithgow's character begins to suffer from Alzheimer's. There's a moment of genius in that particular scene where Caesar exchanges a sad, knowing glance with Franco's character, and it's eerily touching.Director Rupert Wyatt follows blockbuster blueprints from beginning to end, but by enriching the first three-quarters of his film with character development and an actual *story* (something so many blockbusters these days seem to be sorely lacking), when the big action sequence arrives at the end, you're invested in what's happening -- and you actually care.I confess to never having watched many of the ""Apes"" films. I do recall seeing the Tim Burton remake in theaters a decade ago, and even as a 12-year-old kid, I thought, Wow, this sucks. ""Rise"" is infinitely better, more creative and more emotionally stirring -- as aforementioned, it's nothing completely unique or novel from a storytelling standpoint, but it's well-crafted in an old-fashioned, refreshingly familiar way, and the addition of groundbreaking CGI makes it a ""must-see"" rather than something to catch on television. Fox isn't known for pleasing fans with their remakes and sequels (whether it be Die Hard or Wolverine), but Summer 2011 sees two of their biggest properties successfully reinvigorated: first ""X-Men First Class,"" and now this. For my money, ""Apes"" is better -- perhaps the best blockbuster of the season -- which I never in a million years expected to say.Without spoiling anything, the film sets itself up for a sequel. Considering it's on track to smash expectations and take in $55 mil this weekend alone, it's pretty much a sure-thing that it will happen. Hopefully the follow-up takes heed of this film's strengths and doesn't abandon the character development in favor of boisterous action sequences. The fact that audiences are reacting strongly to this movie is an indication of what's been lacking all summer: stories with characters we care about. Go see this if you want to end a disappointing summer on a positive note.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Caesar is great! The humans are...fine...I guess.,"This is a much smarter way to reboot a moribund series, taking the aesthetics into a new century while also updating the narrative to match with new technology. It also trusts the audience to empathize with a non-human character using that new technology, and then it includes the anchor of the human story which is simply not as strong.Instead of trying to recreate any of the previous movies up to this point, Rupert Wyatt pushed the newest entry in the franchise in the Batman Begins direction of giving a grounded, modern take on a fantastical subject. Some chimpanzees are kidnapped from a jungle in Africa and sold to a company doing research into an Alzheimer's cure. A female goes on a rampage after she's infused, but it wasn't due to the cure but because she was protecting her baby she had delivered in secret in the lab. The chief scientist, Will, takes the baby home, discovers it has increased mental powers, and keeps the baby he and his sick father name Caesar.This opening is largely dominated by the human side of the story, and it suffers a bit for it. Will is played by James Franco who's more of a performance artist than an actor and doesn't really deliver much terribly convincingly. The antagonist is a money-grubbing corporate type with a British accent, Jacobs, and he's flat and uninteresting. The scientific stuff is not terribly convincing, feeling like Hollywood dealing in stuff it doesn't really understand. What saves this part is really John Lithgow as Will's father, Charles. He's a quality actor playing the disheveled and confused old man really well and with a depth of humanity that is missing from the rest of the performers.However, it's at about this point that Caesar begins to take center stage. Caesar the character and performance by Andy Serkis is the single greatest part of this movie, and he's great, one of the single greatest things about the franchise up to this point. Caesar grows from an innocent baby monkey into a cynical and hardened leader who uses what tools he has to stand apart from humanity and push ape-kind into a new direction. The digital performance, captured from Serkis' own motion captured performance, is subtle and touching.Caesar ends up defending Charles from their butthead neighbor (another flaw in the movie since he's so thinly drawn and cartoonish, but the part is small, so there wasn't a whole lot else to do) and gets ordered by the court to remain in an ape sanctuary just outside the city of San Francisco. It's there that Caesar first encounters other apes, sees their limitations in contrast to his own heightened intelligence, and how, despite how nice Will and his girlfriend Caroline were to him, Caesar is still a step lower than humans in this world. It's a situation he can't stomach after a while exposed to the unvarnished truth. This is where he hardens, searching for a new truth, and it's all done wordlessly, anchored entirely by facial performances. It's great.Caesar's solution is to expose the rest of the apes along with him in captivity to the compound that Will had been working on, breaking out and stealing it from Will's own refrigerator since he had been doing so much work on it, giving it to his father, outside of work (thin, but okay). With his newfound alpha status and a few dozen suddenly intelligent apes (the scene where they wake up and understand what's going on around them significantly more is a great quiet moment), Caesar decides that they won't live in captivity. Instead, they will escape to the Redwood forests on the other side of the San Francisco Bay.It's pretty much at this point that the human side of the story finally and completely becomes mere support to the main story of Caesar's journey, and the movie improves greatly. Caesar works to get his people free, the movie embraces some action conventions with the apes freeing the apes at a zoo and the remaining apes at the genetics lab before grabbing spears and fighting off the police and Jacobs over the Golden Gate Bridge. It's a satisfying use of action elements because of the clear emotional anchor that is Caesar.Now, a moment about callbacks. In my review of Tim Burton's re-imagining of Planet of the Apes, I complained about the callbacks, saying that they were poorly placed and ill-used, arguing that they could never rise out of guffaw territory. Well, Rise of the Planet of the Apes has several callbacks, perhaps more than Burton's movie, but they work significantly better. Let's take one for example. Tom Felton's character, Dodge, is facing down Caesar at the beginning of his revolt, and Caesar grabs Dodge. ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape,"" Dodge cries out, giving the audience that moment of recognition to something it knows, but then the movie immediately undercuts that with a big emotional moment, Caesar saying his first word, ""No."" The sudden ""No!"" undercuts the guffaw moment and brings the audience immediately back to the emotional reality of what's going on, focusing us on what Caesar is doing. So, the movie gets its callback to a famous line from the original film, fits it into the situation rather organically, but then moves on very quickly to keep the focus where it needs to be, Caesar. It's a very good way to make callbacks work in dramatic situations, essentially making sure that they aren't the focus.Anyway, if the focus were more on Caesar, the film would be great, but because we spend so much time with the uninteresting and rather bland humans through the first half, it's not as good as it could be. It's not that the human stuff is bad, it's just that it's not terribly interesting especially in comparison to what Caesar goes through. Still, it's a solid way to reboot a moribund franchise in a new time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I really wanted to like this film more -- and I'm sorry...,"...but it didn't do it for me. I'm a huge fan of the series (excluding the Tim Burton disaster, of course) but this didn't have nearly the depth nor the intelligence I was expecting. Like most I was initially skeptical at the idea of attempting to reboot the franchise -- but as positive reviews kept flowing in regarding this ""smart"" script and Avatar-like CGI, I began to get excited again. With the surprisingly high box office numbers and positive feedback from most who saw it, I got more excited.I finally ponied up last night to check it out.The good news: The CGI apes stuff works pretty well. Serkis does his usual great job (although I thought his King Kong was better). Action sequences and set pieces are all good.The bad news: There's no Rod Serling-style, Twilight Zone-ish, philosophical themes or moral messages here. It isn't ""smart"" compared to the original films. This one is more like POTA for Dummies. It relies on a trite storyline that's been beaten to death (Don't play God; Don't mess with Nature -- yada, yada, yada) with nothing more interesting or thought-provoking. The original series was not afraid to hit you in the gut and make you think. Those movies were much heavier in every way; while this plays much more like a straight action film. Entertaining from that aspect -- along with Caesar himself, but not much else. So, I don't know where all this ""smart"" talk came from. If this passes for smart then our standards have dropped.Next is the acting. I don't blame the actors b/c it didn't seem that they had much to work with. Franco, Pinto, Felton, Cox and the rest are all one-note characters with little depth. All the humans are cardboard clichés in this film. I know Caesar is the protagonist -- but to have the other actors be so uninteresting is a real drawback. And this -- along with the trite story -- reminds me a bit of Avatar. A by-the-numbers retelling of Pocahontas or Dances with Wolves -- where all the characters are one-dimensional. Visually stunning, yes -- but with shallow characterizations. In Avatar, military guy = bad, corporate exec = bad; in ROTPOTA, drug company exec = bad, neighbor = bad, chimp worker = bad. There's not much else to say about them since we're not presented with their context.No one wanted to like this more than me. I was hoping the flavor of the original series had been brought back -- but I'm afraid if we can't resurrect Rod Serling or enlist a writer of his caliber, we'll never see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wow It's actually a great movie!,"I had extremely low expectations for Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). I loved the original 1968 classic, but every sequel/remake after it sucked. I was surprised they were going to make a prequel of the classic and I thought it was a good idea. But still after so many bad sequels and remakes, I still had my big doubts. Also I didn't like how the monkeys were made by CGI/Special Effects, why not use a robotic monkey or a real one, it would look more real.After my viewing of the film, I was pleasantly surprised and I liked it overall. But there were definitely flaws in the movie, no doubt about it. The characters were a bit uninteresting at times, there were subplots that went pretty much nowhere and indicated that there could sequels in the works, but it all depends on how much money it makes. The movie, at some points turned to an average summer blockbuster with all the action scenes and explosions, but it redeems itself later on.However there are plenty of positive qualities, the movie has. Andy Serkis delivers a great performance as the lead ape in the film and is pretty much the star of the film. James Franco and Freida Pinto, both did a good job portraying their characters. The movie also poses ethical/moral questions, which I found very interesting. The movie is easily on of the most thrilling films we've had this summer. Finally a movie that pays respect to the 1968 original science fiction classic!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
As much as you could hope from a blockbuster,"Back in 2001, everything was in place to re-launch a much-loved, yet dated franchise, that was first kicked off way back in 1968 with Planet of the Apes. The mythology was already laid out, and was ripe to be adjusted, experimented with, and ultimately improved upon. The re-make had an interesting (if overrated) director in Tim Burton, who had made a bona fide classic with Edward Scissorhands and the fantastic and lovingly-rendered Ed Wood. In came up-and-coming A-lister Mark Wahlberg who had impressed in Boogie Nights and Three Kings, and great support in Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Then the film came out. And it was s**t. And worst of all it didn't make sense. It took ten years to recover, and thankfully another attempt has been made to kick this franchise up the arse. Only this time it seems like they've put some thought into it.Dr. Rodman (James Franco) is on the verge of discovering the cure for Alzheimer's disease. He tests his drugs on apes, and when one the apes shows remarkable advances in intelligence, he believes he has it. But when pitching his product to investors, the ape escapes and goes on a rampage, only to be shot dead. It turns out she was only protecting her newly-born child, who Rodman takes home to care for. His Alzheimers- suffering father Charles (John Lithgow) is taken by the chimp and they name it Caesar. But as Caesar grows physically, he does so mentally too. He starts to notice that he is more a pet than family to Rodman, and when Caesar attacks a neighbour, he is taken into care by the sadistic John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son Dodge (Tom Felton). While there, Caesar rebels against the cruelty, and educates his fellow chimp-mates.While Franco may be top billed, the film is stolen by Andy Serkis as Caesar. Of course, the special effects are a marvel and are often flawless. But the character breaks through the effects, and at Caesar's core there is something ultimately human and real. He is the film's heart, if you will, and the film would fall flat on it's face if Caesar was not successfully drawn. Serkis seems to be the go-to guy when a director wants the movements for an entirely CG-character (Gollum, King Kong), and it's clear why. He made Gollum possibly the most memorable character is the last twenty years, and here he shines in the quieter moments, as he broods in his cell, contemplating and absorbing his surroundings. His eyes speak louder than words. It's a triumph of effects and acting.While there is plenty to enjoy about the film - it is as exciting, action-packed, and as intelligent as you would hope a blockbuster would be - there are some negatives. It's unclear as to why Brian Cox was cast in a relatively thin role that any actor could play, and Freida Pinto, one of the stars of Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, is wasted and is nothing more than eye-candy. Tom Felton, clearly cast for his t**t-like qualities, highlighted in his role as Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter, is given a rather cartoon bad guy to play, and the script never really allows the character rise above cliché.But these are rather minor quibbles in what is a thoroughly enjoyable film, that equals it's CG-fuelled visuals with brains and genuine heart. A great start to what is hopefully an interesting franchise, and more than enough to diminish those terrible memories of Tim Burton's terrible 2001 re-make.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Evolution without Revolution,"Hollywood is losing ideas. We already know that. Now we are stuck having remakes, reboots, & prequels. And what's worse, most of these prequels are hardly connected to the original film & sometimes they say it's a reboot. The film? It can be entertaining in some parts, but mostly it's a wooden & clichéd sci-fi story. Convoluted from the original Planet of the Apes series but like they say, This could be a reboot. Any new ideas, Hollywood?The movie is totally disconnected from the original Planet of the Apes movies. It's obvious that they wanted to make another reboot of the series. They're losing ideas & wanted to improve some of the old classics. Rise of the Planet of the Apes doesn't want to show the true origin of the first series. I don't think Fox is still capable of making accurate prequels. It's just like X-Men First Class although X-Men is an enjoyable movie and it's necessary to tell its story.The story here can be interesting but it ends up being generic & predictable. Science goes wrong, Humans are evil, Too much sappiness, & ends with a predictable and somewhat exhausting action climax. Since none of the apes are real, The CGI looks impressive though. The main ape's actor, Andy Serkis, only spoken few lines in this movie but the motion he provides to the character is remarkably amazing. He's an expert to these motion capture characters. James Franco ends up being a wooden character. What's the point of Freida Pinto's character? Tom Felton is playing Draco Malfoy again & this time he's teasing Apes. At least John Lithgow gave some emotional moments.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an altered, predictable, & unnecessary prequel. The filmmaking has already been evolved but still no revolution. The studio is out of ideas & we are getting these unnecessary prequels that suddenly appearing as a reboot. Even the film itself is not good. I noticed that most people liked it maybe because the CGI is quite amazing and the motion capture performance of Andy Serkis nails most of the film. But really, this is unnecessary & ridiculous. The ending also has an ambition for a sequel. I guess these prequels are deceiving reboots.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Summer 2011: A season blessed with brilliant prequels,"To begin on a tangent before evaluating the film, before summer 2011, I had not seen a decent prequel film. Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn't care for previously.Rise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA from now on, I can't bear typing it) is not only a triumph in CG animation, but as a stellar science fiction film, that remembers that films are infinitely more engaging when the audience actually cares for the characters on screen. Too often do I see films with a high premise that forget to flesh out their characters, leaving us to run around in mindless, weightless explosions with nobodies who we know less than 3 things about (cough, Transformers 3). Yes, RPA is about super intelligent apes that ransack cities and take on armed forces with little more than what surrounds them, but before we get to that there is an enormous amount of development from the main protagonist; Caesar. Although the advertisement trumpets James Franco, John Lithgow etc, the real star here is Andy Serkis, along with millions of dollars worth of CG animation to create the most expressive animated creatures on film. Even with Avatar, using real humans, pales in comparison to the amount of detail going into every single one of these apes; there is not one second in the film where you cannot understand one of the primates intentions - you could practically vocalise them yourself with the refined eye movement, body language that clearly separates Caesar from his more primitive relatives. Needless to say, Caesar's performance is flawless; after all this is the man who brought Gollum to life, but he captures the screen with an entirely wordless performance, which to me is the greatest part of the film. I felt for Caesar more than any other character in this film, and he did it without saying a word. Eat that Michael Bay. I was almost in tears at one point during one of Caesar's more emotional scenes for Christ Sake - although a chimp, the heightened intelligence really gives him just enough human characteristic to be above the uncanny valley while still behaving like an animal.The humans in the film were what I considered weakest in this film; not any of the performances were bad, but a little more development in some minor characters and some tweak in the writing here and there would have made this a perfect 10. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) felt a bit off to me; he was cruel but almost in a cartoon way, though I suspect that's more to do with ill writing than any personal issues. The main cast are good, though at it's current length, I think more development with James Franco's character wouldn't have gone amiss, but then again, this might have thrown off the pacing.Another thing I love about this film is that while taking a sharp diversion from its roots in terms of gradual characterisation, it does a superb job of delivering what everyone inevitably came for. A massive Chimpocalypse. A simian uprising that sees the downtrodden apes taking up arms against humanity, and in three words: it's f - ing cool. Made all the more exciting by the anticipation and the feel for these characters, the marvellous point about Caesar's character is that we sympathise with him, we understand why he leads an ape army AND WE SUPPORT HIM. A super intelligent ape is rallying a chimp attack force to free themselves from their confines, cause mayhem, disrupt order and ultimately rule humanity AND WE WANT THEM TO. And for that I applaud.I love a film that makes us look inwards at ourselves and question our own moral codes and attitudes to events in life (this one clearly representing a case of animal cruelty) that make us conclude that WE are indeed the bad guys, and we need to change. Living in a small, rural middle-class society (like myself) or a well-developed area often makes mainstream audiences forget about those less fortunate than themselves, and what it drives them to, or in this case, what having too much drives us to, and it's refreshing to see something that reminds us of how much of a plague we are to the rest of the planet.Overall, I would say a strong 9/10, perhaps not quite reaching the highs that First Class did, but by God, was it more consistent - definitely watch this one, and stay after the credits.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic CGI undermined by slow-moving plot and unconvincing characters,"CGI. It's the single best thing about this movie. All the apes in this movie look and seem real, and there are some fantastic scenes, such as a huge gorilla charging a policeman on a horse on the Golden Gate Bridge! The leader ape, Caesar, is portrayed through motion capture by Andy Serkis. Now, as movie fans know, Andy Serkis always steals the show. As Gollum he overshadowed Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and company, and as King Kong he made a painfully long, overindulgent film seem passable. Unfortunately for us, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is more like the latter.Rupert Wyatt's directorial debut, The Escapist, was a competent effort, but one thing it was very good at was establishing character. It had a number of great character actors (Brian Cox in the lead, who also features in Rise of the Planet of the Apes), playing multi-dimensional roles. Unfortunately, this is actually the greatest weakness of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a scientist working on the cure of Alzheimer's, and the biggest problem about his character is that he does not act, feel or look like a scientist. Tobey Maguire was the original choice for this role before he had to drop out, and I certainly feel he would have been a better choice than his Spider Man co-star. Weaker still is Freida Pinto as Will's girlfriend who serves no purpose at all other than to occasionally warn Franco that he is tampering with things that should not be tampered with or something like that. Brian Cox and Tom Felton feature in one-dimensional roles who are laughable rather than creepy (especially Tom 'Draco Malfoy' Felton, who uses his Draco sneer in this film constantly). Finally there's David Oyelowo as Franco's money-centered boss, whose English accent is used to full effect to show how bad he is. Oyelowo's character is not developed at all, and he is the same over the number of years that the films plot goes over.I would mention that John Lithgow's performance as Wills' Alzeimer's affected father is fairly convincing, but it does not reprieve the others.The other major drawback is the slow plot, which lags in several places and does not serve up enough consistent action over the piece to keep entertainment-hungry teenagers happy. The end scenes, where apes begin to take a stand against the consistently nasty humans, are impressive, but by then - after being through so much back story spanning over a large number of years - I did not really care.Lastly, and oddly, a huge drawback of the film was the marketing. As a huge movie fan, I viewed every trailer for this film, and unfortunately felt that I knew exactly what was coming since the trailer had every interesting scene in it, including in a lesser used trailer, the death of a significant character. It does not help that the film is a prequel, as the audience knows that apes succeed in taking over the world, so we know that they will not be destroyed by humans in the final battle. Because of this knowledge, it lacks tension.In conclusion, it is certainly a watchable film, but another under-par summer blockbuster which is slow-moving and frankly boring in places. It is partially saved by the amazing CGI and conclusive battle, but this cannot quite this from getting away from a disappointing 6/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Lacks development but compensates with suggestive nuance,"It's surprising how engaging segments of this film can be, despite its over-reliance on non-verbal display, linear plot developments, and stock personalities; it's precisely the detail lent to non-verbal display, however, that makes the film worth seeing. Primate dominance hierarchies and play behaviour, meticulously rendered emotions—fear and its autonomic signatures (shallow breathing, dilated pupils, etc.--and consciousness-raising depictions of Alzheimer's disease and its impact on loved ones, all go a long way to make the film seem ""round"" rather than ""flat."" Surprising touches of nuance pervade the film, actually. Caesar, the intelligent chimp and protagonist, displays his perceptiveness and inward-looking grasp of his circumstances, uses a Chinese fable about strength in numbers and weakness in division to reveal his organizational aspirations, is self-restrained and morally sensitized, etc. Then you have ironically ape-like zookeepers revealing themselves in different ways to be more primate-like than the primates they hold in captivity, etc. One zookeeper, with a simian mien, becomes mesmerized by an evangelical commercial, yet happens also to be more sensible than his stereotypically aggressive colleague.So the film has its merits and holds attention, but it also has serious weaknesses common to most Hollywood fair, such as an unwillingness to develop characters, inexplicable plot jumps and unrealistic moments defying belief, etc. We should demand more from sci-fi, since the genre is such an excellent vehicle for thought experimentation, and can explore certain social problems in ways non sci-fi can't. So I should think a truly penetrating look at human nature may come from a Planet of the Apes follow-up feature, a film outranking its classic original in psychological depth and structural control. But whether such a production could meet marketing expectations is doubtful by today's standards. Animated chimps and blue humanoids wielding bows and arrows are expected to appeal to the masses, largely for the sake of making money and not telling a rich, philosophically focused story. I can be hopeful, all the same, can't I?One must, after having watched a film, take stock of its overall 'value' for viewers, despite how a film has made us feel; insofar as lasting value is consideration, Rise of the Planet of the Apes achieves little, because its characters and events lack mimetic relation to experiences in life, as realistically developed over time, as opposed to ample stimuli that we can't help but emote to, since we're viewing primal displays that prompt automatic response. There's little impetus for introspection in this film. Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, by contrast--and I use this as an example merely because the title shows up briefly in the film for the namesake of the protagonist chimp--has much more command over the psychological sphere, over what we're experiencing and how we judge others, and what we ought to do about how we feel, within a complex social structure. I was hoping the filmmakers would bring more from Julius Caesar's themes into the film--and the follow-up film may very well evince this, with a chimp revolt of some sort against their leader--but I would expect any relation, at this point, to be only superficial.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Hands down, the best summer movie of 2011","Of all the movies that can possibly be re-booted......why reboot another movie that's already been re-booted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one? Well it must be the script, because everyone that's come across it has wanted to be somewhat involved. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don't think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton's version.Finally......a summer movie that's actually WORTH your summer dollar. Almost every element of this film is pitch perfect. Just what makes this 'oh so' great? Allow me to explain....Judging from the preview, i thought the movie to be a little too relative to the concept from ""Deep Blue Sea"". But this movie takes a much more different route with their Alzheimer's approach. Needless to say, they did a much better job than that movie.....obviously.I know most people may be scratching their heads to this comment, but in my opinion, this is easily the most well written script of the year thus far. It's intelligent, thought provoking, emotional, and damn well entertaining. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape 'Ceaser' (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. It's now easy to see just why everyone jumped on board when they read this. I kid you not, i actually got goosebumps from this movie, and that rarely happens.And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. Andy Serkis who has already done work like this before in 'Lord of Rings' and 'King Kong', out preformed most actors in Hollywood without barely saying a word. Is it wrong to say that a man in a blue suit with dots all over him, imitating an ape is so far the best actor i've seen this year? Uh.....not at all. Trust me, see the movie, and you'll understand why.Bottom Line.......not only is this easily the best movie of the summer, i will go as far as saying it's the best movie i have seen so far this year. Yes, it is THAT good. Like i said earlier, almost every element of this movie is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the special effects.....all done to near perfection. It some people's eyes, this is called a reboot. However, it feels more like a prequel.

Essentially just another blockbuster with impressive effects,"A film such as this – essentially another summer blockbuster – must be taken on its own terms and on those terms is is rather impressive. But please ignore all claims along the lines that this film 'examines our relationship with blah-blah' or any other such blarney. Lined up against other blockbusters Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes stands tall, mainly, of course, because of its impressive CGI effects. Judged on other criteria, though, it is pretty much standard hokum. Still, go along and enjoy it, but don't read too much into it. There is precious little characterisation, hardly any 'plot' or story and the characters are, at best, two-dimensional, with the standard bad guys and the standard rather misunderstood good guys. But on its own terms it does the biz and then some. Someone else reviewing it here has described it as a 'masterpiece'. Not quite, and don't fall for it.

Not just another monkey movie!,"After the trailer piqued my interest I was expecting quite a different plot to the original ""Apes"", and now it's over I can say I was not disappointed.In the original story humans travel though space to a planet inhabited by intelligent monkeys. This plot was fine for schoolboy comics but it really required a leap of faith for the cinema goers. The latest tale gives a more plausible (though still quite ridiculous) explanation for the monkeys' rise to master their own destiny: Their intelligence was boosted accidentally by medication.OK, it sounds a bit lame but the film is actually very good on many levels. The stars (monkeys) all have personalities, even without the ability to speak. There are many scenes where I felt genuinely bad about the way they were treated. The modern digital imaging is just incredible - I really couldn't tell what I was watching was computer generated, and the expressions on their faces are better acted than their supporting human cast!The story starts off slowly but even then it's never boring. Things really get rolling about halfway though, and it's an action movie after all....so the climax comes with plenty of thrills as the alpha males (human and ape) contend for dominance in a shoot out like you have never seen before.Although this wasn't the most rip-roaring movie I have seen this year, it was by far the most original. Full marks for the plot, and high marks for the testosterone (you could almost smell it)! Loved it. If you are a big kid, go watch it, you'll love it too.

Strong sci-fi with great visual storytelling,"A scientist working on a cure for Alzheimer's takes home a baby chimpanzee with high intelligence.If you are a fan of the Franklin J. Schaffner film there is no reason not to like this reboot prequel, as it takes a plausible approach to getting us to the original's concept.The star of the show is Caesar the chimp, who is brought to life with 2011 CGI and a great performance from Andy Serkis. His interactions with all other characters are very cinematic and the highlight of the film. He is supported well by James Franco, John Lithgow, Tom Felton, Brian Cox, and David Oyelowo.Generally the plot focuses on character development and origins without doing too much that could have made it long-winded. There are the odd few contrived moments and plot holes that defy logic, but if you have the right suspension of disbelief it does the film no real harm.Visually it has lots of memorable images that tell the story of Caesar's journey. The best parts involve his growth as a character and the relationship between apes and humans.If you need lots of action spectacle in your movies, it has plenty of that with its inevitable conflict between human and ape characters. For me this aspect is a mixed bag as it has both crowd pleasing character moments and ridiculously OTT physical feats.

Best movie of Summer 2011,"I didn't want to watch Rise of the Planets of the Apes. First of all because of the title and secondly because it was another Planets of the ape movie. The last try at rebooting this franchise was a disaster even with Tim Burton directing it. As such, I didn't have high hopes with the movie.Directed by Rupert Wyatt, the movie feels like it was directed with tight lease. Caesar and his actions and reactions to the world are the best part of the movie. I think you are not going to see CGI at its best again until James Cameron comes up with Avatar 2 and 3. The story is tight and makes you sit on your toes even though you know whats going to happen in the end. Acting wise, James Franco leads the charge as a son who won't let go of his father. Frieda Pinto is adequate.If you are in two minds about going to this movie, take a chance and watch it. The worst that will happen is you will watch another unsatisfying movie this summer.

Monkeying around with a million dollars,"What the hell is this thing anyway? I am left here puzzling at how starved we must be for tentpole entertainment, not just now but for a long time, to have a whole bunch of films about intelligent apes running amok.There was Godzilla at one point, Night of the Living Dead. Beyond the allegoric politics of these films that offered something to chew on, one could easily posit the mayhem in a believable world. The only stretch was to accept a giant lizard or the dead rising from graves, beyond that the ensuing destruction was carried out with a natural, unplanned dumbness driven by instincts.The sheer ludicrousness of this thing however defies belief. Let's just swallow young genius who invents miraculous cure but with unforeseen side-effects. The idea of an intelligent ape rallying his kin of regular primates around him to throw away the bonds of human oppression. In just what kind of world can a swarm of apes stomp around San Francisco unnoticed? How to solve this? Of course imbue with a a kind of supernatural speed and co-ordination that should go unquestioned because there wouldn't be a movie otherwise.This perfectly prefaces the final segment. The apes are suddenly super intelligent, so it makes some sense that humans would behave like primates. So set up a SWAT roadblock on one end of the Golden Bridge, then have mounted police! storm in the firing range. Have them outwitted by excellent battle tactics, wherein a bunch of gorillas push an upturned bus for cover and one of them charges against a hellicopter. Eegad.Dumb, ugly, preposterous. But of course it's a movie about apes run amok, we should make some concessions, right? So how to handle, in that light, the extremely cheesy 'human interest' angle about father and son, maker and creation? Perhaps this is the daftest thing here, the strained emotional earnestness meant to ground this in believable world dynamics.What is the most troubling to me, is that all this has been received with mostly a straight face and a round of applause, as an example of the summer blockbuster done right. There is a movement lobbying for an Oscar nod to Andy Serkis.The parting image is a laugh riot of unadulterated cheese.

In this movie they do make some references to the 1968 film Planet of the Apes which is really awesome and it actually works. One word to describe the visual effects.... ""Amazing."" The apes look so real. The story is interesting and the acting is really good too. The story gets better when Caesar gets older. One complaint that I have is that I wanted this movie to be just a little bit longer. This is probably one of the best Planet of the Apes films since the original 1968 version. Overall this a movie everyone should see this movie even if your a fan of this franchise. And I think the sequel is going to be even better.""Caesar is home."" -Caesar",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I didn't see in 'till Blu-Ray but a GREAT FILM!,"I was not available to see films in 2011 to 2012 but when I got it on BRD, this is one of the better films I have seen in a very long time. The best part was a repeat of the line that originated with Charlton Heston with a couple of them. First, ""It's a madhouse, just a madhouse..."" and the top one is, ""Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!"". The ape gave use the word human substituted or ape. The storyline is great, the effects are top notch. I like to buy and get the digital version right with it. Just make sure your digital version hasn't expired. I made that error in the past so if you insist on both copies, make sure you are purchasing and receive what it advertised. I don't work for anyone that sells discs but get what you pay for.

I'm Starting To Get Into This Franchise Already,"I have heard from people that the franchise is supposed to be even better than the original film. Now I have watched this, I think I may already be getting into the franchise and why many love these movies so much. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an excellent action-packed movie that reboots the original film and takes to a whole new level. A lot thanks to a highly intense story, awesome editing and special effects that makes the monkey's intelligence look intimidating, great character growth especially for Caesar's intentions throughout the movie, exciting action during the final act, and a powerful social commentary on animal abuse for experimenting. I think this will be the movie worth watching, even those that were like me and have not watched any of the movies. Once you give this a watch, I can guarantee you that it will make you want to catch up to the entire franchise. This has given this to a really great start and really has given me its first impression. Can't wait to watch more of these so even I can rise with the apes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A humantarian epic.,"""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is an outstanding, if unsurprisingly depressing, prelude. The tale is centered around a cast of photoreal CG simians believable enough to relate with as characters. Post-apocalyptic entry has a rougher path ahead, depending on positive publicity and spectacle. ""Rise"" rewrites ""Apes"" legend to present an alternate history for mankind's extinction. Movie's key animal characters display incredibly detailed personalities that no trained monkey or ape-suited actor could possibly have conveyed.

Good origin story,"Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on an experimental drug to cure Alzheimer's disease. The chimp on the drug goes berserk to protect her baby which nobody saw and is killed. Will would raise the baby as a human child naming him Caesar. When Caesar attacks a neighbor, he is locked away. There he suffers under the cruel attentions of the guard.Special kudos for Andy Serkis who performed the motion capture for Caesar. It could have been so easy to have the CG chimps look like a video game. This is actually a much better origin story for the franchise than 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' (1971). The logic holds intact. It just works well. If there is anything holding it back, it's that you have to empathize with Caesar for long stretches of time. For so many reasons, it is just hard to maintain. First, he's a CG creation. Second, we know what he would turn into. Third, he's a chimp that could probably rip your face off. It's an inherit difficulty that this movie couldn't escape.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Average Flick.,"After reading all the reviews and all the hype, I decided to go watch this movie and to be honest I don't know why this movie was hyped up and why it got such good reviews....Besides the special effects, I found this movie an average flick. Storyline was average and very predictable. There was nothing special in the acting side of the movie.

"Interesting, but an 8 out of 10 it's not.","First, it's not a bad movie, but neither is it a great movie, which what the 8 average (as offered up by IMDb users) have given it. That would put this movie above Titanic (7.4) and just below Avatar (8.1), which is ridiculous. It's not even as good as the Mark Wahlberg movie a few years ago.Having said that, it's decent film that movie fans should see, but seeing on the big screen isn't mandated. The story telling in ""Apes"" is unique in that it tells the story from the point of view an orphaned chimp named Caesar, adopted as a lab-test animal by a drug researcher played by James Franco, who's good in this. Franco's character is trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his father, played by the terrific John Lithcow, is in the grips of.But the stories is told through the eyes of chimp Caesar, who goes from family pet/child to being the punching bag for a tyrannical chimp in a California rescue facility for apes. But as clever Caesar outsmarts his aggressor, he comes to realize that the humans that run the facility -- and the world at large -- are the real tyrants, and he sets out to set things right.That portion of the story works well. What doesn't work is the predictable evil pharmaceutical boogeyman playing God by splicing DNA for profit.As I said, the movie is OK, but and 8?

One of the most underrated films of all time.,"There's literally nothing I dislike about this film. This is a perfect intro to the trilogy, we see Caesar grow up in a beautiful sequence.

Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes is cinematic art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's a Madhouse! A Madhouse!,"Greetings again from the darkness. As a young kid I saw the original Planet of the Apes at a drive-in with my parents. At the time, I mostly just thought the talking apes were cool and enjoyed the surprise ending, despite having no ability to really process the statement that Pierre Boulle (novel) and Rod Serling (screenplay) were making. Since then, I have had a soft spot for the series, including the Tim Burton version 10 years ago.As you can tell by the title, this latest version is truly a pre-quel. It is meant to explain the beginnings of how the Apes gained intelligence and created a powerful society that would one day rule humans. It begins in a genetic engineering lab run by James Franco and his team. They are using chimps to test an experimental drug that will hopefully be used to treat and cure Alzheimer's. In fact, Mr. Franco's father is played by John Lithgow, a once renowned musician and teacher, who is now suffering the effects of this horrible disease.When things go wrong at the lab, Franco breaks most every known law and tests the drug on dear old dad. Of course, it works miracles. The accident in the lab, leads Franco to adopt a baby chimp born to one of the chimps used to test the drug. This chimp quickly becomes the smartest one in the house, neighborhood and city. Named Caesar, his learning curve is off the charts. And yes, after a couple of years, his strength and temper are as well.After yet another accident, Caesar is put away in a chimp camp run by greedy Brian Cox and sadistic Tom Felton (Draco of Harry Potter fame). Caesar uses his intelligence and the unsuspecting and unobservant nature of the humans to organize a coup. This part is really something to behold.By far the best acting in the film is delivered by Andy Serkis. Don't recognize the name? You might know him better as King Kong or Gollum in Lord of the Rings. Mr. Serkis is a motion-capture actor-extraordinare. It is sometimes difficult to tell where these effects stop and the CGI begins, but overall the look of the chimps is pretty good and the action sequences are downright amazing.What hurts the film is the weakness of the human stories. Franco as a genius scientist? Doesn't work for me. Freida Pinto as a primate specialist? The script gives her nothing to work with. Lithgow and Cox are excellent actors, but mere pawns in this story.Director Rupert Wyatt tips a cap to the original film a few times: tribute names such as Bright Eyes and Dodge Landon, an orange orangutan named Maurice (in honor of Maurice Evans), a quick glimpse of a Statue of Liberty puzzle, horse-back riding, Charlton Heston on TV (as Moses), and a couple of classic lines including ""stinking paws"".In what was supposed to be a transition story, this one really belongs to the apes ... and it's teed up beautifully for a sequel just across the Golden Gate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It could have been worse... it could have been better.,"OK, let's start by saying that this film is quite reasonable, in fact I'd put it just above that. Now, the reason I say this is because the film gets the most important thing right: it makes sure that we connect with the main character, Caesar. We get to care about him, feel when he's in pain, and root for him when he finally organises a rebellion. Despite being a CGI creation, we, as viewers, are shown something that feels real. No, not in the tangible sense, for the CGI does fail a few times (not often), but in that we come to see the character as one that possesses depth. I have to admit to being fairly impressed with Andy Serkis and the animators in rendering Caesar better than I thought it would be. Yay for Caesar! However, I have to also say that the following is far less than praise.***WARNING! The following might annoy fanboys!*** ;)Now, Caesar is fine, the character we care for, his pain is our pain, etc. Good, that's the important thing that they had to get right. Without that, the film would be a failure. However, that doesn't mean that just because they've created a well rendered main character who is CGI, full of emotions and connections, that they should just stop there and think their job is done. See, I have to say that all the human characters in this film are fairly weak and one-dimensional. The villains tend to be black-and-white caricatures, simplistic and hollow. The original series of PotA had villains, but most of them were fairly rounded, not all pure ""evil"" (Doctor Zaius and Doctor Hasslein, even though they can be seen as generally the villains of the piece in the films that they were in, have their reasons for what they're doing; they're not purely ""evil"", so to speak), but it seems that that is a bit too complex for today's audience, so we're given easy to despise ""baddies"", who act in ways that seem as subtle as a Michael Bay film. Another thing is that the acting of the humans isn't up to much. Most of the actors don't really seem to be trying. Franco looks bored, Pinto seems lost wondering what to do, Felton seems like he still thinks he's in the Harry Potter set near Watford, while Lithgow, although he does throw some acting punches now and then, does seem like he could do better. Then again, the script doesn't help the human characters, so I suppose that doesn't help the actors.Another problem with this film, especially if you want to compare it to the originals, is that it's fairly light in its political message and science fiction concepts. I'm not sure that the idea that society has moved on is a good justification for such weaknesses. There are plenty of hard hitting issues in the world that still need looking at, even ones that still affect us today like they did in the 1960s. The original series of films might not be the most intelligent films ever made, but they did try to come up with some thought behind them, and were certainly, at least in the case of the first film, intelligently written. Rise, unfortunately, seems to just push the ""don't be cruel to animals"" line as well as the ""don't meddle with genetics"", which seems to me to lack the impact of the social issues that the original films were tackling. I don't buy the excuse that things have moved on and that serious topics won't have a resonance.Still, all the above isn't to say that the film is bad. Far from it, but I just think it could have been better handled. I think there were too many compromises in trying to satisfy non-PotA fans out there, giving us a watered down version. However, even though it's watered down (IMO, naturally), it still keeps interest as a film. The apes are the interesting ones, and I suppose it got that right. Once it got to the apes, the film gets impressive, earning respect. The story as a story was worth telling, despite its limitations.Does it deserve a sequel? Yes, I think it deserves sequels; it's done enough for me to warrant that. I also think that a sequel to this story will bring about a more compelling one, with various conflicts between man and ape, and even those within the apes, bringing in more angles and points of interest. It's difficult to start off a series like this, particularly when you know roughly where it's going to lead, so in some ways I should be more forgiving towards Rise. Maybe they'll also be able to explore more weightier themes in the sequels, because they might well be given the chance to with new story ideas. Still, that's a big maybe, and probably a stretch.So, please go and watch this film. It's not fantastic, it's not rubbish, it's more a popcorn film but on the better end of the spectrum. Enjoyable, but brain is optional.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Apes Rule,"I didn't see other Planet of the apes movie. Even though I strongly doubt any of those past movies can top this newest edition to the franchise. For me, script and acting wise Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the best movie of the summer.While usually a summer movie is expected to be heavy on action and CGI, Rise of the Planet of the Apes's true strength lies on its story telling. (Though the CGI part of the movie was pretty awesome too.) It was well paced, emotional and thought provoking. From the opening sequence I was hooked to the screen and I could hardly turn my head till the movie ends.James Franco delivered a superb performance as the talented scientist who is hell bend on finding a cure for his mentally disabled father. But the best performance of the movie, just like every one else is saying, is without a doubt the ape named Ceaser acted by mo-cap actor Andy Serkis. This time i believe he has outdone himself from his previous work in Lord of the Rings and King Kong. The character Ceaser was simply phenomenal. The way the makers blend human emotion with wild animal instinct in Ceaser was really amazing. From his birth to moment he assumes the leadership of the league of free apes, audience will be emotionally attached with him every sequence. You will adore him at his infancy, get amazed by his intellect at his young age, be angry when he was treated so cruelly by human and feel the adrenalin rush when he finally breaks free and rises to the top. The way this character Ceaser developed was almost similar to a Disney character.Rupert Wyatt did one of his best work as director. The CGI, though in my opinion is not the main attraction of the movie, was better than most of the movies of this summer. The apes movement and their facial expressions were spot on. Their wild nature was vivid while in their face you could also read affection, fear, anger, commitment and other such human like emotions in a very realistic way. The score of the movie was very well crafted. It blends well with the sequences and adds a lot in raising emotions.It is very hard to neat pick a movie as good as this one but there are some very minor short comings in my opinion. while James Franco's character has a very big role at the beginning of the movie, his importance gradually fades away as the story reaches towards its end. I think writer could do a bit more with him. Freida Pinto has contributed virtually nothing to the story except from being the love interest of James Franco. I think she is a talented actress and could do a lot if was given the opportunity. The movie felt a bit rushed at the beginning. I personally wanted to see more of Ceasers childhood. And finally as a summer movie it could use a bit more action. Most of its action is near the end of the movie and i don't know if it is enough to satisfy an edge of the seat, jaw dropping action lover. But considering over all quality of the movie these short comings can easily be ignored.Now, I shall watch the original Planet of the Apes movie. And for you I cannot recommend a movie more than this one. This is as good as a summer movie can be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Give Enough Chimps Enough Typewriters And They Could Write A Better Screenplay,"I've no idea how I managed to miss RISE . It came out three years ago and I recall it going on my watch it when it comes out on DVD list but never got round to it for some reason . Now that the sequel DAWN has opened to almost universal praise it's very timely that Channel 4 decided to give it its British TV network broadcast . I saw the trailers on channel 4 last week and made sure I wasn't going to miss it and if I enjoyed this film I might just go out of my way and spend money watching the sequel in the cinema . Hmmmm . After seeing RISE it looks like I've just saved myself the price of a bus ride and a cinema ticketTo be fair the producers deserve some credit on not going for a reworking of the original Pierre Boulle novel . A rocket travels to another planet where Apes at the top of the evolutionary ladder and there's a shock twist at the end . It's been done before and very well in the 1968 film and abysmally in the Tim Burton version so congratulations for trying a different spin this time with a reworking of CONQUESTThe unfortunate thing is the storyline is very predictable and lacking in any imagination . Okay in CONQUEST apes are used as slaves and it's up to Ceaser a self aware chimpanzee from the future who is a fugitive leading a revolution by apes to overthrow their cruel masters . There's not a lot of realism to that plot but the great strength of the original franchise was that it was made with so much imagination plausibility didn't matter "" The good bomb made us all "" indeed and for that we should be grateful . Here however everything is so recognisable that it ends up becoming , insipid , vapid and very mundaneThis most especially extends to the humans who are one note clichés . Good scientists , trying to benefit mankind , sick relative , sadistic guard type character and worst of all rabidly greedy corporate company boss . It says something that the best performance comes from Andy Serkis and he plays the film in a CGI suit swinging through trees and rattling bars but to be fair again Daniel Day Lewis would be incapable of bringing much to the roles of humans in this screenplayThere's a saying that "" If you give enough chimpanzees enough typewriters they will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare "" Apparently this is an untrue truism and according to the likes of Richard Dawkins and other scientists involved in biology there's neither enough chimpanzees or typewriters for this to remotely come close to happening . That said if you give a typewriter to someone like Paul Dehn and sit him in a committee of Hollywood film producers he can string out a highly entertaining and imaginative series of movies based upon a film adaptation of Pierre Boulle;s original novel. There's nothing like that here and you feel you're watching something not all that far removed from the Syfy channel",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
You damned dirty apes!,"Having watched the original ""Planet of the Apes"" the other day, which was great, I found myself in the mood for more ape action. However all of the original sequels are apparently rubbish and the less said about the 2001 remake of PotA the better. That left me with the modern prequels and so here we are.It's fair to say that prosthetics, special effects and technology have come a long way in the last forty to fifty years. This means that the many and varied apes in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" look absolutely incredible. Just amazing really. There's real subtlety and emotional colour in their features and movement to the extent that their existence is never in question.That's a good thing because the humans in the film are fairly superficial and play basically stock characters: the conflicted scientist, the evil money man, the needlessly cruel animal keeper and so on. Which is not to say that they don't play their roles well because they do and so the movie keeps on trucking.But the apes are the stars here and they deserve it. From the get-go they're abused, manipulated, slaughtered and imprisoned. You see the pain in their eyes and feel their despair. This makes them the good guys in my book (well most of them anyway) and I was really rooting for them when the tables got turned.Is it a great film then? Actually yes it is. The story is solid, the acting competent and the effects outstanding. It's just a shame that the movie doesn't quite end with a bang because it's really setting you up for the sequel (which I can't wait to watch tonight).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good concept, but a waste of a great opportunity","I give a 7/10 to a good movie, but this is not a good movie. Like the Curates Egg; it is good in parts.

This is a movie that should have been made a few years from now, when the CGi will be perfected. The CGi is a crutch for the whole movie; without it, this film would flop like a jellyfish. Acting; awful. Dialogue; atrocious. Writing; childish. The plot-holes have been well documented elsewhere. Wait for this to come up on your TV schedule; it is not worth going out of your way to see. The only thing of interest is to see where the sequel goes from here, and how they knit it into the pre-existing classics.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a successful reboot in the long-running Planet of the Apes series.,"This movie really came out of nowhere.In 2006, screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver developed a concept for a new Planet of the Apes film, eventually titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans, Jaffa and Silver conceived the film as a way to reboot the franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest.In this version, Caesar receives enhanced cognition from a new viral drug and is raised by humans; after being imprisoned in a primate sanctuary, he uses his ingenuity to launch an uprising. Jaffa and Silver successfully pitched the story to Fox. However, development was slow for several years as the production cycled through writers, directors, and producers. In January 2010 Peter Chernin of Chernin Entertainment signed on as producer, and brought Jaffa and Silver back on to complete the script.The producers hired Rupert Wyatt to direct.Fox partnered with New Zealand visual effects company Weta Digital to create realistic ape effects, and performance capture actor Andy Serkis signed on to star as Caesar. James Franco signed on as the human lead, Will RodmanThe film debuted on August 5, 2011.Critics reviewed it positively, praising the visual effects, Wyatt's direction, and Serkis' performance as Caesar. Rise was a major box office hit, taking in a total of $481,801,049 over its $93 million budget.Fox immediately planned for a sequel.I won't talk about this movie from beginning to end, but it is a very successful reboot in the Planet of the Apes film series.Will Rodman is played by James Franco and she is trying to find a cure for brain aliments such as Alzheimer's disease. It is given to Caesar's mother, Bright Eyes, but she dies. Will's boss, Steven Jacobs is played by David Oyelowo and the performance he gives is just incredible.Frieda Pinto, Tom Felton and John Lithgow rounds out the rest of the film's all-star cast as other human characters and they have a lot of back story. I loved the performances in this movie and I really did love the actor playing Caesar, which was Andy Serkis, he did CGI and performance capture for the character and the apes look amazing.The CGI for the apes is amazing, the story is subtle and very coherent and the rest is just top-notch. The direction by Rupert Wyatt is very interesting and this movie does not take a lot of re-watches to understand the plot because the plot is not confusing. This reboot is very successful and it is so cool to see because I like the Planet of the Apes movies, but then Dawn of the Planet of the Apes came out in July of last year and really blew me.The editing, cinematography, production design, costume design and musical score by Patrick Doyle is really great and it is really interesting as well.Overall, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES breathes new life into the franchise and is remembered by audiences, moviegoers and critics everyone as a successful reboot in the long-running Planet of the Apes series, which began in 1968 with the original Planet of the Apes film, directed by Franklin J. Schnaffner and starring Charlton Heston.I give it an 8.4 out of 10, not a bad movie, but it is a must-see for all kids and teenagers and moviegoers everywhere.

I expected worse,"Certainly the movie is well done, it fits perfectly all parts of the first ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968) to be truly ""rise"" but I think this is fair to expect ... In general it is well shot, the actors are up to the task even if the monkeys resemble less and less of the Apes (the set, in general, could do better). It tells a story that was possible to develop and exhaust in ten minutes and came out a movie rather than bored: it runs fast and creates a certain suspense.

With amazing cinematography and sweet editing, I was overall very impressed. The plot was amazing as well too. No, these apes did not just randomly escape and destroy everything, but everything has it's reason. Problem is, they didn't focus much on the character development and HONESTLY, they showed the chimp Ceaser more than the humans. Then we have the ground breaker. The special effects in this movie were overall stunning! The CGI chimps were magical, and you can actually feel for them (getting up there with Pixar.) Their emotions were spot on and imagine yourself actually inserting hundreds on apes onto the screen. Another great thing, the score.

Then when the action scenes come in, your heart is racing to see what happens with the music making your heart pump. Then, of course, we have the flaws.

Mixed opinion of the Tim Burton movie, like many I was wary before seeing this one. From the oft played trailer for the film, I thought they'd shown the whole story. Actually, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.A quite intelligent script sees the start of the ""Rise of the Apes"" as we see the new Ceasar raised by humans, turn bitter and begin the backlash of his fellow apes.... Drags a bit at times but it doesn't matter, it doesn't cut corners and keeps your attention. Very well done and not really any corny stuff as was the case with some of the original prequels.Acting is very good, but the CGI is exceptionally good and you sometimes believe it's real (quite a feat when they are mimicking animals).Good direction, good action and good pacing make this worth viewing.Must note that for other fans of the original, it does have lots of references to the original film.

Excellent premise to show how apes might have come to take over from humans.,"Last week my wife and I saw the newer Apes movie, ""Dawn of..."" and while watching it, and getting a glimpse of Caesar's back-story, we realized we had never seen this one, ""Rise Of..."". So we watched it last night.As an overall impression I think this one is clearly a more interesting movie. It is about a scientist, played by James Franco, working to develop a type of virus that would repair brain cells. He had a particular interest as his dad living with him had already begun to develop dementia.The virus works but eventually the body develops autoimmune responses making its effect temporary, so he has to tailor a different virus.Meanwhile the apes used for research at his company get some of the virus and begin to exhibit signs of greatly enhanced intelligence. An incident causes them to put down all the apes but the scientist finds that one of the Chimp females had a newborn, with the green specs in his eyes, indicating he had inherited the intelligence.Bringing him home and naming him Caesar he progresses very rapidly with intelligence absent from other Chimps.So where the ""Dawn Of..."" features the apes in their own colony in Muir Woods, eventually battling the humans in San Francisco, this one contains all the events that lead up to that, how the apes gained intelligence and how they escaped to form their own colony.Good movie!SPOILERS: Caesar (played well in motion-capture by Andy Serkis) ends up in a facility for apes outside San Francisco. He figures out that the serum his ""dad"" was working on could give all the apes intelligence so he plans a break-out and theft to do that, then they all break out to go to Muir Woods, having to battle and defeat police on the Golden Gate Bridge to get there. Meanwhile we see that the last virus is harmful to humans, it gets transferred to the neighbor, an airline pilot, and as the movie ends we see a graphic depicting this virus being spread all over the world. In ""Dawn Of..."" we learn the virus that made the apes smart also killed most of the Earth's population.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the better movies I have seen so far this year...,"I loved the original film, the sequels that followed were a mixed bag and I disliked Tim Burton's remake especially for the ending.

I did, very much so.Rise of the Planet of the Apes mayn't be perfect, but it is for me one of the better movies to do with Planet of the Apes since the original and one of the better movies this year.Rise of the Planet of the Apes for a start looks mind-blowing. Beautiful photography, striking settings and scenery and brilliant effects are plenty of reasons to like this movie, as well as the breathtaking action sequences especially the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge and emotionally powerful score.The story is thrilling and well paced with not too much excess to interrupt the flow. Dialogue is mostly very good and thoughtful, if sometimes clunky particularly in the scenes with Franco and Pinto and one or two of the morals about Man Playing God. Rupert Wyatt's direction is excellent.The characters are mostly engaging, though it is true that the apes are more interesting than the human characters. But Franco's character especially is given enough empathy and depth to make us care for him. Best character? Easily Caesar, not only the most interesting characters but the one I felt the most sympathy for.Acting is very good. It is occasionally a little hammy, with John Lithgow and Brian Cox, however James Franco gives a very credible lead performance, Frieda Pinto is decent, Tom Felton is surprisingly good and Andy Serkis is just phenomenal.Overall, a very good movie. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Breathes New Life into the Franchise; Andy Serkis is the Reason to Watch.,"Rupert Wyatt's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' breathes new life into the forgotten franchise. The screenplay is intriguing and stirring, the special effects and fight sequences are incredible, but it's the lead ape Caesar, played by the brilliantly talented Andy Serkis, who keeps us captivated till the end. Caesar's growth is quite interesting to watch.Actors like Franco, Pinto and Lithgow play their parts commendably. Tom Felton and Brian Cox have minuscule roles. The sound effects and background score are well in tone with the movie.This is the first part of the prequel trilogy to 'Planet of the Apes'. The screenplay is intelligent and intriguing. Hope it continues to be so.Everyone needs a place they belong to. No matter how loved and cared for one is at a place, if he/she doesn't have others like him/her around them, it can become really a lonely place. And intelligent creatures don't want to be someone else's pet or slave; freedom has always been a driving force, throughout the history of mankind. - These facts are used quite effectively with Caesar's story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Going Ape ...,"Or as they called the movie in Germany: Prevolution. But let's not get into the title game (I'm not gonna spell that for you). Let's focus on the movie. It might have taken them a lot of time to come with another Ape movie (after the ""re-imagening"" Tim Burton unleashed upon us), but it was worth the wait.We have another reboot (sort of), which tells us, that stands alone. And while that is true, it is nice to see all the nods to the classic ape movie! There is even a clip with Charlton Heston playing in the background in one scene. There is a quote from the original movie (I'm gonna say one word: ""paws""!) and other nods, that do justice to the ape-line. Great actors, great story (though you may know where it all leads too, it still is filled with tension and exciting to watch), very recommendable!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"""Rodman"" (quite an engaging effort from James Franco) is doing a bit of experimentation on apes to try and find a way to treat his ailing father's Alzheimer's. It's when one of those goes bonkers and is killed that he realises that she had recently given birth. He retrieves the youngster and rears it at the home he shares with dad ""Charles"" (John Lithgow). It's all going fine until ""Caesar"" spots a neighbour having a go at the confused old man and decides he's having none of that. Now enter Brian Cox and his truly odious sidekick ""Dodge"" (Tom Felton) who are in charge of the newly incarcerated ""Caesar"". This is not a character to be dominated though, and after a nervous start he begins to learn - how to get out of this trap and how to avenge himself on those who are keeping his brethren locked up. It's a solid story, well told, with quite a lot packed into this shorter and well crafted depiction of humankind's intolerance and ignorance of these adaptable and intuitive creatures. It's not long before ""Caesar"" is exhibiting cohesive thoughts and leadership skills so you would not be betting against him achieving his goals... It's a bit cheesy at the beginning, this, but once it's got into gear it moves along quickly and offers us quite a bit of food for thought - about our science, our attitudes and our pharmaceutical industries too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Great Prequel,"In San Francisco, the scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) has been researching for almost six years in the Gen Sys Company the ALZ 112 drug in chimpanzees expecting to find the cure to the Alzheimer since his father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) has been deteriorating with the disease.When a subject ape increases its intelligence, Will brings the results of his experiment to his greedy chief, Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo), requesting to use the experimental drug in a human subject. However, his chimpanzee becomes aggressive and is murdered by a security guard. Sooner Will finds that the animal had had an offspring and its change of behavior was actually intended to protect its offspring.Will hides the chimpanzee Caesar and brings it home, raising the animal that has a high IQ like a son. He also gives the drug to his father that recovers from the Alzheimer. When Caesar protects Charles from a neighbor, the court sends the animal to a shelter, where Caesar is imprisoned and abused by the sadistic guard. Will and his girlfriend Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) appeal but Caesar defends the other apes and becomes a leader among his fellow inmates. Sooner he gives the experimental drug 113, which is lethal for mankind, to the other chimpanzees and organizes a rebellion against the humans.I was reluctant to see ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", expecting to see a commercial blockbuster prequel to the classical franchise. However, friends of mine have told me that it would be worthwhile watching this film and today I have just watched it on DVD.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is indeed a great prequel to ""Planet of the Apes', with an excellent story and a screenplay without plot holes. Unfortunately there are explosions in the end of the story and exaggeration in the number of apes that escape from the ""sanctuary"" managed by John Landon, performed by Brian Cox. The DVD is very poor and does not offer any Extras, but there is an important scene entwined in the credits. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Planeta dos Macacos: A Origem"" (""Planet of the Apes: The Origin"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Waste of time and money,"This movie was a complete disaster. You are wasting your money. Trust me on this one. It is unrealistic in so many ways. First of all, the US has a lot more cops than 20. And a whole lot more helicopters than just 1. And a National Guard...and plenty of weapons. This movie could have been a whole lot better with a different plot, and the mimics and the behavior of the apes more realistic (except for Ceasar who should express intelligence). Just watch National Geographic Channel for Goodness sake! Did they have zoologists as consultants at all? The director just had to have action scenes. But they were few and poorly made.The 2001 Mark Whalberg-film may be pointless, but much better than this one. And the first Charlton Heston-film is still the best.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The Best Blockbuster Since ""X-Men: First Class""","Rise of Planet of the Apes (which I will now refer to as Planet for obvious reasons) has had lots of marketing in the last few weeks, and all of it portrays this movie to be a chaotic disaster/action film. Fortunately, while mayhem rears itself in the climax, Planet is more of a suspense drama that tautly engrosses its viewers through expert storytelling, spellbinding performances, a well-wrought script, and stunning visuals.I find no need to give a detailed plot summary, because most of the plot is given away in the trailer. Basically, our hero Will Rodman develops ALZ-112, the cure for Alzheimer's disease, while testing on chimps. However, his key chimp goes bananas and is shot. After the drug is discarded and the apes put down, Will discovers the ape's baby that the drug passed on to and decides to raise it for himself. However, as time passes, the super-smart ape Caesar begins to clash with his neighbors, his origins, and his place in the world.From the beginning, Planet is a thoroughly gripping movie. The dialogue is genuine, the characters are more than relatable, and most of all, the ape visuals are frighteningly real. James Franco lays down a solid performance as Will, and right off the bat makes the viewer care about his character. The co-stars (especially John Lithgow as Will's unfortunate father) also allow the viewers to invest emotionally, but the true star is Andy Serkis's Caesar. From his early playful and curious antics to his shock and fear among the other apes, Andy's digitally rendered performance awes us. When the climax arrives, his presence is downright commanding. That signifies true acting power.The level of design that went into the visual side of Planet is immeasurable. Yes, we are not debating whether or not the apes are real, but they hold our attention nonetheless. For instance, the ape integration scene when the apes are first out of their cages together is inspired. Also, the apes truly acted like you would expect apes to act, and therefore added to the realism.The scriptwriting, while not ""whip-smart"" like some have described, is perfectly balanced, providing a rising tension and an air of dread unmatched by nearly all movies this year. I was genuinely surprised by how powerful the writing was, and how ready the audience was for the finale.There are very few flaws with this movie, but there are enough to name. Freida Pinto's character Caroline, while well-acted, seemed unnecessary and under-written, almost as if she was added in as an afterthought, or as if she was expendable. Also, Tom Felton's nasty character was just plain stupid. Not only did he make illogical decisions in nearly every moment of his screen time (the hose/electrical prod scene was groan worthy on his part), but I also find it hard to believe that someone as irresponsible and brutal as him would find work in an ape house. After all, apes are not dogs, and I'm sure the humane society would have regular check-ups.*SPOILER ALERT*Also, Jacobs death scene was out of place. The entire sequence played out like the audience was supposed to be horrified, but instead afterwards we realize that this should have felt like the death of the villain and we should be satisfied. But that kind of didn't make sense considering Jacobs wasn't nasty enough to be a main villain.*END SPOILER*Finally, small plot holes litter the script. Why did Will still have the updated drug in his fridge long after his father's death? How did no one realize that their neighbor had an ape for five years? How did this elite company not notice some of their breakthrough drug go missing?On a side note, did anyone else have trouble with the names? I felt like the only names i remembered were ""Caesar"" and ""Bright Eyes"". Everyone else I had to nickname names like ""James Franco"", ""the girlfriend"", ""the bloody nose dude"", ""the black boss"", ""the nasty blonde dude"", etc. Maybe its just me, so I won't detract stars.In any case, Planet is an engrossing movie. Not in just the visual ""Avatar"" sense, but also emotionally. It is exhilarating, smart, and entertaining. Rise of the Planet of the Apes comes highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"very good, not enough action","when i sat down in the theatre to enjoy rise of the planet of the apes, in eagerness to purchase the box set sold at HMV for the originals.i think it was acted well and Tom Felton made me laugh like he does as he played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films.i thought there would be more of the riot they would lead towards taking over the planet, and less of the evolution of the mind.I enjoyed it overall and look forward to the early ones and thinks that will roman is a lot better as a scientist instead of throwing pumpkin bombs ;) it makes me think of what could actually happen and felt much sympathy for Will Rodman's father, who had Alzeimer's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Has its flaws, but was so much better than expected","When news first reached me about a new Planet of the Apes film I was mildly intrigued. After seeing the trailer confusion sort of took over that intrigue. I couldn't see the purpose in making an origin story to a franchise that I thought died a horrible death with Tim Burton's remake from 2001. As the release of the film became more and more imminent my skepticism grew. I eventually reached the conclusion that this wasn't going to be a great film, but I'd probably see it anyways. Upon its release the film began receiving rave reviews and a glint of hope was then restored in me. And now that I've finally gotten around to seeing it I'm very glad I did.Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of the apes first rise to power which, after years of evolution, would eventually lead to the events of the original film. James Franco stars as Will Rodman, a young scientist who is searching for the cure to Alzheimer's. He and his colleagues are testing the serum Will has come up with on apes and, due to a mishap in the lab, Will is forced to take home a baby ape that has been received the Alzheimer's antidote genetically through its mother. This chimp eventually grows up to be Caesar, the highly intelligent ape that will one day rise up to overthrow the humans and take over the world. This film is the account of just how he got there, and wow is it exciting! This is a film that ripens over time. It starts out fairly slow with a sort of clichéd scientist versus corporation hitch. Then Caesar is introduced and he starts to grow up and we see his progression over time as he becomes smarter, and therefore more aware of the situation he is in. The script in Rise of the Planet of the Apes leads something to be desired, so a lot of this setup, albeit necessary, gets old. The film really kicks off after an incident which gets Caesar put into a prison like ape facility. After this the film spends its time switching between the apes and the humans. As should be the case, I quickly began to care less and less about what the humans were doing with their lackluster dialogue and dull subplots, and I cared a lot more about what the apes were doing. Honestly, that's the way it should be.Rise of the Planet of the Apes does raise one very important question, however. Can someone win an Oscar for a motion capture performance? I'm talking, of course, about the magnificent Andy Serkis who plays Caesar in the film. His portrayal of the defiant ape is possibly the greatest thing about the entire movie. For one, the technical feat of creating such a realistic looking ape through motion capture is astounding, but Andy Serkis makes it all the more convincing with his fluidly brilliant movement and fantastic facial features which make Caesar into more human of a character than the actual humans, who aren't exactly the most developed of characters. The third act of this film is wicked as it kicks off the ape uprising in all its destructive glory. The movie takes off and becomes a truly awesome Summer blockbuster.I love being surprised by a movie, and that's why I so thoroughly enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It was so much better than expected, with some really incredible technical feats and gripping action for the last third of the film. There are humans in this film but they are more in the way than anything. It's all about the apes, and this film certainly delivers in that department. This is definitely a must see for the Summer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A perfect beginning.,"For a movie released in 2011, the cinematography and CGI were well-done. Not to mention the amazing performance from all the talented actors.It was heartbreaking to witness Caesar getting tortured and kept inside the sanctuary where he learned nothing but hatred for humans. In the end, he led his tribe to freedom. Met his ""father"" once more to finally say goodbye. It was bittersweet, but at least he found his place with his kind.This movie is a classic that is the beginning to Caesar's trilogy movies. Among all the three movies, I must say RISE was the most emotional one. Never thought I would cry over apes on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyed,"What I like about this film is that it creates a new and exciting story to audiences who have no knowledge whatsoever of the original. I've never watched the original but the premise in this gave an appreciation for this franchise.What you get is a man that raises a genetically engineered ape who will be locked down in a cage with fellow less intelligent apes. The apes look and sound epic and we grow to like them more than any human characterThe film does, however, feel like a setup. We've seen how the story started but we didn't get much out of it. We get the consequences of this story by the ending and it does rule. I just feel like we didn't see everything that the story was telling. I feel like there wasn't a lot of connection between all of the apes, but then again this is the beginning of a story and it does right to get us hooked for something more fulfilling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This wasn't a story at all, just a bunch of dis-jointed scenes that don't make any sense at all. Geesh, really? A bad actor, a bad actress, CGI monkey's do not a movie make.

Great movie,"Really well done. Had zero expectations coming into this and was very happy after watching it. James Franco did a phenomenal job convincing me he is more than a flash in the pan. The depth of characters(mainly Caesars and Franco's character) had me vested in both of them and watching the whole time. The latter half of the movie over a little too quick for my tastes but all in all it was a great watch. My woman had some issues with the subject of animal testing but really loved this movie for what it was. A step above a popcorn flick but a step under a movie with too much depth, this hit everything for me. Again very happy after watching this as I had not expected much from it and walked away wanting to revisit the other films.

The best franchise reboot ever made. A Sci-Fi classic!,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a perfect start to this outstanding Apes-Reboot Franchise. It is undoubtedly the best reboot of a franchise ever made. The film manages to weave an engaging narrative, brilliant characters, and a compelling origin story about Caesar.The movie breathes fresh life into the franchise, while remaining faithful to the 1968 classic and its mythos. The epic ape vs. Human battles are just a small part of what makes this film great. The writing is impeccable, with heart, depth, and emotion, and the performances of the entire cast, both CGI and non-CGI, are underrated.Andy Serkis delivers a standout performance as Caesar. Which turned out to be one of the most complex and beautifully crafted characters in all of cinema history. Serkis' motion capture mastery is unparalleled. His portrayal deserved an Oscar, it is a shame that he never received one. James Franco, who I have never fully liked in his comedic performances, really shines in this movie. His acting is exceptional, and it is great to see him in a different role. John Lithgow, who has limited screen time, delivers his best pure performance yet. His portrayal of Charles, who suffers from Alzheimer's, is both scarily accurate and emotionally devastating.The film's cinematography is stunning, ranging from expansive shots of San Francisco to the claustrophobic feel of Will's house and the Ape sanctuary. The writing shines in its characters and their relationships, with the main relationship between Caesar and Will, as well as the sub-relationships, being beautifully crafted.Following Caesar's story is nothing short of epic. We follow his journey from his first steps to his angsty teenage phase, to becoming the leader of a revolution. Watching him struggle with being basically human in every way except physically. Then seeing him battle between his love for his family and his new love for his species. Heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.This movie means so much to me and is a massive part of my love for cinema. It is both fun and entertaining while being dark and emotional.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Prequel Worthy of the Original,"The original 1968 Planet of the Apes spawned its own sequel titles and even had its own remake with Tim Burton's 2001 version. Now the original film acquires its own prequel which is also setting itself up for sequels. Confused? Think of the Star Wars franchise as a comparison and that should help. So who started it all in Rise of the Planet of the Apes? James Franco ladies and gentlemen. Franco's father, John Lithgow, is fading away through Alzheimer's. Luckily, Franco is a leading scientist when it comes to ideas and methods to regenerate brain tissue. Before these syringes full of regenerative juice can be injected into humans though, they must first be tested on chimpanzees.Through a series of misunderstandings and then guilt, Franco acquires and brings home baby Caesar and raises him as his son. At first, Caesar does not recognize he is a chimpanzee or at least does not bother to ask why he is different from daddy. Unfortunately, Caesar learns harshly that other humans only see him as a 'dirty Ape'. The zoo chimps also do not recognize Caesar as one of them so here we have our lead character with the ultimate identity crisis; not an ape, not a human.I was skeptical going into this film about sitting through yet another iteration in the Ape franchise. Was this summer blockbuster just made as a one off attempt to win the box office one week or would it have a quality script with complexities? I believe it chose the latter – most of the time. The first half hour and the last half hour of this film are outstanding. Watching Caesar come of age at first and finally become a leader and spur on the film's climax are really entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, the middle hour of the film sometimes feels like a burden to sit through. These are scenes which of course are required to show Caesar figuring out reality and his place in it, but it does not always make for riveting movie watching for the audience. There are also repugnant characters to endure including Brain Cox and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) as chimp caretakers.The payoff is worth it though. No actual chimpanzees were used in this film; every single one you see is CGI and I suppose that is how it could only have worked. These chimps need facial expressions and require a bit of knowing behind the eyes. Also, there are a few sneaky hints throughout which reference the original film which are fun to watch for. I hope the next film in this franchise is up to the challenge to be as good as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very Decent Indeed,"You do not have to have seen any previous films in your life to make full sense of this film. The plot is, whilst far-fetched, totally enthralling. The effects are top quality. The acting is mostly believable. The lead girl is at times a little formulaic and the guy that runs the scientific lab seems like his character has been somewhat conveniently forced out by the writer to move on the plot. However, I'd never thought it'd be possible for me to feel like I understand the feelings and intents of a monkey. I always knew the human race was stupid, but now I'm convinced.This film successfully brought me into its world, excited and moved me and left me pondering social structures. This is not the kind of film I usually like so I'd strongly suggest that it will suit a wide audience. I suppose, in terms of genre, it is a very palatable action/drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

It is actually not a crap movie!,"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical before watching this movie. I saw the trailer before and I thought ""Wow, another crap movie about apes"". (Mind you it wasn't just me who thought so, the editor of the trailer should be taken blame for that) But then I saw the rating and reviews and I was surprised (lots of the reviews say the same thing too). Thus, I became excited to watch it.It was kind of a prequel to the original ""Planet of the Apes"", which I did not watch. Well ""Planet of the Apes"" was about a planet conquered by Apes where humans were enslaved. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" I suppose, is how it started. A few scientists tested a medicine which was supposed to help human enhance the brain action, on Chimpanzees. so eventually before the humans get smart, the Chimpanzees gotten smart first.OK I think I made it sound a little stupid, but I have to admit it was quite well done. and it was no doubt for the effects and everything to be good after realizing it was done by Weta, which previous works were ""Lord of the Rings"", ""King Kong"" and even ""Avatar"".Andy Serkis was Caesar the Ape. I think he was brilliant, again being cast as a character as so after Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"" and the King Kong in ""King Kong"". The emotions and details looked really good. James Franco did fairly for his part, nothing spectacular but did what his character needed to be. It was interesting to see Freida Pinto here, interesting choice, though her part was not a lot in the movie. The other actors like John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton and etc. did fairly well too.The length of the movie was just nice, and enough to keep going for the whole movie. Even some really tense scenes too. Overall it was above expectation, I give it a thumbs-up for a movie as such to be made successful.No doubt a Best Visual Effect nomination for 2012 Oscar.

Oscars for a Ape character- Andy Serkis deserves it - A Truly exceptional Film,"Two months before, I saw the first official trailer of 'Rise of the planet of Apes'. I was not convinced by the first look and I thought , here we go, another old franchise reboot. But then, I saw the second theatrical trailer of the film 2 weeks ago. It was a better version, giving ideas to the plot of the film. It intrigued me and especially the eye of the chief ape character captivated me. I decided then, I have to see this movie.I saw the movie yesterday, it was a incredible movie. Like Avatar, performance capture techniques are used in this film. The actors wear a special suit to captures their facial movements & expression and CGI transforms it to the ape in the screens. While Avatar was exceptional in this, I feel this movie has truly hit home the possibilities of performance capture technology. Gone are the days were complete CGI morphed the characters minus the emotions. With this,a director can give life to anything that moves.Andy Serkis, 'Ceasar' the ape is the main protagonist in the movie and carries the entire movie on its shoulders. Movie shows the transformation of Caesar from a human family chimp to a ape that understands his origin and leads the primates into a new beginning. Andy has done a extra ordinary job, a truly Oscar performance. Frieda Pinto's character does not get much scope in the film. It is Franco & Serkis show all the way.The way the film ended, is a clear sign of sequels. There is a HUGE scope for the sequels and I am already excited about how well it could be. 10 on 10 for 'The Rise of the Planet of Apes' and most entertaining movie of the Year yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not without flaws, but overall quite potent and entertaining.","An iconic series is brought into the 21st century with engaging results. Starting from square one, it shows how a dedicated researcher, Will Rodman (James Franco), is desperate to create a cure for Alzheimers', which is afflicting his father (ever solid John Lithgow). He is experimenting on chimpanzees, and the ultimate result is a super intelligent chimp whom he names Caesar (motion capture expert Andy Serkis). Caesar ends up in an animal shelter where he is treated terribly by a sadistic employee (Tom Felton of the ""Harry Potter"" series). He ends up so disillusioned with the human race that he motivates his fellow primates to stage an uprising.For quite a while, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is so emotionally involving, and riveting, that it really keeps you watching. You genuinely sympathize with a lot of the characters, and also naturally come to hate characters such as a stereotypically greedy corporation bigwig (David Oyelowo), the nasty Dodge (Felton), and the hostile neighbor Hunsiker (David Hewlett). The apes may be digitally rendered in what is now standard practice, but thanks to the human actors helping to bring them to life, you can see a definite depth of emotion in their eyes and expressions. Serkis has certainly become an absolute master at this brand of performing.The film does go a little heavy on the effects, and may strike some people as being pretty manipulative. Still, there's no denying its potency, which does help to make up for any drawbacks, such as the over the top, utterly conventional action climax.Franco does a decent job in the lead, but Freida Pinto is given little to do as his love interest. Lithgow does an excellent job, as could be expected. Overall, the human cast does creditable work: Brian Cox, Tyler Labine, Jamie Harris, Ty Olsson, etc.What will be fun for veteran fans of this series will be the little nods to previous movies along the way, including THAT legendary line of dialogue from Charlton Heston.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Great effects, but more importantly - a great story!","""Rise of the Planet of the apes"" is the first series ""reboot"" since Batman begins that actually feels justified, and I was so hyped about its new take on the series that I highly doubted I would dislike the movie.Needless to say I think ""Rise"" is great. A Film that introduces a new generation to ""The Planet of the apes"" franchise, while giving those that liked the originals something new, at the same time entertaining both with truly amazing special effects.Other film-makers should take some notes from this too, as it's the films story that takes priority over the effects. Although the visuals deserve equally as much attention. Andy Serkis as Caesar (The ape whos story this movie follows) brings a character too life that could off otherwise been tedious. You are with this character all the way, and quickly forget that he is simply a bunch of computer pixels. Off course it helps that there a bunch off great actors in this film (James Franco, John Lithgow, Brian Cox) but at the end of the day its the computer generated Caesar who is the star.The Flick also doesn't make the mistake off trying too have the ""shocking"" ending that the original or most of its sequels had (Something that ultimately destroyed Tim Burtons take on the apes a decade ago) and instead has a suitable conclusion to the lead characters story, while subtly hinting at where this new ""apes"" series will lead. Its in a direction that those who remember the old movies should be happy with too, as its not exactly the same but in a direction that's familiar.The only flaw about the film is that those who've never heard of the original concept may be surprised by just how ""intelligent"" these apes can get. I did hear laughing and tutting by some of the younger members off the audience. These are probably the same people who complained about the films original title (Rise of the apes) being changed. I can't help but feel the title change was truly justified after seeing the movie.

Raise your fist if you feel threatened,"When i first read on ifc.com that this movie was being made and James Franco was starring, the disappointing Tim Burton remake came to my mind. A few months later, i saw the first movie poster, showing Caesar's fist up high, in a ""fight tha power"" kinda way. Everything seemed laughable and destined to fail. Well, nope. There was a pretty good script, the amazing Andy Serkis as Caesar and the main goal: respect. Respect for the apes, the pace, the audience, the previous movies and cinema itself. I didn't get these kinda feelings at a theater since Children of Men (2005). Not just the great story to tell, acting, FX and respectable score: they give you one of those priceless moments when EVERY SINGLE PERSON at the room stops eating pop corn, texting, making stupid remarks and they just shut up for 3 seconds, shocked over what just happened on the screen. The ""Rosa Parks Moment"" will become a classic. There, i said it... And if Andy Serkis is not -at least- nominated at the Oscars it would be really unfair. An enjoyable piece of art, that can make you believe in Hollywood again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

good film ..,"During experiments to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, a genetically-enhanced chimpanzee uses its greater intelligence to lead other apes to freedom (plot), first thing I didn't expect i will like this film because the first version was bad i mean Tim Burtin Version not the oldest one (1968), but here I really enjoyed, great film and fast paced without a moment to feel boring, the story maybe repeated but the Events was good, the film has a great director Rupert Wyatt, he showed a great talent.. the best part in the film is : Caesar and his actions and reactions to the world, finally I Recommended to watch this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Its strenght are the parallels,"its strenght lies in the parallelsI've seen Rise several times, and it wasn't until my latest view that I realized its true strenght, which are the parallels it sets with the original '68 film. I always considered, and still consider, Rise the weakest chapter, between this and Dawn. Now, however, I see it as a better film than I did before.On the surface, Rise can seem a quite average 'origin' movie, but despite its visual style isn't that interesting or distinctive, and the CGI flawed mostly in the first half of the film. What it does right, though, is to connect emotionally the viewer with the main character, Caesar. Andy Serkis demonstrated how well can Mo-Cap be used to portray a CG character while still using an actor. You can see in Caesar often Serkis, and he proves that the talent of an actor can emerge even when he portrays a Computer Generated Character.As for parallels with the original 1968 movie, there are plenty I noticed. The most evident one is the inversion of quotes between Caesar shouting 'No!' for the first time, and Tom Felton's character, whom quotes Heston's ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" right before. Caesar being imprisoned in a similar facility to that where Charlton Heston's character was in the first one, though inverted in roles, is also a recalling to the first film. When Caesar leads his rise, he imprisons two humans in cages, a foreshadowing of what will happen in the future. During the rampage through San Francisco, the police strongly reminds of the soldier Apes in the first film.There's a slight animalist facet in this film as well, even though we know that the sequels are not really animalist films but more sort of allegoric in an Orwellian 'Animal Farm' fashion.Again, I prefer Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to this film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes provides, though, a good enough introduction to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Apes Together Strong!,"I went into this movie thinking I wouldn't enjoy it. I had never been into the Planet of the Apes franchise and just wasn't interested. I only watched it because a friend made me. I came out of it obsessed and with a new favorite movie!The plot is enjoyable and well paced. Its very interesting to see Caesar grow up and really find himself through a series of unfortunate events. Instead of giving up and giving in, he... well, rises. And man, is it satisfying when he does! I haven't found myself rooting for an animal in a movie so strongly for a long time, and that's saying something, because I almost always root for the animals!The emotional highs and lows in this movie are surprisingly intense and I haven't yet met anybody who watches this movie without feeling something. Some of the tracks on the soundtrack alone give me chills. I never would have expected such an emotional ride from something in the Planet of the Apes franchise.The acting was incredible, especially for the apes, and especially for Caesar. When you can insert a hyper realistic animal into a live action movie and make the audience forget that Caesar isn't really there, you're doing something right. When you accomplish all of that and also manage to make the audience feel more for a character who expresses themselves entirely through body language and facial expressions than they feel for the more communicative characters, you've really outdone yourself.I wish I could experience watching this movie for the first time again. It takes a lot for a movie to actually frighten or startle me, but this movie definitely got my heart pounding in one certain scene. People who have seen it know exactly what I'm talking about. I won't spoil it for those who haven't.I really can't praise this movie enough. If you haven't seen it, go give it a try, even if you don't think you'll like it.

Summer Blockbuster though not without brains !!!,"Once the summer season starts, I always start dreading the onslaught of sloppy flicks,big big budgeted thoroughly lackluster stuff on offer. This year barring, the X- Men prequel, Thor and Captain America has been no different. Even the must trumpeted final installment of Harry Potter is nothing great. I was quite skeptical about this movie too. James Franco, post the Oscar awards poor show and his statements that he was not sure of this movie, did not help.But I was surprised, it is a well done movie, even though the ending does appear to be rushed. The plot is well written and the actors have performed a decent job. Even Tom ""Draco Malfroy"" Felton does a menacing part. Though the scene stealer here is Andy Serkis, he is so much involved that you end up sympathizing with the apes. I will not reveal anything more.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"When I was a kid, they'd often do ""Planet of the Apes"" week on TV, showing all five of the original movies. I know I watched them all at least once, probably twice, but except for a few of the iconic moments from the first movie, it's all lost in a memory fog (I skipped the Burton remake, and by all accounts, that was a smart move). That's neither here nor there, since this film doesn't seem to do anything to connect itself to the original series, with the exception of the ""damn dirty ape"" line (which is horribly shoehorned in, but whatever). I had expectations that the movie would be mostly apes tearing sh*t up, and even kind of hoped for that. But surprisingly, very little of it could be considered an action film. I would say the bulk of it is an interesting spin on the prison movie genre. These are the best parts of the picture (okay, the tearing sh*t up is pretty cool too), watching Caesar's intelligence and rebellion develop. The rest of it is rather meh. James Franco continues his streak of being an entirely uninteresting performer, and the whole bit with John Lithgow's Alzheimer's isn't pulled off very well. Basically, everything not directly involved with Caesar and the other apes is quite obvious, clichéd, predictable.The CG is oddly inconsistent. The animators seemed to have a tough time with ""young"" Caesar, and for the first half hour of the movie he looks like crap. But after that the animation gets pretty damn good, to the point where you forget you're watching CG. I also thought the score was a little overdone at times. In general, though, the film is better than expected yet not as good as I'd hoped for. I'm wavering between ""Fair"" and ""Good""... since nothing about it is horrendously bad or anything, I'll give it a leg up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Reboot done right,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of how the human world becomes the planet of the apes for the original movie ""The Planet of the Apes"".This movie shows Hollywood and the world how a reboot should be done. This movie is not an exact re-hash of the original, it is a total different story that takes place in the same world as the first one. I just love how they were able to create this story that compliments the original movie and is still its own movie.The CGI in the movie is amazing. The main character of ""Caesar"" looks very realistic and Andy's performance really sells it. The rest of the apes also look amazing.The performances in the movie are very good and every actor did their best.The whole idea and story-line of the movie is very entertaining and it explains very clearly how the apes became so smart.Still, I do believe that this movie has some narrative problems. The movie feels like two different movies actually, the first act and the middle of the second feels different from the other half of the second act and third act.Also the movie had some clear clichés. Like the assh*le who mistreats the animals and the ""bad businessman"". The movie also has some difficulty when the ape and James Franco talk, because James has to repeat everything the ape says through sign language so the audience can understand.In the end, it is a fun movie with a great third act and the perfect start for this Planet of the Apes trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best of this year by far.,"Have you ever been surprised by a movie? Ever saw a movie trailer and then thought over that, ""hmmm, this will be something good to watch"", or ""just another summer cash cow movie"". Well this is aimed towards both. I went to the cinema with normal expectations for this movie, to watch apes take over the world. But instead, I got presented by a story, which is well crafted around the characters and especially the apes. There were scenes that were spectacularly done and performed. James Franco did look out his normal best at times, but then again, hey, this ain't a movie around him, but this is a movie where the apes takes the center stage or at least AN ape named, Caesar. The movie opens with a very heart wrenching capture of the chimps and from there is straight on jumps on its wheels and never slows down in its momentum. It doesn't go fast at any point, everything in place was well put. I would be wrong If I say that ""after watching this movie"", but I would even put, ""while watching this movie"", I started to realize the surprise factor it packs. It's not A surprise that you should be waiting to look for, the movie as a whole is a surprise packed for you to watch. We all know that this movie is a reboot or a reboot. At least that's a perception you will get upon watching the trailer. But not, (I'm not giving out a spoiler up next), it's a connector bridging the gap between the incidents, where Charlton Hesston/Mark Wahlberg left for their space expedition, then got trapped in the whole space storm, and came to the Planet of the Apes. Yes this movie shows what happened then. There are even two big clues in the movie for you to grasp on to. Yes two. One of which is during the credits. So there you are, the story is right in its place where it should be. Over all the acting was good, based on the characters given, they performed well. The main focus should be on the chimp's expressions and acting delivery, because there are CGI chimps and not real ones, yeah some scenes might have some real chimps shown, but it's mainly a CGI enriched movie. Andy Serkis stands out, even in a motion capture version, he stands out. There is this one scene in the movie, which will indeed grab you. It deserves to be in the best movie moments. So all in all Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the best origin movies ever to hit. The ape intelligence shown and the story momentum are really good and it's all well placed. So do go to your local cinema and check this movie out, for it will not disappoint you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The slow but effective rise of the Apes!,"As an avid admirer of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, I deliberately avoided the new series (currently four titles and probably more to come) for years. But then I thought: what's the point? These could be very good movies as well. And they are! Or, at least, the first one is.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is the definite beginning of the saga. It certainly isn't a remake of the 1968 Charlton Heston classic (although listed as such on IMDb) and it's much more of a prequel than ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" (1973) ever was. The script comes up with a much more plausible and realistic explanation of why (perhaps), in 200-300 years, apes will be the dominant species on our planet instead of humans. And, for once, we didn't destroy ourselves in nuclear wars, but medical science made a terrible mistake. Oops!Will Rodman obsessively works on a medicine against Alzheimer's Disease, because he's losing his father to it. He reaches a breakthrough and tests it on his pet chimpanzee Caesar (whom he rescued from the lab) and on his father Charles (because his condition rapidly deteriorates). The results on both species are astounding, as Charles is miraculously cured, and Caesar develops a whole lot of incredible cognitive skills. Five years later, however, things still go horribly wrong (which is, I guess, the reason why conclusive tests for a new medicine take 10 years). Charles' Alzheimer returns and spreads faster, and exposure also leads to a slow but deadly and contagious virus. Chimpanzee Caesar becomes more aggressive and uncontrollable. His traumatizing imprisonment in a dreadful primate shelter with abusive guards, in combination with his superior cognitive skills, eventually lead to the titular uprise.As you can derive from the plot summary, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" has a slow and meticulously detailed build-up, and there isn't much action. Nevertheless, the plot is absorbing from start to finish, and the finale - taking place on the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco - is extremely rewarding! Although definitely a better film than Tim Burton's 2001 remake, it has to be said I prefer the special effects & make-up in that one. The motion capture techniques in ""Rise"" are state-of-the-art, for sure, but I swear by the genius of Rick Baker's craftsmanship.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A great restart to the franchise! Rise of The Planet of the Apes has all the ingredients that mix great fiction, action sequences greatly aided by current technology","Working from the script of Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, director Rupert Wyatt transforms the saga that began in 1968 in Planet of the Apes into something new and yours. The restart at the same time pays homage to the original films and seeks unprecedented paths for the franchise, never seeming desperate for sequels or sequences (although it leaves hooks that go with what we know from the series). Wyatt is especially successful in sequences where the drama works like a chain movie. Without dialogues, the director manages to present the complex dynamics of the animal shelter in a totally visual way, an art lost in today's verbose and over explicative cinema.The question about the origin and emergence of Caesar, had already been addressed before in the third film of the franchise in the cinema, The Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, where it was shown that a plague had exterminated cats and dogs and apes were the new animals of pet, treated like slaves, which caused the revolt of Caesar who had lost his parents early and had been raised by a circus owner. Here the owner of a circus is replaced by the scientist Will and it is not a plague that exterminates dogs and cats, but an experimental medicine administered to César's mother that passes on to him the genes that make him more evolved than normal.Undoubtedly the premise of this new film is more realistic, consistent and more credible and works in a more effective and impactful way, which makes everything more disturbing, in thinking that we can actually go through a situation like this in the near and worse future, which will happen what was seen in the original film, years after this. The good script of the duo Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver tries to situate us before this frightening possibility and already knowing the following films, the fear is even more latent because we know how it will end. The ideal would be to carry out a new trilogy or quadrilogy that would culminate in yet another remake of the original film, and this seems to be the path to be followed by the producers of the franchise from now on.The question of humanity is reinforced and mainly in an emblematic phrase when Caesar asks Will ""What is Caesar?"". It is from that moment that the story develops until culminating in the following events. Rupert Wyatt manages to give us several references to previous films, such as the reproduction of the phrase said in the original of 68 and repeated again by the character of Tom Felton: ""Get your dirty hands off me, your filthy ape"". Not to mention a quick news item on TV that showed astronauts (the same as in the 68 film) going for space exploration. In addition, Wyatt achieved good drama scenes, especially in which the apes were trapped and communicating with each other. Great scenes without a single word. It addresses Alzheimer's Disease making it the new path to be followed for the emergence of Caesar, in addition to showing new directions for the franchise. This, in addition to directing great action passages, especially in the final 40 minutes of the feature, with full emphasis on the scene of the Golden Gate Bridge and the escape through the roof of the place where they were caged.Wyatt managed to put the story that is already strong in itself, to be put ahead of the special effects. The director does not appeal and does not amend free sequences of unbridled action to attract the audience and uses it masterfully when he has to use them, throughout the final climax of the plot. One of the essential merits for the good progress of the work is that it is a science fiction film well engaged in research, discoveries and that culminates in several events and that generate monumental scenes of first quality action. The balance that equates action, drama and fiction seems to be at the ideal point, not opting for the most obvious that would be to put many scenes of revolution in the foreground.The most impressive in this feature are the visual effects. In Planet of the Apes: The Origin, a prelude to the well-known science fiction series, Peter Jackson's visual effects company Wrta Digital, performs one of the most impressive computer graphics feats ever seen on screens. For the first time in the franchise, effects and not clothes and makeup were used to represent the apes. Andy Serkis, known for playing another ape, Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" in 2005, and for also lending his movements and facial expressions to capture motion for Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise in the early 2000s, it was the most obvious choice to lend its interpretation to Caesar. And the ease and expressiveness passed by him is amazing. Serkis manages to compose a ape with characteristics and a human look and at the same time shows his ferocity, bringing his most animalistic side to the surface. When César looks at him in a more humane way and even utters a few words, they are moments that go up the spine, very well placed, especially in the final scene of the film and in the attack on his ""keeper"" in the shelter during the escape from the place.But the merits of the effects do not stop at Caesar. All the other apes, orangutans, gorillas, apes, are created in an impeccable way passing the characteristics of each breed, in addition to perceiving the texture of the skin, the fluttering of the hair and the facial expressions so well done, that it becomes impossible to perceive whether it's computing or real animals. It is truly a phenomenal job. And the insertion of these effects in real scenarios was even better. A single caveat is that often the movement when walking and getting around was more upright and less curved than it should be for apes, especially for Caesar.In the cast, besides Serkis, James Franco, Freida Pinto, Brian Cox, Tom Felton and David Oyelowo are only correct when required. John Lithgow stands out well and manages to pass the affliction and suffering of his character who suffers from the disease that motivates the entire course of events. His relationship and integration with Serkis in his characters' scenes is touching. The actor has the best scenes of the film outside the ape nucleus. It is his character's disease, Alzheimer's, after all, that motivates his son to carry out genetic experiments on apes. Cesar is the result of one of those tests. It is also the father, a scholar, who baptizes the little chimpanzee as the Roman dictator.Andrew Lesnie's photograph (from The Lord of the Rings trilogy) is brilliant, knowing how to pass the difference between internal locations, mixing laboratory technology well, with the rustic place where apes suffer at the hands of villains played by Brian Cox and Tom Felton who end up motivating the rebellion. Not to mention the outdoors, with the quiet streets where César lives with Will and Charles, even the spectacular scenes in the dome of the ape escape site and the scenes in the forest park and in the streets and bridges of San Francisco. Patrick Doyle (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Thor) is once again thrilling and providing us with sensations of pure adrenaline, drama and suspense throughout the scenes in yet another excellent work.It is also noted that the writers built the characters with different moral categories and ethical exposure, there being two ways of observing how the direction architected these differences. First, with the help of editing in a light dialectical approach, equating the personality of an ape with that of a human; second, opposing the two worlds as being builders of their own feelings and emotions. From the beginning to the end of the film, we are sympathetic to the apes. The break happens after the urban riot - in fact, a very well-directed sequence, with the action pulsing in the right measure all the time, where, once again, the intelligent use of digital technology stands out - when apes become victims oppressed and belittled for villains. However, in a commendable dramatic turn, the final part of the film brings apes back to the previous level.Rupert Wyatt also presents the audience with numerous references to the other films in the saga appear here, from the Statue of Liberty that César assembles in one of the scenes, to the classic phrase ""Take your hands off me, you damned dirty ape"", dictated by the character of Tom Felton, in good characterization in the film. Without neglecting the original roots of the first episodes, Rupert Wyatt presents us with a film that is great entertainment and a good franchise restart. Bureaucratic power relations are not included in the film. His criticism highlights the ambitious organization of human beings, their zero importance with nature, cruelty and greed. Unlike the 1968 film, hunting is of apes and not of humans, and painful experiences also happen with these captured animals. Gradually, the film builds a whole network of justifications for the animal revolt. Contamination, which in later films will cause the extermination of almost 100% of humans, is an accident of chain results, it has nothing to do with apes. The atmosphere of imminent revolt prevails from the middle of the work, and in its final stretch, we have a legitimate visual indication in the room of Robert Franklin, the person responsible for the apes in the laboratory: a large poster of The Battleship Potemkin.Overall, it's a great restart to the series about apes in theaters and new chapters of the story are already being prepared. Rise of The Planet of the Apes has all the ingredients that mix great fiction, action sequences greatly aided by current technology, an exquisite look, combined with Serkis' work, result in a production that is both fun and endowed with levels of meaning.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wow - that was a great entertainment experience!,"Okay, so I'm normally not impressed by the quality of US movies, but this one really took me by surprise. I really, really enjoyed it! Even more so than the much acclaimed Avatar. The CGI is stunning, but I also got into the story. The emotional factor could have been bumped up a bit further - hence it didn't quite ace it for me, but then again not many movies do nowadays. Not everyone will agree with me on this, but I do think that this movie creates an acceptable introduction to ""Planet of the Apes"" of which the latest installment was a disaster and looked extremely fake. This prequel has a realness and believability over it.Furthermore the movie also has a message, being don't mess around with genetics and nature, although the intention to cure Alzheimer was a sincere one. Having worked for WWF (World Wildlife Fund for Nature) for a number of years this movie also made me realize how far we got detached from our nearest ""relatives"": the primates.

Spectacular origin story,"The new Planet of the Apes movie is a creation all on its own unencumbered by the original Planet of the Apes from the '60s. In this movie, the intelligent apes are not product of natural evolution, but accidental creation of science. Although it's unlikely that few hundred organized apes can successfully launch a revolution, this movie was intended to be the first of series of movies to come. The story is extraordinarily violent, and that aspect turns me off, but as a story it's done in the most believable format as possible for the origin of the Planet of the Apes.Asides from those two points, the movie is above average science fiction movie. Still it's hard to think that the whole movie cost nearly 100 million dollars. The cost of movie making seems to be going up these days.It's hard to rate this movie because the star is a CGI ape Caesar. The character has believability, but CGI is CGI, and I couldn't get emotionally involved with its personality. The other casts were so so, and had to take second fiddle to the ape.The movie is no masterpiece, but neither was the 1968 classic.

Best film of the summer,"This movie was totally amazing. I had low expectations, based on the premise, but was blown away by both the intelligence and the visuals of the film.

If he doesn't get a nomination (or hopefully win) for best supporting actor, there's something wrong with the Academy voters. If I have one criticism of the film (and it's really not that big, but I would have given the film a 9 or 10) it's that the love story with Freida Pinto was a bit underdeveloped and could have used a little more attention. They chose to make a time jump and suddenly they were a couple, I would've liked a little more insight into how they became a couple.

Rise from the Planet of The Humans,"That is what it should have been called, as the apes rise in our world, not the other way around.

They must have just wanted to garner attention, the artistry for the promotional material is even in the same style as the Planet of the apes films! So different story/film but still jumping on the bandwagon.But on the actual film, the storyline is great, but the quality of the film is not so great and the acting a bit off, the CGI effects are not so good, not rubbish but could have been better, Caesar and the other apes all in CGI do not look real or move like real apes.

Apes v. Androids,"Can anything other than human emulates human is a question that has been raised repeatedly. Kafka addressed the boundaries between men and apes in ""a report to an academy"", while Dick tackled similar issue between men and androids in ""do androids dream of electric sheeps"". Science-wise, inventing human-like machine remains a tireless pursue, and the unfortunate fate of Nim Chimpsky does not seem adequate to deter human curiosity of ascertaining equals. The Rise of the Planet of the Apes, being clichéd as it is, is nonetheless an honest attempt that addresses this centuries-long question. After all, when conscious entities other than human become more intelligent or human (or humane?) than us (either artificially or naturally), the perceived uniqueness of the human species is implicitly eradicated along with the existence of our so-call god. In the face of cross-species homogeneity, will religious doctrines crample? Or more precisely, when we are as close to god as we might arrogantly believe, will morality still be guided through the divine doctrines? The Apes manages to touch upon these philosophical, theological, scientific and moral questions (however old they are), but more importantly, it once again reminds us the importance of self-identity and the necessity of self-actualization. In that sense, the Apes is a triumph both in style and in substance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

And we should not forget amazing action scenes and effects.To finish with, I can say that it is not the most conceptual or deepest movie, but it is one of the best what Hollywood have made in last 15 years - there is deep and touching emotions, as well as action, brilliant acting(Andy Serkis is absolutely stunning with his voice!) and etc.Movies abouts animals and their innocent, good feelings always drives people crazy - as well as this one.

"When things are done well, results inevitably come.","This is a great example of how to enhance a well-known franchise and take it to unsuspected limits.The history and great origin of the first ape and legend as Caesar was for this universe.A beginning that may seem minimalist but as the plot progresses it reaches us directly to the heart because of everything that Cesar has to experience.From the death of his mother to protect him, how James Franco's character rescues him and how he is raised with love until the inevitable comes. And with this the entire cascade of events that lead to the spread of the virus that eliminates 90% of the world's population and gives us the ideal context for the development of this world.A separate paragraph is the visual by Andy Serkis, what a great motion capture and how well it is done that it moves us.With what came later it is clear that when you want to do things well, they are done.More franchises should or should copy the example of how a well-written script can lead us to these works of art.It may be better? Without a doubt, but as a prologue to the following films it is not bad to start with such solidity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rating: B+,"This is a great start to another (and hopefully the last) reboot of a well-known franchise, Planet of the Apes. It's easy to say what definitely stands out: the visual effects. All of the CGI apes are incredibly realistic, especially Caesar (Andy Serkis) who is a terrific masterpiece, not only visually, but as a character as well. He's surprisingly the protagonist of the movie, a decision that I congratulate the director and production team for, because it transformed it into a much more captivating and interesting film.Andy Serkis is the God of motion capture, it's amazing the amount of emotion he's able to transmit as a guy in a spandex suit full of white dots on his face. Caesar is one of the most fantastic and intriguing characters I've ever watched and the fact that there's almost no dialogue throughout the film just proves that you can achieve great things with pure emotion (and some sign language ... ).James Franco is good portraying an also well-developed character, even if he wasn't as great as he could be. The script is very smart and emotional (mainly due to the extremely well-directed no-dialogue scenes) and the action is super awesome, particularly because of its emotional side. The fact that we actually care about the apes (maybe even more than the humans) elevates the action-heavy third act and brings the movie home (no pun intended), with a very strong ending.In spite of all this, it's still not a perfect film. Even if the runtime isn't properly long, the film's pacing (principally the second act) is really slow, which drags the movie into almost a boring state. As I said above, the story is captivating, but only when we're with Caesar and his respective families ... All of the human drama inside the Gen-Sys Laboratories isn't really interesting, but we still get too much of it.Finally, the side characters. Besides Caesar, Will and his father (brilliantly portrayed by John Lithgow), no one else got the chance to shine on the big screen. Most of them are plot devices in order to get the story going and actually have a film: the ""bad guys"" are just bad because ... Well, they're assholes, I guess they were born that way ... I would have preferred that they spent a little more time with those characters instead of the company's dramas.All in all, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an excellent start to this reboot that proves we don't need dialogue to transmit a great amount of emotion. The CGI is flawless, Caesar being the huge proof of what a masterpiece looks like, visually and character-wise. A slow pace and some under-developed side characters bring the movie down a bit, but the captivating and emotional story, plus a very well-directed action-heavy third act, elevate the film into one of the best in the whole franchise.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well-thought out,"One would not ordinarily have ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""plausible"" in the same sentence, but this is as close to plausible as I could have imagined. So often a movie in this genre requires a considerable willingness to suspend disbelief, but this movie doesn't leave you scratching your head.It hits wonderful notes of emotional connection with the lead characters of all species. Nothing says that a film is working more than the gut feeling you get where you have intense hopes and fears for the outcome. It's well-acted; the leads deliver balanced performances that aren't overplayed (except for one malevolent character that would have been improved had there been even a hint of subtlety in the portrayal).As many reviews have indicated, the nods to the original movie are all over the place - smartly inserted so that they trigger your memories without making them seem contrived. They aren't played for humor, so even if you never saw the originals you won't be left in the dark. Rather, these references seem to have been inserted as signs of respect, letting the audience know that the filmmakers realize they are messing with something classic - and their effort is a worthy reboot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Underwhelming and Predictable,"Due to the overwhelming amount of good reviews from critics and people alike I figured it was worth checking out. Sad to say, I was not impressed. I will give the film credit for being by far the best of any of the planet of the apes films. And secondly, yes the CGI is excellent. Outside of that the film takes a rather predictable direction. Some interesting turns on occasion but otherwise rather predictable. Overall, the acting is good, but the writing and story went exactly where I thought it would. Ultimately this doesn't take the direction the books did. But oh well. This a franchise that should just be left alone instead of someone trying to reboot it every 5-10 years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
First impression is not the last impression,"As a person unknown to the franchise this movie i thought would be an action packed movie as suggested by the trailers but after entering into the cinema hall.Almost half an hour into the movie it made me realize that movie very nicely captured the emotional connection between the Ape(Andy Serkis) & James Franco . The movie didn't have problem establishing the characters.The movie is about Will(James) trying to cure Alzheimer's disease which is tested on apes .But due to some reason's the medicine is to be dropped. The actor's in the James Franco,Andy Serkis (in his animated avatar) make the movie an enjoying experience.The story is interesting & the way that the director handles it is quite awesome .I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Some things aren't meant to be changed,"As a long time admirer of the apes movies since 1968 until now, I first thought that this was going to be just another ape movie. But I was wrong, and glad to be so. This could be easily considered the best movie of this summer, I say so because you find the drama, suspense and the CGI effects perfectly knit together to make this an instant classic. For me, the fact that the premise of this flick; an experiment to find Alzheimer's disease that by the way could boost the apes' brain turning them more human simply throws me away. Hey folks, this could happen in a distant future at least in theory. What makes the Rise of the Apes so special and distinct is that is carried out in a plot that makes sense and very thought planned. The only minus you see is that you will know the end but at the same time gives you a hint of future sequels. In both the 1968 and 2001 versions, The Planets of the Apes began with these already on control of the world, in the Rise, we can see how it all began where one thing leads to other until the movie reaches present day. And of course it was the main ape character, Cesar that rob everybody's heart and attention, James Franco gives a superb performance not to mention the job of Hollywood legend; John Lithgow. An instant classic hands down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An OK return to the Apes,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a reboot film that carries with it years of past cinema glory and classic status, plus some big names. Although I didn't hate this one of the franchise, I didn't think it was too great. I found it was just TOO much like the follow up to the second film and never really got into any stride or did things differently, in the end it ends up tiredly predictable. It by far though isn't all bad and I felt it was strongly OK, and here bellows is why I thought so.The story is a fairly dull one, as said it was needed to begin the franchise and in a sense show you how it all began but it could have been done better than it was. I enjoyed some of the scenes and toward the end the thrills of the movie really pick up and you can enjoy yourself. I also liked the format it is done in, and the plot is well thought out to say this isn't people of actual science writing this all down.The main performance and most memorable from this is Andy Serkis as Caesar the ape, the motion capture technology used in the film for all the apes is magnificent and Serkis in his performance is even better. James Franco does OK in the film, he doesn't ever get really into it but handles the role well enough. Freida Pinto is pretty much the same story and she also handles well but never takes the film as her own. I liked the supporting cast including the apes and the entire thing is acted well by pretty much everyone.Rupert Wyatt directs the film fairly well and really does make his mark in cinema with this. His guiding hand is one that is of extra importance seeing as he has to say where the apes run and jump etc and all the other things a director does on top. Script isn't the tightest I have ever seen but written OK and some words we so often see in epic movie scenes and chosen well. I wasn't actually too keen on the effects used, not the best and could have been possibly used less but they are good for a first in a series.The main criticism comes from basically the point of ""it could have been much better"", nothing is bad here but the story Is just to boring at times and a real kick in the middle of the film would have greatly improved the viewers enjoyment watching this. Things like the script and acting, also could have been better but I will leave it alone and not pick to much at it, after all it turns out OK.If you enjoyed the original Planet of the Apes series and knew about it at least then this could be even more enjoyable, It is showing the birth of then what happens in the originals so they may be more interested if they have viewed it before. If you want a lot of action and thrilling scenes then this lacks it and is one big reason it isn't so much as good, I felt some more fighting could have raised heart beats and more daring scenes also could have had the same effect.Overall it is Strongly an OK movie and never is at danger of falling a long way down, but neither rising to the movie greats. My review may seemed very negative of the film but I generally recommend watching it as it is interesting, and also if not just for seeing it to then see it's sequel afterwards, it is very important you watch this one if you are planning to then see the next, big plot points and establishing characters here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Worth the viewing,"Speaking as someone who hasn't seen the original films, I really enjoyed this one. Sure, it was an action movie, but it built up to the final twenty minutes in a way that was believable and satisfying. At its heart, it's a story about one person (and yes, I am referring to Caesar as a person; not a human, but a person) and his rise to power.I am of the belief that Caesar is one of the best film characters introduced this year. While he is intelligent, he's not a rocket scientist. He's not solving Fermat's Theorem between composing sonatas and analyzing Chekov. He's simply smarter than the average chimp. He grows up essentially treated like a human child and so feels betrayed by Will when he puts Caesar in the shelter (""Et tu, Brute?""). Will, however, doesn't do this out of spite or apathy or even because he knows it's ""the right thing to do."" He does it because the law literally tells him to.When Caesar sees how the other apes in the shelter are treated, and likely how other apes in general are treated, he realizes that he need to stay there and help his brethren. His motivations are understandable and we sympathize with this character. This is due in no small part to Andy Serkis' astounding performance. With not a single word spoken, he conveys paragraphs with just his eyes and mouth. I honestly think that he should be considered for a leading actor Oscar.I enjoyed this trip to the theater immensely and recommend the picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Far from Ape-tastic,"It was a beautiful letdown. I'm not even sure where to start here; the CGI was far from spectacular. Yeh, the apes looked fantastically realistic in the previews, and at points in the movie, but the animatics lacked. It was very obvious to pick out odd movements, and almost a resistance to gravity at times. So why is there so much fuss about the cartoon apes? I'm not sure...but on a positive note, the man behind Ceasar, Andy Serkis deserves an honorable mention for his contributions as well as many other cast members. The film was acted terrifically which added a single element of realism to cope for digital dishonor. I do wish the characters were more developed, some seemed very shallow even for a somewhat faced-paced movie. Anyway, before this turns into a ramble, I'm going to conclude it to this, don't go in expecting to be blown away.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Saint Simian,"After Tim Burton's crummy remake of the sci-fi classic, anything would be an improvement. And ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is just that. This movie is unrelated to Burton's movie. Rather, it's a prequel to the original version, focusing on how the simian population grew intelligent. In this case, the son of a chimpanzee injected with a drug grows so intelligent that he becomes the leader of the apes. To be certain, the audience roots for the apes every step of the way, seeing how the humans treat them.Obviously, this isn't any masterpiece. Some of the action is overdone, and a couple of scenes are obviously CGI. Still, motion capture star Andy Serkis -- best known as Gollum and King Kong, now playing Capt. Haddock -- is really neat as lead ape Caesar. Also starring are James Franco, Freida Pinto (of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame), John Lithgow, Brian Cox and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies). I recommend the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A rather good prequel...,"I had what you wanted for a prequel, but......something was missing from it to make it complete. I sit here now, having just seen the movie, and I feel where is the next chapter in the story? What happens after the apes break free and up until what happened in the first original movie? Will we get to see that too?Now, the movie in itself is quite good. It is very well told and it is straight to the point. And you will end up having sympathy for Cesar, and with that, the movie-makers really managed to nail it right on the head. Because the story will pick you up and carry you along for one amazing ride.The effects in the movie were quite good and the apes were very believable, which helped the movie quite along the way. And the storyline worked out quite well, even as it told you a couple of sub-story lines as well along the way.As an overall view, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a rather good prequel. I, however, just personally think the movie ended at a bad time. But of course, it ended up so you will be wanting more. I, for one, would love to see the story told from what happens as this movie ends and the original first movie begins. That would, in my opinion, be the best part of this saga.""Rise of the Planets of the Apes"" is a must see if you enjoyed any of the previous movies. Thorough entertainment from start till end. And the story has a good deal of drama and action in it. And as a little bonus, the movie does raise some issues for debate about testing on apes as some do around the world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
How can we sink so low nearly 50 years later ?,"When I saw the trailer, I could already see the whole movie in my head and I knew it would be awful.I could also see that the CGI were not up to the task.Then I came here to see the ratings and lots of people seems to have liked it so I thought maybe I was wrong and its not so bad.Sadly it was worst on many points.Actors are just filling the spot, I mean they could have used any members of the crew like cameraman or sound technician and it wouldn't have made any differences.The story is lame and predictable with no originality, imagination or dept.Its almost like if it came out of a script writing software where you put some key words and it generate a story.If you're a fan of the old ones don't watch this you'll only end up angry.The CGI would be awesome in a video game but in the movie you never feel like you're looking at real apes.Even the movements like fighting or jumping or climbing and even walking don't look natural.I mean I would have thought that if they couldn't make them look real they would at least give them realistic movements ... But no not even and sometimes its just plain stupid like multiple apes jumping out of 3rd floor windows (lol) and all at the same time all getting on the ground at the same time no cuts or anything.Yeah facial expressions are good but still on a face that doesn't look real.The best analogy I can find to describe looking for something like a modern version of the old movies and watching this would be like if you want a 2 inches thick old style pizza with the best quality ingredients cooked in an epic antic oven but instead you end up with an economic brand of a modern industrialized frozen atrocity half reheated in the microwave and still cold in the middle.More and more movies and t.v. shows are as horrible as this these days and not only that people write, produce and sell them but lots of people likes it that way.Its like if a huge number of our populations are becoming empty zombies and these movies/shows are meant to feed them, it really scares me ...",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Origin of Species!,"I haven't reviewed a film for quite a while now, and the main reason is that for the past year or so, films that get ratings of 7 or 8 on this site have proved to be rather disappointing.So again I saw a rating of 8 and thought I might be disappointed.HOW WRONG I WAS! This film has an almost perfect mix of script, acting and effects to keep you thrilled and tense throughout the story. Not only that but it provides a perfect explanation for how the original story began. There are no loose ends and you really get a feeling of ""Wow!! THAT'S how it happened!"" (I have just dug out the original with Charlton Heston to watch again!)It also provides you with a very deep understanding of the enmity between the apes and man - in fact, it drives home vividly the desperation of caged animals.Seeing the protagonist Caesar - the utterly brilliant Andy Serkis - grow from a baby chimp to the leader of the Apes is in itself worth the ticket.And for those expecting blockbuster action, you won't be disappointed either! The bridge scene and the prior buildup to it must be one of the best choreographed fights I have ever seen on screen - literally mind-blowing...I could not find a single fault with this film, and came out of the cinema gushing, excited, and elated.

Human vs Human evolution,"Good interpretation of the actors: 9;Good special effects: 9;Good story: 9;Best human character: Cesar;Action: not prevail as importance (good).This movie shows that apes in their evolution became more human than human beings have regressed. Important is the phase between oppression and rebellion: the awareness acquired through intelligence of their state of slaves. It's an excellent movie which contains a meaning very deep for all people of earth: when people wake up from darkness imposed by unscrupulous and greedy individuals, they will emanate the LIGHT OF REVOLUTION.The only negative note I feel to observe is the easier way apes destroy scientific centre's windows... it would be impossible to break down a bulletproof door or window ( I prefer realism to exaggeration).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Apes are the cure with a vengeance.,"Making a new ""Planet of the Apes""-film is not a bad idea, as the fact goes the only good one is still the 1968 original. Now in 2011 the data technology has raised the bars for special effects, and so the apes look really good in this, the seventh installment in the franchise. There are numerous good scenes, especially the ones involving James Franco and John Lithgow, and off course some of the nifty treatment given to the apes when they're captaining the film. At certain times there seems to be a animal rights movement behind the film, but it does neither add or subtract anything from what is essentially a popcorn flick. The climax on The Golden Gate may not be all that spectacular, but it's good. Sadly I was disappointed throughout the film to see Freida Pinto's character so uninvolved and pointless, and the same goes with Brian Cox' character. But at the end of the day, it scores its highest points on being quite emotional as Franco's relationship with Ceasar (The Ape) evolves in different directions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A reboot done right,"When I saw the trailer to this movie, I felt very under whelmed. Casting James Franco as the lead is always a bad call for me because I can't take him seriously ever since Pineapple Express because he really is like that a bit. I know he can act very well as proved by 127 Hours but I seem to always never take it into account. Also I tend to not like CGI animals because you can always tell they're fake although, the effects were really good.Now the movie has tons of references of the past Planet of the Apes films, some subtle, some not so much. Fans of the series will definitely be on the lookout for hidden clues and references to future films of this reboot.James Franco does a great job of portraying a guy whose doing everything he can to cure his father (played by the magnificent John Lithgow) of Alzheimer's. Lithgow gives a heart wrenching performance and you really feel for Franco having to deal with such a tough situation. Of course they both take a backseat to the incredible Andy Serkis (who most notably played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings franchise.) who plays the role of Caesar. With the great technology we have in this day, he is able to make CGI characters come to life!This movie does a summer blockbuster right. Instead of focusing on explosions and action, it makes it focus the story and the characters first. I mean besides Caesar, there are other apes who also get to show their uniqueness as well. There's a nice shot of Caesar with his 3 main accomplices on the hood of a police car which is amazing! Some people dislike the final act of the film but I find it to be a big payoff and what the majority of the average movie goers went to go see the movie for. The apes break free and cause havoc among the streets of San Francisco. Sure it's a little far fetched how smart they become so fast when it took Caesar years to develop but its a movie about apes taking over so suspension of disbelief is needed.Overall it's an amazing movie and all other reboots should aspire to be this good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Monkey See Monkey Do,"This prequel to the 1968 cult classic about apes and the humans who don't love them takes forever to get going, but once it does, it proves to be a pretty entertaining action film.James Franco is the scientist whose tinkering with genetics and all that jazz is responsible for creating a race of super-intelligent apes and a virus that at the same time begins to kill off the human race. Some not very impressive special effects early in the film give way to some quite impressive ones later, as the apes ban together and declare war on San Francisco, leading a no-holds-barred charge across the Golden Gate Bridge for the sanctuary of Muir Woods. In between, John Lithgow is given the thankless task of portraying an Alzheimer's patient and Frieda Pinto (of ""Slumdog Millionaire"") shows up to prove that she has absolutely no chemistry with James Franco. The villain of the piece is, typically, corporate greed, as personified in this film as the head of Franco's lab and who manages to work in a reference to money into nearly every line of dialogue he's given.People who are expecting camp on par with the 1968 film, or any lines to equal some of the doozies delivered by Charlton Heston in that film, will be disappointed, as this film approaches its material with utmost (and misguided) seriousness.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Andy Serkis should always be considered for all the ape-flicks in the long run !!,"Wow !!!!! Watch this flick and you wouldn't be able to get it out of your head. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen. Everything scores here – Story, direction, plot, music, cinematography, screenplay, action, visual effects and to top that all, brilliant acting by Andy Serkis.The story is really touching and firstly you wouldn't be able to decide whose side you are on. The poor creature's (Caesar's played by Andy Serkis) who lost everything on the very day he was born, who had a tragic curve in his life, or the ugly side of mankind manifested by the likes of Tom Felton (Yes our very own Harry Potter's franchise kid Draco Malfoy), Brian Cox and the entire mankind which is eyed by the apes as their enemies.Andy Serkis, my my, he just doesn't stop. He has always entertained us and haven't we felt that extreme sympathy for an ape before in our hearts when he had stepped in the shoes of the legendary Kong in Peter Jackson's flick. I still remember his superb performance in Einstein and Eddington and of course as Gollum in the Lord of the rings. This is altogether a sudden whim of emotions revisiting us from the likes of King Kong, here in the form of Caesar, the intelligent ape. I must say you'd realize the sympathy in you while watching the movie and you'd wish the poor creature to come triumphant in his venture eventually as 'Pathos' is definitely going to overshadow your ugly side as you'd reach the climax.The story begins with a tragic scene where a mother chimpanzee is captured from a jungle along with other apes to be experimented upon. I felt goosebumps in the beginning itself and I was excited that the flicks gonna be a joyride after all. The flick didn't disappoint me a bit from that point onwards and I wasn't surprised. I was jumping on my seat with awe at Caesar's (Andy Serkis) understanding and intelligence. Caesar (the ape with brains) is taken as a pet by James Franco who has a father of his own suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Caesar happened to be the offspring of the mother ape that had died after she was experimented with a serum that enhanced intelligence which brought in the changes in him as well. James keeps few of the serum for his father and experiments them on his dad as he has a strong belief that the serum works just fine and that it was going to revive his father. As his father recuperates, Caesar begins to grow and becomes a liability. After an incident Caesar is held captive in a cell where he weeps and craves to return to his home. It was really touching to watch him draw the window of his home on the blank wall with high hopes which is shattered by the ""involuntarily-done cruelty"" unknowingly from James' par. James is meanwhile being duped by Brian Cox and Tom Felton that Caesar was being well taken care of. All of the wrong doings and incivilities on the part of mankind lead Caesar to rebel against them all.There was no need to cast Freida Pinto in the 'Rise' as she was,literally speaking, not there in the movie. Franco was 'alright' in the acting department however he has been feeling 'sleepy' lately (and by that yes I direct my fingers towards the academy) so that's the least that we can expect from him.The flick has certain instants that define how the movie happens to be a prequel when the mention of 'Icarus' being lost in a newspaper is manifested. That certainly brought a grin to my countenance as I happily connected the dots.The movie is a must watch. I'd give it an 8 and hope it continues to score more with its awesome music, story, plot and characters. Go watch this one even if you aren't an ape fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A surprisingly great movie!,"1 - Trailer : I wanted to see this movie based on all the good critics it got rather than the trailer. The trailer isn't bad but I feel it makes this movie look way too dramatic and profound in a way that turns cliché and unnecessary. It doesn't make quite justice to the movie as it turned out way better than I expected.2 - Characters & Cast : Though James Franco wasn't as great as in 127 Hours, it's still James Franco and he's a great actor. His character is well put but the real star in this movie is Caesar (Andy Serkis) the ape! Unlike most movie with an animal as the main character, this chimp really acts. You can feel his emotions and see the intelligence in his eyes. You fall in love with the baby ape and later get frighten at the angry grownup Caesar. This Motion-Capture technology is really adding to the CGI by turning the digitally made character in a real actor. Oh and I'm in love with Freida Pinto. Her role isn't major in the movie but as being a cute and tender girlfriend, you can't get better.3 - Plot & Story : I've seen the original movies and though I can barely remember them, I'm sure the fans won't be disappointed. Honestly, with so many sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes in 2011, this is for sure on the top 3. This is an origin story and a very good start for a franchise. I found the plot well developed with a good pace that kept me intrigued the entire movie.4 - Theme & Genre : I think the theme is the same as the originals on how humans are put down in the animal kingdom after thousands of years of ruling with cruelty. The genre is also well brought with good a dose of drama (nothing too cheesy), sci-fi that is realistic and believable and the action that really makes this movie enjoyable to it's potential and also realistic and well-thought of. Not just a bunch of random apesplosions (get it? APE-splosions haha OK sorry about that).5 - Overall Appreciation : This movie may not be a piece of art but it's still a must see in my opinion. I was not a fan of the original franchise and the 2001 remake was OK but now I'm really excited for the upcoming movies. I enjoyed this movie and though CGI usually irritates me, it was astonishingly great. At some point I couldn't tell if it was CGI or a shot of a real ape! 9/10 for the action, CGI, solid story and a well balanced movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Nooo!!!""","I've been a fan of Planet of the Apes since I saw the original with Charlton Heston as a child. Since then, I saw to it that I see each and every last one of the films, and I've done so. Though they got zanier and zanier as time went on, I still found the science-fiction enjoyable regardless. I mean they had some interesting, though I'm not denying cheesy, plots to watch. Then came the 2001 Tim Burton re-make, which I'll admit was an enjoyable film all in all. The problem was it dared to actually call itself a re-make, even though it was a mere action-thrill ride sort of film. That's not bad on its own, but compared to the original one can't help but complain. Why, well mainly because the original had so much going on in-between the lines, it was a very thought provoking film which is why so many regard as it as a masterpiece.This film thankfully does not aim to be a re-make, at least not directly. If you're a fan such as I then you'll know its premise is very similar to the 1972 film ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", though there NOT linked directly. This is need I remind you a reboot. Director Rupert Wyatt creates a nicely paced plot, not as subtle as the original but not a mindless-action oriented as Burton's film, a nice middle ground. Although it doesn't exactly dwell on the inner demons of humanity, the film does deliver emotionally and that's probably its strongest point. Like the 2001 film, the effects are dazzling, but are put to much better use. Andy Serkis, not surprisingly, plays the role of Creaser and quite well. The animators made sure to pay attention to the facial detail, sealing the deal with a nice range of emotions. The cast is also well done, with the likes of James Franco, John Lithgow, Fireda Pinto and (YES!) Brian Cox. The tension is carried out perfectly and the homages are a great touch. Like the early 90s Batman films compared to the new Nolan films, today's audience require a decent level of realism, and the film handles this quite awesomely. The concept of super intelligent apes rioting in our streets never has been so well depicted.Definitely check this one out, total A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"Rewatching Rise of the Planet of the Apes more than a decade later I am still amazed at how great of a film it is. The film has everything that you could want from such a film. The origin story, to Caesar's development and later the conflicts and his rise in stature within the group, it is fascinating to see his character development. The biggest weakness of the film is all the scenes associated with the lab as everything seems rushed and not carefully thought through. The visual and overall look and feel of the film does not seem outdated whatsoever, so would even argue it is better than many contemporary films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not inspired, but full of effort","Wyatt, Jaffa, and Silver validated their license to work here, with a pretty decent effort in the tale of how apes became the dominant species, or will become the dominant species, on Earth.However, while written and directed with efficiency, it doesn't have a lot of inspiration. It looks like a mechanical effort all the way.Still, the efforts of all involved are likable and well done. It's good to see Gollum as the main ape here, giving Andy a chance to give a different type of performance, which must please him no end. He may be the Boris Karloff or Lon Chaney Jr. of the present.The iconic lines of the original movie seemed forced into play here, and I'll nit pick at that as part of the lack of inspiration here.

The Ape Revolution has begun,"Apparently it's been decided that a new generation needs a remake of the great ape series from the Sixties/Seventies and we are in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes. This is where the Ape called Caesar leads the other apes in a revolt against humans. Eventually the apes will decide that they're better equipped to run planet Earth and who's to say they're not.Scientist James Franco in an experiment to cure Alzheimer's Disease has perfected a genetically enhanced ape which is named Caesar. Back in the first series of Ape films, Caesar and his father were played by the erudite Roddy McDowall in heavy simian makeup. The serum that Franco has concocted seems to be working on his father John Lithgow and Caesar is happy with Franco, Lithgow and girlfriend of Franco, Frieda Pinto.But an incident where Caesar is protecting Lithgow after an altercation with a neighbor leads to the ape being taken. That sets off a series of events and when the film is over the Ape Revolution has begun.The cast is nice, but the star is the computer graphic generated special effects. No longer a few hundred extras in ape suits are needed, with just a few extras the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is nicely staged.And for those who remember the original series, the seeds for the next ape production are showed right here at the end of this film.No Monkey business about this film, I think even the ape fans of a preceding generation will like this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
These Apes are well worth rising to go and see on the big screen.,"After the initial success of the original Planet of the Apes back in 1968 with Charlton Heston (which I saw only a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed) they did three sequels preceding it which weren't bad through into the early 70s. Then in 2001 tragically Tim Burton tried a remake/reboot with Mark Walghberg at the helm. For me as it was seen generally by the public it was absolutely awful. Finally after another decade director Rupert Wyatt has made a second attempt at a reboot/remake and I am pleased to say he has carried it off with great aplomb.This version first sees good-intentioned scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) doing experiments on genetically enhanced Apes to try and find a cure for Alzheimer's which his father Charles (John Lithgow) has. He ends up taking home a baby ape that he calls Caeser (Andy Serkis) when it's mother dies after being killed by security guards who thought she was going on the rampage while really she was protecting Caeser. Whilst taking care of Caeser Will discovers a drug within the Apes that will help cure his father as he also teaches Caeser how to socialise. He also develops intelligence (a side effect of the drug). Meanwhile Will ends up dating vet Caroline (Frieda Pinto) who loves Apes as much as Will.As years go by Will's father starts to deteriorate again as the drug begins to wear off and an incident with Caeser defending Charles against an abusive next door neighbour gets the Ape catered off to a sanctuary with other Apes where Caeser is bullied by two guards, one being Dodge Landon (Tom Felton who played Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise).Due to the cruel treatment Caeser receives at the hands of these humans and feeling neglected by Will he establishes himself as the alpha-male and plans a daring and well co-ordinated escape for freedom with the other Apes to rule over the humans (what will eventually be the case in the sequel). First off the CGI of the Apes themselves is absolutely jaw-dropping. Forget men in monkey suits in the original and the sequels that proceeded. These apes look - are actual apes, you wouldn't think that they are just special effects. It's a testament to giving this film realism as they move like real apes. The second biggest strength is the central performance by Andy Serkis as Casear, it also reflects the many strengths of silent movie making as Casear stays virtually wordless. Serkis gives a sensational central performance that deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Through Caesar's movements and facial expressions and when he finally speaks we feel everything he feels tenderness and love at Will looking after him and pain and rage when being mistreated by humans. It is bravo piece of acting and the audience feels for Casear's plight the whole way.It's unfortunate that the humans fair less well mostly. The only ones who really make any impact is Tom Felton as the nasty guard who makes the most of his menace in a cracking performance and Lithgow as Charles who gives an accurate and sensitive portrayal of one suffering from Alzheimer's. Even then they have little character development.Unfortunately James Franco and Frieda Pinto are nothing more than cardboard cut outs as they have severely unwritten roles (though they give decent performances). Franco though has more to do for the first hour as the screenplay sets him up well but loses interest in him in the last hour where he does nothing except fall for the expendable vet who could have been cut from the film altogether as she was very forgettable as a character and run hopelessly after Casear. Also some of the plot is a little too sloppy with a few glaring plot holes. How come Will's neighbours delay complaining to the authorities about the chimp until it is fully grown, when it has behaved scarily for years? How come Will waits so long before telling his boss about the miraculous properties of his drug? Did they somehow slip his mind? And why does Will's boss – a poorly written corporate type profit obsessed - change abruptly from ultra-cautious about animal testing to ridiculously reckless?However putting those faults aside there are other positives going for this film apart from Serkis's performance and the CGI. The action sequences namely the climax is well worth waiting for, which takes place on the Golden Gate Bridge is excellently choreographed and exciting to watch with beautiful cinematography from Andrew Lesnie who previous work included Lord of the Rings.There are faults with Rise of the Planet of the Apes but not enough to stop me enjoying it all the way through. This is a worthy addition to the other versions and a terrific first film for a reboot that is certainly worthy of a sequel. These Apes are well worth seeing on the big screen. I'm really looking forward to seeing the continuation of the story and seeing how this promising new franchise will continue to develop.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
great movie really explains original,Finally a good newer remake that can actually relate to the original when i saw the previews i thought the movie looked okay but after seeing it my thoughts have changed the graphics were great they actually looked like real apes with a great storyline it still relates to the original but with some differences this movie really did a good job at sticking to its story and you could really relate to the apes and you felt bad for them the characters have great personality's and good stories for them all overall this movie was very good only at some parts it got boring other than that it is definitely going into my movie collection,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
No 'damn dirty apes' here.,"Before I begin, there is something I need to get off my chest. Riseof the Planetof the Apes? I can understand the producers' desire to link this film with the rest of the series, but I'm sure audiences would've made the same connection if it was just called Rise of the Apes. But fear not, because an overly clunky, lame title is by far the worst aspect of this movie. It falls short of replicating the thematic genius of the original, yet wipes the floor with Tim Burton's ridiculous remake.Will Rodman (James Franco) is a medical scientist tasked with creating a cure for Alzheimer's disease, a formula that to date has only been tested on apes. Its success is determined by measuring a primate's increased intelligence, but after one subject flips out and is killed, Will takes in her baby and raises the chimp as a son. Noticing that his mother has passed the effects of the drug genetically to young Caesar, Will is shocked to see just how extensive the side effects are, resulting in Caesar developing a mind far beyond any ape, as well as typically human traits such as empathy and compassion, leading to a bond between the chimp and Will's Alzheimer's-afflicted father Charles (John Lithgow).Although personally considered one of the best up-and-coming actors in the business, Franco doesn't have to extend his acting chops here, nor does on- screen girlfriend Frieda Pinto. The criminally underused Lithgow does well in a small role, but it is Andy Serkis, as the man behind the computer-generated Caesar, who steals the show. I suppose this was to be expected (he did Gollum, after all) but I was constantly amazed at how brilliantly a human could not only mimic the movement of an animal, but also invoke real audience empathy for what is just an animated image.The short runtime of the film (approximately 105 minutes) is accommodated by excellent pacing. Certainly, Rise of the Apes is aware of its status as a blockbuster, so almost by definition the movie must move quickly, but this is juxtaposed by the slow, progressive development of Caesar, inserting realism into an area I was expecting would just be glossed over by director Rupert Wyatt. Caesar starts out learning basic life skills, but as he ages, his genetic mutation teaches him complex talents such as intimidation, manipulation, violence and dominance. By the end of the film, he has become the leader of a downtrodden civilisation, spreading his anti-human propaganda for the sake of fulfilling an ambitious plan.Here we have a film in which the ending is inherently obvious even before the opening credits roll. The joy comes from exactly how it arrives to that conclusion. I was expecting a big, dumb, battle-for-survival movie going in, but Apes remains grounded in the sheer art of storytelling for the most part, saving the final battle for a very enjoyable climactic set piece. As one friend stated, you almost become a fan of the apes by the third act, if only to see just how they go about their hostile takeover. In fact, even the final scene does not try to be too excessive, striking a perfect balance between suspension of disbelief and a grounding in reality.To those who may not buy into the premise entirely, I assure you that the vast majority of the plot is explained logically, and any sudden escalation of the story is accounted for with reason for a character's actions or development. As mentioned earlier, Caesar does not immediately become a walking, talking, weapon-wielding ape but instead grows slowly. This is beneficial in justifying the extremities and complexities in his character that have become apparent by film's end.The movie works in certain scenes that hint to the original, both in terms of imagery and the shift in power from apes to humans, which is a nice touch. It does not quite match the thought-provoking nature of the 1968 sci-fi masterclass, but adds a cautionary, self-conscious element to the blockbuster, certainly welcomed by this movie fan, resulting in a final product I would not hesitate in recommending.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

A Great Surprise,"At first I didn't know what to expect from this film when it was announced. But after watching it I was thrilled. In my opinion this movie couldn't have been done better, to be honest I liked the version from Tim Burton but it just didn't accomplish, recently there has been this boom on remakes or reboots and that simply states the obvious ""Hollywood is in crisis"" they simply can't find new ideas that can bring money into the industry, it's easier to make a remake o reboot of a blockbuster even if it's been done recently (Spiderman)But this movie really goes beyond a simple remake/reboot. You obviously can assume what's gonna happen at the end but the story is really really good, other than King Kong there is no other movie that I can think of that has made me feel more clearly what the animal is thinking and feeling. Brilliantly done. The CGI is quite obvious but it's nicely done and even though the apes are noticeably CGI you don't even care.Brilliantly brilliantly done, even the credits at the end as simple as they are they tell a story that really helps for the beginning of the sequel.

The CGI has gone too far. Apes looked fake --> movie looks fake,"The movie was mildly entertaining but so much of it was lost by the terrible use of CGI. Whatever happened to using trained apes or even people in suits for this type of work? Maybe only used CGI to enhance the movie? This is what ruined it for me. I won't go into plot details, but even from the previews you could tell that these CGI apes moved like they were in some kind of video game. And since the apes are in almost every scene, in fact the protagonist is an Ape, the whole movie feels like watching a video game. CGI has been so abused that you need to go back to older movies like Alien & Aliens and Die Hard to see action and sci-fi done right.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The story is about Caesar and the Apes,"This is really an excellent film. I would have given it a 10 rating if it was not for the plain vanilla, lazy performance of James Franco. He put about as much effort into it as he did for hosting the Oscars this year. I guess he gets by on his looks because he is so lame. But this story revolves around Caesar and all the other Apes and it is extremely well done, the apes have great empathy, there is some gentle humour and the excellent special effects truly enhance the film rather than distract from it. Good performance by John Lithgow, too bad Franco does not learn from a truly distinguished actor. Any way see this movie it's great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Eeh- Depends on your taste,"For starters, I have never seen the original Planet of the Apes, or the 2001 re-make, so this could be influencing my opinion. When the trailer first came out, I didn't want to see it, but I wouldn't have gone out of my way not to see it. I had no expectations for it. But I was planning on going to see a movie, with no preference, so I saw that this movie had, at first received a 7.8/10.0, and then increased to an 8.0/10.0. So, I thought I might actually enjoy it, given that the majority of movies I have seen with an 8.0/10.0 rating on IMDb were quite good. However, I was not that impressed with the overall movie. The plot summery was well thought out, I don't know if the explanation as to how the apes had grown so intelligent in the original film or novel, but I felt it gave a solid reason for the apes later advanced civilization. However, some parts just seemed just too unoriginal for the depth of, how I felt, the film was aiming for. This may have been to help attract a larger audience, but I just didn't believe a few parts fit. I felt as though it could have just been scripted to have more emotion and depth, and that the director and writers didn't fully achieve this. While the director and writers did approach this very well, I just felt like more could have been done. Overall, if you're not looking for every aspect of how a film comes together, and mostly only trying to catch a random good movie, this is probably What you would enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Too bad about the trailer,"This really was a very good movie. But the trailer ruined it.This movie is more like a drama, with a very action-packed ending. The entire ending (all the action) is shown in the trailer. So the whole time watching this movie I was left wondering, ""When is this going to happen? When is that going to happen?"" Every exciting twist and turn shows up in the trailer, so I found myself watching just for the imagery, but always knowing what was coming next.Some characters are absolute cookie-cutter and their story arcs can be foreseen instantly and accurately.I would have given this an 8, but knowing the entire plot from beginning to end really detracted from my enjoyment.

"Let me describe the first 7 minutes for you, you'll thank me....","Let me get out of the way that I hate people who are trying to always find fault with movies, snickering at the slightest movement of a cup in the background from shot to shot, etc. So when I describe the first 7 minutes of absurdity in this movie, realize that I am doing it to illustrate just how phoned-in this script was in an effort to save you a rental fee (or know what a laugh you're in for). Onto the movie...So we start with some chimps in the jungle. Then suddenly, African guys with AKs show up to scare them, droving them through a series of traps. One chimp gets caught and gets taken away in a metal box. It shouts in anguish and being taken from its family (seriously, it's the chimp version of KHAAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!!! but drowned out by somewhat sad, angelic choir music).Next scene, the same chimp is doing puzzles in a room with a handler/scientist and a video camera. The chimp is doing really well. James Franco taps on the glass observation window of the room carrying a clipboard, just doing his morning rounds. The handler tells him how well he's doing. Franco sees and in shock runs away yelling ""Get me that video!""He runs to the office of his superior and says the drug they're giving the chimps works and he wants to start human trials. His superior gives the usual ""I speak only in terms of money and I have my doubts"" spiel. Franco throws down what looks like x-rays onto the desk and says ""The data is there, sir!"".What data? Do you know what data is James? And what the hell did you throw on the desk? Was that the papers that were already on your clipboard when you were doing your rounds? His boss says it's only one chimp. ""One is all we need, sir."" His boss replies ""Take some more time"" which is answered with ""I've been working at this for 5 years!"" I don't think James gets how science works. The boss looking at the paper seems convinced (seriously, what is on those pages?) but says he has to pitch it to the shareholders.Next scene we're in the boardroom. They pitch this drug as a cure to everything neurological. Shareholders are impressed. Meanwhile a handler is being a dick to the same chimp, who they need to demonstrate its skills as proof. The chimp gets mad, so they have to lure it out and snare it (I don't know why either). It gets out and starts running around the lab between pipettes and MRI machines. Shouldn't this be a kennel sort of set up? At least have a door that keeps chimps who have gotten out of their cages from escaping entirely, surely. But no. It jumps around a lot and has an odd preference for jumping through plate glass (I count 3 times). The handlers grab dart guns.The chimp is suddenly in the lobby of the company's headquarters. I know Pfizer does all their research on the 2 lowest floors of their skyscraper in downtown Manhattan. That's how much space research takes right? And why are their literally zero locked doors between the animal testing area and the lobby? That seems like a security risk. Our fuzzy friend jumps around, through another huge piece of glass which Franco's presentation is being projected on. Shareholders are terrified and hit the deck. Chimps are like black bears. Just curl up in a ball and they'll leave you alone. Or is that brown bears? The chimp roars at the power of standing on a boardroom table. Then gunshots. A security guard empties his clip into a room filled with the most important people in what must be a multi-trillion dollar company. The chimp falls dead and the handlers show up screaming ""No!"" In this company, lobby guards always know to draw down when wildlife get out. God forbid the chimp get out and then...do what exactly? It had been given a drug, not been infected with Rage. What's the BFD? The chimp dies, scene ends.And there you go. That's what you're in for.

It's all about the ape's baby,"I went into this movie with the wrong impression. Based on the trailers, I was expecting a horror/thriller about helpless humans being attacked by crazed, savage monkeys.Boy, was I wrong.This is the tale of Caesar the orphaned chimp, and it is told very well. The human characters are mostly flat stereotypes with clichéd dialog (many of whom are a bit too conveniently evil/sadistic), but the acting of the CGI apes (yes, I said acting) is top-notch, and Andy Serkis certainly deserves credit for making us feel Caesar's pain. Thanks to mankind's blind allegiance to science, he's a lost soul who is neither ape nor human, but something in between, and when circumstance ultimately leads him to an unjust imprisonment, you can't help but root for him to outsmart the humans and lead a revolt.Unlike Tim Burton's 2001 remake, fans of the original series seem to be mostly embracing this with open arms. Though it contains LOTS of easter egg nods that won't be noticed by newcomers, it's a well-made reboot along the lines of the recent Star Trek, and has little else in common with the originals outside of the basic concept.James Franco as Caesar's savior/caretaker is less than stellar. I can't help but wonder if he was chosen simply as a nod to the actor who played the lead in Beneath the Planet of the Apes, James Franciscus. Fortunately for us, his character isn't the main focus of the film.Without giving it away as a spoiler, I will say that there's one line in the movie that is destined to go down in film history as a classic. If you've already seen it, you probably know the line of which I speak. It's making audiences gasp, and it's a moment that still sends a chill down my spine when I think about it.One final note: STAY FOR THE CREDITS.

expectations exceed - what a nice surprise!,"I'll keep this short! I really was not expecting much from this film, and perhaps unfairly - mainly because of the movie let downs we see so much of. However, I was quite touched by the way this developed - especially as the Apes end up showing more humanity than the humans (bravo in particular to Felton who is brilliantly sadistic). Lithgow (to my mind the most underrated actor in history) genuinely brings a tear to the eye - but no spoilers, so you'll have to watch it to find out why. And to top it off, Franco comes across perfectly - even being 'out classed' by Caesar eventually. Serkis takes a shine to these roles, and this is no different.Unfortunately, they have done it now, and I want several new films to replace and reboot the Planet of the Apes.

The dynamic between Caesar and Will was well written also. Caesar's development was brilliant as he goes from this innocent kid to a determined leader. The visuals were fantastic especially the choregrahpy, the chimps really felt alive and there were face expressions were really well done.

An excellent remake for once...,"Too often, pointless remakes are created that usually do not add anything new except for replacing the actors and possibly changing some small scene/detail here and there. Examples of this phenomenon are the remakes of Psycho and The Wicker Man. Both of these films add nothing new and at the same time they manage to be much worse than the originals in all aspects. Fortunately, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is not such a movie. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is based on the fourth film in the original series, but they have updated the script to make the film work better in today's society.The film is about how they perform experiments on chimpanzees to try and find a cure for Alzheimer's. However, problems arise when the experiments instead lead to a greatly increased intelligence in the primates. The monkeys then decide to fight back against the human tyranny.One aspect of the film that I greatly appreciated is that you mostly saw the film from the monkeys' perspective. They have actually done a really good job of getting the monkeys to express emotions without the help of dialogue. At least until the end of the movie where a monkey actually learns to speak (unnecessary and added nothing, but they might refer to the older movies where the monkeys actually spoke). In addition to this, this also gives the male lead played by James Franco a lot of motivation to behave the way he does. He is trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's (something his father is suffering from) and he therefore has a personal reason for wanting to perform these experimental tests. The film is touching and you feel as much sympathy for the monkeys as for the humans.In conclusion, I would also like to take the opportunity to praise John Lithgow for his acting performance as the father with Alzheimer. He is not an actor that I have taken seriously before, but here he really showed that he can act and he also gave me the biggest surprise in terms of acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A film you wish would have been longer,"Overall a robust movie. The directing slips by unnoticed, yet it more than succeeds in keeping up the pace and interest throughout the film. The cinematography is average, you could argue the movie lacks in variety when it comes to sets, however the overall look is greatly boosted in post-production, with special effects and proper sky replacement (the latter absent from too many movies produced way afterwards) improving the cinematic look, while I had mixed feelings concerning the color theory. Script-wise the movie has an interesting concept, yet vaguely poorly executed, meaning it followed too linear of a storyline, without however having a huge impact on the final result keeping the sequels in mind. Now to the best asset of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the VFX department did an amazing job, as the primates were both realistically and emotionally-correctly animated, while blending in and interacting with the rest of the environment seamlessly.

It's not fun to watch like all of the others even the Tim Burton from 2001 was more entertaining in an odd sort of way. The performances are poor from everybody, but the new Caesar played (sort of) by Andy Serkis comes across as an expletive I won't put here. You don't feel any warmth towards the chimp, you just want somebody to put a bullet through him and end it early.The science behind the film is just daft and the special effects look a bit off despite the fact most of the films budget went on this.

"2011 is not over, but I think we already have a winner.","How do you explain half the audience glued to their seats even as the end credits roll up? At the end of the film, one word I heard myself say was ""Awesome!"". As this year's summer movie mania draws to an end, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is the ground-breaking vehicle that will stay with us for a long time.The most powerful aspect of this film is its totally engaging story. Let's forget for a moment what we have seen and learnt in previous films of the same name. Scripted by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and loosely based on Pierre Boulle's novel, the concept here is mind blowing to say the least. As a scientist at a pharmaceutical company, Will Rodman (James Franco) believes he has developed a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Having successfully tested a genetically engineered retrovirus in chimpanzees, Rodman is all set to go public when a test subject goes berserk and is consequently put down. Discovering the offspring of his ill-fated test subject, Rodman takes the baby chimp home where his father Charles (John Lithgow) names him Caesar. As it turns out, Caesar is no ordinary chimp, having inherited human-like intelligence from his mother. Then comes a powerful turning point in the story – Caesar must decide if he wants to remain a lab subject or free himself from captivity.When ""Planet of the Apes"" was re-made in 2001, director Tim Burton's saving grace was the head-reeling twist in the end. What we here is far more powerful. As the new director, Rupert Wyatt brings together a full bodied story in such a manner, he has obliterated all preceding films, including the 1968 original. Having said that, this is one of those rare films where the story outdoes almost every other aspect of the production. Good thing then because I really doubt James Franco is receiving an Oscar for this film and you can be absolutely sure, neither is Freida Pinto. On that note, I really don't see what Pinto has contributed to this film except a pretty smile. Yes, there are a few few British-American accented words here and there as compared to her non-existent dialogue in ""Slumdog Millionaire"", but that's about it. On the other hand, Lithgow is heart wrenching as an Alzheimer's patient and you feel for his character. Tom Felton brings aboard his nasty persona from the Harry Potter franchise and his character gets what he deserves, in what I thought is an inside joke featuring a not-so-magic wand. But as I mentioned earlier, the story is just too captivating for anyone to be even slightly bothered by screen time fillers like Pinto or Felton.Aside from the phenomenal plot, the other accolade is the ground-breaking technology used to animate apes. When ""Avatar"" came out, director James Cameron was credited with the use of ground-breaking technology known as ""motion capture"". Wyatt raises the bar with acute advancements now known as ""performance capture"". Known for his performance as Gholam in ""Lord of the Rings"" and Kong in ""King Kong"" (2005), Andy Serkis as Caesar is an epitome of a living, breathing, swinging ape and is easily the best moments in the film. I felt as though an ape was trained to act.As if the story is not engaging enough, Wyatt's triumph is the questions worth mulling over. While our greatest strength is our intelligence, are we most vulnerable in our tendency to become complacent? This puts the human race at a disadvantage as we as a species have stopped evolving since we learned to walk upright. Whereas, every other species continue to evolve just to survive. Imagine for a minute, what if the highly agile and comparatively stronger-bodied ape were to slightly improve in intelligence. Would humans still dominate all other species? Or, will we eventually cause our own extinction and in the process allow another species to reign supreme? You know as well as I do what the answers to those questions are. And if you hesitate, don't say I didn't warn you if Caesar forces it out of you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise with the Apes,"In a cinematic era dominated by reboots and mindless blockbuster franchises, Rise of the Planet of the Apes does indeed rise above the rest. This is in whole due to the startling performance by Serkis. The man behind Gollum and Jackson's King Kong has created through motion capture and facial recognition technology an ape character that is nothing short of miraculous. Serkis gives us Caeser, who is every bit the primate but Serkis offers such subtle nuances and gestures that the character outperforms his human counterparts. This is truly deserving of an Oscar, should the Academy finally get its head around this hybrid style of acting. The technology is now so good you can allow yourself to forget you are watching a CGI character, but it is down to Serkis why you believe that character has life and sentience. You will want to rise up and follow him too.The story is told with equal subtlety. While it contains all number of clichés that will swell your heart and stir your compassion, newcomer Wyatt directs with a purpose. There is a sense that there has been great thought about how man can fall and apes rise in their place. The audience is left to fill in the story without having the plot points force fed. By the climatic end it is enough that there is escape for the audience to know the human oppressor has given way to the nobler and indeed humane race.More reviews at lookbeyondreviews.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Don't put the whole point of the film after the credits, dummies.","It started off pretty well, I had a good feeling about it as the plot started developing.Then about half way through it got a bit tedious. At the same moment two things happened.1) The whole rest of the film's main events (except the after-credits scene) became painstakingly obvious.2) The film stopped being as coherent and there seemed to be a few logical gaps - either because the director realised it was too obvious, or because it was so obvious that they couldn't tell it'd stopped making sense in a local context. It felt like it was missing a few scenes that explained how things happened.It was saved by the after-credits scene, and if the final scene was before the credits instead of after, I'd be more tempted to give it 7/10 instead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Really Good First Installment,"Much to everyone's surprise, the trilogy which this reboot started ended up as one of the more groundbreaking, inventive, and generally better franchises of the decade. It's not the best of the three, but it works very well. It's brisk and exciting and the Alzheimer's plot line with the central (human) character's father is convincing and continually relevant. It has a dash of humour as well, but what really sets it apart is the truly remarkable motion-capture work from Andy Serkis and the rest of the people playing apes. The performances are brilliantly judged, and the gradual growth of humanity in them is moving, chilling, and convincing at the same time. The iconic 'get your hands off me ...' moment is cleverly recontextualized, and the ape versus ape moments are both visceral and emotionally engaging. It ultimately follows the standard blockbuster template a bit too much in plot structure, and at times the screenplay feels a little weak, but it's a good first installment in a very fine series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wasn't Expecting This!,"I came into this movie with very low expectations and I was just blown away by the time I finished the movie. I didn't expect much because I don't think fondly of the original series except for the very first one and 2002's remake was okay, but nowhere near anything like this and I'm being kind. I also wondered how a rookie director could handle a movie like this, but Mr. Rupert Wyatt did a mighty fine job.This film is a prequel set in modern-day San Francisco and tells the tale on how the apes took over the world. It all started with a drug that makes chimps have higher intelligence. The main ape in this movie, Caesar happens to be a victim of this drug. When Ceasar is taken away from his home and to an ape facility where he is mistreated, that is where the fun begins....The acting is kind of weak only because Andy Serkis's performance overshadows them all. He really played the part just wonderful and I'm amazed how he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, even though he was motion-capture. That being said, I think James Franco and Frieda Pinto were good in their roles.Overall, this is a movie that highly exceeded my expectations. The visual effects are amazing especially with Caesar. I also loved the expression of the chimps' eyes. Certainly better than the remake ten years ago. Even though there are some great action scenes which the Golden Gate Bridge scene comes to mind, there is a heart here. That is what the previous Plane of the Ape films were lacking. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great execution, but we've seen this movie before","I just saw this movie today and I have to say that it was quite good, but not great. It's basically a retelling of 1972's ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", but whereas ""Conquest of"" had an great premise with a weak execution, this movie has excellent execution with a bland and overdone premise. The premise was nothing new or original so it didn't leave an impression on me like that those original five movies did.Still, the execution was superb. Andy Serkis's CGI Caesar in particular was impressive and even outdid even Roddy McDowell's excellent performance as Caesar in ""Conquest of"". The plot was also more plausible. In ""Conquest of"" we're expected to believe that Apes evolved into their human-like form in less than 20 years. I'm forgiving of the older film because they didn't have the budget or technology to make the Apes more realistic back in 1972, but still, their appearance could have been explained by the arrival of the Apes who traveled back in time in the previous movie, ""Escape From the Planet of the Apes"".In terms of execution, this film was miles ahead of the older films. It also had some great emotional moments, in particular when Caesar is imprisoned and has to endure abuse by his keepers and his fellow chimps. I also liked the Alzheimer's plot, which was heart wrenching and well executed. It managed to capture both the bleak atmosphere of ""Conquest of"" while still retaining the hopeful spirit of ""Battle For The Planet of the Apes"". The only moment I felt taken out of this movie was when Caesar said ""No"" for the first time. It just seemed a little forced and out of place. Obviously it was done as a nod to the older films. ""No"" is the word that humans are forbidden to speak, and also the first word Caesar is heard saying when he starts his rebellion in ""Conquest"". Nevertheless, I felt that when he spoke for the first time, the movie had jumped the shark, but it got good again really quick.The biggest weakness of this film was its bland premise. Scientists try to play god and Evil corporation gets to greedy and we all pay the price. Meanwhile a subjugated group rebels and overcomes its oppressors. Don't interfere with nature ... Blah Blah Blah. It was basically retelling of the ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" movie without the whole ""self fulfilling prophecy"" angle that made those earlier films so interesting. In a way, one could view this as a prequel to the first two films as long as they act as though the backward time traveling events in ""Escape From"" never happened. This is how things could have happened had Cornelius and Zira not gone back in time and changed the course of history. So this resides on a different time-line, or is completely removed from the events of those last three sequels. And though it borrows from the ideas and main premise of ""Conquest Of"", it's more or less a retelling of that story but has no connection to the actual events of that story.Either way, it could serve as both a reboot, or a prequel to the first two films since it doesn't contradict anything in 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" or 1970's ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". I'm sure, however, if they continue with sequels, it will eventually forge its own plot to replace these as well. But, at this point, one could still interpret this as a prequel. It's kind of reminiscent of X-Men First Class, which could work as a prequel to the first two X-Men films, but, depending on the direction they go with the sequels, could also be used as a reboot. It's actually quite smart to do this, and viewing this film as an alternate time-line is thought provoking in itself. Of course, this theme is never explored in the movie, so it's kind of a moot point. Without offering anything new or original to the premise, the film lacks the impression that the original five movies made when they first hit theaters and suffers as a result.

Very disappointing,"I had no idea how disappointing this film was going to be... someone must have rigged the rating ahead of its release. Wish I could get those hours back. Hoping I can spare others the pain with this review.Science: completely implausible, often laughable Character development: patchy and contradictory Motivations: fake and unbelievable CGI: brilliant! The only saving grace of the film Music: incredibly predictable, without any subtlety, was jarring a lot Acting: very ordinary Overall this film has underestimated the intelligence of its viewers or perhaps it didn't care for patronising. Or film makers thought all movie goers are really quite stupid.For those who are used to sci-fi, even reasonably OK sci-fi, this is bound to be a big disappointment: it's crude, implausible and cringe worthy throughout. The premise and the CGI could have propelled this film further if it wasn't bogged down by bad screenplay, bad dialogue, bad acting, bad music and maltreatment of every sacred tenet of good sci-fi. The plot appeals to emotions but leaves the intellect starving.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Be afraid, be very afraid","20th Century Fox have made two excellent blockbusters in the same year: Tom Rothman take note, stay away from the production process because people like strong stories and characters in their films. What is even more surprising is that no one excepted Rise of the Planet of the Apes to be good, it was directed by a fairly unknown director who only made one film and a few episodes of Hollyoaks (a poor British teen soap), the first trailer advertised the special effects company (never a good sign) and it is a prequel to a great film, but of a series people have not shown much interest in. Even the website I work for, Playeraffinity.com (there's my plug), had doubts it would be good. The last Planet of the Apes film was the Tim Burton remake, which was met with a lukewarm reaction. But Rupert Wyatt was able to put it out the bag.Will Rodman (James Franco) is a promising scientist for Gen-Syns, a major pharmaceutical company based in San Francisco and believes he has found the cure for Alzheimer's, the disease his father, Charles (John Lithgow). But after his demonstration to the board goes horribly wrong Will's research is forced back to square one and only one ape survives, Caesar (Andy Serkis) and he ends up caring for the chimp. He discovers that Caesar inherited the brain power of his mother and Will studies him, believing he could be the cure for all brain diseases whilst caring for him. But after a violence attack on a man Caesar is forced to live in a primate sanctuary, with a cruel guard, Dodge (Tom Felton). Caesar sees the many sides of human cruelty and he knows he can lead a revolution and lead his kind.Wyatt shows he is already turning into a really good director: The Escapist was a strong star and Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great blockbuster. In a short 105 minute package Wyatt was able to make a film with lots of drama, action, sci-fi which had a number of story lines: but he never overloaded the film with characters. This is what a blockbuster should be, fun with a great story. This was a film that was Caesar's story as becomes aware and grows from a young chimp to a super intelligence leader. Wyatt was able to mix tender moments with fast paced action: there are great action set pieces and brilliant special effects. Many of the apes have their own unique look and Wyatt knew how to move the camera. He kept the tone serious, dramatic, yet fun. I feared the film would follow a formula, man tests on apes, someone saying we shouldn't be doing this testing, oh crikey everything is going to hell: but the film avoided this, for the most part.Andy Serkis was truly great as Caesar and he was so expressive. There is already a campaign to get him an Oscar nomination but I doubt he would get it, but he does deserve an award at some point in his career. He got his role down perfectly, moving and sounding like an ape and showing you could be a great performance just through movement and facial expressions. There are a lot of moments with the film being without dialogue and it a great strength of Wyatt of making these scenes very compelling, understanding film is a visual median. I personally was hesitant of Franco being cast as a leading scientist because he looks too young and too much of a pretty boy for the role, but he was strong throughout his performance and worked well with Serkis. Lithgow too was strong as the father who was suffering from Alzheimer's and really good for an actor who I know mostly for comic performances. Felton was effectively slimy and like he is in the Harry Potter series a really vile villain. Freida Pinto sadly has a more thankless role as the love interest but sadly actors from South Asia struggle to find good roles in Hollywood, which is a real shame because Pinto is very talented and beautiful actress.Whilst this film has a lot of strength I do have some minor criticisms. The first is that David Oyelowo plays a cliqued movie executive who only thinks about money, does not listen to reason or logic from people who know better and acts constantly as an antagonist for when the situation requires it, even if he changes character. The other little problem I have is that I would have thought a cure for brain disease would be stem cell based, not a retrovirus, but I'm not a scientist so what do I know? I also like to praise Patrick Doyle's score, particularly the use of African drums and Andrew Lesnie's (Peter Jackson's cinematographer) camera work. Plus there are a plenty of homages to the original film and despite the fact Charlton Heston is dead he is still able to offer a cameo: but it is a blink and you miss it moment.Also this is real nitpicking, but is Earth already the planet of the apes because humans are apes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"When I went to see Rise of the Planet of the Apes at midnight I wasn't really sure what to expect. I sort of thought it would either be really good, or really bad, not in between. Luckily it was a very well done film. In a movie like this it is so easy to make it cheesy or stupid but they did a great job of keeping it somewhat grounded. I was constantly on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next and can honestly say I was never bored during the entirety of the movie. I'd say anyone who is a fan of the Apes franchise should see this movie, and would even take it a step further and say that anyone who is a fan of good movies should see it.

Disappointing at the End,"Last night I was watching Strangers on a Train...the old Alfred Hitchcock film. There's a scene in the film where Bruno (the villain) murders the young girl and you watch the murder through the reflection in the girl's eyeglasses that have fallen to the ground. Now I'm not sure how Hitchcock pulled that off (I'm sure I could look it up), but one thing he obviously didn't use was CGI. It was impressive. Today we use computer graphics for everything in movies, and yes it's very impressive, especially on the big screen. But it does take away from the magic of motion picture. Yes, I know, we've all had this conversation before...at least those of us over the age of 35. And computer graphics do have their place in movies. This would be one of those movies. It allows directors to do things they could never have dreamed of doing 20 years ago...like have a massive battle between apes and humans on the Golden Gate Bridge. That's what we want from technology in movies. Computer generated imagery should allow us to expand the scope and abilities of film to create a more realistic canvas for living out our fantasies (because that's really what movies are for. Does this take away from the original Planet of the Apes movies of the '70s? No, of course not. What we hate about CGI is that it sometimes makes our movies seem ""plastic."" Here, I don't think that's the case.But beyond that...how was this movie? Yeah it was good. I enjoyed. James Franco does a fantastic job. And I particularly liked the fact that we side-up with the apes on this one. That is something different from most of the Planet of the Apes franchise movies from the '70s. But the biggest problem with this movie was the ending. It was less than satisfying. I got the feeling that the ending could have gone on from where they left it off, but that the producers wanted to leave off in a good spot for the sequel. So we get a short movie with an ending that doesn't quite go as far as we want it to. The movie could well have gone 30 minutes more and established the beginnings of the apes taking over the world (because we all know that's where the sequel is going. I felt cheated at the end. I felt like they shortened the movie for commercial purposes...to make more money...and that's a bit irritating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Rise to the top of the movies,"I will start out with a very bold statement in saying that in my opinion this is the best movie of 2011 thus far. The cast is amazing including an incredibly talented Andy Serkis who gives Caesar more emotion than most human actors in films today. The script is riddled with great dialogue and although there are a few cliché's it doesn't hinder the film. All the apes look realistic and extremely lifelike to the the point that you'd swear they were all real and the trainer was just off camera. The last half hour is devoted to an action sequence involving the apes and the Golden Gate bridge. There are a number of truly brilliant shots that follow the apes as they move around the environment, and several tracking shots that blew my mind at how well executed they were. This is one of very few times, where I have walked out of a theatre wanting a sequel. Forgive me if I am gushing but I loved this film and cannot help laugh in a way because it's a movie about Apes and the humans are secondary characters. Another unexpected fascination was that the Ape learned sign language and used that to communicate with his owner (franco) and other Apes. They never speak, but the way they act and their facial expressions say it all. Everyone should watch this, especially those familiar with the original film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great movie...,"""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a really nice movie in which a scientist in his attempt to cure the Alzheimer's disease makes an intelligent chimp. This intelligent chimp will lead an ape uprising and it will start war between the two sides (human against chimps).This movie has pretty good visual effects which gives a different view in whole movie. I liked very much the storyline. About the interpretations I have to say that James Franco who played as Dr. Will Rodman was really good and John Lithgow who plays as his father was also good.

They have been able to put a soul into the chimpanzees that has never been done before (at least not so good). I know chimpanzees have souls but you can't let them act like a human does to portrait a certain kind of personality that the script/director wants.From the moment you will notice this you will wonder how the hell they did it.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"This is essentially a B movie dressed up with an expensive production budget and an A-list cast. The events are simplistic and predictable, with nary a plot twist in the entire 105 minutes. Don't get me wrong, in spite of the predictability, the movie is still entertaining as all get out. As the action unfolds we clearly witness a detailed evolution that leads to a climatic battle. The buildup is beautifully done. The machinations are far fetched, but the intellectual advances of the chimps are presented in a most credible fashion. Not only will you accept a chimp could acquire super intelligence, but you'll cheer their ascension to power.The tale's allure is thanks in no small part to the principal chimpanzee's emotionally engaging portrayal. Dispensing with makeup applied to human actors that has been the method in past installments, this reboot relies on major strides in computer technology to create the simian characters. The star chimpanzee, Caesar, is a brilliant use of CGI created from a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis. Renowned as Gollum from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, he's crucial to the enjoyment of this science fiction. I'd actually go as far to say the full picture's success rests with him. It's a wonderfully expressive depiction. Caesar has an emotional progression that is comprehensive. A revolt becomes logical because his emotional trajectory is so believable. We truly mind what happens to this central figure since we're emotionally invested in his growth. Even a simple scene where he corrects the way Will's father holds a fork, is remarkably poignant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

How the monkeys control the zoo,"Rebooting movie franchises are one thing. Rebooting a movie franchise that is still comparatively new is another. Rise of the Planet of the Apes cunningly ignores Tim Burton's misfire of a remake and decides to become a sort of remake/prequel to Charlton Hestern's original classic sci-fi movie.If you don't know or don't care where (chronologically) this movie comes in the series and look at it as a stand-alone work (although, it was a commercial success - not prizes for guessing they'll make a sequel or five), it's actually quite good.The opening twenty minutes or so are a little slow and I was wondering what I was getting myself into here. However, once the central ape, aka Caesar the mentally genetically-enhanced chimpanzee starts growing up and showing signs of things to come, the story picks off. In fact, it kind of makes the human characters redundant as Caesar steals every scene with the help of a menacing look of bitter resentment towards his cruel human masters. Soon he leads the others apes to revolt against them and, if you can get over the fact that apes can take on gun-totting humans, you'll enjoy the action scene on the Golden Gate bridge (which I'm presuming has been recently rebuilt after Magneto destroyed it in X-men 3).All in all it's not overly long and, if you like sci-fi and the premise of super-apes potentially taking over the world, give it a shot (of course we hope this film won't give any terrorist factions ideas - we don't want them bringing the world to its knees by releasing a couple of hundred angry monkeys into any major city and watching humanity crumble).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Second viewing: Still great!...,"The CGI in this film is truly stunning, and although you know most of it is computer generated, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. As far as performances go, well, for me, the star was definitely Andy Serkis who did the vast majority of the motion-capture work for Caesar, a really stunning performance. As far as the humans go, well, James Franco did a decent job as Will Rodman, as did Freida Pinto as Caroline Aranha, although I felt her character was never fully developed and consequently she was woefully underused. John Lithgow was excellent as Will's father, Charles and Brian Cox was suitably sleazy as John Landon. Tom Felton did a good job as the evil handler, Dodge Landon and David Oyelowo was Will's boss, Steven Jacobs.I loved every minute of this film and I really hope any sequels that are made keep to the same standard. If I have one criticism, it's that the human characters are not particularly well developed. I can forgive that to a large extent because it forces the audience to see things from Caesar's perspective. There are plenty of references and nods to the original 1968 film starring Charlton Heston (something to look out for). Certainly one of my favourite films of 2011 and I see nothing here to change my view. I have given it a slightly lower score than after my first viewing, mainly because the film does loose a little of its impact when scaled down for the small screen.

One of the most memorable lines from the original POTA (""... damned dirty ape ..."") is delivered forgettably this time, by an utterly despicable character played by an unknown actor. Heston is rolling in his grave. I give the movie 5 stars for the CGI *acting*. However, much of the CGI *action* is lame. I especially did not appreciate the ape climbing action, which was way too fast and smooth. Not uncanny, just not realistic. I'm sorry, but just because a computer can generate footage that can't be completely processed by the human viewer's brain doesn't make it good. Apes climbing a building were too synchronized. Then there are the product placements. Several of them stood out like sore thumbs, but none more than the guy stuck in traffic who turns his smart phone toward the camera just so we can see it's a BLACKBERRY!

Good Summer Movie,"Just saw this one, I really liked the set up.I am not familiar with the series from the 70s and was NOT a fan of Tim Burton's movie a few years back, but knowing this series existed and how this was going to be Hollywood's attempt at refreshing this series... well, I have to say, well done!I really liked the setup, and the second act, the 3rd act was just OK, if not really predictable by that point.I feel like some studio heads got involved and tore this 2 hour plus movie into the 90 minute flick we all saw.This is a film that could really knock one out of the park with a director's cut that goes a bit deeper into the character and mythology development. I really do think by the end, this film does feel rushed.All that being said, can't recommend this enough... good storyline, good development and a satisfying ride when all is said and done. Not your typical popcorn movie, but does itself well as one for the summer of 2011.Kudos to the actors, writers and directors, this was a really good movie that could have been great had it not been for some studio boss's notes that were ""suggested"" - hey, just my speculation, but if a director's cut ever comes out on DVD/BluRay, it may actually be worth watching!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"CGI monkeys and nothing else, a very overrated waste of time","Anyone who tells you this is a great movie is just trying to get someone else to drop money on this middle of the road flick. Everyone who has been waiting so patiently for this movie has run out and seen it, even if people say it is average and ""kind of dull."" Most will see the movie because of the name recognition of the old movies we fondly remember even though the final effort is a movie that can barely stand on its own. It seem some will go and see it whether it is average or not – it definitely has them by the wallet. Still, those praising it must love CGI monkeys and nothing else. Give them a monkey with shifty eyes and they're happy all day long. The rest of us want more when we pay to see a film. We want a coherent plot that doesn't try to preach and one that we can invest in emotionally. Rise of the Apes does NOT do that and that's the real problem when there's no action to cover for the bad writing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A short Serkis saves this movie from disaster! Caesar rules!,"I am sorry, but I did not go ape crazy with cinematic ecstasy with my ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" viewing experience as many moviegoers and numerous critics did. This movie is a prequel to the ""Planet of the Apes"" and it reveals the genesis of how the apes went ballistic and eventually wiped out the entire human race. And to think it all started in times of Caesar. More on that in just a sec ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist who vehemently tries to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease which his father Charles suffers from. Will tests out an Alzheimer experimental drug on chimpanzees in the lab he works with; when that experiment goes ape crazy, he has no choice but to go back to square one and do a Huey Lewis, ""I Want A New Drug"". Will takes in Caesar, a baby chimp who eventually gets older and gathers humanlike intelligence from the experimental drug's effect; which also help cure Will's father Charles from Alzheimer. When a bullying neighbor tries to hurt Charles outside Caesar's Palace (that would be the Rodman home), Caesar goes bezerk and almost kills the neighbor. Consequently, Caesar is court ordered to an ape sanctuary. What follows is a sort of an ape prison escape type of situation led by a very angry Caesar. Director Rupert Wyatt does a credible job with the action ape sequences of the film, but lays flat when it came to the humans. None of the humans were engaging at all, and it did not help that they had nothing fascinating to say thanks to Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver's humdrum screenplay. Franco looked bored playing Will Rodman, maybe he would have had more fun if he was playing Dennis Rodman. Freida Pinto's performance as primatologist and Will's love interest Caroline Aranha served hardly any purpose in the movie and was just thrown in there for eye candy pinta when seeing the gorgeous Pinto. John Lithgow was OK, but not vintage Lithgow with his performance as Charles. The thespian who stole this show is no doubt Andy Serkis, the performance-capture master who once again showed he is the Lord of the Walking Things with his work as Caesar. His Serkis continues to be the Greatest Show on Earth in the performance-capture movie arena. Another positive rise of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was its breathtaking visual effects; I do visualize that it just might take the Best Visual Effects Academy Award. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a cinematic planet worth visiting primarily due to the Serkis ride of Caesar the primate. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Four Thumbs Up,"Beautifully constructed morality tale from Rupert Wyatt featuring some really remarkable visuals. The effects work and the actors' interactions with their 'props' are so assured that the outcome is convincing to the point that you won't notice the join, and it's a great accomplishment that should deservedly catapult Mr. Wyatt into the big leagues.It's a good if rather predictable story, but satisfying to spot the carefully placed traces of continuity that link to the later (in time-line) phases of the PotA franchise. In the first half at least John Lithgow is the emotional heart of the film and his performance is very touching and effective. James Franco's is a strong turn too, and Freida Pinto provides a strong counterbalance to his character's increasingly reckless pursuit of his scientific goal. It's also good to see Tom Felton casting off his robes and discarding his wand (although just as nasty as ever).In relation to Caesar and the other apes, it is difficult to comprehend the skills that must be necessary to perform effectively with what must be highly invasive technology. Andy Serkis is obviously a skilled actor in his own right, as evinced by his performances as Ian Dury and in The Prestige, Brighton Rock and Little Dorrit (tv) to name a few, but is he really the only guy who can play these marquee motion capture roles? I don't mean to be critical, far from it, I think Mr. Serkis will be remembered as the first and possibly greatest exponent of this newest branch of thespian-ism, but possibly only because of him stepping out from behind the virtual mask and making the transition to 'live action'. It is interesting to consider whether any of Serkis's fellow mocap-ers will ever have the profile that he has deservedly achieved, and if not, why not? In the end, RotPotA is a very enjoyable effects romp, but is best, perhaps unusually, not in its big set pieces but in the personal interactions at the film's heart.All four thumbs up - bring on the Dawn...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"An Interesting Movie, But Probably Not What You Expect","Before I get into the review, I must say I am impressed by Fox's idea of a new version of this movie, and I also think highly of the way the apes look and their expressions in this movie. A great job done by Andy Serkis to fully capture Caesar's emotions and truly portray exactly what he goes through. He is almost guaranteed to be snubbed for an Oscar, but he certainly deserves a nomination and he is the main character in this movie. This is his best motion capture acting performance since Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, and he is the true highlight of the technology that went into making the apes look realistic.James Franco doesn't work in this movie. It is almost like he just showed up for work and read his lines. He tries to be a scientist but also tries to be a cool, normal Aron Rolston type guy that just doesn't fit together. But it's not his fault. The way his character is written is not focused enough to make Franco's scientist job seem real. It isn't the greatest balance of two dimensions.Another awesome thing in the movie creates a problem. The apes have great emotions and the screenwriters did a great job and making them become the protagonists and making them more likable than the humans. However, while they are focused on the apes, James Franco and Freida Pinto almost do nothing, and their characters almost feel unneeded in order to continue the plot. Characters such as Tom Felton's and Brian Cox's are nasty enough to like the apes, but characters like James Franco and Freida Pinto aren't enough to give the humans any credibility, and it would have been nice to see those two have bigger, more hero-inspiring roles.My last few notes, it's a solid reboot with action that is good enough to see in a theatre, and if you are a big Planet of the Apes fan from the past, you will love the references throughout the movie. You might smirk once from one of the more obvious references but overall, take them as a bonus treat to the adventure! The story feels hollow at times, but it's good enough to share an experience with the viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A lot better than expected,"When I first saw a trailer for this I thought only bad things. It reminded me of Tim Burton's sad ""re-imagination"" of a classic movie. But once the movie started I actually got interested. The only thing that made me not interested was that I kinda expected what would happen in the end. I won't ruin it for you readers but if you seen the original you should already know.My main problem with this movie is that the actors were cast wrong. James Francho is much more talented than what he was given in this movie. Same with Freida Pinto, it's not that they did a bad job they just weren't given enough material for their talent. That best acting in this movie is from the apes. Andy as Ceasar is amazing and the cgi is very good. I just wish James was given more especially in the final sense with him and Ceasar. The final was upsetting if you knew the history of planet of apes. If you didn't well you shouldn't even be reading his.I do recommend this movie. It was entertaining and a good prequel to the planet of the apes series. This is not a re-imagining or sequel. It is a original prequel that is worth seeing. Despite the predictable ending, I was impressed by the cgi and story telling of a great series. I give this movie a 7/10 and I say go see it. You won't be disappointed. Also, there's a good few clever parts for the original that I enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fun,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes sets itself apart from most other mediocre sci-fi films because it understands what it is trying to do: entertain. It seems that its competitors in the genre seem to have forgotten that a movie is a much more enjoyable experience when it is actually enjoyable to watch. The character development is good, the plot is... decent (slightly clichéd), the pacing is perfect, and the acting, specifically the mo-cap, will immerse you into emotional investment.And isn't that what sci-fi is all about? Immersing yourself into an altered or impossible reality? This movie does just that. I would even go as far to say that the movie makes you feel at the center of some sort of moral dilemma between the Californians and the cro-magnons, a situation that while common in movies of higher thinking, are often unseen in action movies like ROTPOTA.Those who seem to dislike this movie for a few plot holes with applicable stretched reasoning and some (two) mediocre acting jobs may find it easier to just loop Citizen Kane and play old war transmissions from an FM radio while reclining in a salt bath. If this is your idea of entertainment, then I must recommend adding a wall-powered toaster to your alkaline enriched ego pool.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Monkey Business,"I usually find prequels are just a way for the producers to squeeze a little bit more money from a popular movie. Practically just a waste of time. Luckily Rise of the Planet of the Apes felt more than just that. The movie had its point and the creators of the movie bothered to give it a unique touch and look while respecting the original Planet of apes too. The plot itself is pretty straight forwarded and doesn't have big surprises that you wouldn't see coming. The characters of the movie are fairly ordinary and with the first look you can already see who's the good, who's the bad and who's the ugly of the film. On the other hand the 3d-effects and the environments of the movie are stunning. These 3d monkeys of the movie are very realistic looking and well done. Only the ""main ape"" points out from the crowd with his more humankind face, as the movie makers for sure intended to. The red woods look breathtaking and give a nice touch of the nature to the film and a great contrast to the city life where the main part of the film takes its place. Although the main plot is very straight forwarded and we already know how it is going to end, the small details and references to the original Planet of Apes are the spice that keeps the interest of the audience up and the movie goes through pretty fast and easily. With little improvements in the plot, the movie could have easily become more than just an average movie. I assume the producers and the directors wanted to avoid risks and create a straight forwarded smooth movie to avoid negative ratings the prequel might have with a more radical plot. The result is still amusing to watch and honors its original masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Typical Formulaic Hollywood Scrudge,"Basically this was a rewrite of ""King Kong."" Ape gets imported from Africa and becomes too powerful for its handlers, and there is a shoot out involving high places at the end.A lot of the special-effects ape movements were just about as realistic as those in the original ""King Kong.""So what is the message of the movie? Feeling any anger? Suffered any abuse? Then the highest degree of violence, mayhem, and murder should do it for you. Bah!In the original planet of the apes the implication was that humans devolved (inability to speak, for example) after suffering a major self-inflicted downfall. This movie implied that all humans would perish. Where we do see significant devolution in this movie is how low have become writing standards today compared with, say, 1933. I am sure there are chimps that could produce a better screenplay. And I wish they could have been chosen as screenwriters for what turned out to be this simpleminded simian slop.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great Prequel!,"Simply put Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great prequel to this Planet of the Apes reboot. Great pace and the story is solid. The entire cast are solid as well including the CGI apes. I wasn't sure about the CGI apes when I first heard about it, but it is so well done that I forgot they are CGI. There was something about the original and about real actors wearing ape suits but the CGI apes definitely work and depending on how the sequels go could be even better than their original counterparts. One more thing to add, even though it is a reboot there are bits in it that pay homage to the original and fans of the original should find these enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A valiant effort.,"I watched this movie with great expectations but something about it just didn't do it for me. It raised some concerns about animal experimenting and the directors did a brilliant job of having the audience root for the apes (and against the humans). The implicit hints at the corporate greed of pharmaceuticals and the way in which they exploit both people and animals alike in satisfying the staunch stance held by the shareholders (to make money at all costs) also provided food for thought. The acting however wasn't anything that was likely to raise the bar for future movies; the main characters were portrayed pretty well (by James Franco and Freida Pinto) but many of the other characters, especially Dodge (Tom Felton), were unoriginal and it felt like the acting was a bit shallow. It provided a fairly coherent story-line that is interesting to follow but not to the point that I found myself completely immersed. As a prequel, although it made a valiant effort, it lacks a certain flair and falls short of the standard set by its predecessors.Overall, it's worth a watch though (but maybe only the once).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great way to start things off fresh again.,"As we all have seem, rebooting the franchise by remaking the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" was a terrible idea. Making first a prequel to the whole series was a far better choice, as things turned out. We will surely get more sequels to this movie and who knows, maybe even some decent remakes of some of the old Planet of the Apes movies, or at least some parts of it. I'm fully confident they will come up with a good and original way to expand on the series, following this movie.It really is a great movie to set up things. It's literally one that goes back to the source and cause of the whole ape outbreak and shows how it was possible for these animals to rise against the humans and eventually start ruling the world. Not that this movie shows you all of that (guess we'll have to wait for the sequels for that) but you know it's all still going to happen, at least if you have seen or heard of any of the classic Planet of the Apes movies, which is about everybody on this world.And despite the fact that you basically already have the knowledge how this movie is going to progress, it's still great and exciting to see it all play out. And biggest accomplishments is that you really believe it all. It's a science-fiction movie of course but yet it all plays out very realistically, as if one day this all could truly happen.You could really thank the story for that, that came up with a very plausible story, that slowly progressed into something bigger and bigger, till things went ape, toward the end of the movie. It was a fascinating, tense and exciting movie to watch throughout, with plenty of great and clever, subtle moments in it.The movie also made some subtle references at times, toward the classic Planet of the Apes movies. But good thing about this was that it wasn't constantly in your face about it. If you have seen the classic Planet of the Apes movies you'll get most of the references but if you haven't, the references in this movie won't bother you or distract you from anything that is happening in the movie.It's also a movie with a really great cast in it. Initially the choice for James Franco to play the main, scientist lead in this movie, raised a few eyebrows but as it turned out, he was just simply perfect in his role. I also really liked David Oyelowo and it was also pleasant to watch other big names such as John Lithgow and Brian Cox in this.But of course the biggest stars of this movie truly remains the apes. It's amazing to see how much personality these animals posses in this movie, even while they don't speak (yet). All of the apes were created with motion capture effects, with Andy Serkis playing the main chimpanzee Caesar.And while the apes were all truly great looking I must still admit that at moments it wasn't always all that convincing looking. I just feel that the effects are not quite there yet. We are getting close and no doubt that someday we will truly not be able to tell CGI from real and this movie is truly brining it all a step closer but like I said, it's not quite there yet. Surprisingly enough the closeups of the CG animals were still the most convincing looking, which was probably also still the most important aspect to get right, in order to get all of the emotions across.It's a really great fresh start for the franchise again, that paves the way for many more Planet of the Apes movies to come!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great mix of action and science fiction, lacking character development.","I just got back from the theater and I was pleasantly surprised about how good the film was.CHARACTERS AND ACTING: In all honesty, the worst part of the film is the characters. Franco's role comes off as an unlikable pet freak and his girlfriend is completely useless. I really wish Franco would do better, especially coming off his performance in 127 Hours. The acting was average, but coming into this film expecting to see Nicholsonesque acting wouldn't be a smart mindset.DIALOGUE: The dialogue fits the characters well. Except 3-4 lines in the movie are come off as extremely cheesy. ""You stupid monkey!"". The last line of the film is the worst. The famous ""damned dirty ape"" line is awful coming from a feminine, asshole character. They have ruined the legacy of the quote.PLOT: Excellent idea for a prequel to the Planet of the Apes. I don't want to give out too much, but it works well.SPECIAL EFFECTS: Wow, the CGI apes were great, and I hate CGI with a fiery passion. This is definitely the current front runner for the Best Visual Effects Academy Award. The film is also edited magnificently.The last 30-40 minutes is filled with heart pounding action. Seriously, it's like watching your inner rage spill on to the screen after you find out your whore wife cheats on you, except with chimpanzees. The film should have ended about 5-10 minutes sooner.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) ***,"I've been a die-hard fan of the old PLANET OF THE APES franchise since the early '70s, and have been starved for a very long time by wanting this series to start up fresh again and return ""Apemania"" to the fold. I had my fingers crossed ten years ago when Tim Burton undertook the 2001 reboot, but it turned out to be an abomination and an insult. I'm pleased to say that RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is much better than Burton's idiotic mess. Some viewers already seem to place RISE as some kind of prologue to the original 1968 Charlton Heston classic, but I prefer to think of it as a separate, unrelated storyline which hopefully will make enough money to inspire a followup and possibly a whole new saga all its own.RISE stars James Franco as a young scientist experimenting with a cure for Alzheimer's, which his dad (John Lithgow) suffers from. He reaches a promising level of success, and when testing the cure on apes, it results in a super-intelligent pet chimpanzee named Caesar (played by Andy Serkis, with CGI enhancement). Caesar demonstrates smarts and a communicative ability, and is loved by Franco, but ultimately is taken from him and mistreated in a caged environment with his fellow simians. Caesar becomes more enraged as he is dealt one indignity after another, and it's no surprise by the film's title to say that he initiates a massive ape revolt.This is basically an enjoyable popcorn film, though it's nowhere near as cerebral as the original five-chapter series was. Andy Serkis does an impressive turn as the lead ape Caesar, in a part only semi-replicating Roddy McDowall's performance in CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. James Franco makes a so-so lead, even if it's sometimes hard to believe he can accomplish such medical wonders. John Lithgow is properly sympathetic as Franco's suffering dad. Freida Pinto is completely forgettable in a very under-written part. Some of the lead apes in this film are played by a few actors enhanced through ""CGI Capture"", but otherwise are CGI creations all together. As far as CG technology goes, it's a pretty good job here -- but every now and then I was reminded that I was watching faux images.One thing that was unnecessary to this longtime ApesFan were all the ""wink-wink"" references to the old apes movies; nearly everyone in the movie is named after someone associated with the original film (""Franklin,"" ""Jacobs"", ""Dodge""), and when they revisit a couple of popular classic lines, it made me cringe. (They had re-used one of them even in Burton's movie. Why do they feel compelled to stoop to that?). While nothing great, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a good enough offering with a welcome chunk of heart. It's not exactly clear what heights Caesar and his friends are hoping to accomplish at the end of the story; with any luck, box office receipts will make that more fleshed out in a sequel. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A fitting prequel. All of the in-between knockoffs are irrelevant,"If you were alive and a teen or adult in 1968 you will remember the groundbreaking movie Planet of the Apes. It was the movie that everyone was talking about. People were stunned. Those days were full of turmoil. The day after it was released, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Viet Nam was still a monster on the horizon.Charlton Heston descended from his mount and beat the wet sand on the beach as he screamed at his descendants who had blown it all to hell. He had battled the damn dirty apes only to realize that it was his own kind that had destroyed the world.Zoom forward through the decades to the present day and see the world around you. Medical breakthroughs and technology that surpasses other movies of that time such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. See the advancements and see what was sacrificed. There are now medical advancements that extend human life at the expense of hundreds of thousands of sentient creatures who happen to have been born without opposable thumbs and the developed brain lobes that give them dominance over every other lesser creature. The lab animals suffer for the humans and they don't know why they're being tortured.When I first heard the plot of Rise, the first thing that came to mind was; how can a handful of intelligent apes take over the world? There just aren't that many. A small town police force could take them all out within an hour.After seeing the movie I have had all questions answered. This is another breakthrough movie. Its state of the art CGI that will astound and it should be taken as a tribute to the state of the art. Because movies are just that, art.The first part of the movie is human tragedy, the son desperately seeking a cure for Alzheimer's as his father slips away. There is sadness that will tug at everybody's heart as Caesar is separated from the only human home he has ever known. Man's inhumanity to the man-like creatures is brutal. Many scenes pay homage to the original and give comedic relief, such as one scene that flashes by where Caesar is building a model of the Statue of Liberty.Then when the apes rise up, the audience is rooting for them. It's the exact opposite of the original Planet of the Apes where the apes were the oppressors.The questions are answered at the very end in the credits.

Not so fast.No explanation, until now, about how it all went so askew. This thoughtful homage might breathe new life into a dying franchise.

However let me assure you that there are more people like him in this world than it bears thinking about. At times we can be a truly despicable race that I am utterly ashamed of. This is touched on lightly in the film, but perhaps not heavily enough.This is a quite incredible movie. It took me a long time to get around to seeing it because I wasn't a particularly big fan of the original 'Planet of the Apes' movie, nor the remake. They didn't do much for me. This was a very different type of film. I tend to love origin stories. The way the character of 'Caesar' is handled in this film is incredible. I love that we see every stage of his development, and no matter what stage he is at or what he is doing at that time, we are on his side.The animation in the film is nothing short of brilliant either. I can't speak highly enough about the class it was handled with.

I was scared a lot when I was a kid, and I am impressed every time, again and again.There were 5 films in total. Other 4 wasn't that good, but more less they were OK.Today I watched 6-th film. I was skeptical at first, but Rise of the Planet of the Apes delivers. Directed by Rupert Wyatt, very good work. Main characters James Franco, Freida Pinto and John Lithgow are all great in their roles. And main ape character is played by King Kong himself: Andy Serkis. Special effects were simply special, story was nice, tension was built with every next scene. My vote 7.5/10.Planet of the Apes (1968), Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972), Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973).This is my ""Planet of the Apes"" collection. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) deserve to be there.Planet of the Apes (2001)??? I throw that garbage 10 years ago. Just after I watched it...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Don't expect too much, but better than most","As a joke, I wanted to start this review by saying it is about the horrors of turning real live chimps into CGI, but as I was watching the film I started to get into the mood and understand what it was about. Fortunately, it was a rather good story with very good rendering, but unfortunately it doesn't even begin to approach the level of social commentary that the original movies had. As such, I would say it's a better than average sci-fi movie, but a less than average Planet of the Apes.To put it bluntly, the apes get smart, they start to resent their treatment at the hands of humans and they react. How? Violently! Hulk smash style. Yes, we can now create the level of CGI that shows hordes of apes moving across the Golden Gate bridge, but then we succumb to the ease of transforming it all into a mindless battle for dominance.If there is something to be taken from this film, it is the way emotions were conveyed from a purely apish perspective. Even if sometimes the apes were made to look and act way too human, most of the time one could expect stuff like that from real animals. I think this is relevant, I think this shows the level of emotional manipulation in Hollywood movies today goes far lower than ""the common denominator"", down to the ape in us. And we enjoy it.Bottom line: a block buster that tries to cash in on an idea that most people in the audience aren't even familiar with and a far cry from Carlton Heston's films, but better than most of the crap this year has to offer. Expect nothing spectacular and you will probably enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Disappointed,"I had to shut this off after 15 minutes. The movie was fine to start--I got used to the CGI almost immediately and the emotion in the eyes of the apes was wonderful. It's when the human actors came on that the script fell apart.1st strike-- No pharmaceutical engineering company is going to allow a drug to even be considered for human testing based on a single sample (one successful sample) and without extensive subsequent testing for side effects. There is simply too much money at stake. The James Franco character would not have gotten as far in his career as he had if he had been that rash and foolish all his life. The script lost tons of credibility in just the first five minutes.2nd strike-- In spite of the apparent failure of the one chimp, no corporate CEO would shut down the entire program immediately. The biologists would continue the study, find errors and exceptions and make adjustments.3rd--The baby is discovered. The biologists who study the apes would not have known Bright Eyes was pregnant? Give me a break. In a real test program the chimp subjects would have been health monitored daily or at least weekly--blood draws, EKGs, etc.--and the pregnancy would have been discovered in its early stages.The script writers could have set up the initial premise of the movie in a more reasonable manner. Instead they took the lazy way out. I like science fiction where the characters are realistic and behave as actual people in the real world behave, even when faced with incredible circumstances. The Matrix, 2001, the original Planet of the Apes--the science fiction becomes credible if it is based on real world laws and the lead characters behave as humans actually do and not as script devices. I have no idea how the rest of the movie was but if it was like the first fifteen minutes then forget it--great acting by Andy Serkis or not.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Surprisingly Well Crafted Drama,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes follows that timeless, age-old story we've all seen a thousand times before of a boy with a distant father getting his first pet, bonding with his pet, bonding with his father, and then trying to stop his pet from taking over the world.Okay, so that part about the age-oldness and the pet and the dad and stuff is only partly true, and all in jest. The fact of the matter is that Rise of the Planet of the Apes is, despite being the quadrillionth instalment in a tired franchise, almost entirely original. True, I haven't seen any of the old ones (which I imagine both enables and impares my ability to enjoy this film), but I can say that this movie carves interesting territory by effectively portraying the evolution of a character without using any speech to tell the audience what he is thinking.The movie originally follows Will, a scientist of some kind trying to cure Alzheimers because his father is suffering from the disease. Through a series of hijinks, he ends up the proud owner of a hyperintelligent ape whose mother's exposure to the drug during chimp testing endowed him with a brain capable of as much more then his fellow apes than a completely mentally stable person's brain is compared to someone deep in the depths of Alzheimer's. More hijinks occur, and Caesar (the ape) ends up stuck in a primate shelter run by sadistic animal haters. He develops a distaste for being treated as inferior when he knows he's more than a dumb animal, so he decides to build an army and take over the world.Telling more than that would be spoilers, though I'd love to discuss some of the juicier plot points that get introduced later in the film. The movie's plot is complex and solid. The action scenes are refreshingly necissary, and each one adds to the plot. The acting is all good, though I found myself wondering if James Franco wasn't actually trying to play the distant chemist who can't connect and was just suffering from beign a distant actor who can't connect in real life. I imagine people will take both sides of the debate, but I'll stay neutral. Caesar is a fascinating character, and his bitter evolution is fascinatingly told even if it's sometimes hard to watch because you feel so sorry for him. One thing of very particular note is that although the main human character is given an eye candy girlfriend, she doesn't wreck the movie like so many eye candy girlfriends tend to because she actually contributes to the conversations and interacts with the other characters well.On the flipside, the movie isn't quite perfect. The first half is a little too fast paced, and there definitely needed to be more scenes of Casar in Will's house acting as part of the family, and the last third doesn't have quite enough to tell me how the apes are gonna function in the real world, but in both the first and third acts' defenses, the second act where Caesar raises his army is the one the filmmakers poured their souls into, so it's what matters most. Also, the CGI is very remarkable, but is not quite real enough for my tastes, and is a bit distracting at times. The lead Primate Shelter keeper guy never receives enough explanation, and I felt continuously confused as to why someone who hates apes that much wouldn't just get a job somewhere else.That's about all there is to say. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a lovingly crafted film made by someone obviously quite in love with the franchise who was bent on showing the world just how cool the rather ridiculous concept really is. The last time I saw a movie set up a sequel that well was when Harry stood in front of the Goblin's lair at the end of Spider-Man 2, and I cannot wait to see how this film series (which the screenwriters say is intended to be a trilogy) progresses, though the end of this movie told me enough to left me satisfied that the people behind the film actually do have a good explanation for the apes' ultimate conquest awaiting us in future installments.Side Note: Speaking of Spider-Man, this movie reminded me of the Spider-Man films several times. James Franco is the obvious catalyst, but it continues when the people have extended conversations about human trials of a wonder drug designed to enhance performance and is solidified when you see the apes leaping very much like the Web Slinger around trees and such.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
entertaining sci-fi ape movie,"I liked this movie and thought it was a decent story. I also liked the special effects and am not sure what some are complaining about with those. For the most part, the chimps looked realistic and had facial expressions.Franco plays Will, a scientist working on a cure for Alheimzer's, which his dad has. He has a drug he wants to try on humans, but a chimp goes crazy and his drug is discarded by the company. But, Will takes home a baby chimp whose mother had the drug in her system. The chimp, Ceaser, proves to be exceptionally smart, but attacks someone so is sent away. Meanwhile, Will uses the drug on his dad and sees great results in the beginning. Ceaser sees a way to get all the chimps to follow him and releases the drug. Soon , he has a gang of smart chimps and they escape and cause a mess. And we see how the chimps will rise because the new drug Will was working on, is deadly on humans.FINAL VERDICT: It was good and a fun popcorn flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Its A Mad House!""","Rise of the Planet of the Apse was not just a amazing film on its owe but also pays its dues to the original Planet of the Apes in so many ways that when i was siting there watching this film i tried counting the hints they tosses at you here and there. And there was lots, i couldest keep count. PS. You all know what actor plays the main character Caesar. So if you did see the referents to one of that actors well known rolls, high five to you.The Story So not to revile to much about the plot, the film mostly revolves around the story of a son trying to heal his father from the horrible condition of Alzheimer's.(Which I'm sad to say is that i know way to much about how terrifying it is to watch one of your family members lose all memory of you.)So Will Rodman(James Franco) discovers a chemical that can rebuild and repair brain cells hoping it will heal his father Charles Rodman(John Lithgow). Go onward and i don't want to reveal to much but a chimpanzee named Caesar(Andy Serkis) becomes the main protagonist of this fine story. Changed by the retro virus that the magical chemical that makes him unbelievably smarter that a normal ape. And being mistreated and misunderstander by humanity he leads his fellow apes on a revolution to be truly free.The Up's Andy Serkis steals the show with his amazing acting and is uncanny ability to say a thousand words with just his face and his body language. It would seem that all the work with the apes in the film is impressive and makes you hungry to know more about Caesars fellow revolutionary's. John Lithgow pushed me to the point of crying with is interpretation of being affected by Alzheimer's's and the small amount of parts that him and Caesar share with each other are amazing and powerful. The CG is rather good(even though it can get sloppy here and there).I swear watching the first 5 minutes of this film was like watching a documentary on Animal Planet.Plus the story itself is engaging and as i said before the hints and pocks you get about the original films just puts a smile on my geek face. Me being a big fan of the original 5 films(and i only just recently found out there is 5 of them) this films fits perfectly with the other.And to top it all of, all of you Hary Potter fans out there will enjoy Tom Felton acting being the ass thats hes so good at being on the silver screen.The Down's Not to many problems i can point out here but there is some. I'm not a big fan of James Franco's depiction of a Bioengineer. If James Franco is a Bioengineer then I'm the goddamn queen of England. And like i said before the CG awesome it may be can seem almost sloppy but you really have to be looking close to truly see it.Wow, i cant really think of anything ells bad about this movie..Conclusion Go see the film. Spend ten bucks and enjoin yourself with some friends and family members. Then go see it for a second time because I'm going to see it for a second time.This is your friendly neighbourhood fat dude Chris Bryer saying ""Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intelligent and Pure Fun,"I give ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" 7.5 starsI truly enjoyed this film, one of the most enjoyable film experiences I have had in a long time. Rupert Wyatt directed the movie with perfect pacing, filling the background of the story with the correct balance of warmth, drama, and action before the climatic battle. Wyatt's pacing was patient but never slow, allowing the story to unfold naturally. We get to see the story of Caesar, the simian version of Spartacus mixed with a dash of Moses, rise to power and cheer for him along the way (Andy Serkis is brilliant, yet again).""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a smart film and it allows all of the people who love to over analyze things (aka geeks like me) to have a heyday. The way the apes grow in power is very much in keeping with the rise of early human civilizations. One can also interpret the entire Planet of the Apes narrative as a racial allegory, which Wyatt plays to, with some scenes alluding to the civil rights movement. Nevertheless, it is important not to over-think the film. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a fun a movie and that is its chief intent.If there is a negative to the movie, I think Freida Pinto is a bit stiff throughout the film. The acting of James Franco, John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Tom Felton, and David Oyelowo, all hit the right notes, playing their generalized character archetypes very well. Pinto though came across a little wooden to me and her character is unnecessary, acting mostly to add to dimension to Franco's idealistic scientist (and to increase female viewer ship). However, this is a very small qualm.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a wonderful summer sci-fi action blockbuster that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It is a smart film, never over thinking its subject matter but never playing down to the lowest common denominator. I cannot wait until the next installment of the rebooted Planet of the Apes narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Interesting though not amazing,"I felt what dialogue there was was pretty poor and this let the film down a bit - nevertheless the acting (especially from James Franco) was top notch with what the cast were given.I was a little apprehensive about seeing 'The ROTPOTA' since being a prequel, I felt the plot couldn't get too interesting since we knew it's final destination (the trailer didn't help). However, the journey itself took me by surprise. I was frustrated by the first half hour or so (and personally thought some of it was a litte daft) though this may have been mainly due to the fact I didn't feel all too impressed by the CGI. It felt too surreal and it took me a while to accept and connect with 'Caesar' - but I got there in the end.....maybe a little shallow of me I don't know - it just felt too cheesy to begin with.Once the pace got going though I was fascinated! The expressions conveyed by the Apes were amazing and I felt quite moved - definitely have a new appreciation of the animals, even if they are computer generated.The revolt was brilliantly written - and though all visually based the body language was amazing to watch - I literally couldn't look away. Though I grew to like the chimps I think the real icing on the cake for me was the two other larger apes which Caesar encountered - a male gorilla (very king-Kong like) and this beautiful orangutan which I felt stole the performance. The CGI was so brilliantly done for the orangutan I suspected in parts he was a real animal performing (couldn't tell) and very humorous.By the end, I felt the ticket had been worth it. Tons of subtextual meaning and references to the other films. It felt like it belonged with them - and although the script was far from perfect they made up for this with a blockbuster that got me riled up enough to come on here and review it. A great family film too!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Caesar is to perfect,"Everybody loves a revolution and so do I, but the reason why it didn't receive the full 10 stars is; because they made the film to save and crowd pleasing. In my heart I know this film is actually just a 7 star film, but I gave it the extra point, because Rupert Wyatt showed so much respect to all the previous 'Planet of the Apes' films by putting so many nice little references in his film, making me smile every time I recognised one.The story does a real good job filling in the blanks, which came to being after Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' film. Tim Burton must be really happy with Rupert Wyatt's film, since many people will be motivated to see Tim Burton's film for a second time after seeing this 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' film.However; where Tim Burton tried to hard to make a stamp and create a real different 'Planet of the Apes' film, Rupert Wyatt unfortunately wasn't bold enough and lacked that courage here. There were several wonderful opportunities to make for example the Caesar/Will Rodman (James Franco) relationship really epic (I'm thinking in the trend of Darth Vader/Luke in Star Wars or Fredo/Michael Corleone in Godfather) or Caesar more of a conquerer by not letting the apes hold back. But Rupert Wyatt simply missed this opportunity, which is such a shame! It could have made such a difference and could have made this film a classic, if they were a little bit more bold enough...Still a good watch, I was entertained throughout the film and I am certain all the 'Planet of the Apes' fans wont be disappointed.

Rupert Wyatt is the new Spielberg,"Believe this. Rupert Wyatt is the new Spielberg.The climactic action scene on the bridge is brilliantly filmed. Everyone says that this film real star is Andy Serkis, but I digress. It is Ruper Wyatt who takes a tired, ridiculous and far-fetched premise and makes it work to full extent.The fact that Ceaser is able to connect so well to the audience is thanks to the way Rupert handles the story, giving it such a weight to the more intimate scenes. And even if the cgi is not always credible, the story takes its time to create a real character out of it, that by the end of the film you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat. And the fact that we are talking about a film with cgi apes, that is all even more commendable, if we take into account, that all the other summer blockbusters failed to create truly engaging stories and characters.This film brings the kind of excitement and heart Steven Spielberg used to brings us with his films.On a final note, the film's biggest flaw is Tom Felton's character who in two very awkward scenes says two lines spoken by Charlton Heston in the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A truly inspiring film,"Being someone who has never seen any of the films, I feel I am in a more unbiased position, this however would only apply for other people who never has seen the previous series of films. Now to start off, this is a fantastically accessible film, as it is a reboot, meaning that, although it may share similarities with the other films, it bears no relevance to them whatsoever, similar to the James Bond films for example. The chimps in this is where the 'acting' is at. They provoke large amounts of emotion throughout the film and at many times during the film I was most certainly rooting them on. The storyline is that of a fantastic one, executed near perfectly with fitting cast. This film also was full of very epic moments I found which I do rather enjoy. Another truly captivating element to the films is the contrast that it created with Caesar over the whole timespan of the film... I shall say no more as that would most likely require spoilers. A highly recommended film on my part that won't leave you disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Rise of the Planet of the ApesIf Earth is going to be an ape planet someday, at least we can look forward to the eradication of head lice.And while public grooming is still far-off, this sci-fi film does lay the groundwork for its mass acceptance.Born of a lab chimp filled with an experimental brain enhancement drug, Caesar (Andy Serkis) is naturally gifted.But when the hyper-intelligent orphan is scheduled for termination, the scientist (James Franco) who created the drug absconds with Caesar and rears him himself.Eventually, Caesar attacks a neighbour and is sent to an ape refuge, where his torment at the hands of a guard drives him to lead a primate uprising through San Francisco.A re-imagining of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Rise elevates the series to a new level via smart storytelling, sophisticated special effects and a seditious spirit.Besides, rampaging apes smell much better than Occupy protesters. (Green Light)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The apes are awesome, the humans are uninteresting","The plot of this film is very similar to the recent horror movie Splice. Here, James Franco plays a scientist whose big presentation flops when his experimental chimp goes nuts and attacks a bunch of people. When ordered to destroy all of his experimental subjects, he steals a baby chimp to raise and experiment on at home. The ape, which his father (John Lithgow) names Caesar, is super-intelligent, but has his animal urges, too. This eventually leads to Caesar's discovery and imprisonment in a primate house. There he becomes a leader to the other apes, and, after he steals Franco's Alzheimer's vaccine, he makes them super-intelligent, too, which leads to an ape revolt. The movie is sometimes very well plotted, and at other times it's pure rote Hollywood filmmaking. The human story doesn't work as well as the ape story. John Lithgow's not bad as the Alzheimer's sufferer who inspires Franco's work, but Franco himself is fairly dull, and his love interest, Slumdog Millionaire's Freida Pinto, has absolutely not a thing to do. Whenever the apes are on screen, though, it's an excellent film. Caesar is created with motion capture technology, with Lord of the Rings' Andy Serkis performing. He's absolutely brilliant. Not an exaggeration at all: you can see every thought in that chimp's head. While the special effects are easily identified as CGI (I think every ape in the film is CGI, because the difference would be too bothersome if any real apes were included), they are about as good as that technology is ever going to get. There are a lot of references to the original film, some of which are terrible (two of the film's most famous lines are included and sound ridiculous), but some of which (like naming the orangutan Maurice) made me smile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Review of the Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"A glimpse of this movie's trailer at a suburban mall is what caught my attention. It seemed like an interesting concept - apes taking over the world, getting intelligent. More research revealed that this is actually a part of a series (although not in a direct way) about apes ruling a planet. Information gave rise to curiosity and finally turned into enthusiasm which is when I decided to give this movie a shot. And it didn't disappoint.The story should be familiar to people aware with the series - a new drug is being developed by a scientist Will Rodman to cure Alzheimer's. The drug is tested on a chimp who is killed while trying to defend her baby. The baby chimp then inherits the mother's genes and intelligence which develops far more than what the drug's maker's anticipated. What's interesting is the way this movie has been presented to people who are unfamiliar to the series - no worries, you're not at all gonna feel out of place. So, you definitely don't need to go through the previous movies to watch this one.There's little of character development or outstanding performances here (excepting the main chimp Caeser that is who gets both of these). What makes the movie work at least for me is the writing and the direction. Watch the scene when Caeser defends Will's Dad. Endearing and mesmerizing. The effects are awesome as well. Its hard to believe that so much could be achieved for a relatively small budget (about $90 million). I guess when it comes to top notch visual effects at a relatively low cost, Weta is the one to approach. They could create a whole planet in Avatar for $237 million, the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy for about $300 million and also did the aliens in District 9 for $30 million. Need I say more ???The movie has a really fresh feel to it - it has that typical summer science-fiction feel to it yet it is much more than that. It only runs too short - a little more time, say a run time of about 2.5 hours would have given the movie enough time to establish the characters and would have made it a masterpiece on the lines of Peter Jackson's King Kong. Its perhaps because of the short run time that Freida Pinto's and James Franco's characters get limited screen time and scope to perform. Nevertheless, for all that it is, this is a great summer movie with an outstanding performance by Andy Serkis as Caeser and a technically sound film in all departments (cinematography, VFX, production design and the likes). In short, its all that I expected it to be. If you do not have a problem in suspension of disbelief, I strongly recommend this movie !!! Score: 7.5 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Some things aren't meant to be changed. You have to accept that.,"I love the Planet of the Apes films; all the way back to the original.

Surprisingly driven by emotions and character,"I have to admit, when i first saw the trailer for this one i thought it looked awfully silly and quite honestly figured it would bomb.I was really surprised to hear so much positive critical attention as we approached the launch date, and so I rolled the dice and decided to check this one out.I have to say the trailer does not do it justice. You have no real concept of what the film is about.The effects group at WETA really outdid themselves this time, as did Andy Serkis.

Over-hyped,"This movie was good but not great. What really bothers me is that at the moment it is rated higher than Jurrasic Park, which is absolutely ridiculous.Bad news: The presentation of the human characters is pretty shallow and cliché. You have the heartless corporation head, the caring sensitive girlfriend, the young asshole punk who you know will get what is coming to him. Even James Francos performance was lacklustre compared to the effort he put in to 128 days. However the clichés do not stop at the characters as the film rips story line from Deep Blue Sea, Jurrasic Park, Resident Evil among others. Finally I feel the producers areat fault with the trailers made for the movie. The entire movie issummed up during 30 second TV commercials. There is not much of a novel experience in the theatre.Good news: The CGI technology carries this film. It is incredible how far special effects have come.

"Unlike the 2001 remake, the apes succeed this time","It's 2011 and here we have yet another Planet of the Apes movie. But could this one actually be incredibly good?With this Ape movie we get James Franco playing Will Rodman, he works for a company that is trying to use apes to make a new drug that will possibly cure Alzheimer's. After his main test subject is killed, he finds out it had a baby which is now without a home. He ends up bringing the ape, Caesar, into his home where he lives with his father (John Lithgow) who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Over the years they all bond and become a happy family, teaching Caesar humanly traits and how to be a kind loving person. An incident happens involving a neighbor and Caesar is sent to live in a facility run by Brian Cox and his son played by Tom Felton. While living there he would have the chance to interact with other apes, which he has never had the chance to do before. Over time he is mistreated by the people who run the facility and has given up hope of Will ever coming to his rescue, so he uses he knowledge to get the other apes on his side and eventually break out and dominate the humans.This movie really took me, and I'm sure most people, by surprise. The last Planet of the Apes movie we got was the 2001 Tim Burton remake that was all around ridiculous. With this movie, we get a new take on how the apes came to be almost human and tried to take over and it all works out quite well. It's always great to see that some people can still make a prequel, remake, or sequel and it actually be really good.While James Franco does a great job in the lead role here the real star is Caesar, who is played by Andy Serkis in the same way he played King Kong and Gollum. Every movement and action Caesar makes all looks as real as can be and it makes you actually believe there's an ape on screen doing human activities. John Lithgow also provides a good performance in the movie as well. The rest of the cast is fine but most of their characters are mostly one dimensional, especially a character played by Slumdog Millionaire's Frieda Pinto who is sort of the love interest for Franco's character.As far as the visuals for this movie go, they are pretty stunning. All the apes, gorillas, and orangutangs look as real as they can be. Director Rupert Wyatt really lets us get a feel for this animals and shows us that they are just like humans in a lot of ways. He also gives us characters we can care about like Will, his father, and especially Caesar.The summer movie season this year has been pretty good I would say, but they were definitely saving one of the best for last to end the summer on a very high note.Rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great fresh prequel to reboot this series!,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) isn't just a successful reboot, it's a triumph of storytelling. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the grandeur of San Francisco and the primal beauty of the ape forest with equal skill. But the true magic lies in the groundbreaking effects. We don't just see Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his fellow apes, we feel their emotions. The CGI is flawless, bringing these characters to life in a way that's both awe-inspiring and heartbreaking.The story itself is gripping, exploring themes of humanity, intelligence, and the nature of oppression. The film cleverly builds on the established lore of the Planet of the Apes franchise, creating a believable prequel that sets the stage for future conflicts. We see the rise of Caesar, a chimpanzee who transcends his species through scientific experimentation, from a curious infant to a revolutionary leader. His journey is as compelling as it is tragic.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a must-see for sci-fi fans and anyone who appreciates a well-told story.

Apes rised,"Never seen apes film before. This is my first encounter with ape movie. I should admit the apes rised for real.Plot is not very strong, the screenplay kept me engaged throughout the film. Quick and racy all 90 mins. The lead actors were not impressive except Caesar. Caesar was a performer rather i should say guys behind the CG work were the performers. The look, eyes, gesture, smile, anger everything was mesmerizing. 90 mins lives on the screenplay and the screenplay lives on the emotions, intelligence and relations between the apes and that makes the movie interesting.I go 7/10, 5 for the screenplay and 2 for caesar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
As intelligent as the first,"I have seen some commentaries that regard this film as being not as intelligent as the first, that is unfair and it shows that the people who viewed this movie haven't got the point of it.Wyatt wisely made the decision to leave the philosophy to the 1968 POTA, and instead channeled all of his creative powers to make this movie a thought exercise, to create a possible scenario of how the events in the 1968 POTA came to be. Now because of this people have said that it isn't as intelligent as its philosophically minded predecessor, but lets look at some of the differences.In the 1968 POTA the characters were roughly static the whole time, so Taylor was a misanthrope from beginning to end, Zaius was a reactionary from beginning to end and so on. That was done for a good reason, such static characters were primarily designed to flesh out the moral dilemma behind the movie.In Wyatt's movie character development takes center stage, all the attention is given to Caesar, he is carefully developed and is highly believable, unlike the characters in POTA he is left to develop naturally, reacting to what is around him. I might also add that in Wyatt's movie there are some interesting and thought provoking elements. A certain negation has extreme value, and marks the divide between humans and apes, as does the attitude of Caesar regarding warfare near the end. Its hard to say without spoilers but those two elements are the building blocks of the future POTA society.Another thing that I liked was that this movie is the inverted correspondent of the 1968 POTA. How so? Well think of it this way, in POTA Earth's dominant species are the primates, in this one humans. In POTA Taylor is a human misanthrope who has no belief left in his fellow humans. In Rise Caesar is an ape that believes in the strength of his kind, a patriot if you want. In POTA the main characters that support Taylor are 2 ape scientists and their son, of which the greater role is given to Zira In Rise Caesar is also helped by a couple, this time human, although both are to degree scientists (even Caroline) but this time the one with the greater role is given to Will Rodman. Also note that instead of a son, here we have a child. There is an inverse correspondence between Jacobs and Zaius, Jacobs is very much open minded and has no problem what so ever with intelligent primates, Zaius on the other hand is closed, dogmatic, and is afraid of intelligent humans like the plague. The water hose scene in both movies is also relevant.Taking all of these things into account, we can clearly see that this movie is just as intelligent as the first. Wyatt hasn't made a sequel, or a reboot, in my opinion he has completed the Apes series, with a compelling and believable story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Perfect groundwork for a new franchise,"This was a great movie to set the groundwork for a franchise. At first it was a little slow, but the pacing was just right and added to the weight of what was happening once we hit the third act. I love ""day one"" style movies where we see the event that changes everything taking place in real time. This movie executes on that in an exceptional manner and paves the way for the subsequent films that follow. I have been sleeping on this franchise for over a decade and now I am all in. As a sci-fi nerd I don't know how it took me this long to sit down and watch this film. 8/10. Would recommend to anyone debating on getting into the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Andy Serkis shines in this Great visual fest!,"Before you read this, note that English is not my first language so expect some grammatic errors down below.I had been looking forward to seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes for a long time. Mainly because I like James Franco and Andy Serkis, but also cause I found the plot to be pretty interesting. I thought I was going to see an action movie, turns out I was wrong. But more on that later.The story centers on Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist who is working on a cure for Alzheimer. As the cure is being tested on primates one of the subjects escapes from its cage and all the apes are put to death. However, Will takes one of the surviving apes home. The apes mother was one of the test subjects so the effect of the cure is transferred to the orphaned primate. This ape is named Caesar (Andy Serkis). The effect of the cure makes Caesar smarter and he learns sign language. After Caesar hurts a man in defense he is transferred to monkey custody. And it is at this point that things get grim. Everything culminates in a spectacular battle between intelligent apes and the whole human police force. How unbelievable it may sound, you actually buy it. That's a feat you have to congratulate the director and writer for.Let's talk about the acting. It is in the range of ""solid"" to ""outstanding"". James Franco really shines in the moments when he works on the cure and when he communicates with Caesar. Other than that he is just good. Freida Pinto plays Francos love interest in this movie. Why she really is in this picture is beyond me. Her acting is only good at best. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies) plays the bad ""zoo keeper"" and he does it really well. He is great at playing with his emotions and it really gives the character more depth. While there are some big actors in this film, the true star of this movie is Andy Serkis. With a resume including other motion capture roles such as Gollum, Captain Haddock and King Kong, his role as Caesar is his most remarkable. Caesar is such a deep and layered character and there is so much character development in this role. Though he only speak in sign (if you've seen the movie you know there is more to it later on) his body language and facial expressions says so very much. Andy Serkis is so subtle and precise that the character feels real. I can't understand how he didn't win an Oscar for this role.So let's talk about the visuals. The effects are amazing. Every ape looks unique and surprisingly photo realistic. The skin of every primate has realistic wrinkles and the fur looks fantastic. The motion capture is so good and all the actors are great. And like I said the photorealism can't be compared to other movies.The score is very good. It is exciting, fitting and really emotional at times. Most of the time it is there and it just works so well. It is really in sync with the movie. Overall it's a mighty, perfect soundtrack.So as I said, I thought this was going to be an action blockbuster. I was wrong. Rise of the Planet of the Apes has some really cool ass kicking monkey action but it is reserved to the last half an hour of the movie. Rise is a drama and it tells the surprisingly interesting story about an ape trying to find his place in the society. Sounds weird but thanks to the brilliant acting (mostly by Mr. Serkis), a great script and great directing it really works. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great film, exceeded my expectations","At first I thought, not another Planet of the Apes remakes, quit whilst you're ahead. But this film truly blew me away. It was incredible. My expectations were well and truly exceeded. There was a clear plot and storyline lined out which was easy to follow and understand, the way the film made you connect with both the humans and apes is remarkable, this happened in such a way, that it seemed there there were no bad guys, you wanted both sides to prevail in different ways. Great special effects and action scenes too. The only flaw that I could think of would possibly be the acting, no chance of an Oscar for best actor, but then again, you can't give an Oscar to a chimp !",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good popcorn flick, but more a set-up for (hopefully) better and bigger monkey business to come.","When a failed presentation nearly leads to the entire project being shut down, research scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) finds himself raising both a newborn monkey (saved from 'disposal') and his elderly Father (John Lithgow), who is stricken with Alzheimers, the very disease the serum being tested was meant to cure.The junior chimp is dubbed Caesar, and as he grows it is evident that his mental abilities are clearly in advance of children of a similar age, let alone other apes. Caesar and Will communicate by sign language, and he is trusted to the point that he is allowed quite a level of freedom around the home.Unfortunately as fast as Caesar is developing, Will's Father continues to regress.This leads to some drastic measures being taken which in the early goings have an indisputably positive impact.The following year sees more developments, Caesar is growing and maturing, now too big for the modest home he accompanies Will, his Father and girlfriend Caroline (Frieda Pinto) to outings in the local redwood forests that apparently fringe San Francisco.Here Caesar has all the freedom he can handle, thanks to his understanding and a bond forged by trust between he and Will.But even now the signs are not great, Caesar is in ape years an unruly teenager, he starts resisting forms of control, and exhibits aggression and displays of physical strength at times, one of which leads to him being admitted to an institution for a huge number of monkeys, apes, gorillas and orang-utans.Caesar's increasing intelligence and awareness of his surroundings are evident even before he enters monkey jail, but once inside and thrust among his own species for the first time in a fiercely competitive – almost tribal – ape hierarchy, Caesar is almost always deep in thought and planning 'bigger things'.There are the obligatory mistreating handlers to be railed against, onlookers who don't understand and of course greedy corporate types who see only profits. After the initial half hour Franco is mere window dressing, which is at least more than the under utilised Frieda Pinto can say. She has but to look amazed, in love or surprised, depending on the news she is receiving, in a role that suggests she should be the audience barometer:""I am surprised by this. You should be too!"". ""Now I/we am a little bit upset.""There is some action in Ascending Apes, though not of the gung-ho blood n guts variety, the entire film is extremely PG 13 all over.Finally the most obvious thing I took away was that this all ain't over, this was the rise to be sure, and there is far more to come. I think Caesar and his gang have done well with 'Rise' to build a platform, I hope the monkeys, gorillas and apes in the inevitable sequel ratchet things up a notch and start administering some ass whippings. No point rebelling against your masters if you're just going to chill in the local forests.I shouldn't be disappointed. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a good popcorn flick and I guess everything I expected. I just wanted to be blown away with a balls to the wall Man Vs Wild thing, and was a little less surprised with what was essentially a prison break film with the escape lead by a hairy CGI monkey John Connor.Final Rating – 6 / 10. We want our pop-corn flicks to have brains so I should applaud, especially when Caesar has a higher IQ than 95% of action stars combined. I just hope that the sequel allows a little more chest beating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The story is solid. The visual effects great. And Andy Serkis is tremendous.,"Based on the long running Planet of the Apes franchise, the film stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer 's disease. The experiment ends in tragedy, but there's still hope, in the form of an incredibly intelligent chimpanzee that he adopts, and names Caesar. Several years later, Will's experiments are working well, but Caesar attacks a man in his neighborhood, and he is locked in an ape sanctuary, wherein his whole world is turned upside down, and in secret, he plots revolution.This is a really stylish, solid action movie. Much to thank for that is director Rupert Wyatt's even tone and pace, and a sense of excitement that never overbears the audience. It really takes what it's doing seriously, and never loses that strong emotional core. But it isn't perfect. Notable faults include the fact that the film falters whenever focusing on a romance subplot between James Franco and Frieda Pinto, the latter of whom has near nothing to do in the film.Still, for whatever conceptual problems it has, it makes up with its aesthetics. The action sequences, what well used few there are, are quite exciting, and I was also unsurprised to learn that the film was shot by one of my favorite DPs, Andrew Lesnie. Job well done.The biggest praise I must make are for two things.1: The Visual Effects designed by the one and only Weta Digital of Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The apes are completely convincing, and the motion capture technology is put to great use.2: Caesar being the best character in the film. We're fooled into thinking he's a real being, and he really submerges us into his emotional state, something that the film benefited from big time. For the rest of the year, you can expect to hear me giddily singing the praises of Andy Serkis, who gives us another one of his fantastic motion capture performances, and adds another character to his roster alongside Gollum, and King Kong.While not perfect, Rise of the Planet of the Apes provides solid entertainment, and I give it *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
At Least Half of It is Good,"This reboot of Planet of the Apes starts out with realistic framing compared to the original. The apes actually look like apes and there's great writing and character development for over half of the film.But then it just became more and more ridiculous, naturally climaxing in the sort of prolonged, absurd CGI violence the stupidest of Americans demand. I found this turn of events predictable but a good twenty minutes of this flick are unbearable and this is something I would normally fast forward through.Another serious issue is that Rise of the Planet of the Apes and its successor Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't exactly age well in contrast to more recent experience with the handling of COVID 19.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A fresh and exciting reboot where updated technology and rich characterization revives Planet of the Apes with new life.,"Dr. William ""Will"" Rodman (James Franco) is a chemist who is working on an experimental cure for Alzheimer's disease through testing on chimpanzees called ALZ-112. After his promising test subject, Bright Eyes, rampages through GenSys before being shot, the company bankrolling his work, executive Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) orders the project terminated and the test subjects destroyed. Eventually Will discovers a baby chimp and that Bright Eyes' was just scared for her baby and takes the chimp home where his Alzheimer's stricken father Charles (John Lithgow) names the chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis). Over the next 8 years Will notices that due to Caesar having been exposed to the drug prior to birth he begins to exhibit heightened intelligence. As Will continues his off the books research with ALZ-112, Caesar finds himself questioning his place in the world.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a 2011 science fiction film directed by Rupert Wyatt and the third theatrical incarnation of the premise originated from Pierre Boulle's novel Planet of the Apes following the original 60s/70s film series and the Tim Burton helmed reimagining from 2001. While the 2001 film had been a decent financial hit, divisive critic and audience reception as well as a tumultuous production made it so that no meaningful development on a sequel came to be. Eventually the husband and wife screenwriting team developed a spec script inspired by news stories of problems with pet chimpanzees and after noticing similarities with Planet of the Apes the two wrote a script that would serve as a Batman Begins style relaunch taking inspiration from prior takes while making it their own. 20th Century Fox acquired the script in 2006 with the film beginning production in 2010. Made for $93 million, the film proved to be a sizable hit earning $480 million worldwide and even saw positive critical responses with many praising the visual effects and mo-cap performance of Andy Serkis. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great example of how even with an old franchise like Planet of the Apes it can still be revitalized if given the time and attention to detail to make it work.In many ways, Rise of the Planet of the Apes isn't all that special in terms of its story as it covers very familiar ground that sci-fi fans are well aware of, in this case being the ""science run amok"" where scientists inadvertently unleash unintended consequences in the same vein as Michael Chrichton's Westworld and Jurassic Park, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, or as Peter Travers pointed out Deep Blue Sea. Despite this being a time tested premise of science fiction films don't let that count against the movie as Rise of the Planet of the Apes shows that it's not the premise that sells the movie, but rather the characters and story in combination with each other. While James Franco is the typical overambitious scientist whose good intentions blind him to the potential consequences, his performance and character sell the reasons why it's so important as the movie invests a lot of time into his relationship with his father Charles (ably played by John Lithgow) and of course Caesar with the three forming a surrogate family whom we really grow to care about. The film does a solid job in taking its time establishing relationships and stakes and you really do become invested in the outcome as a result.As with prior entries in this series, the effects work is of paramount importance to a movie like this. While as a concession to the nature of technology the traditional usage of make-up and prosthetics has set aside, the movie gives us an adequate trade-off by using the film as a showcase of mo-cap performances and their capabilities in service of the story. Once we get to the second half in particular, many of the human characters begin to fall into the background as more focus is placed on Caesar. While Rise of the Planet of the Apes undeniably owes a debt to Conquest of the Planet of the Apes to a degree with some plot similarities, the team do a good job of avoiding the heavy-handedness and lack of subtlety of the original series' sequels and they find a way of making the apes more distinguished in order to keep them from losing their identities in the crowds as was often an issue with Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes where the make-up's limitations made themselves known in showcasing large ape crowds. But improved technology and aesthetics aside, I'd be absolutely remiss if I didn't lend praise to Andy Serkis' Caeser who creates a compelling three dimensional character almost exclusively through pantomime, facial expressions, and movement. Serkis is certainly no stranger to this kind of work having served as performer for Gollum and King Kong in Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings and King Kong adaptations respectively, and his performance as Caeser stands proudly alongside the level those two benchmarks achieved.As with any movie there are the occasional imperfections that keep it from greatness. In some cases Rise of the Planet of the Apes has maybe a few more human characters than it really needs such as Freida Pinto who is good in the role as a veterinarian and Will's love interest, but she's honestly such ancillary addition that her character feels like it could've been merged into Will's with little to no effort. We also have some occasional acting that borders on going over the tope such as Tom Felton who plays an over the top jerk whom we're supposed to hate (and says a few iconic lines from the original 1968 film that aren't glaring but feel an ill-fit here). None of these elements kneecap the movie or anything, but they do make themselves noticed.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is exactly the breath of new life this series needed after the troubled development and end result of the 2001 remake. While it has more than a few rough spots that could've been ironed out, it more than makes up for it with fleshed out characters, well realized visuals, and some impressive mo-cap work for the apes with Serkis' performance as Caeser central to why it succeeds.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sets a Solid Foundation for the Trilogy,"This entry pretty much just sets and lays the ground work for what's to come and it does it well for the most part minus a few folly's here and there in the plot which kind of raises an eyebrow at certain decisions made within the narrative. But other than that it's a very enjoyable flick with great performances from a pretty decent cast. Andy Serkis steals the show though as doing the motion capture work for Caesar. His performance only gets more and more robust with each entry in this Apes trilogy too. Plus besides like I said some plot holes and silly decisions being made throughout the film, the tale of how the whole thing started and where it's headed is intriguing and interesting enough to keep you invested throughout. Overall if there's and Apes trilogies or films I can suggest it would be to start with this one as it offers what likely becomes arguably the best Planet of the Apes trilogy to date.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Hail Caesar! (or) Monkey See? Monkey Do!,"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!In spite of its flaws (Yep. They were there), this Sci-Fi/Experiment-Gone-Haywire flick was definitely one of the better in its genre that I've seen in a mighty long-long time.It's certainly been eons since I've been this entertained and involved in a story of this one's nature.I was so pleased to find that, for once, I actually cared about the characters in this particular ""mad scientist"" story (especially that of Caesar, the ape).With its competent direction, good cast, top-notch CGI effects and, yes, its fairly intelligent and thoughtful screenplay, everything about this film came together very nicely as an impressive whole.From start to finish this film's story actually held my full attention and only on a couple of occasions did I feel as though the screenwriters were regarding me as if I were just a ""dumb ape"" when it came to its story-line's plausibility factor.I certainly have to give director Rupert Wyatt some well-deserved credit here for avoiding to get all caught up in so many of the clichéd and predictable pitfalls that seem to plague far too many of these super big-budget Sci-Fi pictures.I must honestly admit that I was very taken in by the Caesar character. At the point when Caesar saw a dog on a leash like his own (and he began to seriously question his own identity) was when I really started to pay close attention to his intricate and pivotal role in the overall success of this film's fairly involving story-line.Below are 3 of my biggest complaints against the story -(1) I could not believe that not even one of the scientists, especially Franklin, had any clue that the ape named ""Bright Eyes"" was pregnant.(2) I could not accept that at the age of 8 (as a young, adult ape) Caesar showed absolutely no apparent interest in finding a mate. (I guess he must have had too much else on his mind, eh?)(3) I thought that the overnight, smartening-up business of the apes and their decidedly over-the-top revolt on the Golden Gate Bridge was really carried just a little too far.Well, there you have it.Of course, none of my complaints, in any way, prevented me from enjoying this otherwise entertaining picture (which, when I first sat down to watch it, I was expecting it to royally suck).I liked the brief scene at the end of the story which showed us how the deadly ALZ-113 virus was transmitted so rapidly to humans all across the entire planet.With sequels to this film definitely in the making right now, I just hope that they don't flog this one to absolute death.P.S.Yes. I fully realize that apes and monkeys are not of the same genus, but, with that said, I went ahead and used the word ""monkey"" at the start of my review 'cause it seemed more fitting and sounded so much better than saying - ""Well, I'll be an ape's uncle!....

A great way to kick off the series,"I remember liking this one when I first watched it ten or so years ago but haven't returned to it since until today.I really enjoy how this film builds up Caesar as a character and the contrast with Franco's father suffering from alzheimer's disease becomes a nice parallel for the story to build on.Franco doesn't really sell the ""genius scientist"" vibe for me but he's fine overall throughout the film and his relationship with Caesar really works for me.The visual effects are of course a standout aspect in the film but I'd like to also give a shout out for the uplifting main theme from this film's score. The music in the film has a really strong identity and I think that deserves to be mentioned.All in all, it sets up the rest of the franchise really well and I'm looking forward to seeing them all now again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The scientists work for a super advanced lab but have no protocols at all in place for anything apparently? They barely monitor their researchers or research subjects? Franco might be desperate but he just shoots up his father with a drug he's tried once. On an ape? COME ON! They walk an ape around on a leash and no one has a problem with it? People get mad if you have the wrong kind of dog but an ape is ok? WTH!?Yeah, there's a lot good in here but there are so many little things that always just drive me nuts and feel like they invalidate a lot of what's happening.

Primates rising!,"After the disaster the remake of Planet of the Apes of 2001 was, a decade later this was the next try in order for the series to start again and this time paid of and we now have a trilogy of these films. This one and the two next take inspiration more from the latter film of the original series (mainly Conquest and Battle), which they weren't very good to be honest and did their own thing.In the story we follow the now iconic chimpanzee Ceasar from his early days to the beginning of the events that started to fall of our society. This start comes from a try of us to cure brain diseases ,but when tested to Apes ,it has the unexpected outcome of making them smart to a point that match a humans intelligence. In short this is both a prequel of the 1968 film and a remake of the how we ended with that society.In general what I praise of that film is how it tackles one of the most baffling problem of humanity, how would we treat a creature of similar or even equal intelligent level which doesn't fit our definition of what is a human or a clever being in general. And if you have seen a lot of sci-fi series and movies you may have noticed the uncanny similarities between the alien and us, this no coincidence and I don't have to mention the manner of the treatment we did to our fellow human when they were different from us.In general this how a remake should be done, both being faithful to the themes of the original and at same time doing it in a different way. Also there is and a third idea from my point f view, do remakes of films that weren't very good or they are now dated to a point they look ridiculous ,however they had an idea which could be used and make a great film, this film is a great example, the Thing of 1982 is also and the Fly of Croneberg.Overall is a very well made film and manage to introduce this franchise to the new generation and re-kindle the interest of the older fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Decent But Slightly Overrrated Film,"Rise of The Planet of The Apes is the first film in the new rebooted Planet of the Ape franchise. I am not that into Planet of The Apes. I had only seen the original before this. This movie is not as good as the original but it is still a well-made film regardless. I'm glad I saw it and am looking forward to the new film coming out next year.The film stars a scientist named Will Rodman (James Franco) trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer's because his father Charles (John Lithgow) has it. He starts by testing his new drug on apes and one of them does very well and is vastly more intelligent. Will tries to get the board to give him more funding but one of the apes goes out of control and gets killed. That ape was pregnant with a baby ape which Will adopts and names Caesar. Caesar inherited the drug from his mom so he becomes much more intelligent as he matures. However, he causes an accident and has to be put in an ape shelter. There he gradually befriends the other apes while getting treated horribly by the workers there. They eventually stage a revolt with Caesar as the leader.The film is well-made. The acting is good. I am a fan of James Franco as an actor. This is not his best performance that I've seen but he does a good job. The cg looks good in many places. The story is good and I think it is a decent start to a new franchise. It is taking what the original setup but doing something different. Instead of war paving the way for the takeover it is a virus caused by the drug James Franco's character invented. I thought that was a good way to distinguish itself. I thought the action at the end was fun and well executed, especially the scene on the bridge.This film does have some problems that do not ruin the film but are noteworthy. Firstly, the CGI of the apes, while very good in many spots, was very noticeable in some spots, especially the cg for Caesar. While the film is under two hours it feels longer. The pacing kind of drags in the middle. Aside from Will and Caesar none of the other characters are that interesting. They are very one note characters that mostly serve to make us feel bad for Caesar. Some characters had no business being there like Will's girlfriend Freida. Lastly the film is a bit too heavy-handed.The film is good but it is not something I would re-watch all the time. This is due to the fact that the film is sad throughout and it tries a bit too hard to pull on your heart strings. Again, the bad guys are very one-dimensional characters that are just there to advance the plot. This suffers from some of the problems Avatar suffered from, though this film is better.Another issue is the constant references and homages to the original Planet of the Apes. Whether it'd be uttering the classic lines or showing references like the space shuttle going to Mars. One or two callbacks are fine but six or more is not. A reboot should be able to stand on its own without drawing any references from the original movies.Overall, Rise of the Apes was a decent start to the new Apes franchise. The film is a bit heavy-handed, and some of its characters are quite bland. Despite that the film does have things that keep you invested. The acting is fine. James Franco and Andy Serkis as Caesar are good character you come to invest in. The action scenes at the end are fun to watch. The story is competent and I like this new angle this film takes on a classic story. If you like Planet of the Apes then you should check this out and the newest film coming if you like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The apes are back and they're as good as ever,"(76%) A smart in more ways than one big budget reboot that brings a new lease of life into an old and highly tapped classic series. And with the focus on character and plot, it's much more satisfying than most typical big blockbusters that will live on longer than two weeks after the DVD release. The cast overall is fine, and it's so great to see John Lithgow in anything as he's stupidly underused in Hollywood these days. I thought the direction was a prime example of rock-solid, none-shaky cam crap filmmaking, with everything framed as a proper big movie should.

May be the worst movie I have ever seen!,"I was and am a big fan of the original Planet of the Apes...Thought provoking...great acting..storyline...so i went to this movie with great anticipation thinking that 30 to 40 years of technology would add immeasurably to the movie...what i got instead was a movie, in my opinion was so bad, it was almost funny..funny except my wife and I spent $25 and 2 hours of time watching..and I certainly did not feel anybody watching it with me felt different so it just amazes me to see the high reviews this movie has gotten..I hate to overstate it but I really believe this movie would be on my top 10 worst films i have ever seen..It makes me think i was not watching the same film...",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not a time-waster at All!,"It was really entertaining and I consider it the best Planet of the Apes movie so far, but I can't go all excited about it as everyone seems to be! The story flows nicely but quite lamely; there is something missing about the development of events that I couldn't really spot. Caesar's transition from friendliness and meekness to anger and rebellion doesn't feel right. Maybe because the process was accelerated in some parts and intensified in others.. I don't really know! The movie again tackles the question of power, putting the master-slave paradigm to test in the hands of a highly intelligent ape who starts questioning his existence and relation to Mankind. There is some amazing performance in the movie, especially that of James Franco and John Lithgow. However, it's funny that the best performance is given by Caesar, played by Andy Serkis who managed to breathe more life into a CGI ape than any of the other cast members showed. All in all, I think Rupert Wyatt did a good job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Evolution becomes Revolution,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes starts and stops with the emotional-motion capture acting ability of Andy Serkis. He's a master of his trade, a pleasure to watch and what he does with the Caesar character is Oscar worthy, if it was legal to nominate him. He's the heart and soul of the film, and without him, the movie wouldn't be the same.I'm amazed how the apes look. It's a wonderful combination of special effects and motion capture. I love the growth in Caesar's personality, the boss daddy pimpness of Maurice and the bad assness of Koba. The action scenes with the apes are as thrilling as they come.For some strange reason, James Franco doesn't appear stoned or ready to cut off his arm. This is the soberest I've seen him. He's very likable, and his story arc makes sense. To me, he's one of the few humans with any depth. His girlfriend is just there. The bad people act like bad guys. John Lithgow is cool as Franco's Alzheimer's suffering father, but his development is predictable.I like how this movie doesn't wear out its welcome. A lot of times, origin stories tend to be overlong. I believe the runtime is just right, and does just enough, to set up the next film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes Review,"In an attempt to cure Alzheimer's a substance is designed that can increase the intelligence of any human or ape it comes in contact with.I remember watching this film when I was young but I didn't really remember specifics so I was excited to relive this film and see if it's as good as I've heard.What makes this film so good for me is Andy Serkis as Caesar. The film drags a fair bit until Caesar is established as the main character and from that point on I was enthralled in his story. Andy Serkis is the king of motion capture. His ability to act without any dialogue is incredible and big congrats to the CGI team that worked on this film. There were many times where I wasn't sure if I was looking at CGI or if it was a real ape which shows how well done the visuals were for this film.The rest of the cast are also good. James Franco is solid as the lead human character and John Lithgow is great as his father. As I said Caesar is what makes this film great which as a result makes any scene not involving him not as entertaining. That's not to say the human aspects of the film weren't well done but whenever an ape is on screen the film is at a whole other level.The story itself is quite interesting as we see Caesar grow and become increasingly intelligent, but also the background development of this virus is quite interesting and really becomes relevant during the mid credit scene.Overall this film is great. Andy Serkis brings an extremely intriguing ape to life in a well written sci-fi drama.8.5/10

Not Worth The Actual Time To Develop,"When I saw the trailer for this film I could not wait for it to be released. On August 4th (the release date), I went to see it and was severely disappointed as it was not true to the original 1968 film. I found it was under budget, cheap and hard to follow in some parts. It was interesting, however, that the director put in some strange symbolism into the film, but this just made it more confusing as it just didn't make you follow the storyline. One thing that infuriated my were the actors. David Oyelowo (Jacobs) was definitely the weak-link in this film as he had a strange and unsuitable English accent that just did not suit the American country. Freida Pinto (Caroline) had the same deal as she had that annoying Cockney accent that just doesn't work in an American movie.Rupert Wyatt (the Director of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes) has only ever directed three other movies before this and it really shows in this, what seems cheap and tacky, film. The storyline didn't develop properly and we all know what was going to happen anyway, hence the title ""RISE of the Planet of the Apes"". I believe that when they made this movie they took there own spin on the storyline a little bit, but then again added bits from the original description of how this all formed (Escape from the Planet of the Apes). Some of the dialog was good but the majority of it was corny and badly written.I am a hardcore Sci-Fi fan and I loved all of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" films (excluding the 2001 remake), but overall I think this movie could have done a lot better if it had a more experienced director (i.e. Steven Spielburge) and better actors. The writer should be sacked for life and never show his face again and the design artist should be congratulate for being able to stand all this horrible commotion. I rate this film 2/5. - Michael Radny",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Great Sci-Fi Film,"This film has an inherently weird concept - James Franco raises an intelligent ape until it rebels against humankind - yet it somehow manages to be endearing regardless. Some of the characters are pretty cookie-cutter for this type of film, but I think it's Andy Serkis' Caesar who is the best part of this film. I actually bought a lot of the emotional moments between him and James Franco. The effects on Caesar have also aged really well, and you have to admire Serkis' commitment to his roles. The action is well choreographed and the story, while a tad far fetched at points, has a strong emotional centre to it that I really liked. All of the performances are good and the music also fits the film really well. My favourite element is probably the pacing - at only 100 odd minutes (without credits) the film never overstays its welcome, and every scene felt completely necessary to the overall story. Overall, whilst not the best in it's genre, this has set up the future films really well as well as standing up on its own as a great film, and one I would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Just A Bad Film, Period","Rise of the Apes is a convoluted mess that has received unwarranted praise simply because people seem to be studying the CGI monkeys and are forgetting that they are suppose to tell a story at the same time. It's true that's it's a disturbing story but it's more disturbing that it's presented in this fashion and people think of it as entertainment. Are some critics in the can for this one? Why else would they praise this crap?The movie and the concept are as ridiculous as one might expect. I mean, not just bad but actually laughably ridiculous. This ""smart"" monkey revolt would've and could've been put down easily and when a film crosses that believability line, it never comes back. I guess we had to get to the start of ""The Planet of the Apes"" somehow but they hammer it home in such a brainless fashion that maybe the writers of this film need smart serum. The first two acts are poorly paced but if you like a final act where fake looking chimps and gorillas break stuff then this is your movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great CGI do not a good film make.,"To see reviewers say ""the most emotional planet of the apes film"" or ""a masterpiece"" makes me wonder if they have seen a different film to me.Firstly, I must admit, I am a huge fan of the original films, when I say original, i do not mean the Tim Burton catastrophe of 2001, but he original series of films.What those films had and what set the apes franchise apart, was strong scripts, extensive plots, social messages, and plenty of twists. Rise of planet of the apes, sadly has none of those.The storyline, is basic at best, for the first half an hour it felt like a Disney movie, as they explained the blatantly obvious to the viewers. They almost completely fail to explore the characters, James Franco's relationship with Pinto, his relationship with his father, even his relationship with Cesar seem barely explored. Jacobs seems to flit from bad guy to good guy quicker than you can say Jacobs. And the lab tech, who was so memorable I cant even remember his name, what happened there, are we supposed to care about his fate, did the other characters in the movie even care about his fate? Is it a good film? Its OK, it really has very little to do with Planet of the Apes and probably shouldn't even say Planet of the Apes in the title. The plot is pretty thin and the whole film feels like its missing about 30 minutes of background and relationship scenes. That said, it was tedious and slow enough for the first hour without the extra scenes. The CGI is great, although claims that Cesar is the greatest moment of cgi in cinema history are well off the mark. Its good, but most of the time its pretty obvious its cgi.Is it better than the Tim Burton film, the jury's out. Is it better than the original films, no chance.Plus Points: Great CGI Downsides: Formulaic plot, no character development",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

With their swift movements, aggressive behavior, and strong defenses and ideas, the apes seemed to have practically become smarter than the human being itself. The movements of the apes were very well done, especially thanks to Andy Serkis. Ceaser was a very well designed CGI ape (as well as the other apes). A good start, a fairly well middle, and a triumphant end to the film. A very neat action cut and a good watch overall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Caesar Rules,"43 Years back, a distant war horn scared the living daylights out of us. It was 1968, when moviegoers across the globe were amazed by the post apocalyptic concept put forth by the sci-fi original 'Planet of the Apes'. Now in 2011, the franchise is getting a reboot as 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', directed by Rupert Wyatt starring James Franco and Frieda Pinto.The movie tells us the story of Caesar, an ape with a superior intellect and the revolution he initiates. This movie is an origin story unlike the Original version. It creates a platform, from scratch, for a number of sequels to come.Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist, who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease by performing tests on apes. The first test subject is a chimpanzee, named Caesar whose mother had been captured in Africa. Rodman's ""cure"" not only repairs brain cells as they expected to, but it genetically modifies Caesar's way of thinking to create a new breed of ape with human-like intelligence.The movie explains the whole transition in a linear way without any confusing, thought-provoking grandfather paradox. The movie, at times, starts to feel like just another B-movie, but there are moments that make it worth a watch. There are several nods to the original movie in 'Rise of Planet of the Apes'. For Instance, the launch of the space shuttle 'Icarus' is shown on TV at the facility (which was actually the mother ship shown in 'Planet of the Apes'). The over-hyped one liner ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape"" is in this one as well. And its right before Caesar does. (Oops, Sorry No Spoilers!). A well-thought parallel starter to total human annihilation is also mentioned in the movie.Rupert Wyatt's direction is excellent. CGI by Weta is Top notch. Andy Serkis once again wears an Ape Motion Track Suit to play Caesar. Weta uses their state of the art technology to give the primates emotions and physical details as like we have never experienced before. Sound Design is brilliant and so is the Cinematography.by Mahesh Ravi Editor www.movierecycle.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good fun,"Not as bad as I expected it to be...The apes never really give you the feeling that you are looking at real apes. All apes seem to have drunk to much coffee, they are all constantly agitated. There is not a lot of dept in the movie although it seems that they've tried a little bit. Don't expect good acting and emotional moments. You wont develop any feeling for any of the characters. But the story is fun and the movie has some good action scenes. It's obvious that the makers are not trying to convince you that this could really happened. All they want to do is give you a fun experience. And in that they succeed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Really good,"A very well-made introduction to the franchise and sets the mood for the subsequent sequels. The humanization of the apes are so good that you actually end up taking sides against your own species. The ending, although satisfying, leaves you wanting more. On top of that, this is a really clever allegory for an enslaved people achieving a national concsioussnes and revolting against their owners.Of course, it has plot holes here and there and the ending may feel a bit abrupt. But the film has abundant action and has you sitting at the edge of your seat at many times. The pacing is incredible, it never makes you feel disengaged with the story. Overall, this is a very good action movie with well-thought characters that easily makes up for its cons using its pros. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One of the best animal upbringing movies since the lion king,"This movie has a lot more substance than you might think it does going into it. In this film we follow a protagonist named Caesar who is taken in by a human to be taken care of. Caesar (the ape) eventually leaves his owner where he finds himself among his own kind. This relates to one of the best parts about this film which is watching Caesar develop as a character. It becomes very easy to sympathize with him due to the series of events and consequences he faces throughout the film. This sympathy that's built for Caesar makes his upbringing that much more satisfying. In the beginning of the film you could take a guess as to where it might be headed, but near the end you'll be chanting for the apes to succeed in their expedition. Going from sentimental touching scenes to awesome actions sequences, this movie will keep you engaged all the way through. Overall a great first installment to the modern planet of the ape's films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A new opportunity for the Apes.,"""Planet of the Apes"" is a formula that has been subject of several film adaptations since it was created by Pierre Boulle. But this film manages to give a new and different look to the story, especially considering the disappointment that was Tim Burton's version. The action takes place on our planet and the apes are our laboratory chimpanzees, around which a story is developed that addresses topics such as the use of animals in scientific experiments, genetic mutation, human action on nature, revenge, evolution etc. Strong themes indeed, in an intense and emotional script. Cinematography and sets are also excellent, even if CGI is sometimes quite obvious and spoils things a little. The work of the actors is good and, from the vast cast, we must highlight the excellent performances of James Franco and Freida Pinto (an actress whose origins are likely to go back to the former Portuguese colony of Goa, judging by her Portuguese surname). Overall, its the most interesting and positive film made over the original Boulle story, having an ending that allows us to anticipate future sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Flimsy script, stock characters and ape CGI galore","I am surprised Rise of the Planet of the Apes raised so much excitement for so many viewers. Maybe it looks original or fashionable nowadays to have a hero from a dominated species confronting our economically violent human world. Like Avatar, this would be Disney with a (not too profound) message.As for the movie itself, it's genuinely boring.James Franco plays the perfectly bland cutesy but single (living home with daddy) scientist with a conscience. Experiments going bad because of greedy research corporations is nothing new, it has been done nicely umpteen times, and this time it's only a basic setting with no substance.Apes are good, OK, but not when they are shown a-moving around in the air, across trees or buildings: movements are linear (something know as the conveyor-belt effect for CGI-enhanced elements moving on ground level), there is simply not the right amount of acceleration. Now the most interesting part of the whole movie is in the refuge, but even then the storyline is far from good. Intercuting with James Franco's nice boy's life prevents the tension from building up, and anyway the refuge wardens are such worn-out stock characters that it cheapens the whole sequence.Icebox logic last: when a film is that bad, you're bound to have the time to think how stupid the whole story is. I can take the premise that a drug will help brain-cells regenerate and that apes can thus become as intelligent as humans in the blink of an eye. Scientifically this is stupid, but when you go to the movies there is the famed suspension of disbelief which the viewer offers to the movie-makers and it works when the movie do delivers. Now I wrote about clichés, yet they can be funny, if only the movie doesn't aim to be dead-serious (or doesn't take funny for granted in a spoof). But the story of Rise of the Planets of the Apes really goes nowhere. In the end the staging of the great battle Apes Vs. Humans is ridiculous. There is no sense of immediacy, so it feels dumb that only a dozen cops and one chopper confront the Apes hours after they stormed the city (yes they do take the time to visit SF, they're not just moving rapidly to leave the city).The screenwriter here certainly didn't get brain-enhancing drugs. This movie is much less interesting than Conquest of the Planet of the Apes which was already a low-budget mediocre prequel-sequel. But the script somewhat helped to forget most of the movie took place with actors-dressed-as-apes walking on a concrete 70s plaza, whereas here the big budget, good and bad CGI, only makes the flimsy script hurting more",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
All-in-all a very good and entertaining movie,"Rupert Wyatt makes this film very interesting and enjoyable, we get a good introduction to both the human side, tests, compassion and treatment, but also the apes side and the changes and neglect that leads up to the events.This is a very entertaining prequel to the franchise, I also liked the one from 2001, but this is a better introduction/beginning to the adventure and a very realistic one also. This has some great CGI and it all seem very real and very emotional, you can easily follow both sides as they try to amend or fight for their believes.The acting is great, the CGI very convincing, the scenery very nice and the story works very well, this is all-in-all a very good and entertaining movie, can be watched for the story, the action, the cgi and much more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Very entertaining,"When the first few minutes of this film began, I was under the impression that the character development was going to be weak, the storyline underdeveloped and filled with gaps, and that I had been duped into watching a famous-because-of-it's- predecessor film. While I may have doubted any substantial character interaction between a cgi ape and it's male owner, and while there may have been some gaps in the early and foundation-laying parts of the film, I actually left the theatre pleasantly surprised.I don't know what I was expecting going in, but I have to admit that the cgi ape threw me off just a bit. What I was more surprised with was the depth of character that was played by a silent ape. From Inherited intelligence at birth to leader of an ape rebellion, from solving puzzles to sign language, from living at home to adapting to live with his own kind, the ape's development is quite remarkable. Sharing the lead role with James Franco (which I also did not expect), the role of Ceasar played by the ape is remarkable.James Franco, on the other hand, plays an almost secondary role to Ceasar. His character stays mostly flat for the entire film. The interaction between him and his out-of- the-blue-acquired-girlfriend is so light and frivolous that I can't even remember her name. However, I felt that the motivation for this researcher's (played by Franco) work was set up very well. There are moments of passion, but all in all, little development.While I felt as if I was put on a bullet train for the first few scenes of the movie, being rushed through Ceasar's early life and development, in retrospect, the story slowed down for the more important parts of the story. What was most critical to the story was the ape's journey from living with humans, to adapting to live with his own kind; from childhood innocence to the harsh reality of life.Lastly, I thought the connections to The Planet of the Apes was great. There are several starting with the ape characters themselves, to apes riding horseback, to fire hoses, etc.. As with any prequel, this adds another dimension of interest.To sum it up, this movie is very entertaining, centring around the character of Ceasar. Any shortcomings in plot lag, or flat acting are made up in the overall flow of the story. I would recommend this movie to anyone, including families as there is no swearing (that I remember), or sex, or drugs of any kind. Although if you are uncomfortable with some animal cruelty, be warned.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Modern Technical Effects Make Movie Magic That Wasn't Possible In 1968,"Somewhere out there in 2011, there was a guy that saw 'Planet Of The Apes' (1968) in the theater, back when Lyndon Johnson was President and no one had air conditioning. It was this guys favorite movie. He bought the posters, and wore a monkey costume on Halloween. So, he saw all the sequels, and lived his life, and now he's in his later years. For that guy, this must have been the greatest movie of all time. The effects make something possible that just couldn't have happened in 1968.For me, I don't like watching humans be mean to animals, as a way to manipulate an audience for 90 minutes of big-budget 'entertainment'.

a successful reboot that firmly establishes the mythos of the Apes' franchise in an updated and modern setting,"Led by Andy Serkis as the talking ape Caesar and James Franco as Dr. Will, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a successful reboot that firmly establishes the mythos of the Apes' franchise in an updated and modern setting. Despite the short running time, the character development is strong enough to present proper motivations and a moving story. Caesar grows from a household pet to a strong leader. He seeks acceptance in humanity's world, but upon realizing the cruelty to which his fellow apes are subjected, Caesar uses his intellect to free his people and leads them on a separate and self-made destiny. Caesar's character overall growth is coming to terms with him being part human in terms of intellect and part ape in terms of physical appearance. The writing does justice to the character by presenting it organically. Andy Serkis' tortured performance demonstrates yet again why he is king of motion capture acting.While Rise is ultimately about Caesar, the human co-lead, Dr. Will, is equally important to the story. Will is Caesar's owner, living with a father who suffers from Alzheimer's. His character aims betterment by curing his father and raising Caesar. Unintentionally, his goals are what would separate Caesar from him. Through Will, much of the story and inner politics is anchored. Behind all the character work is a thematic backdrop on the ethics of biomedical engineering, corporate greed, and animal cruelty. David Oyelowo and Tom Felton are effective villains representing the corporate greed and animal cruelty themes of the movie. Rise is filled more with character interactions than action scenes but of the few of them, all are heart-pounding and in line with the characters' journey. The climax is a clear demonstration that apes were equal to humans, battling the security forces without firearms and coming out victorious.Serkis' performance wouldn't have been done right without excellent CGI. If Caesar was all CGI, the emotional connection to the character wouldn't be so firm and ingrained to the audience. The direction from Rupert Wyatt is also really impressive. The technical aspects are on point. Rise only really needed to be much longer and drawn out. The sequels have done this, which is why they are better but does not negate how good of a movie Rise still is.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Out of the entire series of Planet of the Apes, I think this one really showed us some gold. It was just spectacular!Yes, this film had a lot of great CGI. I am not a huge fan for special effects but if I had no idea the apes were all done by CGI experts, they could have fooled. The apes looked real! The actors delivered fine performances for their well developed characters, I personally loved James Franco's performance. The writers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, did not miss any information with their fantastic and intelligent script, the characters were wonderfully developed. The story was compelling, exciting and emotionally touching. I was able to really connect with the apes.Overall, this film had me connected and concerned from the second it had begun. Great acting!

Chimpin' ain't easy.,"By virtue of nothing more than being the Blu ray on top of my box of Blu rays I decided to rewatch ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" yesterday. It's not a film I can watch very often, as the first half induces so much anxiety, but the second half is a fun catharsis.Desperate to restore his father (John Lithgow) from the Alzheimer's that is taking him away, scientist Will (James Franco) develops a target virus, designed to restore brain function. His testing comes to a stop when his lead Chimpanzee 'Bright Eyes' breaks free and is killed. He discovers that 'Bright Eyes' had a son, Caesar (Andy Serkis) and takes him home. Caesar shows extraordinary intelligence, inherited from his mother's exposure to the virus. However, the same virus has a different effect on humans.Much to admire about this. Performances are good, aside from the previously mentioned actors there's Brian Cox, Tom Felton, Freida Pinto and David Oyelowo. The main event though is the excellent work on the CGI chimpanzees that a truly flawless work. Andy Serkis, king (Kong) of the motion capture suit returns here to play lead chimpanzee Caesar. Weta really are the best visual effects studio going now. It also looks great in general, with huge wide shots of the Bay Area.I don't particularly enjoy the first half of the film, as I know that it's a cavalcade of animal suffering and emotional betrayal. All of which see Caesar end up in an ape's enclosure, tortured by Tom Felton's character. The second half though, with the elevation of Caesar to Ape Moses is a brilliant and emotional time - even if perhaps it's not as big a conclusion as a true summer blockbuster generally has.It sets a table for the films to come well, as well as being solid enough in and of itself and still, ovr a decade later, a technical marvel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Refreshingly Excellent,"I was a little worried when I decided to watch this movie. Most movies lack plot, character development, and most of all care. After watching the movie, I left feeling that there are still people out there that care about making movies and are not out there to make a buck off of a franchise.One thing that I love about this movie is its pacing. It takes its time showing the growth of Caesar and showing his interactions with people. The movies spans a couple of years and shows changes in most of the lead characters. At no point did it feel rushed, and it never tried to throw too much storyline at once to try to tie up loose ends or to just bridge action.This leads to my one complaint of the movie. If it were a rated R movie it could have been amazing. That fact that the humans were killing the apes on screen but the apes would never kill a human, besides the one ""villain"" of the movie. Don't dumb down violence to get a PG-13 rating. People are just too sensitive now.Still, it was a great movie. Good: Strong Acting, Great Story, Good pacing, good use of CGI. Bad: Violence is only towards the apes.Great movie and good use of the ending credits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best one I've ever seen,"Made me cry a few times during the film. I just love this Film. Good direction and good music which makes the film enjoyable. The scenes are emotional and shows the truth of behaving with animals which some humans do to animals. There is a message in the film which says animals are sick of humans they want to be free but the thing is they do not know how to be free and if they had this intelligent to make a plan they would make their own empire so stop bothering animals. If anybody loves animals will love this film too. A very effective film which shows the relation between a pet and it's owner. I've watched this film twice and I still want to watch it again, I would strongly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Truly Impressive,"I just left the movie theater and am still buzzing with excitement after seeing this movie. I will definitely be seeing it again. This movie is an awesome remake of the prequel to the Planet of the Apes. It is very tightly written, well acted and directed with great flare. The story moves along at a break neck pace, with many incredible action sequences. Not only is it a special effects extravaganza, but the movie never loses focus on the emotions of the characters, especially the apes. It is the emotional engagement that makes this movie a true success, the amazing special effects are just icing on the cake. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie created with such incredible pride. The artists involved deserve an academy award for their efforts. I eagerly await this directors next movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
We partially lose what makes the magic of 'live-action',"A rather lively and pleasant narration. Some good ideas like this particular shape of window that Caesar has in his room and which he will draw in captivity to remember this happy past.The limit of the film is perhaps its fundamental artificiality, illustrated by the massive importance of digital technology in the representation of all the apes. It's not badly done in itself but it is ostensibly false, and we partially lose what makes the magic of 'live-action', of the reconstitution of reality in film form, of the flesh which lives on the screen, in opposition to animation films for example.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Thought I knew the answer.,"Having seen all the Ape movies, I assumed I knew how the Apes came to rule. Maybe I missed it before but don't think so. Not until the credits rolled did I appreciate the subtle reminders inserted of the previous Ape movies. For instance, the news story about the manned mission to Mars and its failure. An ape holding in its hand a small piece of the Statue of Liberty. These and others created flashbacks for me to the very first movie. Kudos to the Director, Writers, etc, for the surprise of my life! What a brilliant ending! I feel sorry for the movie goers that walked out as the credits started rolling. If you have seen the movie and stayed you know exactly what I'm talking about.

Another film that exceeded my expectations,"Those who like to refer to the golden age of the old Planet of the Apes movies should be forced to go back and watch them. The first one was a classic, though it's aged badly. The subsequent ones got worse and worse until they reached the point of being unwatchable. Burton's remake was marginally better but an unnecessary exercise.Because of the diminishing returns of the old Apes movies I had no intention of ever watching the Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Indeed the fact that it was promoted as a CGI-fest was enough to deter me as I believe CGI to be responsible for some of the worst excesses of modern cinema. However, it was a rainy afternoon, I had nothing better to do and I found myself watching ""Rise of.."" etc., expecting I'd be bailing out within the first few minutes. To my surprise I watched it to the end and I enjoyed it.This isn't some fiendishly clever film with lots of plot twists and top notch dialogue but it is a decent version of the hero's journey, with our hero being Caesar the ape. The characters, human and simian, are well developed on the whole and there's an emotional core to the film. Thankfully it isn't an action-fest though the showdown at the end is well done. The CGI is obvious, especially when you have scenes with masses of apes, but it's acceptable in this type of movie.There's no point in whining about plot holes and believability – look, apes get intelligent and they take over the planet and you're expecting the story to be believable? Go and read a history book or two if that's what you're looking for. This film is better than I was expecting and it's a decent enough attempt to make a fun film with a few philosophical questions thrown in if you are inclined to think about them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Extremely Well-Made and Thoughtful,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)*** (out of 4)Intelligent and extremely well-made reboot of the Apes franchise has James Franco playing a scientist doing experiments on apes. He's trying to create a drug that cures the brain and soon realizes that the experiment works but there are certain side effects. After the project is shut down he sneaks home a baby ape, named Caesar, and over time this ape's intelligence begins to grow at a fast rate. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty surprising ""Summer Blockbuster"" because it's not just all action and no brains. In fact, it's actually the opposite because there's really not any action until the very end and the majority of everything else is developing the characters and certain Caesar. I must admit that I'm a little shocked this film is going over so well with current audiences because it seems most blockbusters of today just have loud action scenes with very little sense thrown in. I was very shocked to see how much time they actually give to Caesar and his growth into a smart human. It's not like his growth simply happens in the first thirty-minutes and then we're off to the races in terms of action. Instead, nearly 90-minutes is delivered to him, his way of life and the changes that happen which force him to become a leader. I thought the early scenes of him as a bad were incredibly funny and touching and especially the stuff between he and Franco. These early scenes really built up a touching father-son relationship and there's even a very nice section with Franco's father (John Lithgow) who is suffering from Alzheimer's. I thought the film took a very serious look at all of their relationships and this much character development certainly isn't the norm for this type of movie. Another major plus are all the small things thrown in that really leads up to Caesar's knowledge once the revolt begins. The performances are another major plus with Franco turning in a very believable job. There's not a second that you don't believe him as this great scientist and I thought he did a remarkable job acting with the CGI Caesar. The two of them really manage to build up a great relationship and this is really impressive on Franco's part since he wasn't really ""acting"" with anyone. Lithgow is also very good in his role as are Brian Cox and Freida Pinto. I'm not a fan of CGI but I must admit that the effects here were very impressive. I thought the human quality they were able to bring to Caesar was something quite remarkable and I enjoyed how the supporting apes really did come off as apes and each of them had their own personality. The only time the CGI was ugly would be in an early sequence inside Franco's house when Caesar is running around and this scene is used to show him growing. When the action finally does happen it's very well handled but the fear of what's the come is what really stands out. There's no question that this here is just a build-up for the eventually sequel (and remake) and I must admit that I can't wait. Kudos to everyone involved for delivering something with a brain.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pretty fun and entertaining popcorn movie,"An emotional ape film about the rise of a chimp named Caesar. It was pretty fun. To the extent that you wouldn't expect to care about apes and the movie makes you side with them over humans, this is a fairly powerful film. Underlying the drama and action are common issues like animal rights, domestication, and controversial ethics with bio-engineering that could have adverse effects on humans and animals, and therefore backfire.Overall, it's a good movie and I liked the end. Some scenes are really impressive and well done, but others are very cliché. The plot itself is fairly generic: science experiment gone wrong, advanced mutation/evolution in animal, counteractive contagious disease affects humans, animal displays superhuman strength and ability. That was the only major disappointment, all things considered, knowing the kind of movie it was. I thought the plot would be something different, even if only slightly tweaked, compared to other movies with a similar experiment gone wrong origin story.It's definitely not boring, goes by pretty fast, and was worth the watch. Have fun watching Caesar rise with his ape pals, especially the lovable orangutan and self-sacrificing gorilla savior, and be surprised when emotional apes can get you teary eyed.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" remains a captivating and well-executed film","Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" remains a captivating and well-executed film upon revisiting it, showcasing impressive special effects that have stood the test of time.

"Went in with good expectations, came out being blown away with a great movie","This was a fantastic movie. If you have seen the original Planet of the Apes then you know that haven't made a good one since; until this one came out. This movie is emotional, powerful, and not a dull moment in it. From the first scene to the last it was a complete and flawless story. Bravo to the director, Rupert Wyatt, for not trying to go over the top or make this a ridiculous story with too much happening at once so that the audience could't follow. Without saying too much more of this brilliant picture, it probably in my eyes rivals Harry Potter as the best movie of the summer and probably the year so far. And that's saying a lot because I love Harry Potter. The last bit of applause that I must give is to the star-stunning performance of CGI specialist Andy Serkis, who is better known for his role as Gollum in the Lord of the Ring's trilogy.

Disappointing sequel considering cast and budget,"Missed this in theatres-and I'm relieved I didn't go. I kept waiting for the humans to propel the story from the establishment of the apes' story at the beginning. It can be hard to relate to motion-captured 'acting' as there is a residual unrealness to the apes' closeups revealing realistic but not actual eyes. Still they really tried hard in that regard, just not always a bullseye.It was the lack of the three leads being able to reveal their underlying emotions as not enough time was spent on them. For instance, when John Lithgow dies, the scene was a throw-away one with a brief shot of Franco and Pinto dressed to suggest a funeral. Their glance at Lithgow's book didn't allow them time to have a few lines revealing their characters' thoughts, leaving the audience to get an emotional tie only to the apes - a missed opportunity at something deeper. The leads are capable of much more than was offered them; I wish the two producer/writers and director had noticed that in the rough cut.Also, the film is devoid of any humor; just some quick references to past films' dialogue.With too much reliance on special effects and lack of human motivation in response to the apes' 'rise,' and the actual finale taking place after the producer and director credits, when a paying audience usually is exiting the theatre, an unsatisfying feeling to the whole production becomes dominant.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Better and wiser than expected,"Frequently sequels or imitations or take-offs or whatever the designator you choose of famous older movies prove to be ho-hum to poor. If that is the thought about RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES then give this film a chance. It has a lot of nuances we don't expect from movies of this genre – introducing the concept of genetic therapy, for example – in addition to the fact that it has a superb cast on both extremes of the animal spectrum!The principal player is Caesar (beautifully enacted by Andy Serkis at the later age and by Terry Notary in the early phase), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from the experimental drug ALZ 112, a drug that causes neurogenesis, which allows the brain to grow new brain cells (something that doesn't happen after birth) and heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to the eyes. Raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco in a very fine, sensitive role) and a primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned in an ape sanctuary in San Bruno. Seeking justice for his fellow inmates, Caesar gives the fellow apes the same drug that he inherited. He then assembles a simian army and escapes the sanctuary - putting man and ape on a collision course with dire possibilities.Blended into this story are some fine subplots and the presence of such excellent actors as John Lithgow, Brian Cox, David Oyelowo among others. The screenplay was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver whose ideas came form the Pierre Boulle novel, 'La planète des singes'. The direction is in the sure hands of Rupert Wyatt and of course considerable credit is due to the special effects and costume/makeup crew.

To me this film is a prequel to the 2001 planet of the apes (mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter) because its like this is the start of the planet earth becoming a planet run by apes and at the end of the 2001 version when mark Wahlberg's character captain Leo Davidson lands back on earth the planets run by apes but they have learnt to act, talk and walk like humans. i just feel another film between them two will make the story connect together.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This new film is a modern adaptation that also serves as a prequel to the 5 original classics. This film has great animated computer graphics and has the best of it in quite some time. I enjoyed the action but the great thing is the subtext of animal rights cruelty that brings heart to the center of the story and makes you understand what happens ultimately.

A little King kong, a little Frankenstein, a great adding to the Planet of the Apes franchise and I thank them for also paying many homages to the original films in the dialogue and script.

"A Thoughtful, Deliberate Elaboration on Forgotten Themes","A very smart, sensible way to reboot the franchise, enriching the legacy left by the originals while paving the way for fresher material. It does struggle through a few minor glitches - some terribly forced one-liners and a stereotypical redneck jailer spring to mind - but at heart it's a bright, challenging take that takes its time, delivers a few powerful moments of revelation, and doesn't look or act like your typical CGI-driven action dump. James Franco has shown more versatility in previous leading roles, but his character in Apes is intended to be about as straightforward and vanilla as it gets, so that's precisely what he delivers. The real focus is on the apes themselves, anyway, with whom the picture treads lightly amidst some very tricky material. It often toes the line between excess and believability, but never gives in fully to temptation and emerges as a far better film for exercising caution. An intriguing take on material that everyone already assumed they understood, it opens the door wide to further investigation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
computerized graphics cannot put soul into these apes,"Amazing how many times can Hollywood try to squeeze the idea that triggered in 1968 the 'Planet of the Apes' series. The original film starred Charlton Heston and led to four sequels in the few years after its original release. A remake by Tim Burton with Mark Wahlberg in the lead role was made one decade ago. And now we have 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' which in my humble opinion is technically sophisticated but lacks much of the quality and ideas on which the original films were based.The evil human origins of the world dominated by apes were the nuclear apocalypse in the original film. The new evil role is nowadays taken by genetics research and medical corporations. Experiments on apes for a drug that can heal the Alzheimer disease go wrong and one smart ape triggers a revolution. The family-adopts-ape plot is extremely simplistic and not much complex then in scores of films and TV shows we have seen in the last few decades. Even so the film which is directed by Rupert Wyatt feels much longer than its 105 minutes.'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is certainly technically amazing. The imaging technique used already in such films as the 'Lord of the Rings' series or in 'Avatar' allows human actors to dress into fantastic shapes while keeping expressiveness and emotions. Here this technique is brilliantly used to create the main chimpanzee character (Caesar) and the crowd of apes, each gaining individual traits. Unfortunately the more sophisticated the technique and the virtual characters the less expressive are the human ones. There is not too much talent to be wasted in the characters of the scientist played by James Franco or his girlfriend played by Freida Pinto, and the best human performance is given by John Lithgow as the Alzheimer disease-stricken father.It is said that 'Rise of the Planet of Apes' is the smarter entertaining film of the summer. I can only imagine how bad must be the other. You can certainly lie back in the chair, and enjoy the popcorn and the apes. Not much more.

It's pretty amazing how a film like this can get the viewer to turn so quickly on their own race!,"'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four Stars (Out of Five)Prequel/reboot to the 1968 classic science fiction film 'PLANET OF THE APES'. This film tells the origin story of how apes originally evolved and started an uprising against the human race. It's sort of a remake of the fourth film in the original 'PLANET OF THE APES' series, 1972's 'CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' (since that film went back in time and told a similar story) but it's more of a fresh reboot to a totally new series than anything else. It was directed by Rupert Wyatt and written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who have experience in the sci-fi/horror genre co-writing films like 1997's 'THE RELIC' and 1992's 'THE HAND THAT ROCKED THE CRADLE'). The film is full of spectacular visual effects (but surprisingly wasn't released in 3D) and is a much more satisfying re-imagining than Tim Burton's 2001 remake.James Franco stars as Will Rodman, a scientist working for a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company. Will is hard at work trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, motivated by his father Charles (John Lithgow) who is a victim of it. He's testing a new drug out on lab apes and one shows remarkable promise. When the ape goes crazy defending it's baby, that no one knew she was pregnant with, all the apes are ordered put down and the experiment is canceled. Will secretly takes the baby home with him and continues doing tests on it. His father bonds with it and names it Ceaser (he's played as an adult by Andy Serkis, through motion capture filming). What Will and Charles don't know is that Caesar will one day lead his fellow apes in a rebellion and when he's sent to an ape holding facility the world as we know it is forever changed. Freida Pinto (of 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' fame) co-stars as a veterinarian Will falls for.The CGI is breathtaking, it's finally gotten to a point where the creatures they bring to life on screen look much more real than actors in costumes do. That's one of the ways this is far superior to Burton's 'ape' film. Serkis's performance is outstanding and he brings a lot of heart to the film through it. Lithgow also gives a 'heart tugging' performance but Pinto is wasted here. She's proved she can act as well as look stunningly beautiful but with this the filmmakers obviously just wanted her to look pretty. Her character is not developed at all and pretty much the only point of her even being there is to fill the void of a human female presence. Franco is good and relatable at times but he's done better work (he's also done worse though). Brian Cox, David Oyelowo and Tom Felton (of 'HARRY POTTER' fame) all make great antagonists (especially Felton, which he's now beginning to be typecast as). One of the biggest strengths of the film is how much it makes you loath the humans and root for the apes. Besides Franco, Lithgow and Pinto none of the other humans in the film are very likable and the rest of the human population is portrayed as pretty hateful and morally deprived. It's pretty amazing how a film like this can get the viewer to turn so quickly on their own race. The rebellion of the film is very involving and impressively built up to (but it plays a pretty small part of the actual film). There's almost nothing more satisfying in my opinion than watching tormented victims get the upper hand on their oppressors. This is where the film really works (Wyatt really did a good job directing the film in that way). The writing and acting is decent as well but it's the emotional build up and striking visuals that really make the film worth while. If you're a fan of the series you'll almost definitely enjoy this new installment.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nse6Wm1EtZU",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"One of the Best Movies of All Time - Equal to the original ""Planet of the Apes,"" Better than the original ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""","As a child, I was a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies. They are EXACTLY what science fiction was meant to be. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" is a perfect 10 in my book. If memory serves, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a little lame, but as a set, the original movies were amazing. I was lost pondering the way out of their looping-cause-and-effect world. These movies got us all thinking about animal rights, religion versus science, nuclear war and the fact that we COULD accidentally destroy the planet. The remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" was a disappointment, so I went to see the new ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" with low expectations and WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY! This movie is a re-imagining of the original story, not a remake, so it is very fresh, incorporating current science and highlighting a new and different potential apocalypse for humanity to worry about. It is a completely new story that totally understands and and honors the first. The ""echos"" from the original were so perfect they caused the audience to gasp in unison--and yes, I probably cried. What may be less obvious to movie goers was that the writers also honored and lifted themes and scenes directly from real-life cases of Apes who lived with Humans for a time (as pets or for science). I am referring to the cases of Nim Chimpsky and of Lucy (two chimps raised in homes to see if they would learn language). Both made great strides in language learning, had strong friendship with their caretakers, eventually became too hard to control, and well . . . it didn't end well for either of these chimps. There is a movie called ""Nim Chimpsky"" and an NPR story on ""Lucy."" Check those out after you see this movie. So, I will leave it to other reviewers to tell you how great the action and cinematography was. I was too lost in the heart-rending story: Yes, you will be totally cheering for the Apes when they break out to wreak havoc on San Francisco!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Dull and small scale - a waste of time,Didn't enjoy this movie. The story is weak and uninvolving. Good points: How they made the apes act is quite amazing. Very real. Faults: Bit confusing which ape was which. The story was irritating and uninteresting. Franco's scientist did cause a lot of trouble just because got attached to his ape. Too much of the story took place in the facility. The whole thing felt very small scale. Only the last part had some epic feel. Didn't feel for any of the characters human or animal. There is no chemistry between Pinto and Franco. She gets cast in roles that don't quite suit her. Overall about as bad as the Marky Mark movie. Only the original Heston version was good. Forget all the rest.,2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
the apes rise together with you!,"nice summer flick. i watched this several hours ago. it is, by far the best film of 2011 in my opinion.let me say that it has some great acting and is well scripted. i liked all the characters. caesar is an intelligent genius. Will Rodman is a strong character who shows considerable emotion throughout the movie. his father is a well developed character who is unfortunately stricken with alzheimer's. his neighbour is a crazy guy and i think they chose the right actor for this role. the rest of the characters were good, but there was one who was actually quite abusive.nice and smooth plot. here, we see Will Rodman's experiment turning out to be a temporary success and then eventual failure for humans with his neighbour, his dad, and that abusive guy all part of the reason behind that failure. actually, no you could say it's his fault testing the drugs on apes in the first place, as revealed in the trailer. like most humans, he doesn't really care much for animals and unfortunately learns the very hard way that what he was doing was wrong. i saw no plot holes at all. the movie is hugely focused on caesar and the apes made in such a way that you end up hoping the apes would win :). your first thought when walking out of the cinema is ""long live the apes!"", which is the reason why this review is called ""the apes rise together with you"". but, the interesting thing is that the humans don't too much seem to be enemies either.the movie has good actions scenes. they succeed at doing them without huge amounts of explosions, even though that's kind of what i wanted. some nice special effects. there is a long period of time without any action scenes, but you still end up being interested. each time you view an action scene, you end up wanting the apes' victory. you might end up demanding more action by the end of the movie, though.it wasn't exactly a ""can't-get-your-eyes-off-the-screen"" type of movie, in my opinion it came the closest to falling under that category out of all of the movies i watched so far in 2011.but all in all, it had a lot of elements that deserved a high rating. that's why my rating is an 8.5/10. i find it quite a good idea to watch films like this on tuesdays, for $6 at a price much cheaper then other days :).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely loved this,"how can anyone hate this, i loved this movie so much, when i saw it on the shelf i really didn't want to watch this movie i got it as a result of boredom, and oh my gosh i was extremely surprised, it was the first movie to actually make me gasp, and cry *3 times..shame :)*. I enjoyed it so much i was sad when it was ending and i think i even said no no don't be finished no no and i actually pushed play again and watched it again there is only one other movie i have done that with... i loved the graphics and fell in love with Caesar, this is another movie i made everyone watch and everyone loved it. My sister and niece were the same as me they were not so keen on watching it I told them to watch the first 20 min and if they didn't like it turn it off, they have now watched it at least 4 time as well :) well worth the watch",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Huge Disappointment!  Lame Story?,"Big fan of the original three movies, especially the first two. Refused to see the Burton remake and hesitated to see this one. A friend said it was very good. Read IMDb reviews and was impressed. Saw the film.Ugh! Really? Half the movie is still developing plot. Slow and boring. The fact is the plot of an intelligent chimp through drugs (a monkey version of the film Limitless) could have taken 30 mins at most.The CGI apes were bad as well. The original movie looked WAY better! The only good thing was the facial gestures of the monkeys, especially Caesar, but they looked too human in that regard. Very disappointing. Monkeys flying and swinging was so computerized and for this to be accepted it tells me a new generation of young movie goers accept this dribble. That is regression in my book! When in doubt, add eye candy to keep the male viewers attention w/Will's g/f. The lead acting was terrible, especially David Oyelowo as Jacobs. Franco needs to slow down and focus on one project at a time. He seems half present as the story rolls on. Brian Cox and John Lithgow were miscast.One of the worst scenes that told me the director was a goof had to be the stolen classic line from the original...it was so bad and comical the only reaction was insult. This would be poor in a local community play, but a major motion picture?Bad movie overall. If movies like Avatar and Rise are good, then my movie enjoyment will decrease with this type of genre.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
stupid Humans,"Considering the last attempt to bring Planet of the Apes to the screen was a complete disaster, it's hard to believe this film even got the go ahead to be made. However, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is nothing less than a pleasant and extremely exciting surprise.The film starts out as a drama: James Franco plays a doctor who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's. When there is a fatal accident in the lab, Franco sneaks a baby chimp home, where he discovers that the Alzheimer's drug given to chimps is genetic, and as a result, makes little baby Caesar extremely intelligent. But as the years go by, Caesar becomes more and more displaced, and eventually winds up at the pound. It is here, among average chimps, orangutans, and a gorilla, that Caesar becomes increasingly depressed, and then the real action starts.Franco is fantastic as the ambitious young doctor, and John Lithgow is great as Franco's Alzheimer's stricken father. It is strange to see Tom Felton portraying anyone else besides Malfoy in Harry Potter, yet he too is perfect as the obnoxious employee at the pound. But it's Andy Serkis (covered up in motion-capture CGI) as Caesar that steals the show. Serkis blends ape mannerisms seamlessly with human attributes, and supplies the most touching moments in the film.Newcomer Rupert Wyatt directs this film with precision. Not a moment is dull or unwanted. Wyatt constantly pays tribute to the original series by reusing classic lines and plot elements that make the movie so pleasing.The Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the most thrilling movies of the year, and is part of a recent trend of very well done sci-fi films. A suspenseful and exhilarating ride, one can only hope the sequel will be as good.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well Done!,"So I saw the Rise of the Planet of the Apes this past weekend and I must say, ""kudos"" to the writers and directors for staying true to the original story and set up of the first movie.(written by Pierre Boulle, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver. Directed by Rupert Wyatt) The movie had a well written story that kept you entertain and brought to life the life of Caesar in a great way. Caesar who was played by ""Andy Serkis"" who also played ""Gollum/Smeagol"" in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Did a great job playing the character so that the role can be later animated during editing.The best parts of the movie for me was the interaction between the apes. And of course the quite parts of the movie, which in my eyes made you feel for the characters and then better understand their roles. I'm not a fan of James Franco, but his role was secondary in my eyes as the role of Caesar who's character was much more powerful. So even though his acting is not as good as I hoped it would be. The movie still made an impact even with him in it.This is a must watch if your into the Planet of the Apes series.In my B.S.

excellent use of CGI and good storyline,"This is supposed to be a prequel to the much acclaimed Planet Of The Apes from 1968. But in that particular flick an astronaut crew crash lands on a planet in the distant future where intelligent talking apes are the dominant species, and humans are the oppressed and enslaved. In Rise we are on planet earth, to be precise in San Francisco. A laboratory is experimenting with a new medicine to cure Alzheimer but they need to experiment on chimpanzees. But one experiment goes to far and a genetically-enhanced chimp breaks free and leaves a baby chimp behind. The mother is killed and one of the doctors (James Franco) Will Rodman takes the baby home and it grows up in the family. But the baby chimp has some qualities inherited from his mother. Once the chimp (Ceasar) knows it and uses it intelligence.Due a simple incident between (John Lithgow) Charles Rodman and his neighbor Ceasar breaks free and defend Charles, but he is captured and send to a place full of chimps, the rise is a fact.This summer blockbuster was forgotten very fast in my country due Transformers 3. But was it that bad that it should disappear that fast. No, to be honest, I even enjoyed it. The apes due look like real apes and that makes it more enjoyable. There is naturally a lot of CGI but it all looks so real that you forget that you are watching a CGI flick. It takes a while before things go wrong. There are things going on but to see how the rise happens you really have to wait an hour. The action lays in the last part of this flick. It reminded me a bit of the story of I Robot were one Robot (Sonny) violates the rules and is learning things by himself. Caesar does the same. I liked it more than the remake done by Tim Burton. I know that a lot of people disliked Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes but give it a try and forget the saga for one moment.

A thought provoking blockbuster!,"This film really makes you think, not in the whole animal hugging type way, but in a way of following the main characters. Ceaser, the ape who starts the whole riot, shows that actions speak louder than words. For the audience have to watch Ceaser and try and ""read his mind"", so to speak. The whole development of the rise is very well done, not to fast and not to slow in pace. The human characters are also a joy to watch, James Franco and Freida Pinto are really good in this film. Tome Felton? meh (good thing he's not the main character) the rest worked really well in the film. Don't expect the whole world to be overtaken by apes in this one film but expect to see the beginning of the growth of the apes domination over the whole world.

LOVED IT.  Better than Avatar. Up there with LOTR.,"I love movies and know a good movie when I see it.Rise of the Apes blew me away. And honestly I wasn't expecting much. I hadn't seen or heard reviews, and basically went into the movie hoping to be captivated enough to pass time. Boy was I...The CGI was the best special effects, maybe of all time. It was that good. The fact I was so emotionally invested in a green screen, make believe character still has me amazed. What a fantastic job by Serkis again. He was a huge part of the LOTR success with Golum and was even better IMO as Caeser. He was so good that I joke his character should be up for an Oscar as best actor. Imagine a CGI character being nominated for an Oscar. He was that good.The story was believable enough to keep me fully engrossed. I was looking for a moment to play devils advocate and complaign about being 'too unrealistic' but couldn't.Franco was fine. Lithgow better. Cox and the dude from Harry potter did fine jobs also. But they were supporters to Caeser. They could have been replaced with anyone and I still would have enjoyed it thoroughly.Definitely worth seeing. And Im excited to hear they're working on a sequel, although it was god enough as a standalone. Just don't let Tim Burton near the sequel.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Wyatts newest addition to the saga not only ties into the original story extremely well, but also reveals new aspects that make for an immensely enjoyable movie.","To begin, i would just like to state that i am a huge fan of the original planet of the apes. with that said, this movie contains all the elements i loved about the original, but in a modernized sense. it contains many great throwbacks to the original, such as the ape's behaviour, famous dialogue, and even references to the original characters. this movie is a must see for anyone who enjoyed the original.i must admit i was worried about the presentation of the apes in this film as i was rather fond of the original ape makeup. however the cgi apes are astonishing to say the least. Andy Serkis is obviously used to playing apes (as he was Kong in King Kong[2005]) and its good to see him play his part as both believable as an ape, but also a character we can relate to as a human.As for acting, it was strong but there were a few weak links. James Franco is great as Will Rodman, and he plays it strong throughout. he is very emotive and you can feel what he feels by his expression. Freida Pinto on the other hand does a far less believable job. Her performance is mediocre at best, she was one of the few things that brought this movie down for me, due to her blank expression, poor emotion, and overall unenjoyable portrayal of her character. Others give great supporting performances such as David Oyelowo, Tom Felton ( although he basically plays a role identical to his role as Draco Malfoy), Brian Cox, and Tyler Labine. However my John Lithgow gives my favourite supporting performance by far and it is something that is to be appreciated about this film.Finally, the story is very well written. For me, it is almost as good as the original. The slow transformation of the ape Caeser from an innocent, child like figure to a dangerous leader is well portrayed. the slow evolution as the apes learn not to trust humans is nice, and the characters are interestingin short, the movie is well worth your time and i gave it an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Simian Braveheart,"This film is a testament to modern film technology. It is a familiar story about slavery and freedom that cleverly weaves in concurrent themes of super-science, pandemic, and genetic acceleration. An engaging experience that is as much a study in struggle as it is an action/battle movie.The main point of this movie has already been covered by plenty of films and fiction: What happens when some other group of entities attain a sentience formerly only known by humans - the will to assert coupled with intelligence. Whether it be apes, computers, or robots, the prime question is: How will the new beings treat humans? And an ancillary to that is: Will they hold a grudge? This film takes plenty of time to delve into these matters, with quite a few subtle references to man's own enslavement of man, by prison, by arms, and by general attitude. The acting and pacing are just right to let us explore this. But it goes further and PERSONALIZES the whole struggle in the story of Caesar.Amazingly, through well-crafted CGI and the actor/model work of Andy Sirkis, we are captivated by the actions and thoughts of a character, who is not only a different species, but who uses no spoken words through most of the film. This is sheer movie magic, and it's why this movie is important and deserves praise.Sirkis' and the other model actors' work is so nuanced and dense, that the mere posture and gestures of the apes tells us volumes. There's a real genuine emotional force as we share Caesar's life and his discovery of many not-too-pleasant realities, from the joy of his youth, to his first experience with xenophobic anger - his questioning of his origins, his visceral separation from peace, and his rise as a leader of men...er apes. I really have no end of praise for the work done for the non-human characters of this film. Strikingly, it's their performances that are by far the best in the film.And, like Braveheart, by a certain point, we are very much cheering them on. The action sequences are clever and crisp, and a lot of thought went into the questions of how APES would conduct a struggle for freedom and resistance, with unique approaches that are decidedly not human, and therefore quite effective against the unprepared.So come for an action film and linger on the deeper currents. Oh and there's plenty of homage in here too, for the film buffs who actually saw the brilliant originals. Overall one of the best movies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What a pleasant surprise!,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011) was a really good entertainment.

The storytelling is at its best. And motion capture technology is beautifully used. Andy Serkis steals every single scene he is in.

I'm really looking forward to the next movie of this franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The next leap forward in effects..,"There have been certain movies since the inception of digital effects that stand out for their use of new technology to assist the storytelling. Jurassic Park made us believe in dinosaurs. So much of The Lord of the Rings films hinged on Gollum, a CG performance-captured character. Avatar created an incredibly lush and dense alien world, populated with bizarre, photo-realistic creatures. In 2011, Rupert Wyatt's cumbersomely titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes represents the next leap forward in cinema effects. There is a human story here, but Wyatt wisely leaves it more or less in the background. and focuses the film on its strongest element: Andy Serkis as Caesar.Rise builds audience sympathy for the ape characters right from the opening scene. Make no mistake, what happens later on in the story is our fault, the end product of insatiable human greed. The events of the film progress in a fairly by the numbers fashion, and anyone familiar at all with the Apes series knows where it's going, yet Wyatt and Serkis manage to surprise by crafting easily the most interesting and developed character of the blockbuster season, and arguably the entire year thus far. This film is all Caesar's, and the work done by Serkis and the wizards at Weta is truly remarkable. It was a risky proposition to make Caesar a completely CG character; if the effect didn't work, the whole film wouldn't work. Building on what they had done previously in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong, Weta and Serkis achieve what was though by some impossible, making Caesar and the other apes 100 percent believable, not just in look, but in emotion. Wyatt, fearlessly inviting close scrutiny of the digital characters, focuses a great deal on the eyes of the apes, and when Caesar looks at James Franco or John Lithgow, you really feel the connection between them. When the Oscar nominations are announced in January, is it possible that Serkis will get a nod for supporting actor? Probably not, but the strength of his performance is sure to spark debate about the legitimacy of performance-captured animated characters. More so than Rings or Avatar, Rise really shows what the technology is capable of, and it seems that the uncanny valley is ever so much closer to being bridged. Whether or not Weta can work their magic on a human character remains to be seen, but the potential is definitely there, and it's exciting. As for the real human characters, Lithgow stands out as always, but Franco, Freida Pinto, and particularly Tom Felton as a sadistic ape handler deliver fairly forgettable performances. They do what they have to do, but Wyatt knows where the film needs to spend its time, and their story never gets in the way of Caesar's journey from adorable orphan to calculating revolutionary. It's a shame that 20th Century Fox's marketing department felt it necessary to alter the film's title, as the original title Caesar is much more appropriate.Technical achievements aside, Rise is also a surprisingly effective summer action film. Whereas the majority of reboots/remakes come off as a little unnecessary, Wyatt and writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver really seem like they have something to say, and the climax of the film left me quite genuinely conflicted in my morals. The subtext of the film asks some big questions about genetic engineering and animal rights, and what our response should be to protect ourselves from nature's fury. Obviously the events in the film are pushed to an extreme level, but the human response seems rather realistic, and it's not something we should be proud of.This is how franchise filmmaking should be done. Using outstanding technical mastery to tell a challenging and exciting story, Rise of the Planet of the Apes ends blockbuster season on a high note, and sets a solid foundation for further stories in this universe. The Apes series seemed dead in the water after Tim Burton's awful 2001 remake, but Rupert Wyatt and his team have reinvigorated it into something relevant, topical and thrilling.tinribs27.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The triumph of the special effects is not their credibility, but the methods in which they produce empathy for an imaginary creature","In 2005, Peter Jackson brought back the most famous cinema-ape of all time, King Kong, with a surprising amount of affection for the creature. That film, the second remake of ""King Kong,"" used the wonder of 21st century special effects to generate emotion and empathy for an imaginary creature. Six years later, Rupert Wyatt accomplished nearly as much in producing not a remake, but a chapter in a long line of science-fiction spectaculars. The film is ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" In regards to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, it is the prequel to the 2001 remake by Tim Burton: a film I was not very fond of. I confess to not having seen the whole series, but this new, ramped-up movie could be the best. Yes, I liked it more than the 1968 original with Charlton Heston.This new film does not have the religious and philosophical subtext of the 1968 film and its 2001 remake, but it generates an enormous amount of visceral empathy for a creature created using pixels, modeled from the movements of an actor, Andy Serkis. The creature is Caesar, an abnormally intelligent, lab chimpanzee rescued from being euthanize by one of technicians. James Franco plays the technician, who hopes that Caesar, who has experimental enzymes in his body, will lead to drugs that can cure first his father's mental handicaps and then worldwide human disorders. Things take a turn for the worse, beginning with Caesar being captured by the local animal control and tossed in with less-intelligent primates. And, as the title hints, and using methods I shall not spoil in this review, Caesar begins to lead his kind so that we can see how Mark Wahlberg, in the original, found himself being photographed by monkeys before a modified Lincoln Memorial.I was auspicious of the movie in the beginning. Like so many surprisingly good movies in recent years, it seems to be pacing itself too fast in its exposition. Predominately in the way it establishes the characters and their predicaments. However, about a third of the way through the 105-minute running time, the movie enhances itself so that the weaknesses I spotted at the beginning were easily forgiven and forgotten.The special effects are quite astonishing. The detail is very strong; only a couple of times I remembered that I was looking at something digitally added in post-production. The apes, and there are lots of them by the end, really do seem to occupy the same three-dimensional space as their human counterparts. But again, the real triumph of director Wyatt, and his two screenwriters (Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver) is how they make us feel for not only for Caesar and his fellow apes. Even the obligatory snotty employee who taunts and abuses the animals (this time played by Tom Felton) seems genuinely antagonizing because I actually cared about Caesar and felt mad when Mr. Felton turned a fire hose on him. By the end of the picture, I even felt a little guilty about the amount of sympathy I had for a group of animals that, after all, were planning to dominate and enslave the human race. After all, come the time for Tim Burton's remake, men were living in jungles and cages. If I were a hardcore moralist, the ending might have even offended me. But alas, I cannot be, for I love movies too much. I don't see that as a bad thing.What is also special about ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" and what distinguishes it from other remakes/prequels/sequels of the past 20 years, is how it makes references to its predecessors not cheaply or obligatorily, but cleverly. Take, for instance, the reiteration of Charlton Heston's 2nd-most famous line from the original: ""This is a madhouse! A madhouse!"" The line appears here as well, but is disguised behind howling apes and clanging bars, as if it had been invented for the picture. And details referring directly to the 2001 remake are placed strategically, not smack-dab in your face. So folks who have never seen a ""Planet of the Apes"" movie before will not feel like the joke's beyond them. The only reference that does seem out of place and cheap is the reiteration of the original's 1st-most famous line. It comes all too predictably and clumsily. I wish the filmmakers could have just resisted the temptation.While I'm on the negatives, I might as well point out a few things. Again, the first 3rd of the movie needs cinematic Ridilin. It moves too fast, covers subplots too fast, and even leaves holes. For instance, Mr. Franco's handicapped father also has a mother. Her inclusion is so brief and abrupt, and holds no consequence to anything that follows, that it might as well have been tossed out. There is not even an exit scene to explain her disappearance. If it's on a deleted scene, I'm not surprised, but it's still the fault of the writers for not including this in a moment that had to stay in the picture. There is also, of course, a love interest for the human protagonist. Playing this obligatory role, Freida Pinto is charming. But she is lost in a thankless part. And while I did adore most of director Wyatt's camera angles and movements, his editing is sometimes too brisk. Too akin to Tony Scott, whose style I have many gripes with.But, as I think I've made it clear, the positives far outweigh the negatives. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is such an engrossing cinematic experience that I've kicked myself for missing on the chance to see it in a theater. For even projected on a small screen, it was quite the sight to behold. Great movies demand to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. So for all those who did rush out to see it, I have just one statement: I envy you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
So much ape there's no room for human.,"I'll admit that when I first heard this was being made (and first saw the trailer) I thought it was a hilariously awful idea and the movie wouldn't be worth anything. The surprisingly positive reviews got me kind of excited for it, but now that I've seen it I feel I should have stuck to my original guns and just passed on it. With a real pro like Andy Serkis taking on the role of Caesar, the film is able to elicit quite a bit of emotional strength out of it's revolutionary ape. I found myself caring for him a lot, although this concern dwindled as the film progressed towards it's alarmingly anti-climatic conclusion.The main problem though is that they spent so much time developing Caesar that they forgot to do anything with the humans. Every single human is a dull one-dimensional set piece just designed to further the plot for Caesar, none of them being interesting in the least bit. It sure doesn't help that the actors are unanimously drab, from the sleep-walking James Franco down to the laughable Tom Felton. The action sequences in the final act were well done but they ended far too quickly and couldn't make up for the very dry experience that came for the hour and a half before it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A LOT better than I expected!,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Must admit, There are not many remakes or reboots that I like. BUT, this is one of those exceptions. The 2001 film ""Planet of the Apes"" was an okay remake of the original 1968 film staring Charlton Heston. This movie is a reboot of the 1983 film, ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Fourth film in the series line. Although it does has similarities to ""Conquest"", it is NOT a remake, which is good.I can honestly say I don't know what I expected from this film. Disappointed by recent reboots/remakes, I in part expected not to like it. I could not have been more wrong. James Franco, best known for his staring role in 127 Hours. He plays Will Rodman, Genetic Engineer looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. A good part and well acted. Freida Pinto, known mainly for her lead female role in Slumdog Millionaire. She plays a primatologist who bonds with Will Rodman and Caesar. The voice of Caesar is played by Andy Serkis who has done many voice overs, including Gollum from Lord of the Rings.The Special Effects of the film were just great. The acting and storyline are superb. I don't want to give spoilers in this review because I think it is a brilliant film and I suggest people watch the film instead of reading all the spoilers.Now, According to reports, this film will be the first in the line of a new series of Planet of the Apes films. :D So, we can hope that the future has some very good films to come.

Caesar is home ...,"The movie was lying in my hard disk since a long time as I was trying to avoid it thinking of it as something similar to the older movie.But I should say, its worth watching an awesome movie.

The expressions of a chimp, its so real you just forget for the entire movie that its no human. And the last line ""Caesar is home"", its like an awesome climax to an awesome movie. Seeing this movie I got reminded of I-robot, kind of similar.James Franco as usual has given his best in the role of a son and a real chimp lover.I say a must watch if you appreciate great CGI effects, intense and great message at the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rise of the Planet of the Apes: A Simian Triumph,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes has become for me an ideal example of fresh, thrilling, spellbinding, emotive, overall perfect cinema. I love this movie, because it is all these things and more. The trailblazing motion- capture, used to artfully capture Andy Serkis' Oscar-worthy performance, laughs (I apologize in advance to the fans of the original franchise) Charlton Heston's 1960's series to shame; Patrick Doyle's score is simple, yet delightful; the pacing is perfect, and the actors well-chosen and talented. This review could well prove painful to me, owing not to any fault of the film in question, but rather to the possibly necessary restraint from droning on interminably to its deserved credit.In most motion pictures, I would judge any which run below, let's say, 100 minutes, as likely lacking the material needed to produce a fully matured movie, and most of the time I would be correct in so doing. Here is evidenced an exception to the rule. At only 104 minutes of running time, that which I would tend to view as a fault is indeed a virtue in this case. The reason for the shorter-than-average blockbuster length is because the story pleading telling requires only that amount of time. Packed jam-full into those 104 minutes is a fantastic adventure, complete with thrills, sorrows, and everything in between. The pacing is beautiful - the film constantly moving along its well-planned trajectory, never feeling either hurried or stalled. It maintains continual interest as every event unfolds. I digress momentarily to add that, without becoming merely a ""rung in the ladder"", the story, begun so praise worthily in this first installment, maintains its flow as the franchise progresses. In an age in which ideas are forever recycled and served up as sequels with a slightly new flavour to audiences again and again, original series that manage to tell authentic stories should be warmly welcomed. But to return to the topic at hand. The plot is largely believable and convincing, although admittedly the climax pushes credibility, somewhat.Despite a slightly obscure cast, the characters are well-formed and well-played, presenting convincing and realistic performances. Motion capture master Andy Serkis is naturally the champion that holds up the entire premise. Here, in ape realm, Serkis is king. His unmatched emotive talent seems to be perfectly at home as Caesar, and though he has delivered an array of indisputably singular performances as Gollum, Captain Haddock, King Kong and more, Caesar remains my personal favourite and, in my mind, his most organically, authentically, self- made trademark personality. As mentioned, the characters are developed nicely, and I appreciate the practicality the writers employed when they wove the players into the story, not as absolute centrepieces, but well-ordered parts of a whole - clever appendages to the events that shaped the lives of many. One of the beautiful aspects to these movies is the way in which characters and the plot are balanced - so that you really feel for the heroes on an intimate level, while never abandoning the continuous course of history.Visual effects are obviously crucial to the movie's success, and here they used brilliantly. Unlike most blockbusters, which routinely follow formulas that involve a load of explosions and similar eye-candy, to Weta's credit (and to the credit of VFX in general) Rise of the Planet of the Apes uses them to provide a unique medium - one that replaces humans with apes, and, ridiculous as it will sound to someone new to the concept, it works really, really well. Since 2011, mo-cap has improved noticeably, and supposedly it will continue to do so. Still, visually it is very pleasing, and story-wise it excels. I think animation is a praise-worthy mode of story- telling, and the method by which it is here blended so it meshes perfectly with live-action is a joy to behold.When Rise of the Planet of the Apes hit cinemas in 2011, nobody was expecting the successful reboot that followed, and though it received strong critical reviews, audiences never showed the support I believe it deserved. Over the years, it has risen in true-ape style to enter the highest ranks of my all-time favourite films. The serious pitch and good continuity are maintained as the trilogy progresses. It has many great moments; I can hardly recommend it enough. If you have yet to see this movie, don't waste any more time - see it right away!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Better Than I Would've Originally Believed,"If someone had asked me in early 2011 what big summer movie I was least anticipated, it would've been RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. For a bunch of reasons, the biggest being that I've never been a fan of the originals. Sorry, fans, but it was just a series I never gravitated towards. I've seen bits and pieces of the original and next to nothing of the sequels. If it weren't for parodies (e.g. the episode of ""The Simpsons"" featuring the musical), I probably wouldn't even be aware of the big reveal at the end. I just didn't care. Combine that with my growing agitation with the sequel/prequel/remake/reboot craze and a title at least three words too long, and it all adds up to a movie that I had no intention of seeing. The trailers were intriguing, no doubt, but it wasn't until the reviews began floating in with praise for the movie and Andy Serkis' motion capture awesomeness. So I gave it a chance and admit that I was wrong. Establishing the events that led to the ape domination, the movie is set in modern times where Dr. Will Rodman is using chimpanzees in his tests to cure Alzheimer's. When a lab incident leads to the eradication of his ape subjects, Will smuggles an infant to the safety of his home until he can find an alternative. The chimp, named Caesar, becomes a part of the family with Will and his Alzheimer's-afflicted father. As Caesar grows, so does his intelligence. When an altercation with a neighbor leads to Caesar's imprisonment in an ape preserve at the hands of cruel men, Caesar grows to detest his place in the world as an ""animal"" and leads a revolt with his fellow apes.I suppose it's a good thing that the apes in this movie are infinitely more relatable than any of the humans. Andy Serkis is the king of motion capture characters and Caesar is the best he's done. It really says a lot for the man's talent that he can create such a vivid character utilizing body language and facial expressions. Caesar isn't a sentient creature of another world like Gollum or an instinct-driven beast like Kong; he's thinking, feeling creature and Serkis brings real life to his performance that (with some fantastic CG from Weta) feels real. Honestly, the entire motion capture crew deserve some credit for their work bringing these animals to life. I wish the same could be said for the human cast. James Franco is pretty flat here. I'll chalk it up to the possibility that he just wasn't used to playing against a CG character. Freida Pinto is Will's love interest, a vet tech named Caroline. Her only real purpose is to provide the voice of reason against Will's mad scientist ways. John Lithgow stands out as Will's ill father and David Oyelowo makes for a pretty good villain (if business-centric = villain, here). The film also features the awesome Brian Cox as the owner of the problematic ape sanctuary, but it's former evil wizard-in-training Tom Felton who acts as real source of evil and gets away with a few franchise-favorite quotes (even if he came off as a cartoon character).The movie has sort of a slow build-up to the eventual ape uprising but, when it hits, it's pretty wicked. A massive final battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is the highlight of the movie, but everything leading into it is very deliberately paced. I guess I was kind of expecting more bang in the finale but the filmmakers must be saving the rest of the ape's rise to power for future installments. This movie was a lot better than I was willing to believe. It may not be the best film in 2011 but I'm sure it'll fall in to my top ten favorites of the year. It was enough to inspire my interest in a franchise I'd long-since written off, and I'm actually interested to see everything come together. The movie was a definite financial success so I'm sure we'll be seeing more and, next time, I probably won't wait for the home video release to check it out. Just think, if the CG apes were the best part of this movie, a movie with even less human involvement could be even better. Maybe and just do the audience a favor and shorten the titles a bit?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

If this is the future of Hollywood...,"then I think I'll stick to watching older or foreign films. Despite a prevalence of positive reviews in the press, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (who thought of THAT title?) turns out to be one of the most disappointing films I've seen all year. It's nothing more than a CGI-laden special effects extravaganza which, like much other recent fare, forgets to tell a story along the way.The film is conceived as a kind-of prequel to the classic PLANET OF THE APES films, but it doesn't really work out that way. The long-winded narrative, about a drug that increases intelligence and the eventual way it finds itself into chimpanzees, could have been dusted over in the first ten minutes of the movie. I seem to recall Danny Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER treading similar ground in the first two or three minutes, but here the entire film is devoted to entirely predictable – and overly familiar – events. It all builds to a CGI set-piece which is yawn-inducing rather than technically impressive, and then the film just ends without any kind of attempted closure. The bridge scene that ends the movie is pure over the top trash, something I'd expect from a TRANSFORMERS movie, which is on the same level as this film.I'm pretty sure that end-of-the-world thrillers like this are supposed to be frightening and suspenseful, and yet RISE forgets to bring either of those things to the table. It's also crushingly tame, going for a PG-13 rating when it should have been restricted. I mean, if you wanted to make the film believable AT ALL, you should have shown these chimps ripping off arms and faces; after all, that's the real behaviour when they go feral. You only have to follow the news to realise that. But RISE presents them as a sanitised and noble species. It's pure fantasy.The actors sleepwalk through their roles, with only the old dependable John Lithgow giving anything approaching a good performance. Brian Cox literally shows up to pick up his paycheque, and as for Tom Felton trying to act after Malfoyoh dear. Freida Pinto shows up for one of those pretty-girlfriend-hanging-on-the-hero's-arm type roles, and as for James Franco, well to say he's slumming it would be to over-praise him. Even worse, he has no reason to be in the film at all, his character is totally extraneous to the plot other than at the outset.My real venom, though, is directed towards the apes themselves, which for the first time are completely CGI generated. Please, bring back the men in suits! These CGI effects are dated already, just a year after the film came out, and they're never believable or indeed realistic. Not one bit. And when I hear Andy Serkis, a guy who's made an entire career out of playing Gollum, waffling on about how motion capture brings an emotional core to these creations, I feel a little bit sick inside. No, Andy, it doesn't bring ANY emotion whatsoever. These things are one-dimensional cartoons and you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. You're there to provide motion and that's it. Don't keep bigging yourself up.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Revolution Has Begun....,"""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was almost doomed to fail from the start. Few reboots/remakes have ever offered anything new to a franchise, especially a well-loved classic, it had a reasonably new and un-heard director behind the wheel and was known to have a heavy use of CGI before release. But this film pulled it off. ROTPOTA offers a more realistic take on the original, portraying the start of the ape uprising that lead to the events in ""Planet of the Apes"". It mostly follows the story of Caesar, a domesticated chimpanzee who inherits a gene from his mother who was injected with a drug said to cure alzheimers by James Franco (a brilliant scientist who cares for Caesar at home) which improves his brain functions and effectively makes him smarter. As humanity treats him wrong, Caesar seeks revenge with the help of his fellow primates. Andy Serkis does a fantastic job of playing Caesar, imitating the stance and actions of apes perfectly. The rest of the cast do a fine job too, with John Lithgow providing a stand-out performance as James Franco's father who suffers from the disease his son is trying to fix. What ROTPOTA does well is not to show either side (the apes or the humans) as a side worth rooting for. By the time the final sequence approaches most audiences will struggle which side to support. However this works to the movie's advantage, allowing the viewer to empathize with both parties. The film is not overly- violent, but is still extremely brutal and hard-hitting, creating a sense of realism in a usually unbelievable world and story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

We get a very well laid out plot and excellent character and relationship development. Something that is seriously lacking in perhaps the vast majority of movies I've sadly watched in the past few years.A real testament to this film is from my wife, who hates this type of thing, who also believes it's one of the best films she's seen in a long time.

The storytelling is grand. The Direction and cinematography are very good. The ape effects are very different from the original, but very good. ""Bright Eyes"" and call backs like that are all homages to the original films. James Franco and Frieda Pinto are great. This was really good.

Rises above the unintelligent studio schlock and rubbish remakes it's forced to call its peers.,"An Intelligent blockbuster that's better than it had any right to be, I mean expecting a prequel to a forty-three year old franchise (at the time of release) to be any good is almost asking for disappointment, and yet here we have what is easily one of the smartest big-budget Hollywood productions of this decade. 'Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes (2011)' swaps out soulless spectacle for keen character development and manages to make you care about an entirely digital ape protagonist. The action-sequences, while well-done and generally quite entertaining, are actually the weakest part of this picture and that truly speaks volumes.

Apes stole the show...,"First and foremost, apes are not monkeys; apes are apes, the animal which manages to be the main character of the show. No doubt, what sells this movie is the ape itself, behind their story of evolution because of man. Caesar, the lead ape, is the baby of the product of an experimenting chimpanzee. Caesar grows attached to the human world, becoming foreign to its own, with intelligence that is beyond ordinary that will later lead in a rise of the apes. This movie depicts a drama that is beautifully crafted to show the relationship between man and ape, giving its 'wow' moments in bits and pieces until the credits, or post-credits.Definitely a prequel to the other 'Apes' movie, this movie explains and exudes the beginning of the whole story with simplicity that binds me from the start to the end. James Franco's performance as the leading man (Will Rodman) is one to be praised aside from the apes. He has proved again that he is an exceptional actor. Likewise, John Lithgow (Will's sick father who finds temporary relief using an experimenting virus), Tom Felton (Dodge Landon, another villain role that deserves for what he did) and David Oyelowo (Steven Jacobs, the stubborn man that seeks money out of experiments) portray their characters well. However, there wasn't much screen time of Freida Pinto given the hype created around her. His and her love story is not much presented; but then, why the need for their love story when the focus on the ape and Will far surpass the need for it? And in the short time of appearance, I believe this isn't her best performance yet.Once again, I would like to mention that this movie is drama at its best, in which there are some scenes that touch the heart. I predicted some of this sort, knowing it has a human-animal relationship. I was not disappointed; in fact, I enjoyed that it wasn't tear-jerking but suffice to pull heartstrings. Growing a connection with Caesar, we must realize that some things in life are best left unchanged- this is told in much depth. I thought there would be war between ape and man at its climax, somehow like the previous ones, but I was fooled. Because there wasn't any war; in fact, there isn't a need for war to bring out the essence of the movie. The final lines of the movie tell it all.In short, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' lives to its great expectation and to say that it has no 'wow' moments would be a great lie. Unlike many current movies with extensive use of bombs or gun fire, this has enough to capture the attention; but then again, why the need for extensive explosions when the stage set for the story of ape and man was delivered splendidly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It misses the mark,"""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a mixed bag. The last half hour or so is well done. It's totally ridiculous but its kind of exciting. The rest of the movie isn't nearly as good. The script is pretty good but the cast is a letdown. James Franco is in over his head. The usually always reliable John Lithgow completely fails at his role. His performance is more annoying than anything else. Lithgow ruins every scene he's in. There's more, Caesar the Chimp is almost as bad. Everything that went right when Andy Serkis played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies goes wrong for him here.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - What a Bunch of Crazy Apes!,"James Franco stars in a new sci-fi ape thriller that is neither a sequel or remake to the original ""Planet of the Apes"", but a visual re-imagining of the original idea. Franco stars as a scientist who tries to research a way to create a medicine for Alzheimers' to cure his dying father. He decides to test this medicine on a series of chimps, who later gain revolutionary intelligence. Then something goes wrong in the lab, and Franco is forced to raise a baby ape named Caesar. He takes a dose of this magic drug, and years later, Caesar is showing signs of advanced intelligence. But then some consequences occur, and Caesar is forced to be taken to an animal shelter, then Caesar starts a rebellion to prove to the animals that they are more than just lab rats. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a spectacular film, and it's easily one of the more better films of 2011. The dazzling use of motion capture technology to make the apes look so realistic is truly breathtaking. This film is thrilling and exciting, and the action scenes are super cool. There's also excellent performances by this wonderful cast ensemble. James Franco is just super as the scientist searching for the cure to Alzheimers', John Lithgow is brilliant as Franco's Alzheimer-stricken father, but Andy Serkis steals the whole show as Caesar, and he helps prove that Caesar is more the main character, instead of a computer-generated animal. But, the only disappointing character is Frieda Pinto as Franco's love interest who delivers no purpose of what her character had to do with anything. The rest of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is crystal perfect. The special effects are dazzling, the acting is superb, the suspense is real, and the finale on the Golden Gate Bridge brings a ton of drama and suspense. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is surprisingly one of the more better films of the year, from the beautiful graphics, the fine storyline, and an excellent performance by Andy Serkis. This is probably one of the most exciting movies of the year, and it's definitely worth anyone's precious time and money. All audiences will be dazzled with what this movie has to offer.

A terrific return to form. Best since the original,A reintroduction to a well loved series that has seen a few terrible entries. No more so than the Burton debacle. Rise is an extraordinary piece of modern cinema. Utilising CGI in a way that doesn't depend on the technology to be the main attraction. Superb retelling of the inception of the saga with an excellent plot and is thoroughly enjoyable. Serkis is a joy as Ceasar and provides a character which is undoubtedly likeable. You are driven to root for the new order as they strive to escape their human overlords and embark on their free existence. The action scenes are spectacular with the showdown on the Bridge being a particular highlight. Given the car crash that the 2000 movie was. I wasn't expecting much.

Another Horrible Ape Instalment,"Despite being a huge fan of James Franco, when the trailers started for this film, the seventh instalment of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, all I could think was ""Really?"" I was sure it was a guaranteed flop. Then the film got released and not only was it one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, there were numerous critics who PRAISED this film.And I cannot begin to figure out why.I had absolutely no interest in this film at all, especially with the 2001 remake having been such a joke, but found myself curious enough to watch it on a long flight between California and Hawaii. Seeing it was free, and I had nothing but time to waste, I thought sitting through it would at least give me the right to an opinion rather than blindly passing judgement. But my assumption of the film was right. It is absolute crap.Franco plays a scientist developing a serum to combat Alzheimer's and decides to try testing on chimps. Long story short, the serum is so effective, the chimps figure out how to break out of the lab and take over the Golden Gate Bridge. Yeah, all those action scenes you saw in the trailer? Every single one is from the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film.And although the special effects are impressive enough, that, in no way, makes up for the rest of this ridiculously cheesy and horrible film.Even monkeys would be smart enough to avoid this one. So maybe that does prove that chimps are actually smarter than the movie-going masses. Watching a film about a man trying to cure Alzheimer's actually managed to make me feel like a moron for having thought this film might actually have some merit.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A good example of how to reboot a movie series,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a good example of how to reboot a movie series. It plays off the original idea, but it has a unique storyline along with plenty of homages.

This film has invigorated this franchise once again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A prequel with purpose,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes proves that even the laziest sounding ideas can yield incredible results in the right hands. This is a ridiculously efficient film that's constantly moving and crams so much into a very lean 105 minute run time. It's a complete story on its own terms that also happens to be the beginning of the greatest prequel trilogy ever made.Andy Serkis gives a phenomenal lead performance that is simply mind blowing from the first moments. The performance capture loses none of Serkis' work and it results in one the most emotive performances put to screen. His work here shows that performance capture allows actors to truly transform in a way that could never be achieved without the unison of this technology and his commitment.On the human side, James Franco gives a great performance that gives life to a fair amount of exposition. Brian Cox uses minimal screen time to leave a lasting impression as an uncaring animal control officer who is numb to everything. Similarly, David Oyelowo takes what could've been a one-note money grabbing businessman into someone a little more human.Rupert Wyatt's direction succeeds at blending the CGI with the practical to make it feel as believable as possible whilst Andrew Lesnie's cinematography effortlessly glides through the action. Patrick Doyle's score really knows how to be sinister at times but its greatest strength lies in the moments of triumph to make sure it ends on a rewarding note.The visual effects on display here are still astonishing. The only reason it's showing any age is because its own sequels have surpassed it in the overall visual fidelity. Even then, there are still a lot of shots here where the level of detail is insanely impressive and some of the apes just look real. The fact that this lost the Oscar in that category is a crime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Going Ape.,"I'm glad that the apes are CGI, and not actors in ape makeup. A nice reboot to the franchise, it makes for the lazy Planet of The Apes(2001), don't get me wrong the makeup was awesome, but the characters and effects where so null and void.The story of a scientist(James Franco), who is trying to make a serum for his terminally ill father(John Lithgow), and anybody else who is sick. He tries it on apes, and one of his subjects goes awry, and his killed. But quickly discover a baby monkey after wards. He takes it home and raises it, and they name it Ceaser. When he grows up(Andy Serkis), his intelligent goes higher to the max. And when Ceaser is captured and put with other apes, will his intelligent become there savior?Andy Serkis is good has Ceaser, he brings that motion capture ape to life. The effects where incredible.

A Good Enough Beginning For The Next Wild Big Long Story,"A first part of a wild big long story, i think in 104 minutes runtime what fascinating is that i felt every characters personality in this movie pretty well already especially Caesar, Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes is pretty straight forward again with just a short amount of time i think people had already enough to get what's coming next, James Franco and the rest of the supporting cast was good, the tension, the danger, and the warning sign was really well captured and i felt it, it's pretty scary and terrifying and more when you think it's absolutely possible to happen in real life, the problem that i have with the film was the CGI in all the animal can look too soft and not quite finish, the texture of the skin could look not that smooth and real, but sometimes it can still looks better, nit picky here and there, but overall Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes was still a good enough beginning for the next wild big long story of Caesar and the extinction of human, and i bet it's gonna be even scarier and hopefully better in terms of film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Spectacular Gripping tale,"I saw this movie without much expectation but was thrilled to see what came my way.it is the fact that this must be one of the warmest and most humane sci fie fantasies of late that makes Rise of the Planet of the Apes such a gripping saga.James Franco always manages to add that special touch to his roles, makes his character even more appealing. Freida Pinto stays mostly in the background but does have a piquant charm of her own. But the revelation was Andy Serkis in the role of caesar, he was outstanding.Watch the apes storm across the Golden Gate bridge, chase cars, smash them down, jump into helicopters, tear them apart and send the super human species reeling for cover and you have relentless moments of high drama on screen. Equally enthralling is the secret uprising in the animal facility where Caesar infuses a sense of dignity in the rest of the apes who are used to being maltreated by the cruel handlers.This one's both a mass entertainer and a film with a high intelligent quotient.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing reboot,"This movie is everything this saga needed.With a different story from the originals, but having a certain essence of those same movies, this new installment manages to give us a very interesting story, well written and exciting, there are many references to the other movies and they are well placed in the story, although the film also has several very memorable scenes. As in any well-written story, our main characters have emotional attachments that lead them to act in a certain way, just as it tells us about the ambition of the human being, compared to the compassion and forgiveness that exists in apes. You will never stop paying attention to the small details of this film, which reflect how the apes observe the attitudes and actions of humans. The development of the characters is so good that it allows us to empathize with them and be able to be in their point of view, all the scenes are well done, the CGI is decent, the performances are good, although it has some conveniences that go unnoticed due to the different approach that this film has compared to the originals.It is a very enjoyable film with memorable scenes, which is faithful to the first film of the entire saga and which delivers a totally new story, but still contains a bit of the essence of the first films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"An unusual improvement with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""","Rupert Wyatt has directed a surprisingly improved episode of the traditional ""Planet of the Apes"" series films. It is definitely unique and incomparable to prior editions. James Fanco plays Will Rodman, a current day scientist involved in a similar fashion to the very well recognized book and film, ""A Perfect Day for Algernon"". He is adequate in his role yet subservient to the perfectly designed chimpanzees who are the real stars of this cinema in a similar way to ""Rosie"", the elephant in ""Water for Elephants"", also a well made picture.This movie very much compels great empathy for the lower mammalian world, and gives pause to the hectic world we are currently experiencing globally.

Average,"This was an okay movie, not that I would have watched with the benefit of hindsight. It contained some elements that I liked, namely it was quite fast paced and peppered with some juicy justice, remarkably lacking in violence, from the part of apes that is. For years the anthropologists have wondered, why the evolution favored the less agile and slow way of walking on two legs, instead of four. I guess the evolution made a mistake. We can all see it firsthand in this movie, when the apes move around speedily with ease, overpowering the firepower of the police force, who inflict remarkably little damage on the apes - even with a chopper.It's also a cautionary tale of how far the science can get you. I should call it the 'scientific-industrial establishment', whose carelessness and disregard (in the film) for procedure caused the ape race to become supreme. The film itself doesn't emphasize the bad quality of relations between humans and apes.Anyhow, it doesn't matter how unbelievable all of it sounds. When watching the movie, the evolution of the story sounded pretty good. It even has its cast of evil characters. If they'd only been less evil, all of us would be saved from our destiny in the hands of the apes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Cæsar Is Home,"Andy Serkis is the best mocap actor ever. His performance as a chimp that slowly gains sentience is riveting. This film rebooted the Planet of the Apes franchise with a bang, the titular apes look amazing, and the story point of how the apes become increasingly clever is well told. John Lithgow also turns in a great performance here, and even James Franco has his moments. The cinematography is gorgeous as well.

Surprise of the Planet of the Apes,"My bias...Loves: Exceeded expectations Likes: James Franco Dislikes: CGI Hates: Planet of the Apes by Tim BurtonI'll preface my review by saying that I have not seen any of the older Apes movies, but have seen the Tim Burton movie (which I cannot remember a thing from, but I do remember that I hated it). That being said, I missed this in theaters because I had no attachments to the Apes franchise and the first trailer released looked awful.I wish that I had caught this on the big screen. I loved every minute of this movie. The story was strong enough that I was able to ignore the (at times) poor CGI and got attached to Caesar as a non-human protagonist. The only problem I had with this film was the fact that, during the start of the film,around 8 years supposedly passes and no one ages or becomes any different in their motivations, personality, or hairstyles.The human acting is serviceable and the action, while used sparingly, is done well. The setup of the final battle scene is excellent.All in all, I loved this movie. It didn't do much with the humans, but I was instantly attached to Caesar.

Impressive and surprising!,"I was greatly impressed by this new Planet of the apes film. Since the successful reboot of Batman reboots have become way popular in Hollywood maybe too so. But after Tim Burton's Planet of the apes remake I think reboot was the only way to go with the series. And whats more this is not just starting the same story over again. Insteed they have managed to create something fresh. This film focuses very much on the drama and it really works. There will be action but the emotional themes work great. So much that it never starts to drag, go over the top or just feeling out of place. The story has clear themes of moral values which at least for me made an impression and actually were the main thing making this film so worth following, not just the action. Not saying that there is no action because the is and is is really well done. Through the movie there is quite some talking about science but it nothing that you need to follow closely and it is of course most made up fictional but is is successfully used to ask questions of moral, animal rights and science gone to far. The effects used to create the apes are absolutely brilliant. Made in the same way I guess as Gollum in Lord of the rings and also starring Andy Serkis. Without these effects the emotional substance that the film manages would have been lost even though for the story's sentimental themes. James Franco might not look entirely believable as a scientist as he still looks quite young but it doesn't matter for the movie and he makes it up with a great performance in bringing the right emotional feeling for the relation to the other characters. Fun to see Tom Felton in his big first post Harry Potter film. He plays the same kind of bastard as in those movies.This is the most different Planet of the apes movie. Focusing on emotional substance instead of the dystopian themes of the previous movies. I really liked Rise of the planets of the apes and would rank it as second best in the series after the first one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The issue of Plot Holes - how far do you expect us to go?,"The first warning that a reviewer should give any prospective moviegoer about this film is the requirement to overlook the MULTITUDE OF PLOT HOLES. Is it possible to latch on to the likable characters and amazing CGI chimp work and forgive the MASSIVELY HUGE PLOT HOLES? One can start to watch a movie and have a cynical attitude, however I will give a movie a break on one deficiency or another, but can you suspend disbelief when there are GAPING JAW-DROPPING PLOT HOLES? OK, we all know that this is a science fiction film. ROTPOTA is following the recent formula where movie franchises are rebooting with more realism and Earthbound storytelling. I was not a huge fan of the original movie series, but acknowledge as a strong work of science fiction, and some of the sequels held intriguing possibilities. One big credit goes to adding the new twist in this origin story that the source of accelerated intelligence in the apes came from a research lab trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's. But after that, the sequence of events are less inspired. We have a too broadly painted animal keeper who likes to abuse apes. You would think a special habitat built especially for apes would employ animal lovers, but that would be pointing out one of the ASTRONOMICALLY GARGANTUAN PLOT HOLES. Ultimately the film loses it's appeal, and one becomes strained as you try to continue to give the film a fair break.The good news is that ROTPOTA wins you over because of the great teamwork of Andy Serkis and Weta in creating a amiable character Caesar along with a cast of other apes. Although you know that the apes in this film don't completely resemble a true chimpanzee, and the movements still resemble humans in capture gear, you have a deep enough story to follow it through. And credit must be given to director Rupert Wyatt for being bold enough to have a lyrical directing style usually absent in a summer tentpole film. One drawback is that the second act is slow to resolve the inevitable uprising (as seen in the trailers - so no spoiler here), and great leaps of faith are required as character actions occur that would make a 4 year old SCREAM IN UTTER FRUSTRATION AT THE SERIOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOT HOLES. Some events in passing include Caesar monkey-ing around with a small Statue of Liberty souvenir (echos of the end of the 1st film), as well as TV new reports of a Mars space mission getting lost. These are obvious sequel setups. Although I didn't get too excited at yet another remake/reboot, I feel encouraged that subsequent sequels will have similar imaginative but COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS PLOT HOLES that will take the audience into more original and inventive movie fare. Yes, there are no superheroes in this film for once. I would suggest that waiting for the DVD would be best, lest you groan a little too loud in the theater at the INCREDIBLY HUMONGOUS PLOT HOLES.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Evolution becomes revolution.,"I really enjoyed this, I had watched this way too long ago to remember it so it felt like I was watching it for the first time. The story is nothing mind bending, but it served as a great start for the franchise reboot, a good origin for Ceaser. It really is a movie about the apes, I mean that's obvious but the ape characters were acting spectacularly. I know they're played by people, the special effects was so good and you can tell so much care was taken into bringing these characters on to screen. The human characters weren't exactly spectacular, the story had some cliches, and it played pretty safe, but I can't complain much, it's nitpicking. It was a great start to a pretty epic trilogy.

One of the best science fiction film,"The story of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is set in present day San Francisco. Scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) leads a medical laboratory team attempting to cure Alzheimer's disease, which involves experimentation on apes. This process leads to increased intelligence in the primate test subjects and triggers a series of events that leads to a confrontation between humans and apes.This movie is another installment from the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise. Apart from Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, no film has managed to reinvigorate a franchise more than this film. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a well-crafted movie with astonishingly effective motion capture CGI technology that convincingly captures the ape-human rumble.The story of the film is engaging and the action sequences (particularly the climactic face-off between humans and apes on the Golden Gate Bridge featuring hundreds of life-like apes) are spectacular. The background score adds to the thrill of the movie. Caesar (the main ape) emerges as the main reason to watch this film. You feel his rage, fear and innocence through his wonderfully animated expressions and body language. Despite being a sci-fi movie, the film focuses more on the story than the spectacle and effectively showcases the interaction between the humans and the apes. The movie also poses ethical and moral questions which is an interesting aspect of the plot.Though the film also contains certain loopholes - the pace is a bit quick and because of this some characters are left underdeveloped - but overall, it is an entertaining and an engaging film that has plenty of mouth-agape moments and is a worthy addition to the franchise.

A man's own experiments with genetic engineering lead to the development of intelligence in apes and the onset of a war for supremacy.,"If you were like me and you had seen the original movie with Charlton Heston, you were dreading the day that this movie came out for two reasons. 1. The movie was in CGI. I loved the original ape movies because of its practical effects and costumes, so when I saw it was in CGI my hopes went a bit more down. 2. The remake before suck. In 2001 Tim Burton made an apes movie and sucked big time, so seeing that there was another remake made me pretty angry.I went into the theatre ready to hate this movie and tear it a new one, but I came out liking it. The acting for the most part was pretty good. You could actually feel the chemistry between James Franco's character and Caesar(the main ape.) The CGI was decent but at times look very weird and the whole movie you can tell that Caesar didn't look right. Aside from that the movie was very well done the second best ape movie in the whole series. There were a few minor plot holes here and there, but you get over it.The one main thing that brings the movie down is Tom Felton who you might know from the harry potter movies as Draco. He says a line in the movie at the most dramatic part in the movie so be ready for that cause it takes you out of the movie when he says that line.Like I said I went into it hating it and came out liking it.

"Creative addition to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise","'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a very creative and thought-provoking addition to the ""Apes"" franchise.James Franco's performance as Dr. Will Rodman is very convincing. Rodman takes home an infant chimpanzee who otherwise would have been ""put down"", and thereby saves the chimp's life. The chimpanzee, named Caesar, obtains unusual intelligence from experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and soon becomes the leader in an ape revolt.Veteran actor John Lithgow once again proves his acting skills as Charles, Will's father who is suffering from Alzheimer's's disease. Freida Pinto portrays Will's attractive companion, Caroline.The special effects in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" are very impressive. This isn't Charleton Heston's 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"", with actors portraying simians via heavy prosthetic makeup. The apes in this 2011 saga are computer generated and are very realistic in appearance. More importantly, however, are the emotions the apes feel throughout the film. Their anger boils to the surface due to the ill treatment inflicted by their handlers.There are several direct references made to the 1968 original film, ""Planet of the Apes"". First, Caesar's mother is called ""Bright Eyes"", which was the name Heston's character was called before the apes learned his actual name was Taylor. Second, in the 2011 film, a handler repeats Charleton Heston's infamous lines, ""It's a madhouse!"" and ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"". Third, Caesar is ruthlessly hosed down while in his cage, in a scene reminiscent of Taylor's experience in the 1968 film. Furthermore, ""Caesar"" was the name of the offspring of Cornelius and Zira, two chimpanzee scientists in the 1968 film.In my view, there are two main themes of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". First, all creatures want to be treated with dignity and respect. Second, the unintended consequences of medical technology can be severe. I highly recommend this creative science fiction film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A worthy addition to the Apes oeuvre,"I admit that I'm a huge ""Planet of the Apes"" fan. As a child, I loved all of the original films, and I even ""went Ape for a day"" when movie theaters showed all 5 original Apes films back-to-back in one day back in the mid-1970s. I'm also a fan of the Tim Burton ""Planet of the Apes"" film (which is far more faithful to the source novel than the others). So it was with a sense of trepidation that I viewed this latest ""re-imagining."" As it turns out, my fears were for naught. This film, which pretty much reconceptualizes ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" (the 4th film in the original franchise), is a smart, exciting, and surprisingly sophisticated take on how humanity could engineer its own demise at the hands of another species. James Franco is solid in the lead as a researcher with a strong sense of ethics and a passion to develop a cure for Alzheimer's, a disease that plagues his father, played by the always brilliant John Lithgow. The real star of this film, however, is Andy Serkis, who gives life to Caesar, the chimpanzee who is torn between his love for humanity and his duty to his species—and whose performance is surely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Don't worry if this all sounds a bit hokey—it plays a lot better than it sounds. Add a star if you're a die-hard ""Apes"" fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best...prequel...ever!,"The film surprised me, when it was announced, I did not trust a lot. The 1968 classic is a Mastepiece, and over the years have been made ​​horrible remakes, and I thought this would be no different. After I saw the movie, I apologize to Ruppert Wart and Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa. The movie is fantastic, it's one of the best reboots ever made, is super loyal to the 1968 classic stories and characters, but also focuses on reality, what would happen if super intelligent monkeys started a revolution against humans today? The monkeys are not smart suddenly because of magic or steroids, it was all genetics, and it was not on purpose that any scientist wanting to be famous starts creating intelligent apes, it was all an accident (see the movie and will understand better). After an accident in the lab because of an experiment of a medicine, all the monkeys are killed, and a scientist finds a baby ape and brings him to save his life. After a few days the scientist begins to see that the little monkey has an advanced intelligence. Months pass and the monkey grows to a fantastic evolution, that is where the movie touches a very good point, evolution. After a domestic accident, the poor monkey is taken away, and we see at the beginning of that evolution becomes revolution. The cast is solid, James Franco is an actor who is fantastic here, but he is not the main character, but Andy Serkys that is the primate Ceasar. Another point where the film does a good touch, does not focus attention on the human but in primates. The monkeys are computerized and so much realistic, Andy Serkis becomes a monkey in person.

Like Caesar, Nim is taken away from his mother in captivity, he learns sign language like Caesar, he bonds to the humans like Caesar, he eventually starts to show his chimp aggression like Casear, he gets put back into captivity like Caesar, he gets sent to a medical research lab like Caesar. The only difference is the ending. Nim does not start a chimp uprising like Caesar. I was ready to cheer an uprising, since it was criminal what was done to Nim, but fortunately he gets some comfort in the end, better late than never.Anyway, Project Nim would make a great double bill with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic movie with great action and very interesting plot,"The only other planet of the apes movie i have seen is the rubbish Tim Burton one from 2001. This one was definitely a whole lot better.The premise of this movie is that apes are captured from the wild and experimented on in a lab. James Franco, a doctor at the lab, develops a cure for Alzheimer's and tests it on a primate specimen that he took from the lab, who he names Caesar. The ape shows signs of becoming very clever, acting almost like a human and also displaying intelligence much more than any other ape. Eventually, Franco's character Will is forced to commit Caesar to an ape home where Caesar is out of place and treated badly. This causes Caesar to use his intelligence to lead his fellow apes on an uprising.The plot of this film is very interesting and the acting is alright, with John Lithgow, Freida Pinto, Brian Cox and Tom Felton (Harry Potter's Draco Malfoy) supporting Franco. However Andy Serkis' motion capture performance as Caesar the ape outshines everyone, proving to really be good as CGI characters.

James Franco stars as a scientist who's father, Jon Lithgow, suffers from Alzheimer's, and he rapidly tries to create a cure, but after testing it and it supposedly works on a chimpanzee, the mother goes crazy before the cure can be patented and financially supported and the offspring, who has the benefits of this drug as well, becomes Caesar, who in the fourth film in the original series, led the Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. The film's special effects, while they sometimes look cheap, do the trick, aided by a tremendous performance by Andy Serkis doing motion capture as Caesar, and a thrilling ride once the apes get loose and rise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very good movie,"At first I was sceptical watching the movie but I said what the heck I am home alone on new year's eve and watched it. Well I must say the movie is beautifully done and gets 8/10 in my books. Of course for me a horde of apes escaping a big city like New York would be impossible, but with the given police force totally feasible. The CGI is absolutely magnificent but the movie itself is not really about effects but about looking within ourselves and the truth that holds about humanity. We lost ourselves and with it our souls, we cut corners where we should not. We are egoists and think we are immortals, we like to think that we are the only one's in this world. This movie is exposing the danger we pose to ourself by trying to change nature and control it thinking we are immune to anything. Materials and profits made us lose our humanity and that will be our downfall eventually in the real life. Be it a total war or total pollution or even a lab virus. Kansas song illustrates it better: We are just dust in the wind... and yet we play God (and no i am not religious)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
