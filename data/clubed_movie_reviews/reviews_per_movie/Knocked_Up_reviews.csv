"Vulgar, Sure, But Certainly Not Stupid.","I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like ""Mr. Woodcock"" and ""Good Luck Chuck,"" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.""Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!""""He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!""No. Die.Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Clever Writing ....,"Although the subject matter wasn't really appealing to me, the critics and general audience reviews are right: this is a very well made movie. The acting is great, the plot fast-paced, the characters believable and the dialog witty and clever. It reminds me of Superbad - another movie that I would never normally see, but one which wins you over by it's sheer (albeit crude) brilliance.The basic premise is simple: a young TV reporter celebrates a promotion by getting drunk and inadvertently pregnant. The father-to-be is a good natured, pot-head slacker who has no money. When she decides to have the baby, she's not sure what her relationship with the father should be... and the movie progresses from there.It's a simple plot but the dialog is what makes this movie shine. No matter the scene, it was always fun to hear what the characters were going to say. Even though most of them were one-dimensional, the dialog made them seem human and easy to relate to. A fast-movie plot also kept the movie moving along - something was always happening and there was never a dull moment.While there is a certain level of crudity throughout, the movie is generally lighthearted and innocent. It's a fun movie to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Decent, but I don't see what all of the fuss is about.","I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the ""instant classic"" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn't get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn't have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann's unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, cliché drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clichéd, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don't mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Over-hyped,"This film is about a successful TV presenter who gets pregnant after a drunken one night stand.""Knocked Up"" tells a story that a lot of people fear, and a lot of people can relate to. The two individuals in the spotlight are very incompatible with each other, and yet they try to be in a relationship for the sake of the unborn baby. The film s funny at times, but most of the time the five pot heads are far too annoying to be entertaining. Watching them acting irresponsibly like spoiled teenagers is not my idea of comedy.I cannot help compare ""Knocked Up"" with ""This Is 40"", which is the sequel of this. I found ""This Is 40"" funny but fragmented; ""Knocked Up"" is cohesive but not so funny. I think it is over-hyped. If it wasn't for Katherine Heigl's charm and Leslie Mann's attitude, ""Knocked Up"" would have been a bore.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I can see what people admire and praise about it - but I think some are going too far.,"""Knocked Up"" is a well-made, enjoyable comedy about the consequences of an unprotected one-night stand. It has dual lessons for its lead characters: Seth Rogen has to learn to grow up and accept responsibility and Katherine Heigl has to choose between a professional life as a television interviewer or a possibly less rewarding (as she sees it) life as a stay-at-home mom.And because it's Judd Apatow, he handles the sex gags carefully and with enough maturity that it doesn't become another stale sex comedy. But I think some people jumping on the Apatow bandwagon are so eager to praise him as the ""Savior"" of the sex-comedy genre that they are overlooking some of the film's flaws.First of all, if we're going to be picky, the comedy isn't very consistent. Which is OK - I'd prefer it that way - but when you see reviews touting it as ""the funniest movie of the year,"" expectations can't help but build.I didn't think the acting was as good as in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" Seth Rogen is a great supporting actor - but I find him rather irritating as a lead character. His revelation at the end of the film, too, isn't very believable - they spend so much time focusing on his life as a slacker that the transition between him being a man-child and accepting responsibility is as realistic as a ""Rocky"" training montage; he has a heartfelt talk with his dad (Harold Ramis) and suddenly he's 100% willing to become committed. Okay.I'm not a big Heigl fan, but she fit the role well here. Paul Rudd was the real scene-stealer, though. But he's thrown off-balance by the casting of Apatow's wife - can he PLEASE stop putting her in all his movies? She can't act.Overall, this is an OK comedy - better than most of its genre - and the drama is more realistic than most sex comedies, but some people were so willing to jump on it as a ""masterpiece"" of its genre before it even came out that the hype just killed it for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny and Entertaining,"When Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is promoted in E! Television, she goes to a night-club to celebrate with her older married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). Alison meets the pothead reckless Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and while having a small talk with him, Debbie's husband Pete (Paul Rudd) calls her to tell that their daughter has chickenpox. Debbie immediately leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand. Ben does not use condom and eight weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant. She calls Ben and they decide to try to stay together and have the baby. But the immatures Ben needs to grow-up first to raise a family of his own.""Knocked Up"" is a funny comedy and an entertaining romance with a charming cast. Seth Rogen and the gorgeous Katherine Heigl show a perfect chemistry with their charismatic characters, very well supported by Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, and I laughed a lot with the most hilarious situations. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ligeiramente Grávidos"" (""Slightly Pregnants"")",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A simple story is made into a very entertaining comedy,"Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.Seth Rogen does an excellent job, I'm glad he's been given the chance to be the lead in such a big film. And Katherine Heigl is equally entertaining. The two of them are so great together, they're just so much fun to watch on screen. The supporting actors are also wonderful. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are perfect together. And I think Kristen Wiig steals the show with her small yet hysterical role as one of the workers at E!.When people go to see this they'll want to compare it with 40 Year Old Virgin. Though I'm not a big fan of comparing movies to other movies, I guess I'll have to go through with it. For me, 40 Year Old Virgin is a funnier movie, but Knocked Up is a better written film and it has more heart to it. Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Knocked Up, on the other hand, uses its set up and continues the story throughout the film, developing its characters.So, Knocked Up is a very enjoyable film, it has some big laughs (I particularly love the side story with the bearded roommate) but its also very sweet at times. I'm sure people will love it. See the movie and you'll get more than just laughs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"This has some good moments, but it's been really hyped","Well, this flick IS better and more original than your average Hollywood fare. That's not saying much, though. I saw previews for five summer movies before seeing this film and all of them looked horrible. After seeing The 40-Year-Old Virgin I had high hopes for this movie, but it didn't measure up. I wasn't expecting them to be alike, but I hoped that Knocked Up would be as touching and funny.Unfortunately I found this movie inconsistent and the main relationship didn't make sense to me. The relationship between the two main characters seemed like wish fulfillment on the male director's or writer's part. I couldn't see her with him and I couldn't see her tolerating his teenage stoner lifestyle, however sweet he might be. It reminded me of that Seinfeld episode when George Costanza tells an attractive woman in the diner ""I'm unemployed and I live with my parents"" and she turns to him with interest and says ""Hiiii!"" or something like that.In contrast, the relationship in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was sweet, quirky, enjoyable and much more realistic. All the characters were great and the jokes in that movie came thick and fast. There were a number of very funny moments in this film too, but there were also scenes that were very unrealistic or boring--i.e., the one with the bouncer outside the club, and part of the Vegas scene. I really wanted to smack the married sister and tell her to get a life. If I were Paul Rudd's character I would have been out of there pronto.I did like it when the guys started to get into the back-and-forth insults that they used in TFYOV--I just wish there had been more of that. The two are both basically movies that accept and welcome nerdiness, quirkiness and difference, which is great. This one just didn't pull it off so well. I'd say, however, that if you're a teenage boy who likes to toke, you're going to love it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Is it me, or was this simply over-rated?","A ""fairly unattractive"" man. Who smokes weed. Has no life. Living off a compensation benefit. Meets a ""pretty"" woman. At a club. They both get drunk. Have sex. Woman becomes pregnant...You get the drift, I could actually write this review in the same context all the way through. This is probably as close as to how the film has been constructed.I can't say that I enjoyed the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" in fact, I thought it was boring, crap storyline, segments were funny, with random scenes and locations which had no relevance to the film to fill in extra minutes for your money, and so on, so forth. This is EXACTLY what happens in ""Knocked Up"".What annoys me, is the fact that this film could of been so good. I wanted it to make that extra yard to make me fall out of my seat, so, so, so much. It just reminded me of crap sex, an ongoing ordeal that you think will come to something, and just when you think things are going your way, it all flops down.I can't completely slag this film though, as Seth Rogan shows what a talented actor he can be in funny situations. I think he will be one to watch out for in the future for sure. He has some brilliant one liners it has to be said! Katherine Heigl also done a blinding performance, its such a shame, because the storyline and little plot-holes completely screwed them both over. They are big actors for the big comic bound occasion, its a shame they were blindfolded and given shocking scenario's to work with.Of course it has its moments, but nothing that makes you go to pub with your mates and chat about it. I was very whole-heartedly disappointed with this film. So much speculation ruins a good thing ya' know? Possibly the most over-rated comedy of 2007. Yes. Down to the shoddy direction of the film. Absolutely. Possibly showcasing the new coming talent of comedies for the future. Maybe. With the right ingredients.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Poor Messages, Poorer Film.","Granted there are a few funny moments in this film, but it really lacks the warmth (and dare I say heart) of say, 40 Year Old Virgin. Seth Rogen is too grimy to ever really be likable, the rest of the performances are average at best. As a whole the flimsy storyline is pretty darn bad, let's face it.What worries me is the film's messages. 1. That it's OK to smoke bongs all day and be a perpetual underachiever, and 2. that unplanned pregnancies end happily ever after.Sorry, but a film whose laughs come from a 6 year a old girl saying ""penis"" and ""prick"" is an insult to everyone's intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Stuck in No Man's Land - A ""half comedy"" ?","After watching Knocked Up I left with a feeling that I wanted SOMETHING more. Yes, it sure had good bits of that 40 Year Old Virgin type humor, and it was also a lot sweeter and more serious than 40 YOV...but that is where I think it failed. The movie had no identity.I wasn't sure how to handle the characters. Was I supposed to identify with them and take them seriously? Or was I supposed to laugh at how goofy they were? There was a little bit of both, but because of that I was never really able to get into the groove of it. In this case two halves did NOT make a whole.Sure, it was good for a few laughs, the acting was fine (not outstanding), the production was fine (again, not outstanding)...but I don't think it was worth seeing in the theaters. It just left me in limbo...I couldn't really get into the comedy because these were SERIOUS issues they explored, and I also couldn't take the characters and their problems as seriously as I wanted to because of the wacky 40 YOV humor. Knocked Up tried to be two things at once, and because of that it lost lots of power on both sides of the coin.Maybe people like this new kind of ""half comedy""...but I couldn't really get into it. And it just seemed to drag ON AND ON. Especially because from what I heard there was supposed to be constant gut busting humor...but to be honest, I don't think this is nearly as good as 40 YOV, because it takes itself too seriously. You knew what 40 YOV was from the start, right up the goofy song ending...they kept you in that comedy mode. But Knocked Up seemed to get caught in no man's land to me...and just couldn't satisfy either my want for comedy or my want for romance/drama.Overall it's not a bad film, but I'd wait for it on DVD and a lazy, rainy day :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Very funny, very incisive look at modern existence but, for those who like their fun good and clean, pick another film to see","Allison (Katherine Heigl) is a rising star in the entertainment television news business. Having just been promoted to an on-camera role, she is ready to party hearty and celebrate. Her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann) is glad to help out, so the two of the them get dolled up and head for a trendy nightclub. Once there, Allison goes to the bar to buy some drinks but she has difficulty attracting the bartender's attention. Enter Ben (Seth Rogen). He helps Allison by arranging for her to get her beers without delay. Allsion is grateful and heads back to her table. Ben also returns to his circle of friends, where his pals chide him for not making more of a play for the obviously beautiful Allison. Bolstered by their suggestions, he approaches Allison again and they make a connection, albeit one that works better because of Allison's growing intoxication. They somehow end up spending the night together. But, in the morning, reality rears its ugly face. Allsion is a pretty lady with a great job and Ben is a consummate slacker with no ambitions or desire to change his present circumstances. Although they go their separate ways, fate throws them a curveball. Eight weeks later, Allsion learns that she is pregnant. Is there any possible future for Allison and Ben, that includes a baby? This is a very funny film, although the humor is as eyebrow-raising as it comes. The cast, quite large, is very nice, with Rogen doing a great job as the less-than-perfect suitor for Allison. Special mention should also be extended to Paul Rudd for his simply tremendous performance as Debbie's husband, a performance of humor and empathy. The whole production looks great, with well-picked costumes, scenery, and photography. Again, the script is the true champion here, as the story shines a bright, probing light on the realities of marriage, casual sex, money, and success. Although one would have to say, in the final analysis, that the film's conclusion is unrealistic, it is a very upbeat one, indeed. In essence, this is the brave new world of romantic comedy, told from the male perspective, as exhibited in such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin. As such, it is supremely funny and insightful but, if you prefer fun that is good and clean, you should pick another film, for this one treads into the limits of raunchiness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
it is shockingly funny but some might feel tricked to discover that there are more pockets of drama and romance than the target audience would normally sign up for,"As it is irreverently and grossly hilarious, don't make the mistake of watching this with your parents.Seth Rogen (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) plays ultimate slacker Ben who gets the camera-friendly and otherwise level-headed E! News correspondent Alison (played by Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy) pregnant. Astonishingly, Alison decides to try and make it work with Ben despite having zilch in common, for their baby's sake.Rogen plays his character well, with no insecurity and with a wicked amount of confidence playing Heigl's unlikely beau. The kids who play Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) children are Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's (the director) real children, and they are incredibly charming and deliver their lines without any annoying trace of self-consciousness.While Knocked Up is marketed as a comedy grossfest, it is surprisingly also much more. For the most part, it is shockingly funny but some might feel tricked to discover that there are more pockets of drama and romance than the target audience would normally sign up for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"No Pregnant Pauses in A Sharp, Often Hilarious Character-Driven Comedy with Loads of Heart","Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's ""Love With the Proper Stranger"", about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plot line to the point where each makes the other more resonant.Familiar faces from ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" return in this movie beginning with Seth Rogen, who proves he can carry a movie as Ben. Despite outward appearances to the contrary, his shaggy-dog demeanor and sometimes piercing self-deprecation provide much of the heart in the picture. As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likability on ""Grey's Anatomy"" to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in ""Virgin"", is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with ""Virgin"". A running time of 129 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant are the deliberate references to ""Virgin"" in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I was disappointed,"I don't know. Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing 40 Year Old Virgin, and seeing the rating on this site. There were a lot of funny lines in the movie, but no hilarious ones. There weren't really any super funny scenes. No rich set-ups and pay-offs. No innovative photography. Was there a message? Must have missed it.Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed it. I like the quirky quasi-ad-libbed style; it worked in The 40 Y.O.V., e.g. the donkey in Tijuana conversation. The problem is that this entire movie is scripted (or not) this way. I think it made the movie lose direction at times.My biggest disappointment was that I wanted to see a great comedy, but ended up seeing a so-so relationship movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Young America In The Eternal City,"As I lived part of my life in the US, both coasts. I was able to read between the lines of the dubbed-into-Italian breakthrough Judd Apatow comedy and laugh. Most people dismissed it at the movie theater in Rome where I saw it. Thought it was vulgar and old hat. Vulgar? The Italians of the Massimo Boldi comedies thought it was vulgar?! ""Knocked Up"", besides making me laugh out loud and amusing me no end taught me a really important cultural lesson. We, in Italy, ride a very high (non existent) horse. I think the time has come for us to get off the horse and start looking at ourselves for what we really are - like we used to in Dino Risi, Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli's films. ""Knocked Up"" is ultra sophisticated and yet, it reached a vast audience in the States because the sophistication is so amazingly smart. Seth Rogen is a real find. His eyes when he realizes Katherinre Heigl is going to stay with him that first and fatal night made me fall in love with his unlikely character. Katherine Heigl is another incredible discovery. Superb and stunning and classy to boot. Now, all this praise and I haven't even seen it in its original English version. I can't wait.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Judd Apatow work since Freaks & Geeks,"I saw this recently and left with a stomach ache from laughing so hard. I watched 40 Year Old Virgin again to make a fair assessment, and i found this to be funnier. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Judd Apatow's work, but this to me was the best thing since Freaks & Geeks. Apatow has a brilliant way of letting the audience get to know all of the characters(anyone who has seen his stuff will know that it is a lot and usually the same people)which gives you the feeling that you are a part of what's going on, and makes you interested. By now, I am sure everyone is familiar with the plot summary. Couple meets, hooks up and surprise she's pregnant. I find it amusing that some of the previous comments mention that it it such an unbelievable concept. Well of course it is, it's a movie!!! But come on, is it not entirely true that someone would hook up on a celebratory night out with someone they normally wouldn't? Of course they would! Thus, the meeting of Alison( Ketherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen)seems so genuine and awkward. The aftermath is the best part though. Since this is a movie, trying to make the best out of a bad situation is a given. The getting to know someone AFTER they have gotten you pregnant, meeting family and friends, realizing the many differences you have, etc. All of this is explored is very realistic fashion, especially the emotion and the trying to have sex while six months along!! Of course the whole thing can't be comedy. With so many other characters to help take the focus off the main two, there will be parts of the story that are more ""serious"". True is the case towards the end with Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) having a falling out. This is a very nice, but what seems eternally long, scene about the importance of understanding in a relationship. Could that be the moral of our story Alison and Ben, understanding and acceptance? I think so. Naturally the only thing left is birth and the happily ever after. The hospital scene is definitely NOT for the squeamish. I really hope those parts are not cut from the movie, because they received some of the most reactions. I found this whole seen to be painfully realistic, more so than any other movie has dared to be. Finally, the happy ending is upon us and the closing credits are filled with family snapshots and even childhood photos of cast and crew, very cute. So to you the potential viewer I say that this is an exceptional comedy. It is definitely the funniest thing I have seen this year. I will definitely be seeing it again to see all the parts I missed while laughing. And I must say I was absolutely delighted to see both Martin Starr (do NOT leave the theater during the scenes with his girlfriend) and Loudon Wainwright. Put one more in the win column for Judd Apatow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Typical, Typical, Typical","I predicted the outcome of this movie before the film even began. It is the same plot as so many films that have come before it. I think one of the problems I had was the fact I could not relate myself to the characters. The burn-out, perverted stoner who seems to have no real connection with the rest of the world. The characters to me are over the top creepy most of the time. The movie gets a little slow at times also, and sometimes it feels like they tried to drag it out so it would seem longer. However, it is a funny movie and a lot of the jokes are good. It is about as funny as 40 Year Old Virgin, but 40 Year Old Virgin is a much better film on the whole. I expect Seth Rogan to be a star for a long time, because he is very good at looking stupid and quirky, which makes the movie better. His blank facial expressions are just great in many scenes. Its not just a horrible film, but its not exactly great. Average is the best word I can use here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good, but not great","I had heard so much about this movie that it was nearly impossibly for i to live up the the expectations I had. Some people even called it the funniest movie of all time. It was number 1 at the box office for weeks. It made nearly 150 million dollars. I finally got it from netflix last night and sat down for a viewing. My opinion is that it's a fine movie, but certainly not the funniest movie ever made.The plot sees simple enough. Slacker goes to a bar and has a one night stand with a stranger. Stranger gets pregnant and they struggle to cope with the situation they're in. The slacker realizes that his partying ways are about to come to an end, and she is terrified that she'll lose her job as an on-air E network personality. The film follows them through the course of her 9 month pregnancy, and introduces us to a zany cast of characters along the way.For those who have seen the film, perhaps the funniest moment was the cameo of ""Stephen Hawking"" or their constant harassment over a roommate who decided to go a full year without cutting his hair or shaving. A lot of what makes this film work on a personal level is the ability of the audience to identify with the characters. Most people know a slacker, a demanding wife, a husband who will do anything to get out of the house, etc. Watching this film was almost equivalent to going back in time when I was in college (sans the drugs).Overall, I give this a 7/10. Definitely worth renting, but not as good as the 40 Year Old Virgin.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
fantastic,"Knocked Up is a comedy about pregnancy, love, and marriage, that has far more intelligence and emotional depth to it than somewhat its flippant title would suggest. Ben (Rogen) is a layabout bum who lives with his stoner friends, ""working"" on a celebrity porn movie website. Alison (Heigl) has just been promoted at E!, and when she heads out to celebrate, their worlds collide with disastrous and of course hilarious consequences.The comedy is clever and insightful, loaded with little self-referential moments and pop culture references (the Munich one is particularly awesome), and while it occasionally veers toward the puerile, the movie's subject matter ensures that the humour remains considered and intelligent for the most part. The performances are outstanding, but not just in terms of comic timing. Rogen appears built for this sort of balanced role as he realises that he has to grow up to meet the challenges of relationships and parenthood, and Heigl is just as effective as she learns to accommodate Ben's lifestyle and releases her grip on her career. The support from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann is also brilliant. While their conflict-ridden marriage doesn't make them the greatest of role models for Ben and Alison, it certainly provides lots of laughs, and the clashes between Mann's overly paranoid Debbie and Rudd's laid-back Pete provide an interesting projection of how Ben & Alison's relationship could turn out.The Rudd & Rogen moments make for some of the movie's better lines, but their humour is finely balanced with that emotional depth that I mentioned before, making the characters far more than punchline machines, which benefits the movie immeasurably. The awkward intimacy of Ben & Alison's almost-forced relationship also provides touching and comic moments, as Apatow examines what happens ""when life doesn't care about your plan"". Even the serious, emotional scenes are laced with a sort of ironic, bittersweet humour, which again gives the characters a sense of realism but also makes the movie that bit more comfortable and reassuring.A subject that could have been treated with a crass touch, Apatow remains in tune with his previous effort, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and chooses to focus on the impact the pregnancy has on the lives of the characters, allowing their actions and interactions to create the comedy as they come to terms with their new situation. His light touch makes Knocked Up touching, insightful, and very, very, funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not good, not bad,","While this is not by any chance a movie that you will forever remember, it is not bad either.Some parts of the movie seem misplaced, random and unnecessary. The whole story could be told in 30 minutes, yet it drags itself through more than 120. It lacks depth and originality and it is predictable and portraits a society I hope does not exist.However, there's not only bad things about this movie. The cast is decent and the characters are funny. You'll be left wondering why some of them are even there, but they're funny nonetheless. Some jokes are really corny, but others are good. Some characters are really plain, but others develop through the movie and it is good watching that.Overall, this is not the kind of movie I want to rewatch, but it kept me entertained for 2 hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A (Slightly Above) Average Rom-Com,"Knocked Up started strong and I understood the ""uproariously funny"" part, but as the movie progressed it became more and more like every other rom-com. Seth Rogen looks weird and childish without his big beard he's known for, which I prefer over the mostly shaven look he wears throughout. Luckily, it didn't feel overly dragged on but 2 hours 9 minutes is more than a movie like this should have been. The highlights of Knocked Up wasn't even the romance but Seth Rogen and his friends goofing off and behaving like childish idiots. Paul Rudd's wife was a controlling *****, and I nearly jumped with glee when she was put in her place at the end of the movie. Overall decent, and just barely made it above a 6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Judd Apatow is simply a genius,"I liked Judd Apatow's first comedy,'The 40-Year Old Virgin'.When it comes to comedy,Judd knows exactly how to make people laugh until they beg him to make another movie.'Knocked Up'isn't just funny.It's a smart and refreshing movie that actually teaches a lesson:make sure you wear a condom when you have sex with a woman.But if you want a child,then do whatever that floats in your mind.The one thing that I probably dislike about the movie is it's running time.Even you probably wouldn't want to watch a really funny movie that lasts 129 minutes.But its definitely worth it when it comes to 'Knocked Up' and Judd Apatow.Grab some popcorn,get some friends,and laugh your butt off at this funny and brilliant comedy if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
We Have Seen It Before,"Knocked Up is all about Seth Rogen. He is clearly a fresh voice in Hollywood for the X- Generation and below. His comedy instincts and his timing are reminiscent of the great Albert Brooks (see Modern Romance). This is about Rogen's third or forth time out playing virtually the same character. But it worked for Albert Brooks for 40 years so I guess Rogen has some more time to perfect the character which he already does a brilliant job with. What happens here is Ben Stone, played by Rogen, has a one-night stand with Alison Scott (the ever hot Katherine Heigl). She is an assistant on the E! cable show who rises to reporter just as she discovers she is pregnant so she chooses to hide that fact. The secret isn't easy and isn't helped much by Rogen's character whose out of control life and lack of maturity provide us with consistent laughter. Heigl plays this character to perfection and easily holds he own against Rogen's nuttiness. This is a warm, sweet and very funny film that definitely has its share of comedy moments but there just isn't enough of those moments nor is there enough here that we haven't seen before from the same guys.  Posters for the movie consist of the two main characters in the same mood.

An Character-Driven Joyride of Non-stop Hilarity,"Knocked Up is quite easily one of the best movies I have seen thus far this year. The story takes absolutely no time to be a drawn-out flick where you go, ""Make it stop!"" This movie is non-stop hilarity, a bit crude, but something that you can truly connect with and hits home with a heartwarming story of love and life.The movie has a simple premise: two people who are seemingly ""living the dream""--Alison, an E! Channel Correspondent and Ben, a half-witted, pot-smoking celebrity nude website administrator along with his five estranged friends whom he also lives with--decide to hook up for a fateful one night stand after meeting at a night club. They do the nasty, and the two part ways after that. The story picks up once again 8 weeks later, as Allison finds herself pregnant with what she hilariously discovers to be Ben's child. At once we as the audience sympathize, even empathize with her at her situation with Ben and the pregnancy. As the movie proceeds we find ourselves riding through the radically changing lives of Ben and Alison from the moment that she breaks the news to him that he's the father to when they fall for each other to the ""irreconcilable differences"" and finally to the painful and slow phase of ""growing up"" and facing each other's, as well as their own, fears to accept and uncover the joys of giving life and becoming parents.Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl do a wondrous job of being the two people that ""life came straight at, not caring about their plans"". Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, portraying Alison's brother-in-law and sister, are fantastic supporting cast as we often find parallels between the two couples and how they are something of ""elders"" that show Ben and Alison what it's like to be parents, working both against and for them. Hell, the entire cast is incredible, the comedic timing is impeccable. And Judd Apatow, the man behind the 40 Year Old Virgin, has created yet another heart-warming laugh riot that is its own creation, not simply a rehash of the 40 Year Old Virgin as some would be led to believe.GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It has the perfect cast of comedic actors that makes the word funny an understatement.

Funniest Movie of the Year,"I was non-stop laughing the entire movie. I saw one of the first advanced screenings, so hopefully they don't take too many good scenes out.

If you are looking for a serious drama look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a great comedy similar to Happy Gilmore, Old School or 40 year old virgin, look no further.

Modern romance isn't pretty,"I think there's been a general notion recently that, at least among the mainstream demographic, the Romantic comedy is dead. So with that in mind, there's some good news and bad news. The good news is that the genre has been saved by a gifted young writer named Judd Apatow. The bad news: It isn't very pretty.It's sad but true. His film is crude and does very little to restore confidence to the institution of fatherhood. The PTA in this child's future school district is rightfully going to be frightened to death.At the same time, ""Knocked Up"" probably comes closer to portraying modern romance more than any attempt at romantic comedy in recent years. As sad as it is to admit, romance these days is more about drunken hook-ups than it is about screwball-comedy-type courting and today's standard of chivalry might be a guy like Rogen's character, willing to commit to a girl he knocked up instead of Cary Grant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overrated but Still Pretty Damn Funny and Touching,"Pete: Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it doesn't last 22 minutes. It lasts forever.Going into 'Knocked Up' I was expecting a lot. After seeing his last film, the side-split-tingly funny '40 Year Old Virgin', I noticed I was quickly becoming a big Judd Apatow fan. If I were to say 'Knocked Up' met my expectations, I'd be lying. Honestly, I loved it, but I was expecting so much more from it than great one-liners and a good story. I was expecting one of the funniest movies I've seen, and that's not what I got. 'Knocked Up' is very funny, but there's only one or two scenes where the funny level drifts into the 'hysterical' zone, so to speak.The story is kind of familiar. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is an out-of-shape ambition-less pothead. In most cultures we'd call him a loser. He and his less classy but very entertaining friends; Jay, Jason, Jonah and Martin, run a website that tells you exactly how far into movies hot celebrities get naked. Too bad none of them ever heard of Mr. Skin.com, a revelation they have later in the movie and find disheartening. One night, Ben and his buddies are at a club getting sh__t-faced, and Ben meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an extremely attractive E! news anchor, and they have a drunken hook-up. Eight weeks later, Alison finds out she's pregnant due to Ben's condom mishap. Like anyone with a brain in their head could have predicted, Alison tells Ben, and Ben decides to take on the responsibilities of being a father. The two slowly start to fall in love with each other during the ordeal.As far as the acting goes, I was pleasantly surprised. Seth Rogen surprised the hell out of me in his capability as a leading man. His acting isn't half-bad and he's very convincing in his role consistently through-out the film. Rogen is also hilarious for the most part, in both his dialogue and screen presence. Katherine Heigl also gives a merit-able performance. She's not nearly as funny as Rogen, but she's not over-the-top like most female leads in these kinda movies (like Jennifer Aniston in 'The Break-Up' -- pbbt!) I've heard from many people Heigl is good in 'Grey's Anatomy', but I wouldn't know, I don't watch that stupid friggin' show. Leslie Mann is humorous as Alison's annoying sister, and Paul Rudd is excellent in his role as Alison's sister's husband who compares marriage to a very long and unfunny episode of 'Everybody Loves Raymond'. Rudd, whose proved himself with commendable work in 'The Shape of Things' and 'The Cider House Rules', is without question the best actor in the film and his performance adds a lot to it. 'Knocked Up' also has a number of interesting cameos from people like Ryan Seacrest, Jessica Alba, Steve Carrell, and my personal favorite, Mo Collins as a gynecologist.Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen's writing is perhaps the strongest aspect of the movie in most cases. Apatow and Rogen provide some ingenious one-liners that in more ways than one are the saving grace of the movie when it gets kinda boring towards the final 20 minutes. But that's the thing -- 'Knocked Up' relies on one-liners instead of big extravagant physical comedy sequences to make it funny. This is where one of the biggest problems of the film lies. This would be fine if the one-liners were more prolific than they are here. There's just too many dull blocks of time in 'Knocked Up' to make this type of comedic approach work as successfully as it could.You may think by reading my review, I hated the film, when in fact I really quite enjoyed it. I was just sorely disappointed in it. There are many parts in the film that are genuinely funny and the film isn't sappy in it's dramatic moments, it's just such a let-down from '40 Year-Old Virgin', 'Borat', or some of the other REALLY good comedies that have been released in the last two years. But there is a lot more to like about the movie, than there is to dislike about it. I recommend it to anyone looking to have a fun time at the movie theater in a year where movies just flat-out suck. In a summer where the god-awful 'Spider-Man 3' and sleep-inducing 'Pirates 3' lead the box office, 'Knocked Up' is a freakin' godsend. Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Boy Meets Girl"" with a twist in a modern love story","KNOCKED UP is an extremely entertaining film which has real dialog that rings true for singles who meet today, have sex and then discover that a baby can throw their whole lives off, as well as take them on an unexpected journey that neither would have dreamed of. Seith Rogen is such a modern man in every context of the word-out to get screwed, have a good time and just""party hearty"" until Katherine Heigl steps into his life through a bar encounter and changes everything. The chemistry between Rogen and Heigl just feels right on the screen.The male bonding between Rogen and Paul Rudd is terrific to watch as at last each has a male friend that truly understands one another. The frat house atmosphere of the ""party males"" rang true and their never ending beer busts, porn films and wanting to get laid are real to men today, as well as yesterday. Men and women issues come out on the screen with a great sense of frustration each sex feels for the other but KNOCKED UP delivers these issues in an amusing fashion.The audience in Westwood (Los Angeles) really enjoyed the film and the laughs kept rolling along with the picture.

Knocked Out Early.,"A whirlwind one-night stand between loser Seth Rogen and aspiring Entertainment Channel interviewer Katherine Heigl leads to a surprise pregnancy that changes each of their lives, and seemingly everyone else's lives, forever with would-be heartfelt and hilarious results. Another example of the one-joke pony that would not die as ""Knocked Up"" is a vulgar, mean-spirited, and uneven mess which puts an admittedly likable cast into a cinematic nightmare of epically pretentious and interminable proportions. Basic sitcom ideas that are not funny are randomly replaced with sudden dramatic turns that are sadly more laugh-inducing than the actual waning attempts at humor.

Good Heart Doesn't Save Shaky Plot,"Please know that I'm rooting like crazy for Judd Apatow to be an enormous success after the way NBC mishandled his brilliant ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and because I enjoyed ""The 40-Year Old Virgin."" However, ""Knocked Up"" misses the mark in several ways.The main plot point, as others have mentioned, is a little too hard to swallow.*SPOILER* (I wonder if scenes that illuminated why Heigl's character fell for Rogan's or how Rogan's character suddenly landed a job wound up on the cutting room floor.) *END OF SPOILER*The depiction of Rogan and his roommates are a sort of comedic fantasy of what it's like to be four, crude, single guys sharing a house. That would be fine, but it just ain't that funny (for the most part). As likable an actor as Seth Rogan is, it was pretty hard for me to like him in this, despite that plot contortions to elicit the audience's sympathy.What saves this film from failure is the provocative, original dialog in the more serious moments that explores relationship issues and gender differences. Plus, the acting is good all around.Maybe this film is better if you go see it as stoned as some of its characters are.

A Comedy Classic? Not Quite....,"As with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" I thought ""Knocked Up"" was funny and a I had a good time with it, but it didn't warrant the rapturous response it has received from critics, or the inexplicably high rating it has received here at IMDb.Frankly, the joke about adult men refusing to grow up has worn thin, and not much more comic mileage can be squeezed from it. Also, it's a shame that a movie people are congratulating for its frankness and candidness doesn't have the balls to treat pregnancy the way it really is. It would have been nice in a movie about the beautiful act of bringing a child into the world for the filmmakers to extend that idea of beauty to the woman's body in pregnancy, but instead we have a gorgeous actress who never once convincingly looks, moves or acts like a pregnant woman, and who even looks gorgeous while she's in the middle of delivery no less.But, when you consider the typical Hollywood comedy being churned out these days, many of which I saw previews for when I went to see this film, you can understand why a movie like this, that has sharp acting and writing, and whose laughs come from well-delivered lines and good timing rather than juvenile pratfalls and fart jokes, is blowing like a fresh breeze through our summer movie theatres.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny Bits, But No Classic","The most interesting lesson learned from Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is one about the statistics of a tomatometer. The film has scored 91% ripe tomatoes on Rotten Tomatoes, usually an indication that a movie is truly excellent. Films like ""The Godfather"" or ""Casablanca"" score 90% or more ripe tomatoes. However, the assumption that a high score guarantees a moving, enlightening cinematic experience is unfounded. What the 90% rating means is that most critics thought the movie was worth seeing, not necessarily that it was a superior film. This seems to be the case for ""Knocked Up""a decidedly mediocre yet watchable movie with the good fortune of being wedged between releases of ""Spiderman 3"" and ""The Transformers"" and its ilk so that it can cash in on whatever genre elements that separate it from those tiresome actioners. In short, despite its high ratings, critics thought the film was decent (probably because they're tired of watching action movies based on children's' cartoons) but not excellent.""Knocked Up"" is exactly this. This highly formulaic frat-boy romantic comedy has some well drawn moments, but ultimately it's an all quite forgettable tale of boy meets girl, loses girl, grows up, gets girl back. Although, one thing that is not entirely forgettable is the tenuous credibility of the film's premise, which involves a coupling of the most unlikely pair of people, a peculiar glossing over of character motivations (why no abortion?), and an affirmation of traditional family structures and value of conformity worthy of a TV sitcom.Also, with the exception of a few truly inspired moments, the comedy of ""Knocked Up"" relies on crude, sophomoric potty humor that has found broad acceptance thanks to films and TV shows such as ""American Pie"" and ""South Park."" Although it should be noted that gross-out comedies were just as prominent in the 1980s (""Porky's,"" ""Caddyshack""), which makes their popularity now a bit confounding considering how stale the jokes have become by now. Granted the gags of ""Knocked Up"" are mostly verbal not graphic and a predicated on the embarrassment of social awkwardness rather than grossness for its own sake. In Apatow's film the characters refer to their antics with frankness, as when they describe how they've managed to pass on pink eye to nearly everyone in the household via flatulence. Fortunately, Apatow spares us an explicit depiction. Unfortunately, either way (verbal or graphic) the gag isn't funny. Certainly some audience members will get a chuckle out of their repartee because they can identify with the characters, situation, and/or the obsession with bodily functions from their own childhood. But the humor in farting on someone's pillow is for 10 year olds. And a movie about a couple dealing with an unwanted pregnancy is for adults. So, although it's not very upsetting that some guys in the audience might see this joke on the screen and reminisce about a more carefree time in their lives, it is disturbing that professional filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors see fit to include such banality in their movies rather than demanding higher standards of wit and insight from each other and themselves. It's troubling to consider how much money these people spent (and how much they've made) making this movie when you they felt the need to include fart jokes in it. I for one could do better. I guess a lot of other people could too.But perhaps most confounding of all is the few moments of wit and satire that make the film worth seeing: why didn't the makers insist on being clever throughout the movie. For example, in an interview with her boss Katherine Heigl's character is promoted to on-camera interviewer to the consternation of one of her female colleague. Her pointed off-hand mumblings (""Yeah, I was so surprised too."") are precious, as are her boss's gentle but persistent suggestions about ""tightening up."" Scenes like these, which are too few and far between in a two hour plus comedy, make this a decent, watchable movie. But, don't be fooled by all those shiny red tomatoes. It's no ""Casablanca.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hey IZZIE you got some splainin to do!,"I'm not a fan of most comedies. I love to laugh and I have a good subversive sense of humor, but most American comedies leave me especially cold. So I decided to read up on what the critics had to say about ""Knocked up."" They all loved it  overwhelmingly so! I was very disappointed! Not just in the movie but in the critics! Usually I can go to Rotten Tomatoes and agree with the average rating given by the dozens of America's critics. Maybe it's just a generational issue. I'm geriatric; old but not yet ancient. Maybe if I'd seen this when I was twenty or thirty I would have found it hilarious. Maybe most of the critics are young too; actually I'm sure they are. I really don't want to have to read AARP's movie reviews, because I know lots of old fogies who wouldn't be seen dead in movies I like.What I discovered  too late  was that people over 45 gave this movie thumbs down. So I was right, it is a generational thing. Young people like to watch themselves and humanity portrayed as shallow; feckless; and amoral. Us older farts are bored to death by it.Watching a movie about men permanently stuck in adolescence leaves me cold. It's the same with watching movies about drunks or drug addicts. What's funny about emotional retards? There's no pathos about pathetic people! The one organ that can get us to evolve is the Brain! Watching people abuse theirs sobers me right up, and that makes laughing hard! Watching a movie about a vibrant, gorgeous woman apparently not intelligent enough to know what her zillion other options were, other than to have sex with a Neanderthal  even when she's not seriously sh*t faced  and then to try and make it work with the moron set my teeth on edge! What's funny about stupidity?But then this is the woman who plays ""Izzy"" on Greys anatomy, the one who fell in love with a terminally ill patient of hers, killed him off while trying to save him, and is now in the arms of the only married friend of hers! Not the sharpest morality wise!Watching Kathy Heigl diminish her star quality in this way saddens me. It reminded me of Jane Seymour's embarrassing fling in ""Wedding Crashers.""

Plays the Consumerism Game and Releases Astute Communication,"Knocked Up did its applaudably, insightfully wise job. It lured its conventional teen target consumers into a hard-to-miss universal social commentary. It is stunningly enlightening and intelligent, not in a vernacular or high-brow sense but emboldeningly sharp in its assertion of wisdom and sensibility within the mainstream American culture of regular pop culture-driven people of today.Judd Apatow is so honest and wise in his portrayal of the all-American knocked-up situation, that everything makes sense despite how stupid things are. Take for example the most obvious and necessary scene in the movie, which is when Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl get drunk and wind up at her house having sex. Rogen is battling to maintain an erection and fit a condom on while keeping the pace. Heigl gets impatient and says, ""Just do it!"" Of course, she's trying to speed up the fastening of the condom. But also of course, he interprets that as ""Forget the condom, let's go."" This clearly pivotal moment in the movie could so easily have been botched.Apatow is very much above the stick figure story. See, a lot of the time when Hollywood wants to make a commercial movie with a message pertaining to an oft-confronted conflict in or because of American culture, they simply take a classic scenario and fill in the blanks, which would just be character names, place, et cetera. Knocked Up begins with its characters. It also sets the stage for hilarity at their expense. Rogen is not just a horny American Pie party animal. He's an immature Jewish Canadian who is building a website of all the great nudie film scenes with his LA pothead friends. He lives there and doesn't pay taxes, living on an injury settlement. Heigl is a competent, together, motivated woman who is promoted anchorwoman for E! TV and lives with her sister, who is married with a family. She goes to a nightclub because she is rewarding herself with a good time and he goes to the same nightclub because he and his friends spontaneously decided to go. This pairing is an extremely socially and psychologically perceptive comic manipulation. Their occupations and immediate social personalities are specifically and deeply opposing.It's not just a farce, however. It takes itself seriously. Seth Rogen's character's personality is actually a good model for describing the climate of the film. It's hilarious with a whip-smart sense of timing and comeback, yet it isn't simply a breezy clown because there's so much aggression and passion behind it's sense of humor. This leaves room for the most comfortable and considerate poignancy in a Hollywood movie directed at young people in years. All of the couple's fears and mutually irritating idiosyncracies naturally threaten the delicate situation that they try so hard to take with a grain of salt, and their own friends and family become infected with the same feelings between each other. Heigl's sister, played by Leslie Mann, is in the most typical hetero marriage in the world: an unhappy one. And because of their close sibling relationship, their instabilities and uncertainties complement each other.Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen are hilarious together and Jonah Hill, whose natural over- the-topness works well in the subsequent Apatow/Rogen film Superbad, here playing one of Rogen's stoner friends, whips out many a razor-sharp laugh line. The dialogue in this film is so absorbing, hilarious, smart, rhythmic and quotable that David Mamet, Quentin Tarantino, Neil Simon, and Dashiell Hammett are surely seeking to visit Apatow for inspiration. No, I wouldn't rank Knocked Up with the likes of Glengarry Glen Ross, Pulp Fiction, The Goodbye Girl or To Have and Have Not, but it's certainly the cinematic speech beat for the present American pop culture. It has its fingers vigorously pressing against its pulse.I know I'm building this film up a wee bit, and I should in all fairness report that the movie struggles to begin. The first five minutes or so strike dread into one's heart because the rap blaring over the soundtrack, the shots of Rogen and his buddies partying, and Heigl's existing-condition life look like one's in for a simple coasting through Hollywood 16-to-25 age group fluff. Nevertheless it certainly overpowers its brief early expectation by a landslide.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked together,"If this be nepotism, bring it on! ""Knocked Up"" director Jeff Apatow gave his wife, Leslie Mann, and their two young daughters, Iris and Maude Apatow, important supportive roles, and the three pretty much walk away with the movie.San Francisco native Mann plays Debbie, a prim-proper-and-funny control-freak wife, channeling an anachronistic presence from the 'Fifties, the two kids are her spirited and uncontrolled children; add a loving but unhappy husband (Paul Rudd), and there you have the ""model family"" against which the unusual romance of Ben (Seth Rogen) and Alison (Katherine Heigl) takes place.Ben is the most unlikely leading man of recent times, never mind a romantic lead: he is a penniless, unkempt, overweight young man with a kind of charm only drinking (or pot-smoking) buddies could appreciate. Alison is gorgeous, successful, with the relentless sheen Heigl has been radiating with unvaried artificiality in 61 episodes (so far) of ""Grey's Anatomy"" as Izzie Stevens.So what do Ben and Alison have in common? The pregnancy referred to in the movie's indelicate title. The unhappy embryo brings together not only the two unlikely lovers, but also their respective, far-distant tribes. Ben's grossly juvenile would-be webmaster playmates and Alison's should-be proper family (Debbie & Co.) are squeezed together in a variety of ways. Yes, it's a non-starter basic plot, and the surprise is that the movie actually goes to some distance in search of some coherence.Invariably linked with Apatow's ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up"" has mercifully less exaggerated physical comedy than the former, but the same sense of delight in the absurd, even if Apatow goes a long way at times to find it truthiness in the ludicrous. A big plus: mostly appealing (but realistic) characters, easy to care about, with their faults and warts and all.The result is rather pleasant: a mostly funny, occasionally charming, steadily foul-mouthed, frequently well-written, otherwise downright stupid comedy, enjoyable in spite of its unaccountably overblown length of over two hours. It would have made a real good hour-long TV sitcom. Also, ""Knocked Up"" has a first-class score by Joe Henry and Loudon Wainwright III.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Then after one drunken night at the bar, they end up in an one-night stand.Writer/director Judd Apatow is bringing the mj smoking, gross out, inappropriate comedy to a new frontier. It is one of the few pregnancy comedies that work. Seth Rogen is great as a lovable slob. Leslie Mann and her kids are hilarious with Paul Rudd. Where baby comes from has never been funnier.

"Overrated, but still good.....","Im a little surprised by all the negative reviews as I am surprised by all the rave ones this movie got from professional critics.First of all, a lot of people in here said ""I didn't even watch the whole thing, it was awful"", if you didn't watch the entire movie then you are in no position to give an objective review, watch the whole thing first and then you talk, as of right now, your opinion is worthless.I just saw this movie on demand and I thought it was great, not as funny as I thought it would be, but great and with a big heart. What's so hard to believe about a successful beautiful woman falling for some ugly, fat loser???? sure it's not common, but it happens, love is something you can't control, there have been cases of women falling in love with the man who rape them, or women falling for their brothers, or criminals, successful teachers falling for their students or happily married women falling for their son's adolescent friend, it happens, so stop bitching and moaning about it because it may happen to you someday.Stop being so shallow and picky, it's a movie after all and a good one, not a masterpiece, but good and worthy of your time, give it a try but don't expect TOO much, we read good reviews or see the high rating at rottentomatoes and we think that that particular film must be something out of this world, and then when we are able to watch it and judge it for ourselves, we end up being disappointed, in other words, it's not the movie's fault, it's our own fault. Take the movie for what it is, a good fun comedy with some of the classic stereotypes and old jokes, but that thanks to a excellent cast and somewhat smart script rises above the dumb and predictable bunch of teen comedies and scary movie clones that Hollywood churns out every month.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great movie. Funny, sexy, and raunchy. Judd Apatow again scores big by pushing the limits.","I must say ""Knocked Up"" is great! It's very funny, sexy, and just great a movie that's a current pop culture gem. Again writer,and director Judd Apatow scores big just like he did with ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", this tale just might be a little more sentimental since it involves childbirth. The script he does is very raunchy and funny with plenty of wise jokes and foul language to keep you amused while an uncommon couple grow during change. You have a loser and porn loving movie and internet slob named Ben(Seth Rogen)who does plenty of pot smoking and childish things, but finally he gets a break when he meets a young and beautiful career-girl named Alison(Katherine Heigl) who's a studio worker at E! News and she finally gets a hosting gig due to her looks and beauty. Upon getting together at the bar one night as so common a one night stand happens! Upon returning to her home which Alison shares with her sister Debbie(Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete(Paul Rudd) she finds out eventually she's knocked up! The news is delivered and both are at first unhappy, but both Ben and Alison decide that they will work together and have the baby and raise it! During the course Apatow fills it with plenty of crude and foul language and raunchy scenes of sex(the two most memorable are the dog style bed scene and the showing of the vagina before birth!) And upon seeing Ben's friends a viewer can feel that they are socially challenged losers, yet with the skin and raunchy scenes Judd did it gives great appeal to hormone driven males. Still if you as a viewer can overlook all of the foul and nagging crudeness underneath you can see this film is a nice fairy tale and storybook love story for both Ben and Alison. For one Ben learns to grow up and learn love and respect the responsibility of a new life. Alison sees life for a change and learns that people are who they are in life just like Ben is and she sees love is possible and can happen between two opposites of their kind. The lines are sharp too with a good take on current pop culture, that helps the viewer find some fresh air as it serves up the start of a new life and brings happiness to a couple of different backgrounds. Overall ""Knocked Up"" is a real winner that's blended well with elements we all like and they make us happy, it proves again that Judd Apatow knows how to reach an audience's emotions and pleasures. Final note it's clear too that Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen are rising stars to be respected look for both to be around some more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"It's Taken Five Months For 2007 To Get An Indefinitely ""Good"" Movie","2007 has been a year full of surprises for most people so far. So many big movies came out: Ghost Rider, Spider-man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It almost seemed like 2007 would be THE best year for movies and that those three would be the perfect evidence. Instead, most people walked away from those movies sour and found more entertainment in Disturbia, a less-than 2 hour somewhat corny thriller.Now enter Knocked Up, the next movie by the guys that brought you The 40-Year Old Virgin. The story behind the movie isn't anything new, a stoner gets a hard-working hottie pregnant and they need to work things out. But don't let that (or the disappointments this year for that matter) fool you, because Knocked Up is unquestionably the first indefinitely ""good"" movie so far this year.Why does Knocked Up actually work? Well, part of it has to do with how easily accessible it is. If you're a guy that loves the outrageous comedies and has a girl that's all over the ""chick flicks"" or vice versa, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this movie. The style of the movie is like a mix between Liar Liar's lesson of responsibility and The 40-Year Old Virgin's outrageous and totally irresistible comedy. In other words, it's an insane comedy with a great heart.Knocked Up is a movie that you don't need to speak much about to really emphasize how great it is. All that one really needs to know is that it's a comedy mixed with some romance that works quite well. About the only thing the movie doesn't do well is the length, it's running time is noticeably longer than other comedies. But you know what? What's wrong with a few more laughs, honestly? If the first batch of movies have been 2007's disappointments, then Knocked Up is 2007's redemption.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
awful; avoid being knocked up by a bad film.,"i was very disappointed in this film as reviewers claimed something good and there was none, zero! i cannot think of one positive except it finally ends and magnificent quiet fills the space left by actors swearing, abusing each other, and us. save your money, tell everyone you know to do likewise and see something else. this film is classless, base, stupid, boring, dull, a total waste of time. I rarely have seen a film that was so bad that I felt compelled to post a warning to the general public to run in the opposite direction. I wanted to see it because I'd seen a few of the actors on late night shows and daytime shows where they promoted the sweetness that evolved in the story line. They went on and on with comments about depth. I find this totally hilarious in retrospect as ""depth"" as a description of the emotional emptiness of the characters in this film would be like someone describing insanity as the highest form of intellectual development. I was hoodwinked and hope you will not be likewise 'knocked up.'",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Judd Apatow continues to improve his distinct style with the most consistent comedy of the season,"From the hilarious writer-director-oddball Judd Apatow, Knocked Up one-ups even his extremely well received 40 Year Old Virgin. And just like last year's funniest surprise hit, his latest release seems destined to repeat the same critically and commercially successful process. Apatow continues to triumph, like few working American filmmakers today, by merging vulgarity with sincerity into equally hilarious and heartfelt results. In detailing the warped and awkwardly circumstantial paining of Seth Rogen's quintessential slacker and Katherine Heigl's ambitious businesswoman (both casted well), Apatow's trademark bittersweet dynamics get to shine brighter even then anything we have previously seen.What works so well for the film, besides it's constant and perceptive humor, is how well both sexes are covered in this gross-out comedy with heart. If The 40 Year Old Virgin was a great comedy with romantic intentions, Knocked Up is a romantic movie with comedic intentions. Despite his preoccupation with bodily gags and stereotypical stoners, Apatow has truly been refining the emotional content of his characters, coming up with two people who are a pleasure to invest into the relationship despite a plethora of disgusting toilet humor emanating from much of the dialog.What results is a movie that functions nearly as well as an offbeat chick flick or the masterful comedy that it is. The screenplay may push a little too hard with crude sexual references at times, though it often compliments the heavier romantic qualities splendidly. Of course the plot will have it's fair share of unrealistic qualities (even if Apatow does vividly capture some very real qualities from the demographic he writes about he still struggles with the female psyche), and some may resent Apatow's continuous decision to load his last act up with a heavier dosage of drama then the overall tone would suggest, but line for line Knocked Up is surely the funniest script to emerge on the big screen this year, and this year's champion of the one-liner zing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very Good.  Not for ninnies,"This is a fun movie. It's not as good or as bad as everyone says. I like, it, but it's a little over-hyped.I want to be clear that I really did enjoy it, and laughed a lot, and enjoyed the buddy movie parts and the dopey love story parts - but not as much as (the also not-flawless) the 40-year old virgin or (the flawless and tragically canceled TV show) Freaks and Geeks.... but I LOVE those, so really, I like this a lot.People who complain about the ""toilet humor"" or who say the film is insensitive are probably uptight, and are clearly not the target audience.

Very Funny,"I had just watched Knocked Up last night and it turned out to be the funniest and most original comedy I've seen since The 40 Year Old Virgin last year. Seth Rogen, was absolutely hilarious as Ben Stone a fun loving party animal who meets successful career girl Alison (Heigl) at a bar they have a drunken one night stand. Two months later she makes the discovery that she's pregnant and for the sake of the baby they try to make a relationship work. It was painfully funny watching a man go from being a party animal to a mature and reliable adult, there was a bit too much drug usage and more sex scenes than in the average comedy. Other than that the movie was pretty entertaining and sweet, seeing two people trying to be together despite the many differences each one has.

A Drama Disguised as a Comedy,"Ben Stone goes out partying one night and ends up sleeping with a woman who has had a bit too much to drink. After getting ""knocked up"" she decides to keep the baby, even though she's a successful working woman and Stone is a drug-using, unemployed slacker. Can they come to terms before the baby is born? I went into this film being told it's the funniest film of 2007. And I ended up seeing a drama or romance with some funny scenes thrown in, but hardly the funniest film of the year. (Those who promoted it have reneged on their claim after giving it a second viewing.) So, I was mislead... but it was still a good film.I just wanted to say that -- if you came for a comedy, you might be disappointed. The scenes with Paul Rudd are pretty funny, and the running gag of making beard jokes kept me laughing, but more often than not it is two people trying to make a hopeless situation workable. And that was confusing for me -- was this a comedy or a drama? Like ""Click"", the comedy seemed overshadowed by the seriousness, but the seriousness was weakened by the comedy. maybe it was just me.I still think this is a good film and worth seeing. Especially if you enjoyed ""40-Year Old Virgin"". We have Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Paul Rudd and a little bit of Steve Carrell, so it's the usual suspects here. I think I found ""40 Year"" more satisfying as a whole, but the beard parts of this one were funnier than anything in the previous film. So, they each have redeemable qualities. If you didn't like ""40 Year"" then you're likely to be disappointed by this steady stream of cuss words and drug talk.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Apatow Takes Realism To The Limits & Brings It Back,"Let's just say for all intents and practical purposes you are totally bored with real stupid comedy and you've watched up all your soap operas. Where do you soon turn? Of course, where else will most agreeably turn when everything else fails? The DVD Comedy Section! Judd Apatow takes his views on life, love, and comedy very seriously. So seriously that he continues to pour out film after film of hilarious uncharted territory we all can not seem to get enough of.Like most films Apatow produces, we learn to expect a different kind of experience. Apatow normally, if not mostly, likes to push the envelope as far as possible on what the audience perceives as either plain stupid, ignorant, gross, profane, incoherent, embarrassing, in your face, or unacceptable when it comes to embracing the current common societal views on decency. Apatow somehow is able to walk this thin line in his films without totally alienating most people. The common thread in most all of his films seems to revolve around characters that we somehow would love to hate, however, can't seem to ever get to that point. We always conditionally forgive these people regardless of how they act. Most of the characters tend to always redeem themselves with us before the film ends.The common fallacy we might make when trying to explain a film to someone who hasn't seen it before is saying something like, ""Hey man! Have you seen that film called Knocked Up? That was totally awesome!"". Of course when the person, that doesn't really understand that you are a film expert film buff, goes home and watches it, then they might never listen to another one of your opinions again. Mostly, the film as with any film, either has a shelf life (i.e. A life of its own or it doesn't).My opinion is meaningless when it comes to judging a comedy. We just have to see if it's going to be a long-term forgettable film like ""Flashdance"", or something else. I'm certainly not knocking the directing talent of Adrian Lyne or Don Simpson as a producer, but there is so far a film can carry you after 30 years. For instance, I can only remember the gal (Jennifer Beals), I thought I would never see again in another film, and the Michael Simbelo ""Maniac"" song. I'm certainly glad the Jennifer Beals didn't just disappear from the scene, but she has hardly starred in another major role in her acting career. Jennifer is definitely still holding her own and looking better than ever, which is a miracle. She is only about 6 months younger than me, and my body looks like it's been trampled by a herd of hippos. I'm just saying, in trying to pinpoint a single formula that makes Apatow's films so very memorable, you'll just have to go back and watch it 20 years later. That's the most important litmus test for the next generation of comedy analyzers.Some say that the inner sanctum of loving a film is loving the main character. Seth Rogen is definitely fun and delivers us the most astonishing silliness one could ever imagine. Ben Stone is a likable guy who could just as well be your best friend or cousin. Bad behavior is expected along the way and Rogen as Stone delivers it up as best he knows how. Simply put, you actually feel sorrow for this green and pitiful idiot who has no clue how he has screwed his life up. Instead of taking us down an even more pitiful story-line, Apatow shows us that even this guy can make good decisions and turn his life around.

Who needs a time machine?,"First off, If the time machine dinner scene doesn't make you laugh then you have no sense of humor... that is easily in the top 20 funniest scenes EVER.I'm not sure why so many people hate this movie so much. Is it because Seth's character isn't a PC simp... even though he should have been since Katherine Heigl is hot and classy and he is slothly and sloppy....???I've heard some people say that Seth's character is a narcissist. I'm not sure where they go that from... he ends up getting a job to do the right thing for the baby, he ends up reading the baby books for the baby, he stops hanging out with his sloppy friends for the baby, he makes sure the baby is delivered properly, he takes care of the baby after it's delivered...If Seth's character was a narcissist he would have kept getting sloppy with his friends and said fuq all ....I guess this movie pisses some people off because it shows women as hormonal and men as immature. But you know what, that's life! Women are hormonal at times, and men sometimes act like children. I guess that a lot of people don't like the idea of women being hormonal because it makes them look weak and mean... and when men act like children it's funny... so I guess this is a double slap in the face to people whom are offended by this movie.Lastly, it's okay for men to be men... which means being their own person and not caving into a woman's every desire via pussyfooting-simping-virtue-signaling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
more laughs than your average romcom,"The romantic comedy is big business in Hollywood. Like the action movie staple, it is designed to appeal to a wide audience. But we've all seen so many of these films that they have totally lost any ability to surprise us. Boy meets girl, boy and girl like each other, an obstacle is placed in their way, boy loses girl, the obstacle is overcome... the audience won't stand an unhappy ending, so the destination is always the same; everyone lives happily ever after. What matters, then, is what happens along the way.No one will be surprised to learn that Knocked Up does not deviate from this formula- but starting from an unusual premise (a one night stand between Ben and Alison, two mismatched types) and developing a new genre, the gross-out romantic comedy (I know! Romance for the girls and sick gags for the boys, it's a sure-fire winner) it remains consistently entertaining along the way.My main problem with the film is that I had no sympathy at all with Ben and his slacker friends. A few genuinely funny gags aside, they remained impressively irritating throughout the movie. Much better is director Judd Apatow's sly dig at the conventions of the form, an interesting subplot centred around the marital troubles of Alison's sister and her husband, a few years down the marriage road. Convincingly played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, the couple's problems are not fully resolved; look, Apatow is saying to us, Ben and Alison may be happy at the end of the movie, but in a few years' time this is where they may well end up.Seth Rogen plays Ben well, a big bear of a man scared to grow up. I was less convinced by Alison, played by Katherine Heigl; maybe it's the way the role is written, but she never creates a realistic personality for the character. One minute she is revolted by the lifestyle of Ben and his friends, and seemingly within no time she is enthusiastically joining in. Still, there are enough laughs for a strong supporting cast to keep the entertainment rolling along to the inevitable conclusion. Like many romantic comedies, I am not sure Knocked Up will live long in the memory. It's too long for a comedy (really, two hours? Ninety minutes is always enough). However, it offers more genuine laughs than most in the genre, and confirms Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen as talents to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Fun,Knocked Up (2007)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Hilarious and often times touching story of a slacker man (Ben Stone) who knocks up a woman (Katherine Heigl) after a one night stand and the downfall that follows. This is from the same man who made The 40-Year-Old Virgin and like that film this one here isn't afraid to attack stereotypes but the director is smart enough to add some serious moments to the mix. We've seen countless raunchy comedies in the past but this film here throws in a heart and some serious moments that makes the film a lot better than it would have been in lesser hands. Rogen and Heigl are terrific together and the supporting cast including Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are just as impressive. I watched this with my girlfriend and we both really enjoyed the film but we also say things differently just like the men and women in this film.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Didn't knock it out of the park but was amusing enough,"Say what you will about writer/director Judd Apatow but beyond the raunchy, crude and drug humor usually seen in his comedies, there's usually also a lot of heart and honesty. That guy might even be a closet romantic for all we know. I didn't like ""Knocked up"" as much as his other efforts (40 year-old virgin, Superbad, etc) but I did have a good time watching it. I found it often amusing but rarely hilarious. The premise of a poor overweight average-looking slacker impregnating the hot ambitious successful blonde could be material for lots of dumb easy jokes but it does manage to make the average guy (Seth Rogen) likable in an earnest childish way and we do see how the blonde (Katherine Heigl) in question might not dismiss him right out the bat. This being an American comedy, I kind of expected abortion not to be brought up at all but I was pleasantly surprised at how tastefully it was talked about. The humor does rely on clever dialog and the differences between this ill-assorted pair, more specifically on how unsophisticated and irresponsible Seth Rogen seems to be. In one of the funniest scenes, he explains what he does for a living in a totally honest non self-conscious way while the audience and the blonde roll their eyes.Seth's character also has a bunch of slacker roommates who do help raise the raunchy pop-culture humor level. However, as much as I liked the running joke with the beard, I thought 2 of the friends in question (the bearded guy and the mustache guy) lacked on-screen presence and charisma (although I know they're not supposed to be charismatic). Heigl in the leading female role was natural and charming playing as the straight (wo)man role to Rogen's funny man. The chemistry between them was good and I did enjoy their character development. The women (thinking specifically of Heigl's sister here) might seem like prudish snobbish killjoys but I think it contrasts well with the immature fun-loving boys and does add a certain dramatic element and insight on modern men-women relationships. There were some complaints that the film was sexist towards women but really I would argue it's the guys who are not portrayed flatteringly. Weirdly, this movie is a paradox: a somewhat moral honest modern ""romantic"" comedy hidden under a raunchy immature slacker comedy.Rating: 6.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A decent comedy,"For Ben (Seth Rogen) and Alison (Katherine Heigl) a drunken roll in the hay leads to an unexpected pregnancy. Alison decides to keep the baby but can the prospective parents forge an 'opposites attract' romance?I can't put my finger on it but there's something about this film that doesn't quite measure up to Apatow's previous effort, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". The film reunites a few cast members from that film and picks up a few new faces along the way. Seth Rogen is consistently funny and has good chemistry with Katherine Heigl but I wouldn't say that he's as talented as Steve Carrell. Ben's circle of loser friends is an entertaining bunch as well. Actually, the only performance that isn't up to snuff is Harold Ramis (as Ben's dad), who illustrates why he should stick to writing/directing.The drop in quality may be due to a script that isn't as funny as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". The film tries to strike an emotional chord as well but is only successful some of the time as it treads the fine line between maudlin and sincere. The story also feels a little padded with the marital trials and tribulations of Alison's sister, which add little to the story.The directing & music are unobtrusive and otherwise not worth remarking upon.It was apparently the unrated version that I saw but really there was nothing in it to differentiate it from the usual R-rated fare.

Funny But Indecisive.,"I heard good things about this flick going in to see it, and having found The 40 Year Old Virgin pretty amusing I thought this would deliver. However, although laugh-out-loud funny in places the film has a problem deciding whether to be a comedy or serious and this definitely bogs down the narrative at times. Also although the characters are well sketched out, the relationship between the two protagonists is highly unlikely leading to some moments that just don't work. That said though, this film definitely has its moments and is packed with great one-liners and a really amusing array of supporting characters plus it is worth seeing just for Vegas sequence alone.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Time Will Tell if I really love this film, but it's very funny.","Knocked Up - A fun-loving slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) has a one night stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and they decide to keep the baby and strike up a relationship from there.The acting in this is solid, the stand-outs being the two 40 Year Old Virgin veterans Rogen and Paul Rudd, who looked like they had a blast making this film. Katherine Heigl brings them down to earth in a part that in a lesser actress' hands would be annoying. My one real complaint would be that at times the comraderie between the Seth and his buddies felt a little forced, unlike thhe group in Virgin.Judd Apatow is quickly rising through the ranks as one of my favorite comedy directors (Up there under Edgar Wright) and like The 40 Year Old Virgin, this film takes a long-shot premise (In reality, w/e your views on choice or not, this would easily end in an abortion) and runs with it in a more or less serious fashion, though there'd be less hilarity and far fewer movie references in a truly straight-forward version of this tale. If nothing good has come out of Spider-Man 3, at least this film got some good material out of it. And I don't ever recall seeing a better Robert De Nero or Arnold Schwarzennegger impression before. James Franco, Jessica Alba, Alan Tudyk and Steve Carrell (looking as uncomfortable about his Evan Almighty film as I am) all make cameo appearances.Of course, movie references aside (There's one every 5 minutes or so), this movie is hilarious, and while there aren't that many laugh you to tears moments, the general feeling I had was glee. Rarely a minute goes by without something to make you at least smile, if not laugh out loud.Humorous antics (and lo, there are many. From drugs to boffing to Cirque du Soleil, these guys can have fun with anything) aside, this is a coming of age story. These are some real characters that go with the funniness.The main characters are very sympathetic, with the possible exception of Debbie from time to time. I felt she was rather cold sometimes. The movie makes sport several times of marital fights (emotion driven and pointless) and whether or not the women in the audience mind this or not, I don't know. Movie Mom gave this film a B- so I cannot make any claims as to whether the women like this film or not, but this film is one I'd definitely recommend to the guys.Comedies are hard for me to give a final judgment on because the mark of a very good one is how many times you watch it afterward.

Simple story...,"""Knocked Up"" is a movie which has to dot with a man who is a party animal and he goes from party to party. The only thing that he never thought is a baby and a woman who got pregnant by him. In this movie we watch this party animal trying to survive by this woman who after eight weeks showed up in his doorstep to tell him that she was pregnant by him in a party in which he went.I did not like this movie as much as I expected but I have to admit that the whole plot and storyline was nice. The direction of Judd Apatow for one more time was not enough to make this movie a little better but the interpretations of Seth Rogen's who plays as Ben Stone the party animal was outstanding and Katherine Heigl's who plays as Alison Scott the pregnant woman was equally nice.Although I have to tell you that ""Knocked Up"" is a funny movie to watch and spare your time but nothing more than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I need to change chairsKnocked Up,"Can Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow strike gold twice in as many tries? Well I guess you can say they had success together with TV shows ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared,"" but then, despite what seemed to be universal love, both got cancelled. It wasn't until The 40 Year Old Virgin hit that they started becoming household names. With Apatow's follow-up, Knocked Up, he has brought his old friend out from the shadows and into the spotlight. Rogen definitely has the talent to hit it out of the park, but as far as the film itself striking gold as its predecessor did for me, I have to say it comes up a bit short. Let's just say it strikes silver.Our story is one that occurs probably too often in the real world, a one-night stand which produces offspring. We are of course privy to the obligatory abortion sequence, although short and never mentioned in lieu of ""smushmortion,"" but the real impetus to the movie is these two finding each other and common ground to raise a child. Right from the get go, both leads want the baby and work hard in order to achieve their goal, slowly finding out that they may have real feelings for the other. After recently checking out the fantastic hijinks from the previous Steve Carell film, I expected to be laughing non-stop here. The plot is laced with seriousness, but ripe for satire and hilarity. What ends up happening, however, is that the jokes are merely window dressing for the tale of love conquering all. All the serious issues at play are very much in the forefront and Knocked Up ends up being an entertaining date movie first, uproarious comedy second. This is by no means a bad thing, it just wasn't exactly what I was anticipating going in. In the end it works to balance the two directions, although somewhat precariously because when the laughs arrive they are huge, only making the serious parts that much more sobering and ultimately a tad boring.Apatow again succeeds with flying colors as far as scripting a story with heart and realism. He pulls no punches at all and never goes into the realm of schtick or surrealism. You have to applaud the man for going so far as to showing the baby crowning during birth as well as actually giving the mother a slimy child rather than a cleaned off ""prop"" instead. We are witnessing the relationship between two strangers as they are thrust into each other's lives. It is absolutely paramount that we see the reality of the situation and understand where each is coming from throughout all their activities and actions. Maybe the lack of Carell co-writing led to the somewhat more subdued end result, but even so, this film is very funny.Let's just say that I would pay to watch two hours of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd in a room riffing with one another alone. Every time these two share screen time is the best moment of the film. Their film quote referencing, Back to the Future and Swingers being some of the best, are classic and the rapport they share is genuine, most is surely ad-libbed. As for the casting of Rogen's friends, what better way to do so than with his real friends? The foursome all play characters sharing their own first names and the comradery and insults are so spot- on it once again must be mostly improvised. Every sly jab at the one for being in a bet not allowing him to shave is priceless. For him to be the one they are grateful is not a Jew to eventually being thought of as one because of the facial hair is a great evolutionMatisyahu anyone?As for the rest of the cast, Katherine Heigl truly shines as the woman at the center of it all. Her life is flipped upside down and her emotions run high. I have not seen her in anything elseno I have not watched ""Grey's Anatomy"" as of yetbut I have to say I was impressed by her performance. While talking of acting range I will also mention the phenomenal job Rogen did himself. Always being the funny guy coming into scenes, he really needed to step up here and carry the film. His character undergoes a huge transformation during the course of the movie and Rogen makes every moment of it believable. Other credit goes to the entire Apatow family. His wife Leslie Mann is finally given a role she can run with besides the usual ten-minute butt of the joke scenes I'm used to seeing her partake in. Also, their children, playing her children in the film, are immensely funny. Their interactions together in the car and the eldest's story of where babies come from are quite memorable. Oh and one needs to congratulate Ryan Seacrest with a wonderful bit of self-parody and the other friends popping up like Carell and James Franco.So, in the end, Apatow delivers a heartfelt tale of love mixed with a good amount of humor, both sweet and broad. While definitely an R-rated feature with many moments of hilarity due to graphic language and or actions, I would still say this is more for the date crowd than the group of friends going out for a Friday night. The laughs are there, and big in most instances, however, the end result is really a romantic comedy when you look closely. It may be the crudest rom-com you'll see, but it also is one of the more effective ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Doesn't live up to the massive hype but is still enjoyably fresh and funny despite the rather dodgy moral message under the surface,"Alison Scott is a production assistant on E! Entertainment who finds herself offered a spot in front of the cameras. She goes out with her married sister to celebrate in a club and there she meets the friendly but terminally unemployed Ben Stone and his stoner friends. Drink + music = a one night stand where Ben clumsily misinterprets an instruction from Alison and has unprotected sex. The next morning sees Alison faced with a curly haired, flabby man washed up in her bed and a brief breakfast leaves her in no doubt that she can do much, much better. However two months later and Alison is throwing up much more than she used to and finding she is pregnant decides it only right to get in touch with the man totally unprepared for the news that he is to be a father.Hearing about this at the time of release you would have thought that it was the second coming of the Messiah. I was in New York during its run in theatres there and could not avoid posters hailing it the film of the year and the hype continued when it arrived in the UK. Not really being into teen comedies, I sort of dismissed it and moved on. When it hit DVD I decided to give it a try and found something that is not totally worthy of the hype it received but certainly better than the crude teen sex comedy that I had the image of it being. What it actually is is a pretty natural and engaging comedy based around people who are, if not ""real"" then at least recognisable. The dialogue is quite snappy and the comedy mostly avoids being broad or crude and on the contrary manages to be really well observed at times (the rather bitter woman in Alison's manager's office being a favourite of me and my partner).The characters do help and for some will be really recognisable. I don't really know people like any of them but the feelings and actions mostly feel genuine and real to me and I did care about them to sufficient extent that my interest was maintained even when laughs were not to be had for a bit. Speaking of genuine actions though, the one thing I would say that struck a sour note was the rather strange moral decisions taken where two people stumble into this relationship due to the child. I appreciate that it is not a subject for this film so much as a plot device to set up the story but it still didn't ring true to me and wasn't helped by seeing the topic being handled much better in Juno (where it was also not a big political message either). That said Apatow's script does bring out valid themes and it is these that see the film be convincing and feel quite real. Dissatisfaction in long-term relationships, fears, worries, the passing of youth etc are all there to be seen within the characters and, while not a searing comment, the film is smart and natural with it.The cast mostly respond well to this although it is clear that the vast majority work best with the comedy material. Rogen is not totally up to the task of leading a film, but he is funny if nothing else. In the more demanding aspects of the role? Well, I'm not totally sure. Heigl is charming and beautiful but almost to the point where the central relationship is made less convincing. I would have preferred a less stunning actress in the role as it would have covered for the lack of doubt in her character and also been more interesting in regards Ben's choices. Anyway, she is quite amusing and she is more comfortable in the more dramatic moments in the film. Mann is OK but Rudd is better. The support cast of stoners etc are mostly funny but my favourite turn is from Wiig who is wonderfully bad at concealing her tired bitterness while also going along with the bosses to keep her job.Overall then, Knocked Up is an enjoyable and fresh comedy that is funny while also having natural characters that I either cared about or recognised enough to be interested in. Not totally convinced by the fudged morality of the film or the way the central relationship goes but Apatow's script is funny and interesting enough to cover up for the weaknesses he has also created. Don't believe the hype but it is still fun.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Judd Apatow's crowning glory,"Cinema in the summer of 2007 belonged to Judd Apatow. While audiences everywhere were becoming excited and disappointed in equal measure to the high-profile likes of Spider Man 3 and The Simpsons Movie, Apatow was bringing truly rewarding films to the table in the shape of Knocked Up and Superbad. Of the two, it seems that Knocked Up had the highest expectations surrounding it as early reports of a never-ending laugh-riot began to circulate amidst some ugly controversy regarding the abortion debate. Now the dust has settled, it's still clear that this funny little pregnancy adventure is an excellent film. Crude, foul mouthed and brimming over with pop culture references, it doesn't provide as many big belly laughs as you'd hope but instead provides a warm and intelligent debate on heterosexual relationships that find themselves having to deal with an unexpected third party.In some respects, Apatow is becoming Kevin Smith's successor - he writes movies that are true to his own experiences which a lot of people will be able to relate to, not to mention returning to the same cast and crew several times over. Stepping up to the plate here is Seth Rogen, best known for scene stealing supporting turns in You, Me and Dupree and Apatow's own 40 Year Old Virgin. He plays 23 year old man child Ben Stone, an unemployed, pot smoking layabout who manages through a combination of alcohol, charm and sheer luck to cop off with TV career girl Alison Scott (Katherine Hiegl) in a nightclub. His intoxicated mix of joy and ""oh thank god it's been a while"" relief however results in a miscommunication regarding birth control and two months later, she contacts him again to let him know she's carrying his child.From here, the film charts the giddying highs and terrifying lows of pregnancy remarkably well and it is to Apatow's eternal credit that he manages to voice both sex's anxiety in a convincing way. Ben is distraught that his days of booze, pot and porn may be over but simultaneously determined to stand by Alison and be a good father. Alison meanwhile frets about her looks, career and the fact that she might have to end up with a hairy overweight slob for the rest of her life. This is reflected in the form of Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie ""Mrs Apatow"" Mann), a slightly older married couple who provide a snapshot of how Ben and Alison may turn out. This results not only in some revealing insights about modern relationships but also some very funny and touching scenes. Ben and Pete's trip to Las Vegas for instance is terrific, the pair going on a hallucinogen fuelled wander before a freak out in a hotel room that ends in Pete's revelation of his marriage's big picture.That isn't to say Knocked Up is all sensible observations and witty dialogue though and there are still some big laughs to be had, most of them provided by Ben's stoner flatmates. A lot of the jokes are very smutty, but they support the story rather than drag it down and they are never puerile simply for the point of being puerile. Apatow isn't above shocking audiences though and some of the camera angles in the climactic birth scene are likely to elicit howls of ""I can't believe they filmed that,"" especially from the women among you.It's a shame then that Knocked Up's reputation was tarnished somewhat by the media as this is neither a pro-life propaganda piece nor a riotous comedy that'll leave you crying with laughter. Just because a film is about pregnancy doesn't mean it has to have an agenda and when it's as sweet, touching and true to life as this one, it's a very pedantic complaint to make. If you want to laugh so much it hurts, go and rent Superbad (trust me, it's awesome) but if you want a romantic comedy that's so good you don't even realise it is one, this is the film to get.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good Film....eventually,"Knocked Up winds up being a funny and honest movie...eventually. It has a running time of 2 hours and 15 min. My advice to anyone watching would be to skip the first hour and 15 min. Nothing really happens in this time except the setup to the film (which is not even remotely plausible), and a LOT of penis and fart jokes. A lot. The first few are mildly amusing, the 20th one, not so much. There are no spoilers involved in the following setup. Katerine Heigl plays Allison, an absolute knockout, who is intelligent, funny, and who's career has just taken a big leap forward with her recent promotion at a popular entertainment network (that's the believable part). She suddenly decides to go to a club one night (apparently the only date she can get is her sister) and for some reason, no one hits on her. No one. So, obviously desperate (and a bit drunk), she decides to pick up the biggest loser in the club (Ben Stone), invites him back to her place, and has wild sex with him (apparently because he helped her get a drink at the bar. Guys, if you want a really hot girl to have sex with you, this may be your plan).Despite being disgusted at the sight of him the next morning, and despite the fact that she realizes that this man has no income, no ambition, lives in a post-college frat house with 4 other man-children (insert penis joke here), and can't seem to say anything remotely intelligent or tactful, she improbably decides...""let me stick it out with this guy"", since she's been, yup, you guessed it, insert movie title here.However, it is a broad comedy, so I suppose some leeway should be given (and this setup involves a LOT of leeway). But after it settles down in the 2nd hour, it becomes a really honest (and funny) portrait of adult responsibility and the headaches and joys that come with it. And this almost makes the first half worth sitting through for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Terrible morals, but entertaining dialogue","When it comes to morals this movie is terrible, but it's still a pretty entertaining movie. The story is basically about a fat hairy guy hooking up with a girl out of his league and also works for the entertainment news channel(not that I ever found Katherine Heigl ever attractive) but that is the point of view the movie wants the audience to have. But than again some audiences my find her hot, I just never really liked her screen presence in movies all that much. But she fit her role in this really well and made it work. Seth Rogen is entertaining to watch in this and isn't much of a shock that this movie was his big break. Besides the part about the characters having sex without a condom after getting drunk. The movie goes in a direction where it sort of sends a message that if you want a girl to be with you, just get her pregnant cause then the chance of her just dumping you is pretty slim. The movie has some clever dialogue and the interactions between the characters is funny and entertaining. This movie isn't super funny or anything like that and although the humor probably won't make you burst out laughing like crazy it still has what it takes to catch the audiences attention with it's character interactions even if a lot of it is them screwing around.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Pretty good, far from great.","Are we all so fed up with how bad comedies usually are that we're instantly calling this one of the greatest movies of all time? I like Judd Apatow's style, but Knocked Up mined a lot of the same territory as The 40 Year Old Virgin, and in a less original way. That movie's endearing exploration of freaks, geeks, and immature man/boys was tighter and funnier. Knocked Up was a bit too schmaltzy and meandering during it's 129 minutes. Many scenes and situations come straight from the generic pregnancy movie guidebook. Buying all the pregnancy tests in a store was funny 15 years ago in Singles, and if a filmmaker wanted to cop from John Hughes, She's Having a Baby isn't the greatest place to start. This was indeed an enjoyable movie, but it doesn't quite reach greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It Didn't Know What It Wanted To Be. Just BAD.,"Unless you have kids and have gone through the process of childbirth, this movie is NOT for you. What's worse, it simply didn't know what it wanted to be. A chick flick? A crude guy comedy? Instead, they tried to make both and failed quite miserably. Did Will Ferrell turn down the lead role? Some funny moments are lost by simple gross out humor. Don't go for gross out when your target audience is clearly between the ages of 33 and 45. Anyone younger will find this movie revolting. Anyone older will find it mostly offensive and genuinely unfunny.I agree with the critic who ripped this thing by stating the writers of this movie think relationships fall ""between junior high and joint mortgage payments. It's a view wherein men are idiots that must be refined (if not actually tamed) by women."" I'm SO tired of that portrayal and of the tired clichés this movie promotes as if no one has ever thought of them before or as if we're suppose to think they're actually funny. It's not, at least not the way they presented it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Knocked Up, But Not Quite Knocked Out","I had such high expectations, given Rogen and Apatow's ground-breaking work in ""40-year-old Virgin"".""Knocked Up"" tells the story of a slacker, Ben Stone (Rogen) who gets really lucky one night at a club and finds himself doing the horizontal mambo with blonde bombshell career girl Alison Scott (Heigl). 2 mins later, the course of both their lives is altered irrevocably.The movie explores how they adapt to each other, and to the people in their respective lives, in light of circumstances that force them together, even though they'd really rather not be.The problem with this movie is that Rogen's character, while acute and incisive in a supporting context, can't carry a main role - certainly not in the way Steve Carrell's did in ""40-year-old Virgin"".It's like the smoke without the fire, or the bang without the cracker. The one is nothing without the other, even though the reverse isn't necessarily true. Rogen, to his credit, does very well in crafting a likable loser here. And so full credit to him for that achievement.Heigl, for her part, is really delightful in this role, but she too suffers in this movie from Apatow's unfortunate ability to create his most interesting characters in a cameo roles. Cases in point are: Paul Rudd character, his wife played by Leslie Mann, the bouncer at the club where all the trouble originally started, and Heigl's sterile plastic bosses at the TV station.What you end up with is a patchwork quilt of very funny characters. On the whole, though, it ends up as somewhat less than the sum of its parts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good, yes! $100 million? HOW?","I enjoyed this movie. I got past the vulgar language, I found many of the jokes truly funny and there was some chemistry between the two characters. Nearly every day we see couples where we think, ""Why is SHE with him?"" or ""How did he get HER?"" Thus the relationship is somewhat plausible. I guess I'm wondering how this movie reached a ""common denominators"" lowest or otherwise, that allowed it to surpass a box office of $100 million. Obviously there is an audience for this type of ""joe-blow"" humor, F-bombs, drug use and such because similar films have been successful in the past.

Thank You once again,"The 40 year old virgin was an instant classic and easily one of the funniest movies I had ever seen. It had a real life feel as well as great humor and a cast that gelled like they were truly friends their whole life. So I wondered how Judd Apatow could ever follow that. Well he has, and he has done it quite well.Knocked Up is a great follow up to his earlier success. In my opinion, it is not as solidly funny as the virgin, but it does come close. Once again, the cast is just so good together that it just seems like you are watching someone's home movie, just filming their friends running around doing goofy things. The chemistry is amazing.The jokes come fast and often work. There are a few misfires, but way more work than not. The ladies in this film are hilarious. Katherine Heigl does an amazing job as a level headed but semi wild working girl turned hormonally imbalanced pregnant rage of emotions. Leslie Mann practically steals the show, especially the great scene where she gets into it with a doorman at a nightclub.The support that Rogen and Heigl get is also amazing. All Rogen's roommates play off each other so well, you almost wish they had more screen time. Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen together is comedy gold, especially when they go to vegas.I could say a million praises to the film, but it's probably not anything you haven't heard already. The movie is over two hours long and never feels that way. It's a great date film with superb acting, a stretched yet believable story, and just loads of fun.

A great comedy for the summer and probably the best this year so far!,"I couldn't wait to see knocked up, from the trailer, this looked like such a fun movie that anyone could laugh at. I didn't see it opening weekend, so when I peeked here on IMDb, I couldn't believe that it was already on the top 250, especially for a comedy in this year? I had to see this movie! My friend and I saw it yesterday and we had an absolute blast. But I have to admit, there were a few jokes that had me a little thrown off or were a little too much, but I have to say that thinking about it, it did over all work because it was realistic. I think we all know someone who is like a character in this film and that was what made it lovable.Ben Stone is a pot head who is very lazy and is about to put a website up with his friends on how long celebrities are naked in their films. Alison Scott is a determined and hard working woman who just got a hot promotion interviewing celebrities on E! When she goes out to celebrate with her married sister at the hottest club, she meets Ben, they have a little too much to drink and well, you know the saying ""Don't drink and drive, it causes accidents""? Well, let's put it this was ""Don't drink and park, it causes people"". They have sex and Alison gets pregnant, she tells Ben, and they now are trying to get to know each other and pushing themselves to even love each other for the sake of this child.Knocked Up has great jokes that anyone I'm sure sometime in your life could relate too. Every character is sympathetic because you could relate in some way. The story worked very well, because sadly, I'm sure this situation happens more than we'd like to think it does.

Katherine Heigl, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann give very good performances, and the supporting cast is just as well, including the Seth Rogen character's loser buddies.

Sharp-fanged but sweet-natured...,"Writer-director Judd Apatow easily tapped into a vastly-commercial comedic market with this film (and, earlier, with 2005's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""). By bringing loutish 'guy behavior' into the mainstream--and mixing it cheerfully within the responsible middle-class--Apatow managed to give TV sitcom humor a goosey edge that hadn't been tried before. Unemployed, feckless Canadian living in Los Angeles--into bong blasts and movies with naked chicks--unintentionally gets an attractive television newswoman pregnant, which forces him into rethinking his life. Apatow surrounds central couple Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl with colorful support, from Leslie Mann's tightly-wound sister (and suspicious wife to Paul Rudd) to Harold Ramis as Rogen's ""go with the flow"" dad. The movie runs too long and wears out its welcome, but Apatow rushes us through the meandering stuff and usually has something surprising and funny waiting in the wings. The filmmaker is also careful not to push the film's nicer, more sentimental moments too far--this is definitely a rude, foul-mouthed modern comedy, yet one with a big heart. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Seth Rogen is very believable as the lumpy pot head slacker who ultimately grows up.....just enough to win the girl. Katherine Heigl is very good as the hottie who makes a mistake, but instead of running the other direction gives our shlump a chance to be a dad and be her mate for life.Apatow seems to have this genre down, I just hope we don't continue to see the same thing being recycled over and over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not hilarious, but good movie","I went into this expecting something like Superbad - a bunch of vulgar humor I'd enjoy in high school. While I did laugh here and there, the style of the movie was more of a story of someone who got knocked up after one night and how things progressed.Yes, the trivia mentions certain words being used over 120+ times. However, the dialog sounded very natural for the type of people involved. I could imagine having some of the dialog in the situations with some of my friends.I'm not that sure what I think of Seth Rogan as an actor. There are some good moments, but overall it just seemed to feel too improvised. Katherine Heigl does a wonderful job as a stressed out mom-to-be.Overall it was a good movie.

Extremely Crude...But With Heart,"The best way to describe ""Knocked Up"" is this: If a movie like ""Superbad"" actually had a shred of dramatic integrity (e.g. ""a point"") to add to its crude, sometimes gross-out antics, you'd have this comedy.For a basic plot summary, ""Knocked Up"" sees stoner Ben (Seth Rogen) and straight-laced Allison (Katherine Heigl) hook up during a drunken one-night stand. When Allison finds out that she is pregnant, she must decide not only what to do about her ""situation"", but also try to include Ben in the process.To be very frank, this is one of the crudest movies ever made, filled with gross-out images, a boatload of profanity, and sexual zingers at literally almost every turn. If these are things that you are uncomfortable with, then turn the other way and run right now!At the same time, ""Knocked Up"" does have one key attribute that most of its contemporaries lack: heart. When you wade through all the stoner jokes, sexual innuendo, and the like, you actually get a story that you might just find yourself caring about. It touches on a variety of different marital/relationship themes, and the tremendous acting of Heigl/Rogen helps to add a legitimate emotional dynamic to the proceedings.Basically, ""Knocked Up"" is Judd Apatow's pulling together of the traditional romantic comedy and the stoner/goofball genre, a pairing that one would think wouldn't work all that well. It does in this case, though, because the overall effort is taken seriously enough to produce a perfect mix of well-crafted jokes from all areas of life. Unless you are turned off by the crudeness, you will be both laughing at and caring about the characters in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Great, Excellent, Brilliant, FANTASTIC!!!!","This was the greatest comedy of 2007. It shows a common unplanned pregnancy and turns it into a funny yet serious film. Great acting by Katherine Heigl, I think that she will become a big big star as more movies she makes and Seth Rogen plays a excellent part as a misguided man on the doll. The themes shown in this film are well executed (love,ageism,pregnancy etc). I think the main reason what makes this the best comedy flick of 2007 is the fact that while watching this you can actually relate to the subjects which are going on in the film. At the end of the film it left me wanting more, i wanted to actually see them in a few years time or something like that, thats why i feel that they could quite easily squeeze a sequel out of this, that could get them just as much money at the box office.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Accepts Itself,"Even the lowest brow films reward if you allow yourself to watch the machinery of the thing as well as the thing itself.The narrative itself is unrewarding. The humor is weak, the romance ineffective. But what the thing actually is charms.A standard romance has the wonderful girl, the clumsy guy who gets the girl, loses the girl by some complication, and then gets her back, usually involving some public, folded activity. These things are billed as date movies and have highly evolved values for both men and women.The woman's stuff is usually handled by making the guy solidly desirable at root, and supplementing that with some truth about the internals of a woman's life. But the formula is so worn out that studios put heavy attention into innovations that tap the same energy and use the same bankable conventions, but in new ways.So here we have a new twist on the woman's angle. Oh, it has something for the guys, who apparently can be appeased by a few jokes about how doofy we are. The fact that so little will carry us while other complicated narrative dynamics are spun, says more about how doofy we are than the truth of any joke.Those complicated dynamics have to do with the girl-to-girl conversation about the world they have to tolerate. By that I mean the wall of incompetence they face in emotional support. So this is a romance with a loser but its okay because all men are losers.Interestingly, it works. It works better than I would have expected, and that's trying to see it from both sides.Its a clever experiment perhaps two steps closer to defusing the fantasy of the genre is a self-critical fashion.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The comedy of the year,"Inside every great dumb gross-out comedy is a smarter film just waiting burst out of that film's womb. In the case of Knocked Up, we have a movie that presents itself in the American Pie tradition of fart gags and sex jokes, but that has aspirations to higher levels of cinematic purity. LEvels where it isn't just teenage boys who are given permission to laugh at the screen. Or indeed teenagers at all. Judd Apatow, the film's director, is more Woody Allen than Porky's revenge. His movie's are filled with observational humour, cultural and societal situations and questions of morality when pregnancy is concerned. How should a man finally ""man up"" when it is time to play the role of daddy-to-be, especially when his whole existence seems so peripheral, his claim to fame is a working part-time on a website that allows to find which movies your favourite actresses have been nude in?Seth Rogen plays Ben, a podgy, unemployed stoner-slob who lives in an apartment with four other similar friends. When at a club one night, he meets Alison, a recently-promoted TV presenter, who is initially charmed by the lovable oaf. Several empty beer bottles later, they end up spending the night together, only to discover their real personalities the morning after. During breakfast, Alison soon becomes repulsed by Ben's oafish opinions and demeanour, and soon decides it is best to leave the situation as a one night stand. Several weeks later Alison discovers she is pregnant, and decides to keep the baby. Without much thought into how she might achieve such a feet, she decides to give Ben another chance, for the sake of the baby, to make a relationship work between them.The great achievement of Knocked Up is that it is a comedy for adults, that has not been dumbed down for kids. Yes there are many crude jokes, similar to the filmmaker's previous effort - The 40 year Old Virgin. But the crudeness is shown up for what it is, and Ben's slacker routine is not glorified over Alison's sensibility. This is a movie where, like American Pie, the women have someone to look up to just like the men do. And a year in which American comedies have sunk so low that Will Ferrell is considered high-end, it is refreshing to see a new breed of smart filmmakers come out to give rebirth to the dumb comedy genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Every one said this movie was hilarious. But.........,"It's not.It was OK. Not great, but definitely not good. It had it's funny moments. But after those moments it just dragged and dragged. The acting was good, the story was good, but the writing on the jokes wasn't good at all. The movie had good moral in what the movie meant. But it just wan't strong enough to make me laugh a lot. I like how they brought all of the comedians that work together in movies a lot together. It was a cute movie. And if it wasn't for all of the cussing ant the drugs and the porn ha ha. It would have made a great family movie. I just got kind of bored of the movie really fast. Every one I knew was saying it was so funny. But i have to disagree with them. It's just a cute movie. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Evolution of the adult male,"I wasn't sure that I would like ""Knocked Up"", but my family wanted to go see it. There was certainly quite a bit of crude joking, but then I saw there was a much better story underneath. I could see the evolution of Ben Stone into an ""adult"" male. He begins as an immature guy who is only interested in sex, alcohol, smoking pot, and hanging out with his roommates making vulgar jokes. When faced with the unexpected pregnancy, he still doesn't get it. He thinks he can continue as he has before and doesn't expect anything to change. Eventually, when one might almost give up hope, he finally grows up. It does give you a sense of hope that some of the most immature males might become responsible adults.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Very funny, as well as touching. But it has some problems.","Sweet-natured romantic comedy about a one-night stand that results in pregnancy. The two reluctant parents are Ben (Seth Rogan), an unemployed stoner, and Alison (Katherine Heigl), a newly hired reporter for the E! cable network. The film follows their experiences and their rocky relationship. We also spend a lot of time with Alison's sister and brother-in-law (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd), as well as Ben's roommates (too many to mention, but is Jonah Hill Chris Penn's love child or what?). The film runs a tad over two hours long, and with all these characters, it feels rushed. I liked the characters, but wanted to know them better. I think Alison especially gets short-changed. Writer/director Apatow's experience surely lies with Ben, and it feels like we spend a lot more time with him. I didn't feel like I understood Alison's choices. A career-minded 20-something Los Angelina gets knocked up by a chubby, pot-smoking under-construction porn site running loser. Yeah. I honestly never believed that this character would have a baby. The film addresses the abortion issue, but in a flippant manner. Joanna Kerns pops up in one scene as Alison's mother, and advises her to get an abortion. It's clearly just there so a conservative audience can hiss at her. Sorry, folks, but people like Alison have abortions every day of the week and twice on Sundays. Without a little more background, I don't buy it. I'm also left perplexed at the absolute plethora of pop culture references. What purpose do they serve other than to date the film immediately? They talk about going to see Spider-Man 3, for Christ's sake! Despite those grumbles, the film is quite enjoyable. I liked Apatow's previous film, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, but felt it could have been funnier. Knocked Up succeeds a lot better in its comedy. It does rely a bit too much on the stoner roommates, and a scene where Rogan and Rudd take mushrooms during Cirque de Soleil is not nearly as funny as Apatow seems to think it is. But, heck, I laughed a lot during the film. And I was touched to a certain extent. Very worthwhile, though I'd definitely recommend Waitress over this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
pretty realistic... not much of a comedy,"This is one of those movies you just don't know where to put it or what to think of it. Was it really good, or bad...? Well, the thing is here that the movie has a good idea seen many times before. you know- two people have sex and the girl ends up being pregnant. I've seen like 3 or 4 movies like this but its ""Knocked up"" that will be the first one on that list. (""Juno"" being second) A good touch is not just the clash of two people that barely know each other but she clash of worlds. You also might be pulled away form the main two characters and by the end of the movie you wont be able to know the difference between the main and the supporting cast. The humor is also something that must be spoken about. Its Seth Rogen who you laugh at and none else. Maybe its because the movie tries (and manages) to keep a serious impression and not end up being just another stupid comedy. If so, its good but still, Ben Stone (thats Seth Rogen in case you didn't know) holds all the funny lines along with his roommates while on the other hand all you get from the rest of the characters is seriosity. Now, YES, its a comedy but not just that. Its pretty good with a storyline hat you know how it will end but still, it has those little turns that make the road to the end of the movie unpredictable. So if you're in for a couple of laughs- go ahead, if you're in for a serious story- go ahead. If you're in for the action- nope... wait! Its a nice and balanced movie. Go see it, if nothing- you'll remember to put a condom on next time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Apatow's genius churns out the perfect date comedy,"Judd Apatow delivers again in what is easily his most poignant comedy while still staying true to the antics of his usual band of characters. ""Knocked Up"" is able to still deliver a lot of the laughs while being honest and meaningful: in other words, something for both guys and girls to enjoy equally. While some might argue that both kind of cheat the other of realizing their full potential (it's not meaningful enough or funny enough), I say the strategy works perfectly.The true quality of this film emerges in the simple contrast between its main characters: Ben, a 23-year-old jobless stoner played by Rogen and Alison, an up-and-coming talent for TV network E! The fact that they have irresponsible sex and Alison gets pregnant forces their different lives together, which allows for a lot of humor in addition to serious relationship drama. With some great writing, Apatow really finds a way to make this a movie everyone can see, enjoy, laugh at and take something away from--a guaranteed success.If you're a girl, you will love Heigl if you for some reason you don't already which means you're one of no people who doesn't watch ""Grey's Anatomy"" and falls into the target demographic for this film. I would go as far as to say she's so talented that she's rather above this film and doesn't fit. Both she and Leslie Mann, who plays her sister, have a great rep on screen and turn this into a film that can be almost as much for girls as it is for guys. For the guys, Rogen is great in his first leading role and his posse of friends including Jason Segel and Jonah Hill keep the comic relief coming quickly if you feel there isn't enough of it. Their humor doesn't dominate the film, but there's a healthy dose--I didn't find it shortchanged although it was not exactly side-splitting. Rogen is most skilled at being able to do both the romantic comedy and the stoner comedy and not seeming unnatural.Of all the films he produces, the ones Apatow directs (this film and ""40-Year-Old Virgin"") seem to be the most meaningful ones. His style is very natural and allows for focus on the situations, dialogue and characters, portraying them in a way that is truest to real life. In this sense, ""Knocked Up"" trounces ""Virgin."" If you've been in a serious relationship, you've heard all these lines before and of course unplanned pregnancy is a very real occurrence in this world with a set of consequences and predictable actions. The fact that he found a way to do this while still including his trademarks is a testament to his grip on the film industry and will guarantee him a lot more success until someone can match his comedic prowess. Until then, any films with the Apatow tag on them will be the most anticipated comedies each year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the funnier films of the year,"There's nothing funny about getting someone pregnant after a one night stand.Or is there? Knocked Up, the new comedy from the creative mind of Judd Apatow who brought us the very funny The 40-Year-Old Virgin just over a year ago, is funny, touching, hilarious and in one scene  gross, all culminating in what is the funniest movie since.well, since The 40-Year-Old Virgin.The premise is summed up in the two word title, but let me try and expand on it just a little bit. It all starts when the beautiful Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) meets the Shrek-ish Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) at a bar where she is out with sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) looking for nothing more than a good time and a few laughs. The good time and good laughs come alright, but so does copious amounts of alcohol that eventually lead the two opposites back at Alison's house and where a miscommunication regarding the usage of a condom leads in a revelation some eight weeks later.The movie drifts between high emotional drama and belly laughs as the beauty and beast try and get to know each other while friend and family influences on both sides of the argument voice opinions and trade quips leading to the eventual birthing scene in the films final reel.There is so much to like about Knocked Up that it is hard to know where to start. Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow is able to make the audience genuinely care for the characters and their plights while surrounding them with a supporting cast that adds to much of the humor quotient of the film.What I liked best about the film was the dialogue between the characters. There is joy, confusion, anger and happiness all scattered in and around situations that every day folk like ourselves can relate to (as opposed to say, Ocean's 13). For instance, the sheer shock of hearing that Alison is pregnant, Ben retorts, ""With a baby?"" Sure, it may sound stupid, but think of what the first unsuspecting words might be coming out of your mouth if slapped in the face with a life changing occurrence.And if I liked the dialogue I really really appreciated the supporting team, in particular Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who play sister-in-law-to-Alison Debbie and her husband Pete. Mann is a quick witted, sharp, tongue spearing pessimist that thinks her husband is cheating on her. Her biting words remind me of a young Elizabeth Perkins and Paul Rudd does a fantastic job of giving us a character that is vulnerable and trapped in a family of children and responsibility.For all my praise, there are a few drawbacks which keep the film from accepting a 4+ star review rating. A sequence including magic mushrooms at a performance of Cirque in Vegas could have fell to the cutting room floor without much impact and at two hours and twenty nine minutes, it is hard for the comedic punches to maintain their open wounds.But, if you get through the roller-coaster ride and find yourself still invested in interest by the time the crowning scene rolls along, you will undoubtedly have enjoyed yourself and in the mix of explosions and car chases this summer, that is a definite good thing.www.robertsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Outstanding Dramity,"I had read most of the reviews of ""hatred"" for this film before seeing it opening night. Not one of the people whom disliked the film seemed to give it a bad film because of the plot, poor acting, bad jokes, etc. The only flaw people seemed to bring up was that there was no way that the main characters would ever get together in real life. This ""criticism"" not only didn't hold water to me (I have bore witness to many a one-night-stands of odd proportions in my lifetime), but I found it to be a very small critique of what appeared to be a much better film than that.After watching the film, I have to say that this not only had me laughing me almost out of my seat at times, but also had me really knotted up into the love story and coming of age of the characters. Judd Apatow has the Midas touch when it comes to appealing to both the childish man comedy and the classic chick-flick flare. My wife even commented that Seth Rogen even had her pulling for him and that he has a really sneaky attractiveness to him in this movie. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd both completely lived up to the billing and improved an already talented cast. This movie was well worth every penny I spent at the theater and then some. I may go see it again just to make sure that I catch all the ""other"" things that I know I missed the first time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up knocks it out of the park.,"KNOCKED UP is the latest in a line of comedies that has surfaced in the past few years that I hope lasts a long time, films that don't treat their characters as the butt of jokes or grist for the mill, but instead the film seems to love it's characters and so...we do too. The humor comes to the audience through pure honesty - it's funny...because it's so true, which is the best place for comedy to come from.When a swinging single young bachelor scores big time while out on the town, he not only spikes the ball...he plants the seed. There are so many directions one can go with a set up like this, but the idea that the couple will go through with the pregnancy...and learn to sincerely love each other, is such a breath of fresh air and optimism in a time when we so need it.Seth Rogen is the heir apparent to Ben Stiller's thrown of funny regular Jewish guy, and like any good heir should, Rogen kicks things up a notch. His warmth and good humor are all so natural and work so well together that he seems to be a movie star unlike any other. Hollywood spends millions trying to hoist the next matinée idol on us, and here Rogen just sort of slips in and I have to tell you - hand him the trophy, because he's the real deal.Katherine Heigl too is nothing short of breathtaking...not only is she easy on the eyes, and a wonderful actress, but she's gifted with the comedy too.The truth is that the film is so breezy and charming that you can't help but to be pulling for it. Judd Apatow is a gifted writer and director, with not only an ear for what's funny, but the balls to put it out there and trust the audience won't pass a negative judgment on the characters. Lines like: ""Don't let the door hit your pu**y on the way out."" I mean...ya gotta love it. He also made The 40 year Old Virgin, if you haven't seen that already - rent it.Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, and the rest of the cast seem to be having so much fun here it's infectious. Can you tell I liked the film? I will say there were parts of it that really reminded me of an old indie film called COURTING COURTNEY that I picked up ages ago, it's not exactly a remake...but there seemed to be slight organ transplants which were all just a loving nod to this little seen no budget indie gem.Biggest laugh was Leslie Mann trying to get into a bar and being told she couldn't because she was too old. The doorman, whom I believe was played by an actor named Craig Robinson, was PITCH PERFECT with lines like:""You old, she pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old pregnant bi****s running around. That's crazy, I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that, that means if there's 25 people here I get to let in one and a quarter black people. So I gotta hope there's a midget in the crowd.""For that kind of dialog alone...KNOCKED UP is worth the admission, and in this day and age of admission prices, that's saying something.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Out of the Ball Park?,"Forgive the rather redundant pun. The end of the day what I should try and summarise quickly is that this comedy is actually funny. Considering that my view of romantic comedies is that they tend to play for the safe laughs and an expected happy ending. Knocked Up does not do that.The premise itself is rather risqué when painted as a romantic comedy (which this film is over the gross out comedy more often associated American Pie or Apatow's other work The 40 Year Old Virgin) as essentially a slacker impregnates a beautiful, though equally clueless, woman.Overlooked completely are the leads in this movie. While Rogen gets most of the laughs (and deservedly so) it is Heigl who gives the best performance. Her breakdown in the clinic is completely believable and brings a tear to even the most unemotional human being. Equal applause should go to Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) who despite being essentially the nemesis of the piece gives just as important a performance as a woman trapped in a souring marriage. Paul Rudd is the only of the four leads who isn't given enough to really shine. Hilarious in Anchorman and Apatow's earlier piece here he feels like an add-on to the main cast.Nevertheless the film is brilliantly written and superbly performed by everyone. The highlights are undoubtedly the beard jokes ('your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles) and Harold Ramis' Alzheimers skit. All the while remember that the two leads are actually have a lot of the same neuroses and fears as anyone in a relationship and that is perhaps the film's strongest point that despite the aesthetic differences between the pair. Ben actually makes Alison happy after initial teething's and that perhaps is the strongest suit of the film that the pair are completely believable despite the inevitable smutty jokes. It is well observed and masterfully executed.See this film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

enjoyable,"i have to say how much i enjoyed this film. i didn't expect to like it as much as i did. The title of the film suggests the type of over-the-top brainless, sexist film which conforms to all the clichéd ""porkys"" elements that came before it. But it's not. The film has a real subtle warmth about it. The leading performers all have a under-stated likability about them. I liked the improvised dialogue that Ben and his stoner friends used during their scenes, it gave each of their characters their own individuality, each being able to hold his/her own screen presence. I friend of mine said the film was completely sexist because if the the roles were reversed and it was a hot, successful guy who got a over-weight slacker girl pregnant the the film would be more like Fatal Attraction than an easy going comedy. I suppose there is a point to be made there but sometimes you should appreciate something for what it is. This is obviously no Citizen Kane and i don't think it's ever attempting to be, but likewise when you go to Burger King you don't expect french fries and caviar. To finish, this is not a laugh out loud comedy, however, if you've got a couple of hours to kill and you feel like watching something that makes you smile and forget that you live in rainy England for a while this picture is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

So-So Movie,"I actually can't see why this movie was so successful and all that praise for Katherine Heigl?! She is an okay actress in this movie, but nothing outstanding. Cameron Diaz would have played this role ten times better, but at least she was a rather fresh face. Seth Rogan was pretty good and the supporting cast was awesome. All in all this movie is just far too long. It keeps dragging on and on, not much of a storyline. I didn't even get what this was really about?!?! Oh and it's far to vulgar for my taste. I don't mind a little, but in this movie they just don't know when to stop. I wouldn't even call it a comedy, but I guess it fits best in this category. Knocked up doesn't really know what to be. Not my taste, but at least it's a ''comedy'' you haven't seen already ten times before.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One-dimensional and unsure what it wants to be,"Knocked Up is one of those movies that seems to get instant cult status, based partly on its pedigree (guys from The 40 Year Old Virgin and recent Will Ferrell movies) and its appeal to twentysomething stoner/slackers. But although some of the jokes are pretty good, and the performances are mostly spot-on, the film's pretty uneven; the funny parts are mostly funny, but the so-called sincere parts come off as maudlin or treacly.Ben (Seth Rogen) is the slacker/stoner in question here. He and his not-all-there buds (ha! check out the double meaning) are in the process of launching a website dedicated to finding nudity in mainstream movies. If you immediately said, ""What, like Mr. Skin?"" you're in the target audience. So basically, Ben has no job, and neither do the rest of the man-children in his posse.Contrary to that is Alison (Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy), an E! entertainment producer-type who's just been given a shot at working in front of the camera. So she heads out to a club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and winds up hooking up with Ben. Of course, she was drunk at the time - Heigl is a pinup model and Rogen is a fat slob. So you know it's sort of true to life in that sense.Fast forward eight weeks later, and Alison's preggers. Whoopsie daisy. Now how will these two lustbirds reconcile the fact that they don't really know each other with this impending birth? Or, for that matter, the fact that while sober neither has anything in common with the other? As I said, scenes that are supposed to be funny usually work, because Rogen is just doofy enough to pull it off; the film works when it pokes fun at Ben's slacker proclivities or the idiosyncrasies of his friends. It doesn't work so much in the way the women are portrayed, however. Look, we've all enjoyed movies in which women are mere objects, right? Porky's, I'm looking at you! Done right, that sort of approach can be raucously entertaining. But in this movie, the womenfolk alternately come off as wildly bitchy or just humorless. Alison was never really shown to have much of a sense of humor (although there's one scene in which she helps the boys spot nude scenes in films for their website).That's all well and good regardless, because some movies can manage to have ""bad"" female characters off of which the males can play. But that's where the schizophrenia of this movie comes into play; is it a low-brow, misogynistic comedy or a relationship movie? Too often, it opted for the latter, and if you're trying to show the trials and tribulations of two crazy kids who aren't even in love with each other, you shouldn't make one of them unlikable and irrational. Even if, you know, that's how it'd be in real life.Judd Apatow, who brought us similarly flawed The 40 Year Old Virgin, compares the burgeoning Ben-Alison relationship to the marriage of Debbie and Pete. Oops, looks like Pete's an inconsiderate jerk! Looks like Debbie's an overreacting, hyperactive nitwit! Of course, Apatow's not saying theirs is the ideal relationship for which Ben and Alison should strive, but he makes it seem as if just having an relationship is a bad idea.And I know I might be in the minority here, but I've never liked humor that serves only to humiliate someone. So when Ben or Alison launches a profanity-laced attack on the other, that's not funny. It's not even entertaining. It's annoying.(Another recurring theme was that Debbie feels unappreciated. Check out the scene in which she and Alison are turned away from a club - Alison because she's pregnant and Debbie because she's, um, old. Leslie Mann is two years younger than me, it should be noted; anyway, the scene is presumably supposed to show the sisters bonding over their respective rejections, but all it did was show Debbie as whiny.) One plus, though - good to see Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly) getting some work; here, he's Alison's boss. His rotten-bitch-sycophant assisant has to go, though. She, like some of the other secondary and tertiary characters, was just thoroughly obnoxious and useless - not funny in the biting, sarcastic way, just caustic and off-putting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Awesome,"I wouldn't say that Judd Apatow is reinventing comedy but he definitely adds substance that most comedies do not have. Most comedies are bad because they do not have to be good to make money. Clichéd jokes make money. So when a comedy comes along that takes the service to actually be funny (or disservice if you are brain dead member of the general public that helped make NORBIT and WILD HOGS international hits) it is enormously refreshing. And when that movie can make a hundred million dollars in the process, well, that makes one think that maybe there is hope for this country.Well that movie was called 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN which was able to achieve such a rare combination. And director Apatow and a chunk of the cast are back for the not-quite-as-funny-but-still-pretty-damn-good follow-up, KNOCKED UP.KNOCKED UP has the same brilliant interaction between the main characters, highlighted by the brilliant conversation about how MUNICH was the first movie where Jews were able to kick ass and take names. Main star Ben, played by rising star Seth Rogen, claims one night at a bar that if any of them get laid to night it is ""because of Eric Bana."" Well unfortunately for Ben Mr. Bana's ass kicking charm worked a little too well and he ends up going home with a recently promoted E! Entertainment Channel reporter named Allsion (GREY'S ANATOMY'S Katherine Heigl). Allison finds out she is pregnant five months later and must approach Ben, whom she is increasingly disgusted with, to tell her she is, well, knocked up. He decides he wants to help any way possible. He enters her life permanently followed by romance and a possible family.Why this film works, along with the hilarious jokes, is because it takes a very real approach to life. It doesn't rely on lazy relationship stereotypes. Ben is a jobless slacker who is trying to create a website with his buddies helping men know at what time their favorite actresses are naked in films. But where most films would show the male as a loner and slacker who slowly needs to realize that love is in front of him he just needs to grow up this film shows that Ben, though definitely a slacker and immature, likes Allison the while time. He WANTS to grow up, just doesn't know how. And where most films would have Allison begging to be with Ben and have a family, in real life most men would kill to be with a girl like Allison. So she is the one in charge of the relationship and having the issues, not Ben.The truth is in life men can be just as eager and zealous to be with woman and this movie takes no shortcuts and shows you a world where serious situations can happen to real peopletough hilariously.And if nothing else see the film Ben's roommate Jason claiming that he can't wait till its time to look up Felicity Huffman's nude scenes because he's had a thing for her since TRANSMERICA. Earning the most rousing, yet delayed, laughs of the movie. Highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Loudest Fun ever seen...,"I agree that Seth Rogen is being seen in almost every next Hollywood comedy this days but I also believe that he is one of the spontaneous comedian & quite perfect in good for nothing fellow roles. This movie represents him in a complete fun package. The movie is full of gags, adult humor & successfully tickles your funny bones in first half (if u like this sort of loud gag bag comedy), even the sentimental lines of the film remain the hilarious one but in second half it turned to show up some sentimental part. Katherine Heigl played a girl next door role here with her characteristic charm. Worth to watch if u like Comedy of Rogen.Ratings-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny, yes. Hysterical, no","This is the ultimate date- chick-flick movie. Every woman in the audience ate this film up. Any movie with a pregnant woman in it for that matter. The director Michael Apatow took a big chance by putting a lot social commentary about the men's lives. I'm surprised at a few of the other scenes that he included. First it was unnecessary to show Heigel's fake vagina with a baby coming out. Second, I see that nepotism is alive and well with him putting his two little girls in the movie. Third, there's an interesting (yet totally irrelevant) scene of Heigel and Mann trying to get into a club by ignoring the line and getting put down for it. In the end the director wimps out and apologizes for the snub. Naturally at the end of the movie a baby gets born and everything is all right with the world. Give me a break! This doesn't happen anywhere. By the time the credits rolled I was ready to kill myself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl shine as the odd couple,"After the frat pack started to fizzle out by the mid 00s a new bunch of younger comedians took their place. This stoner gang consisted of Seth Rogen, James Franco, Judd Apatow behind the camera, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd etc and they would rule the roost of Hollywood comedies for the next few years. Knocked Up is one of their first and one of the finest entries. This isn't a laugh riot but more about comedy with dramatic elements.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
feel good movie,"I've seen this movie before, but am revisiting as, (although a predictable plot) it has that 'feel good' vibe coupled to an easy going, gentler comedy.Worth watching if you want your faith in human nature restored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Grown-up Fun,"Don't know if it was brilliant, exactly, but KNOCKED UP worked. At least for the most part. Judd Apatow once again does a good job of framing scenes that come off with almost an improvisational quality, and the first half-hour of this movie has some great laughs (my personal opinion of Ryan Seacrest has improved considerably).It isn't great. This feels more like a collection of related skits than an actual story, but since some of these ""skits"" manage to be either funny, touching, or otherwise entertaining, it's okay. But in a comedy that comes out to more than 2 hours (on DVD), it does seem to get a little long, after a while.This is a rude, crude movie for adults, though there are some pretty good messages about responsibility and the challenges people face as they start a family (particluarly an unplanned one), and I (personally) would probably let high-school-age kids see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarous at the time,"It's every man's worst nightmare: after a one-night stand with a pretty girl you meet at a nightclub, she calls you up six weeks later and tells you she's pregnant and is going to keep the baby. I would imagine that if Knocked Up sent any lesson to its male audience, it would be to give out a fake phone number next time. Just kidding.This is one of those comedies that was hilarious at the time, but no one has any idea how funny it will be as the years pass. Who knows how funny it will be to laugh at a guy completely unprepared for fatherhood suddenly reading baby books and going shopping for bassinets? Years from now, audiences might wonder why Katherine Heigl wanted Seth Rogen to be an active father figure in her child's life if he was so irresponsible and ill equipped. For now, it's still funny when drunk people think they're good dancers, when doctors have less tact than you'd like, and when bedroom scenes don't go as planned. If you missed this one when it came out, gather up a group of your friends and have a steady stream of cocktails ready. Just don't do what I did: no matter how cool and modern your parents want to prove they are, don't watch this movie with them.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Too much bickering,"I liked the movie, but I had to take two naproxen and two tylenol tabs after--it gave me such a headache. Some scenes were a bit much, e.g. the woman OB/GYN comment about mistaking the vagina for an asshole. Simply not needed. I think the movie would have been much better with a little more humor, and less bickering and dumb comments like the one above. It was a little hard to suspend judgment about a cute girl getting involved with someone outside her ""cutegory."" I also thought that the Jill character was initially developed as a little too mean to be redeemed later. Cut 30 minutes and the unneeded lines from the movie, add a little more humor, and you've got a 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny, yes, but somehow weirdly beautiful. One to watch!","I started watching this film with a scepticism, i expected it to be funny, and vulgar, with witty jokes, and that is exactly what i got. However, when the film centred in on the love of Alison (Katherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen) and the birth, it was actually a weirdly beautiful thing. I'm not one to enjoy any films to do with love and all that rubbish (hence why i chose to watch this film) but towards the end, i started to enjoy the lovely-dovey stuff that came to light and enjoyed it even more with the jokes that tended to deter away from the sad/love things. There were many jokes surrounding the life of the group of pot smokers, but, i didn't expect a lot of the jokes to be well thought up and to be honest, quite smart. Obviously with a film like this you get the basic jokes that were in-your-face but i feel there was just the right amount of it for it still to work.Also, there was the gorgeous Katherine Heigl as a lead which made it more aesthetically pleasing but also the character of Ben performed brilliantly by Seth Rogen which tended to make it more accessible to the viewers as, lets be honest, he is physically blessed but he acting was top knock and he was very funny.I would recommend this film to you as it is a must-see. If you are only into romance-type films, then i would steer clear, but only if you cannot appreciate some toilet humour, if you can, there is still an element of love and it should be seen. Don't BE DETERRED if you do enjoy the films about weed and silly jokes, because that is predominantly what this film is about and the jokes are very funny.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
When Slacker met Yuppie,"Being facetious, one could say that the premise of the movie is pure science fiction fantasy: a somewhat overweight dope-smoking slacker somehow meets an absolutely beautiful woman who has been promoted to an on-air role on an entertainment TV programme.The beautiful woman in question is Katherine Heigl, who plays Alison Scott. She has a terrific dead-pan persona when dealing with the slacker's ways & attitudes (the slacker is Ben Stone, played by Seth Rogen)...a real poker-face. I'm not sure if Heigl's teeth have been done by Industrial Light & Magic, but they are hard to look at without sunglasses.Anyway, as a result of Scott & Stone's union, Scott gets pregnant. This serves as the premise for which this odd couple spend more time with each other than one would ordinarily expect.Much of the humour arises from Stone's slacker ways (along with his friends too...each of which is horrifyingly interesting...like a car-crash). The way Scott doesn't give anything away in dealing with Stone is also funny.The good thing about this movie is the way that the comedic load is shared amongst the cast...from the main players to people with minor roles. E.g. the scenes with Scott's superiors are very funny...especially her female superior, who is a bit of a seething mass of resentment towards Alison.Or the married couple Scott and Stone hang out with (the wife is Scott's sister). Both married characters get to steal a few scenes with their face pulling or outrageous opinions.I especially like the scene where Alison's sister just has a melt-down when a black bouncer refuses to let her and Alison into a night club. What is even better is when the black bouncer gets to say some good lines in response.For me, the movie tends to fall a bit towards the end.i.e.when Ben and the husband take magic mushrooms before seeing Cirque de Soleil. It isn't quite as funny as it sounds.Things pick up for the funny birth scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An Entertaining and Touching Comedy (So Don't Expect a Rip-Roarious Laugh Fest),"Not the joke parade that ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" was, but this film's got a lot of heart. I'd say the main focus is on the serious subject matter: a young couple struggling to make the best out of an unexpected pregnancy.It seems like a more real-life, touching kind of story than in ""Virgin"" (where the focus was the ridiculous situation of a man who'd never had sex). This movie is something that could happen to anyone. There's still some comedy (mostly in the form of improvised comebacks). The film also gives an entertaining look at the differences in male and female perspectives.I enjoyed ""Virgin"" and read rave reviews of this movie, but I found many one-star reviews online and wasn't sure what to expect. Personally, I really liked the film. Not so much as an uproarious comedy as a heartfelt look at real-world issues, seen through a not-too-serious lens. (There are cast and crew baby photos during the end credits.) It's not too off-the-wall and it's not too melodramatic. It's just serious enough, and there's some humor to go with it.I think most of the criticisms I read were about vulgarity. This film is rated R (or above), so vulgarity shouldn't catch you off-guard. There is a lot of swearing, but not to the extent that people were complaining about. I didn't notice it as a problem. (Maybe I'm desensitized.) It's used in conversations the way I'd hear out with friends. Not for the overly sensitive and not for small children. There is also some nudity (including a few shots of authentic childbirth action), so keep that in mind if that's an issue.Seth Rogen plays Ben, who becomes the father of Alison's (Katherine Heigl) unborn child. Alison lives with her sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd), whose marriage is work. The two sisters stick by each other's side while the two men bond. The supporting cast includes many Apatow Productions alums (including Jason Segel and Martin Starr from ""Freaks and Geeks"" and Jonah Hill, who'd later star in ""Superbad""). Paul Rudd has some of the best lines.""Knocked Up"" has its raunchy moments, but it's not a mindless, raunchy, fratboy comedy. Don't expect comedic genius or two hours of gags, because this movie is more about heart. This is a very entertaining film if you go into it with the right mindset. I'd bet it would be a good pick to watch with your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, or husband. 7.5/10 stars.(NOTE: I've only seen the R-rated theatrical version, so I don't know what's different on the unrated DVD.)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hit and Miss,"Considering that I have watched 40 Year Old Virgin 20+ times, I had great expectations for this movie. Well, I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was funny. The story line was good...and is definitely relevant to a lot of people. The humor was hit or miss, but the good one-liners and expressions were well above average. The problem...language. A good f-bomb or two can be dropped into a dialogue and prove to be funny. However, the excessive language was over the top and took away from the story line. I wasn't impressed, and I think it just proves that some producers and directors don't have the ability to deliver a movie that's gut-wrenching funny from beginning to end. I would have been just fine if the language was replaced with some more dramatic dialogue to make it a bit more chick-flickish. I'm not a chick flick kinda guy, but I'll take it if it will add to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Little Disappointed,"Well see, I'm a huge fan of Katie Heigl. She's just such a great actress, she's so talented and gorgeous. She acted well in this movie too. All the actors/actresses acted well.The beginning of 'Knocked Up' really disappointed me. I was so looking forward to see this movie but I think the beginning is just a bit ordinary. It was a little boring. But there's one dialog I laughed so much about, this is probably one of the bests: Jack: We decided that, we want you to be on camera. Alison Scott: Oh my god,really? Jill: I know, I was so surprised too. I love what Jill says. What I really loved to was the unshown scene in which Alison interviews Eva Mendez, it's very funny what they're talking about and how Alison reacts on what Eva says. Great scene! Why wasn't it shown in the movie?The part of the movie where Alison and Ben try to live together, is very funny and I started to enjoy watching the movie. It became very funny. All in all this movie shows how fast it could happen to lose his single life because of a one One-Night-Stand. I think this movie shows good the risk but it's not like a documentary it's a comedy which shows it and I think this is great. Seth Rogen and Katie Heigl were such a great screen couple and I could imagine to see them in another movie too. There was such a great chemistry between them. But I really want to mention Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann too because they really did a great job too, even I think that Paul's acting wasn't as good as I know it from 'Friends'. Well, this was a nice entertainment but it's not the best comedy I've ever seen. It's average. But watch it yourself to see if you think other!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A great comedy, and drama.","Stars: Seth Rogen, Kathryn Heigl, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Allen Tudyc, Harold Ramis. Cameos by Ryan Seacrest, Steve Carell, Jessica Simpson, Jessica Alba.I really enjoyed ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", and I figured I would enjoy this. While I really did enjoy this, I liked it in a different way. It's actually easier to relate to this situation and (some of) these characters than the ones in writer/director Judd Appatow's last film. The plot of this is pretty simple. After a night of partying and drinking, strangers Ben Stone (Rogen) and Allison Scott (Heigl) have sex, she gets pregnant. Allison is a hard worker and Ben doesn't work and is interested only in smoking pot with his friends and watching films where women undress. ""Knocked Up"" managed to have some really hilarious comedy, and the next moment it seamlessly went to drama that was actually sad. The only problem I had with this was it occasionally went too much into comedy and too often relied on Ben's friends for cheap laughs, but usually it was fine and hilarious. It was written very well, and often very realistically too. I highly recommend you see it!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****.

Not just another Apatow- Rogen sex comedy,"Judd Apatow has done countless comedy films and so has Seth Rogen as well. Both have collaborated on several occasions. Well Knocked Up could easily be seen as another one of those films. But, you cannot judge a book by it's cover. Knocked Up was released in 2007 (the same year as the Apatow produced Superbad). The film was written and directed by Judd Apatow (The 40 Year Old Virgin) and stars Seth Rogen (Superbad) and Katherine Heigl (Grey's Anatomy). The film would receive critical praise and do fairly well at the box office.Ben (Seth Rogen) is a pot smoking, slacker who does not have a job. He goes to a club with a bunch of his friends and gets drunk and goes on a one night stand with celebrity interviewer Alison (Katherine Heigl). Some time goes by and Alison finds out that she is pregnant. It is up to Ben to step up and learn about responsibility.Before watching this film, one can assume that this film is just another one of those Apatow sex comedies (like The 40-Year Old Virgin) that just so happens to have Seth Rogen. But, I would say that if this movie was what I was expecting, the film would be average at best. But Knocked Up is not another one of those films. Frankly, it is better than films like The 40-Year Old Virgin. Of course we are given actors and actresses who are funny and do a good job in their roles which is something that is always present in these Apatow films. But it should be noted that what Knocked Up does best is not just make this a sex comedy or just a comedy, it is a journey of two people who live two completely different lifestyles and become close due to this unexpected event that occurred in their life. There is comedy and fairly good comedy but while I find myself laughing more at the comedy of The 40-Year Old Virgin, it is this balance of comedy and the sentimental moments which are done fairly well. I can actually take an Apatow film somewhat seriously because it has those sentimental moments with our two main characters. You notice that they are unsure of the future but no matter what, they will do anything for one another. You see that even though Rogen's character is not the typical guy that has it all and everything, he gives it his all and there are moments where it comes off as sweet. I would just say go see the film for all of that alone. Also, the music used in this film is kind of dope. For me, it was songs by the likes of The B-52's, The All-American Rejects, and Beck. My only complaint about this film is the length which usually is a problem with most Apatow films. I think over two hours is just a little too long for a comedy film. Try to keep it between 90 and 100 minutes.Knocked Up balances the comedic and sentimental moments superbly and shows that this film is not just another Apatow sex comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Way overrated!?,"I really liked The 40 Year Old Virgin but this was more annoying than funny.Firstly it was more a cruddy druggy 'Grandma's Boy' type film than the clever and funny 40 YO Virgin with likable characters.Secondly it seems to purport to be a 'message movie', though for the life of me I can't tell what that message is in the context of the film.Thirdly the premise of the film was utterly unbelievable, even at any level within the world of the film.We are expected to believe that firstly this woman would conceive a baby with this junkie slob, and secondly she would decide she suddenly loves him and his lifestyle while being horribly bitchy about him?? I expected a lot from the funny trailer and just got another annoying 'comedy'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up,"When ""Knocked Up"" came out in summer 2007 it became, shockingly, one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the decade. It was also a box office hit and when I saw it for the first time theatrically I thought it was very good, but was a little surprised at the overwhelming praise it received from critics and audiences. I gave the film another shot today after finally getting around to seeing Apatow's directorial debut ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" last night and found my feelings to be almost exactly the same as the first time I watched it. I've noticed a backlash build up against the film recently, and while I wish to distance myself from that as I still enjoyed the film quite a bit, I do have to admit that, well, it's a little, here comes the dreaded word: overrated.""Knocked Up"" is far more focused on drama than ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is, in fact the relationship drama seems to me the real center of the film instead of the comedy. I have no problems with this at all, but now that I've seen it twice I know that my personal feelings on the dramatic aspects of this screenplay are that it's not anything really special. It's a good, solid story with well-written characters, but I really don't think it's worthy of the sort of praise heaped on it. Do Heigl's Alison or Rogen's Ben really hold a candle to Andy as characters, or really any of the supporting characters in this live up to those from ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""? I don't think so.The movie is less focused on sex than ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and Apatow proves himself capable of handling comic conversations with emotional relevance to the story yet again. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was great thanks to superb comedic timing from the entire cast and Apatow as a director, as well as whoever edited the film. It was a phenomenal example of its craft. ""Knocked Up"" is a very good example of its craft. I don't care for Heigl though she's okay here and in all honesty I think I prefer Rogen as a supporting actor and writer than in a leading role. He was great on ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"" and in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", but I think there was a little too much of his shtick here and in ""Pineapple Express"". ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is problematic for several reasons but it has a lot of plus points, Rogen's toned-down and efficient performance (mostly, I gather, due to Kevin Smith limiting his improv) and Elizabeth Banks' brilliant turn as Miri perhaps the strongest aspects of the film.I enjoyed ""Knocked Up"", I really did, and I hope I haven't sounded too negative about the film because I still thought it was very good. I much preferred ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" from Apatow as a writer as far as his movie career goes and the better Apatow-produced film from 2007 in my estimation was ""Superbad"". I actually think Rogen is a better writer than actor, and while Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd made up somewhat for Heigl and Rogen's occasional mediocrity and lack of great comic timing, it didn't keep it from affecting my enjoyment of the film. Glad I gave this a rewatch but I think the one I'll keep going back to is Apatow's debut.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not as funny as I could have possibly hoped for, but still a mostly enjoyable Judd Apatow comedy","The last film I saw which Judd Apatow was involved in was ""Superbad"", and my review of that hit 2007 comedy will tell you how puzzled I was by its massive appeal! However, I had seen several Apatow movies before that one and found several of them funny. He was a producer for all these films, and wrote and/or directed SOME of them. He wrote, directed, and co-produced ""Knocked Up"", another successful R-rated comedy released the same year as ""Superbad"". I was expecting this one to be a lot funnier than the last Apatow production I saw, and in my opinion, it definitely is that. Maybe most people who have seen the two films think they're both great comedies, and I don't think either of them is, but at least I still think this one is good.Alison Scott has been working behind-the-scenes at E! Television Network, but she gets promoted to an on-air position. She is single, but her older sister, Debbie has a husband named Pete, and the couple has kids. To celebrate Alison's promotion, the two sisters go to a night club. Debbie has to leave early when she hears that her daughter has chicken pox, but when this happens, Alison decides to stay behind with Ben Stone, a guy she has just met. Alison and Ben both leave drunk that night and end up having sex. However, after this one-night stand, she begins to learn about this young man and how little they have in common! Ben is an irresponsible stoner who is working on a website with his friends which tells people the exact moments when famous actresses appear naked in movies! Eight weeks later, Alison finds herself throwing up at work, and it is soon discovered that she is pregnant after her one session with Ben!This Judd Apatow effort certainly doesn't start out hilarious, but there are some funny scenes near the beginning, such as the first conversation we see between Debbie and Pete. It gets really funny starting with Alison waking Ben up the morning after their night of drunken sex, which is followed by a scene showing the two of them learning about each other while out for breakfast. These are both big laughs! I even laughed when I saw Alison throwing up on the air, as wrong as that scene may be! After a while, the film goes downhill a little. There were parts which I found somewhat funny, but not as many REALLY funny moments as before. I sometimes found myself kind of struggling to stay into it, but this certainly didn't last for the rest of the viewing, and I found lots of comic highlights at different points, as the movie shows Debbie and Pete's marriage in trouble, and Alison and Ben also having problems with their relationship. The dialogue is a major part of the humour. Whether I was laughing hard or not, I did find that the story can certainly be intriguing at times, especially towards the end, and there are some touching moments which can also add to the film's quality.If you're at all familiar with Judd Apatow's work, it really shouldn't surprise you that this particular film of his is very raunchy and juvenile, and obviously many people don't find this kind of humour the least bit amusing. However, while I found that this type of humour did not work in ""Superbad"" for the most part, I would say it mostly does work in this film, just like it does in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", another comedy which Apatow was a major part of. While ""Knocked Up"" isn't as consistently funny as that 2005 comedy blockbuster, which I first saw a few years ago, it succeeded in making me laugh many times, and also gave me an overall engaging story with memorable characters. These elements were enough to leave me in a good mood, and I have to give the film credit for that. If you're an adult who is into sex jokes, this could be a comedy for you, even if it doesn't COMPLETELY live up to its reputation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Apatow knocks it out of the park.  Could it be better than The 40 Year Old Virgin???,"Knocked Up sounded just like The 40 Year Old Virgin did when I first heard about it. Raunchy, disrespectful, vulgar, and stupid. I was wrong about The 40 Year Old Virgin, and I was wrong about Knocked Up. What you've got is by far the best comedy of the year, because it's clever, romantic, sweet, and most of all, absolutely hilarious.Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the typical loser. He smokes pot, watches nude scenes in movies, and sits on his rear all day doing nothing. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl looking absolutely gorgeous) has everything going for her. She just got promoted at the E! Network, and she is finally ready to make a life of her own. When Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) takes her out to celebrate, Ben and Alison meet and there is an instant connection. Many drinks and hours later, the unlikely pair head back to her house for some fun. Fast forward 8 weeks. Alison finds out she's pregnant by the loser Ben, but the two vow to try and make a relationship work between them for the sake of their child.Now, first off, this story could actually be written as a dramatic movie/coming of age story. How Judd Apatow got so much comedy out of this is proof of his comedic genius. He is the King of Comedy. There are religion jokes (great all the way through), sex jokes, fart jokes, pot jokes, relationship jokes, and everything else you can think of. They are nonstop and vary between witty and just plain stupid, and that's the brilliance of it. The cameos of Ryan Seacrest and James Franco are unforgettable. Not a scene goes by without a laugh, even serious ones. Apatow's direction and the timing of actors like Rogen, Mann, and Paul Rudd allow for those humorous moments to weave seamlessly with the drama, not taking anything away from it. It really is brilliant directing and writing on the part of Judd Apatow. Wonderful job.The actors are equally as brilliant, especially Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. Rogen does a great job of building a character. When we meet Ben, he's a lazy, sleazy slacker, but Rogen evolves him as the film goes on into a sweet and good man. He's good, but he still has problems. The film will also delve into the things men don't understand about women and vice versa. At first, you'll like only Alison, but by the end you'll love both of them. Katherine Heigl has a knack for inserting drama into stupid comedies and making them better. She really knows how to take a director's advice and make the best out of it. She is extremely likable as Alison, and yes, her looks definitely help her, even though she spends a majority of the movie pregnant. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are absolutely hysterical as the reluctantly married couple. Rudd gives one of the strongest supporting performances in a comedy I've ever seen. Every scene between Rudd and Rogen is unmissable. Rudd has some of the best comedic timing in the business, and it's on display at its best here. Harold Ramis is also great as Ben's father, as are Jonah Hill and Jason Segel (a Craig Bierko look-a-like) in roles as Ben's friends. His 4 friends account for some of the best jokes in the movie.The only faults I find with Knocked Up are its runtime (just about 2hrs 10mins) and the fact that it is eerily similar to The 40 Year Old Virgin. The male characters in each movie are each thrown into a situation they don't want to be in, each male character has 4 friends supporting him all the way, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, and Jonah Hill are in both movies, and even some of the jokes are recycled. The fact of the matter is, if you liked The 40 Year Old Virgin, you'll like Knocked Up. It really is a great comedy that shouldn't be missed. It's also an excellent date movie...if you're old enough. This is a very R rated movie, not for anyone under 17 or 18. Go see it while there's lots of people in the theater, trust me.9/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up — About a good guy slob knocking up a career oriented beauty,"Knocked Up is a silly yet serious comedy. You have a mix of the completely goofball and eternal teen played by Seth Rogen, and the very serious and proper career oriented young adult played by the beautiful Katherine Heigl. You could have picked better opposite.The whole movie is like that and makes you alternate between the two world. How they mesh is pretty simple, you'll see. It's very touching, and you'll be rooting for all parties, because they are all right and wrong.There's something for everybody. Emotions, laughters, completely idiotic behaviors, responsible decisions, breakups, makeups, kisses, tenderness, and sex. That movie gives you everything and is the opposite of the dating movie, it goes backward.One thing irked me: at some point, it seemed to be anti-abortion. I'm pro-choice, and that ruffles my feather. Beyond that, it's a crazy setup.The acting is good, mostly silly, the story is excellent, if nothing new, and the soundtrack very appropriate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It wasn't one of those movies that strung you along with a funny moment here and there, it was consistently funny throughout. I highly recommend going to see this, and I really hope the previews do it justice. I also love that it had a lot of the people from Freaks and Geeks and The 40 Year Old Virgin, great combo for a comedy team. Rogen was great in this and I'm glad they didn't go with Jennifer Love Hewitt or Kate Bosworth for the leading female role, I think it would have left the movie a little dry.

The film was made by Judd Apatow, the maker of such films like the 40-Year-Old Virgin and a key member of the Frat pack. I am not a big film of the Frat Pack type comedies but there were good reviews for Knocked Up at the time.The plot of the film is as the title suggests, a woman getting pregnant after a one night stand. The main character of the film is Allison (Katherine Heigl), a woman working for E! and was given the chance to become a presenter. At the same time Ben (Seth Rogen) is a lazy, unemployed young man who lived with his friends and was working on a website that tells people when a nude scene was in a movie. Allison and her sister decide to celebrate her promotion by going for the night and in a bar Allison meets Ben. The two of them get drunk and go back the Allison's. Whilst getting ready for the act of love Ben struggles to put protection on. Allison tell him to hurry up and he misunderstands and goes on unprotected. The obvious result was that she gets pregnant and the film focuses on Allison and Ben's relationship afterwards.The film was advised as a comedy in the mould of Frat Pack comedy. However this film did not have the slapstick or silliness you would expect from those sort of films and Knocked Up was must more serious movie. I put it down to the subject matter that the film matter. There were issues of relationships and parenthood in this movie. There was also a sub-plot between Allison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her relationship with her husband. There was also the issue about Ben having to grow up and face his responsibilities. The film did make me smile and chuckle, but was belly arching laugher. It was an okay movie, but nothing special. Okay to watch if it was on TV.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny yet endearing movie.,"This is a great comedy film from the Apatow camp. Knocked up is silly, offensive and yet romantic. For Knocked Up, writer/director Judd Apatow's sophomore feature, the filmmaker has elected to follow pretty much the same formula that made his debut, The 40 Year Old Virgin, such a success. Considering how winning the formula is, it's a safe approach. The often ribald humor is genuinely funny. The characters are endearing and very well played by Seth Rogen(Who is right at home here in this material) and Katherine Heigl. And there's something warm and sweet about the underlying storyline. Apatow is clearly a romantic, even if there's a profane edge to his ""love conquers all"" worldview. Other filmmakers embarking into the comedy minefield could learn a thing or two from him.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Disappointing ""40-Year Old Virgin"" follow-up","""Knocked Up"" is a manipulative comedy by writer-director Judd Apatow whose previous work has included the fabulous, short-lived television series ""Freaks & Geeks"" and the Steve Carrell vehicle ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"". Here again many attempts are made to interweave humor and heart, but unfortunately it fails to overcome its Monday night NBC feel.The basic premise has ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Katherine Heigl and ""Freaks""-alum Seth Rogan having a one-time drunken hook-up that leads to an unplanned pregnancy. Unfortunately, as in many a sit-com she's a stunning, responsible, professional woman and he's a chubby, teddy bear of an immature loser with a deep indention in his couch. What's a girl to do? Well, in the world of Hollywood the answer lies in skimming the leaves off the ""Pygmalion"" pool one more time.""Knocked Up"" isn't a bad movie, exactly. It's got plenty of laughs and a bit of the predictable third act sap, but part of the charm of ""Freaks & Geeks"" and ""Virgin"" was in Apatow's ability to create unique, believable characters that lived in what felt like the real world. This film doesn't really have that, but instead has caricatures playing out predictable gender stereotypes in an overly convenient storyline. This is standard comedy, and it's clear from previous viewing experience that Apatow is just better than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Remarkably entertaining despite Stretching Credibility,"Although the film was enjoyable and lived up to the critical praise it received, there was one major premise that rang false.The story in a nutshell is that Alison (Katherine Heigl), a TV reporter, meets unemployed Ben (Seth Rogen) in a local bar, becomes pregnant from him that same night, and spends the rest of the movie coping with her predicament and the relationship. There are several funny incidents involving her gynecologists, her sister, and their adventures trying to enter an exclusive club.What was not at all credible was that Alison would have pursued any kind of ongoing relationship with Ben in the real world. Alison was a very attractive woman who probably could have dated anyone, and could hardly go anywhere without being hit upon. Ben was just the opposite: unattractive, overweight, with no money, no job, no career prospects, and friends who were a bunch of losers. When she learned she was pregnant, I couldn't believe she would call him about it, since she otherwise had little interest in him. She certainly did not need him for his breadwinner's role, and she showed little chemistry for him other than their impending parenthood. However, I might concede that the one-night stand itself may have been plausible because they were drunk.This was one of the very few movie couples I rooted against and hoped that their relationship would collapse; I won't spoil the outcome for you. The other couple in the film -- Alison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd)  was very likable, credible and worthy of my support.There were also incidents in the movie like the trip to a Vegas strip club and dinner at expensive restaurants that I did not see how Ben paid for with his meager bank balance.If you can overlook what I consider these major stumbling blocks of credibility, then the film was fine. I, however, could not ignore them. The other characters in the movie like Alison's sister and brother-in-law, the club bouncer and Ben's buddies were sharply drawn and highly believable. The pacing and music were good compliments to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked up in the edit suite,"Whilst watching this film I became increasingly aware of the bizarre editing. There seemed to be two different versions of the same film made and both edited together to make this one film. One version was a harder more verbally cruel one with anger-humor frat boy slacker (Sandler style) as a weapon and the other almost as a Drew Barrymore style comedy romance. It is as if both were filmed and then spliced together. I can see how neither tone or story angle worked so both were edited together to get this very uneven result. See the film again and then watch the out-takes and deleted scenes... there is material there that is both absurd and repulsive... and also explanatory (where Ben tells his flatmates he cannot live with them anymore, which is not in the final edited movie). Odd things just happen all through KNOCKED UP: There are whole scenes missing, linking scenes that explain why and how they are in the next scene. Ben just goes and rents an apartment; She has his picture on her work desk, as if he is some boyfriend when in the previous scenes she is exasperated with his sloppiness and person; suddenly they go spying on Paul Rudd and walk into a house somewhere... the intros of so many scenes have been chopped off and the viewer is abruptly halfway into another setting or tone or conversation without a smooth or logical segue-way into how or why they are there. Where is the scene where her mother actually meets him? The whole tone swings between vulgarity then really sooky romance then screaming rudeness, then shrewish selfishness, then everyone makes drag-queen style cracks at each other like some screwball comedy throwback (the Asian doctor for example) .. all inconsistent tone, direction editing and dialog. The gratuitous vulgarity and the extreme physical medical crudeness...the screaming subplot about the sister and her husband, the silly little girl rudeness etc... the argument in the car, it is all a jumble of different ideas and directing styles and writing. KNOCKED UP is a jigsaw puzzle edit of these films: ANIMAL HOUSE, MAYBE BABY, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, MONSTER IN LAW, BIG DADDY, American PIE, ROAD TRIP and any other US made crassness where humiliation and abuse is deemed funny. Howvere there is one genuinely inspired and hilarious scene in Las Vegas where Paul Rudd tries to explain why there are 5 different styles of chair in their room. It is as if someone else wrote and directed and edited in that scene too. Maybe KNOCKED UP was made by a committee. It looks and sounds as if it was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"a guide to having a baby, with stoners, and E! news","My first reaction at the end of the film was probably too simplistic a comparison: Harold and Kumar meets Nine Months (yes, the Hugh Grant/Julianne Moore pregnancy comedy from 95). But the film actually carries off how so few romantic comedies know how- to actually give us a man and a woman to actually give a damn about. More than that, Apatow has matched extraordinarily well the shlubby but funny and down-to-earth skills of Seth Rogan with the vibrant, uncertain but ultimately believably conflicted personality in Katherine Heigl. It's a tough sell with it's premise, to be sure, that a very attractive E! news reporter like Allison (Heigl) and a total stoner almost-bum like Ben (Rogan) could hook up over less than 12 hours and suddenly procreate, but there you have it. It's a premise that actually had me avoiding the film, even with the immense hype from critics as well as friends and family, because the footage shown in the trailer didn't seem to be that much to write home about.The actual finished product, however, is certainly the funniest American movie out so far in 2007, pointed at the age variant of around 18 to, um, 37 maybe, with all of the supporting characters, as well as Rogan and co-star Paul Rudd as Heigel's brother-in-law via sister played by Leslie Mann, very sharp with levels of sarcastic wit and pop-culture references. At the same time Apatow gets some really amazing one-liners regarding Ben's friends joking on each other (the bearded guy provides the most fodder, but the general attitude is 'hey, f*** it, lets get stoned""), but doesn't lose track of what he's trying to do, successfully. He's out to criticize as well as embrace a culture where responsibility for one's self has to do with how the other in the relationship is comfortable or dissatisfied with the other. And Apatow makes the Rudd/Mann relationship a kind of bittersweet (much more bitter really) counterpoint to the rocky start to Ben and Allison's 'shot-gun' romance.There's silly one liners (""I live in your phone!""), goofy caricatures (the gynecologists), smart aleck kids who know a lot of ""bad"" words that provides for some wicked laughs, and the usual mayhem in the delivery room an actual winner in terms of making it partly true and partly farce (albeit Judd doesn't seem to understand, despite having three kids, what a woman is like *throughout* the labor process, as reconciliations don't usually happen aside from script contrivances). Yet all the while, it's a sincere film, with the relationships shown not as cardboard cut-outs but where the people actually have to deal, if eventually, with the lots in life they've got themselves into. What is it to balance love and commitment, Apatow is asking. There's even one shot that provides a note of discomfort with the characters of Ben and Allison as they have a bad argument in the car, the view being outside of the car in traffic, a distance kept because, and it's a credit to Apatow as a storyteller, we do care about what will happen in this situation.In fact, that's probably one of the best things to say about Knocked Up. Too often in movies, especially of the cineplex fare, the situation is more-so told than an actual story. This is one of those rare cases where the situation, a tricky one to surpass as it's been done (the 'situation' of pregnancy, not so much the one-nite-stand part), unfolds more as a story, and by the time the 'happy' ending comes, it's not a cop-out or cheat. And this goes without saying that the actors, as well as the filmmaker, are totally assured with their comic skills, be they subtle (the dazed look of the bearded ""Martin Scorsese on cocaine"" friend, even Rudd to a degree can be staggeringly subtle), or big (the ""second"" sex scene between the main couple). Quite simply, it's THE rom-com sleeper of the past few years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Exactly what you'd expect from a Judd Apatow film!,"If you enjoy other Apatow productions such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall etc, then you'll find lots to enjoy with Knocked Up. It has all the same sorts of themes, similar sense of humour, similar style. Lots of the same cast members too.All the familiar faces are here, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jason Segel et al, and they all put in great comedic performances as you'd expect. I'm willing to stick my neck out and say that Seth Rogen is the greatest comedic actor of our times. He has never failed in a performance and just nails it everytime. His role as Ben in Knocked Up is no exception, and his chemistry with Katherine Heigl is spot on. Both of them were brilliant.I thought the plot was really enjoyable. Maybe a little overly long for what it was yet somehow with a slightly rushed ending. A small criticism really though as I had a great time watching it. Knocked Up is also maybe a little less funny than some other Apatow films, but it is still full of good laughs.I went into this film expecting to enjoy it and to have a good laugh and that's exactly what I got. Not a groundbreaking comedy but a very enjoyable one nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
OK comedy drama,"Rogen and Heigl meet in a club and have a one-night stand. Several weeks later, she's preggers. The two, an extremely unlikely pair (he's a fat slacker and she;s a rising business exec) decide to see things through as a couple. It's all pretty much downhill from there. A romantic comedy with dramatic overtones. The only way to accept Heigl sleeping with Rogen is that she is dead drunk at the time, of course. Solid supporting cast keeps this clichéd plot moving along. Otherwise, I guarantee you've seen the story many times before. A sidenote: I have watched the movie more than once and wondered why Heigl's character simply did not get an abortion. In real life, that's how it's done by a woman her age and station in life.

Turns into something worth watching,"Has its moments.'Knocked Up' begins with more cringe than enjoyment, but belatedly turns into something worth watching.

Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Ken Jeong to name just some. Pretty impressive. Heck, even Don's buddy Stormy Daniels is in there.It made me laugh in a few moments, nothing belly laugh worthy but I had fun with bits of it for sure. Rogen and Heigl are extremely solid together, the latter particularly does well. I will say the run time is a little too long, these type of comedy films tend to work best at 90mins in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Bawdy rom-com,"If I'm being cruel, I could say that if you've seen one Judd Apatow movie then you've probably seen most of them. That's because they almost always feature the same group of socially-awkward guys trying to get with a girl while generally making fart jokes and smoking weed. 'Knocked Up' fits that description pretty well. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't worth a watch.After a drunken one night stand between loser web designer Seth Rogen and E! Reporter Katherine Heigl, the latter ends up getting, er, knocked up. Now they have to overcome their differences and see whether they can make it as a couple for each other and for the unborn baby's sake.Seth Rogen basically plays, er, Seth Rogen - lovable, overweight stoner with a dirty sense of humour. Katherine Heigl plays - if you believe what you read online - actually a nicer version of herself (note: this film sort of became infamous due to the fact that Katherine Heigl made claims about how bad it was to work on due to all the 'male humour' on display around the set (and it didn't do her career many favours going forwards!)). But, sticking with the on-screen performances, they seem to have enough chemistry to just about believe that they may get together in some sort of paralell Hollywood universe.There are plenty of other cast members, all of which don't get half as much screen time. Rogen's 'posse' of friends are mainly there as walking punch-lines, while more screen time is afforded to Heigl's on-screen family, namely her sister and her husband. These two went on to get their own 'spin-off' movie, but I can't help but think that may have something to do with the actress' relationship with Apatow.It's a fun time that offers little new, but has enough gags contained within to make it an easy film to sit through. If it has a main drawback, like with many Apatow comedies it is slightly longer than many similar stories. It clocks in at around the two hour mark, meaning there's a lot more to it than you may expect. In some areas it does drag a little, but luckily not enough to really make it annoying.It's basically a romantic comedy which follows the conventions beat for beat that every other film of the same genre does. You could argue that that's a negative, but, if you're in the mood for a 'boy meets girl' story (with plenty of 'adult' humour'), or just a fan of 'Apatow's gang' then this is definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Rude, crude yet funny in places","After getting a promotion at the TV station where she works, Alison (Heigl) celebrates and goes home with jobless Ben (Rogan) and is impregnated by him. Will she keep the baby, will she dump Ben, inquiring minds ask?There are a lot of explicit sexual content, and F-bombs exploding all over the place and yet, the funny lines and actions do not come from any of that. I found them all to be offensive, embarrassing and annoying and the story would not have suffered if all of that were left out. No, the funny stuff comes from everything other than that. There are some good lines, good acting, and timely facial expressions that are the funny stuff. Okay, okay, when she is in the process of delivering the baby and having a hard time of it, there is a lot of anger, rudeness, crudeness and uninhibited language spewing forth from Alison and the scene was laugh-out-loud funny I have to admit.This movie showcases Katherine Heigl's acting ranges as she goes through a myriad of emotions and all are quite believable and you care for her. If you didn't care for her then there is no point in watching the rest of the movie. Both Ben and Alison take the pregnancy seriously, but it is Alison that you care for and hope all turns out well for her. Ms Heigl is so beautiful that you are vaguely aware there are others in the scene as you cannot take your eyes off of her. And, this woman can act. Make no mistake about that. Yes, to some she is eye-candy. But eye-candy with a lot of acting talent. Oh, and she has a nice laugh too.Now, why was this movie made? To let us see Ms Heigl in something other than Grey's Anatomy TV show, of course.

Though Seth Rogen gets most of the laughs, I think the cast all in all did a decent job. And except for some rather slow parts, you are never bored for very long. Since this is an honest review, I have to point out that the story drags on, it is all a bit too clichéd and you sort of see what is coming. However, it has heart, funny actors and good characters and, most importantly, genuinely funny moments. It even delivers heart beating climax.

Vulgar comedy with a heart in the right place.,"Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is in his early 20's, who shares a place with his slacker friends (Jason Segal, Jay Baruchel, Johan Hill & Martin Starr). Which Ben and his friends are planning to website, where celebrates exposed themselves in high-profile Hollywood movies. Then one night... Ben meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an ambitious assistant for E! Entertainment News. Who's been recently hired to be a reporter for E! But things changed, when Ben & Alison gets drunk and ended up having a one night stand. Alison thinks it was a one night only with Ben but two months later, she discover that she's pregnant with Ben's child! Now Alison has no choice to contact Ben with the unexpected news. Ben is shocked as well with the news but he decided to be in Alison's life and their child is going to be born in seven months. In the meanwhile... Ben gets to know Alison's sister (Leslie Mann), her husband (Paul Rudd) and their two kids (Iris Apatow & Maude Apatow). Alison does the same with Ben's friends and they discover each other flaws. While they start an relationship, which they try to make it work before the baby is born.Written and Directed by Judd Apatow (The 40 Year Old Virgin) made an enjoyable, tasteless comedy but with a heart and soul. Rogen gives an excellent comedic lead performance in this film. Which he also one of the two executive producers of this movie. Which it was one of the most popular comedies of this summer. Heigl is quite good as well, which Anna Hathaway was originally cast as Alison until she backed up in the last minute. Originally this film was supposed to be an followed up to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" with following the supporting characters from the picture. Since that didn't work, Apatow manages to make this movie original in its storytelling.The Single Disc DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an funny commentary track by writer/director Apatow, actor/executive producer Rogan and actor Bill Hader. DVD also Deleted Scenes, Extended Scenes, Outtakes and more. The cast is first rate in the film, every character do have comedic moments as well. Mann (Who's married to the director and as well her two real-life kids are in the picture) steals the show as the supportive, over-worried older sister. Apatow's script is original, fresh, funny and even vulgar but it's works surprisingly well for an adult comedy. Rogen is going to be an big comedic star soon, i would love to see him more in lead characters as well. Many celebrities appears in unbilled cameos. Harold Ramis has good funny moments in his cameo as Ben's father. Also available in a Two-Disc Collector's Edition. (****/*****).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A surprisingly meaningful film well-beyond typical expectations,"Going in to this movie, most viewers are expecting the all too typical formula of sex, drug and male incompetence jokes and one-liners that tends to abound in the summer comedy movie season. Make no mistake, all of those elements remain largely intact, but this film still boasts an unexpected maturity as it unfolds. Despite the moral shortcomings of one, if not both, of the main characters, this film finds them both to be surprisingly real characters that gradually rise to the challenge of impending parenthood with a humanity that subtly engages the sympathies of the audience. Although it possesses many memorable comedic moments, and the film certainly can be enjoyed as a comedy alone, its dramatic tones are perhaps the most meaningful. This film often displays the fear, uncertainty and awkwardness of the characters so strongly and accurately, though, that the comedy is more required as a needed emotional break for the audience then as an integral component of the plot or movement. In many respects, this most was reminiscent of the often under-rated 'Parenthood', which similarly balanced strikingly real family drama with thoroughly enjoyable comedic interludes. While several scenes of sexual content and drug use make this film unfortunately inappropriate for younger viewers, its positive message of mismatched expecting parents growing together through their shared commitment to the child about to enter their lives is quaint, honest and meaningful beyond the outward appearances of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Katherine Heigl is gorgeous in the film and does a great job. Seth Rogen is hilarious as a poor, fat, ugly dude who knocks up a sexy drunk girl. Also funny, were Ben's friends. I found most of the jokes to be pretty witty. yeah, it's raunchy, but its fun.Sure, the premise isn't too original and Knocked Up won't win any awards for screenplays, but it was a fun funny movie, and that's good enough for me. It's not nearly as bad as all the reviews I've just read on here. Come on people.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Everybody Loves Seth Rogen,"Unlike the 40 year old virgin Steve Carell wasn't here to carry this movie however Seth Rogen proved he was up to the task. After seeing Seth lay it down as his role as Cal in the 40 year old virgin I knew he was going to be the next comedy icon, Knocked up is his next step closer. The same genre, style and cast as the 40 year old virgin but just a touch more romance. Barely a 'Blockbuster' but definitely a night at home with the mates and a couple of beers to wash down the popcorn. This crew and team of actors are really raising the bar when it comes to American comedy. It was great to see the slapstick comedy of Will Ferrell falling over for the 12th time in a film for a cheap laugh back in 2001 but I say 'Out with the old in with the new' new being Seth Rogen. This film will give you hope in the upcoming comedies from the u.s. P.S. I crossed out Jessica Alba from my top 3 after watching this...Katherine Heigl! You know it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hilariously funny movie that will keep you laughing throughout the whole thing,"(My Synopsis) Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted to an on-camera interviewer job for E! (Entertainment Channel). That night, she goes out with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) to celebrate and party at a trendy nightclub. At the bar, Allison meets Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) who buys her some drinks. Allison and Ben with the addition of a lot of drinks make a connection at the nightclub. They end up spending the night together. The next morning reality hits; Allison is an up-and-coming entertainment journalist, and Ben is an overweight immature unemployed pot-head slacker. They part their separate ways never to meet again; however, circumstances bring them together eight weeks later. Allison must tell Ben that she is pregnant and that he is the father. Ben's first thought is to hit the road and go back home to Canada, but instead he becomes supportive and wants to help Allison. Little do they know what they are getting into!(My Comment) This is a very funny movie, although the humor is crude and rough, and definitely not for children. The movie has an abundance of one-liners that kept the audience and me laughing throughout the whole movie. I haven't laughed out loud so much at a movie in a long time. This is a simple story of what can happen by accident one night that can change your life permanently. The script has a lot of great laughs by exploring the realities of casual sex, marriage, commitment, money, a job, and drugs. The film's conclusion may be a little unrealistic, but it does show that accidents do happen, and people try to do their best to make their new life connection manageable, especially, when a child is involved. Stay and see the closing credits, because they are filled with childhood photos of the cast and crew. I want to repeat that this is not a movie for children, because there is a lot of cursing and some nude scenes. (Universal Pictures, Run time 2:09, Rated R)(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not entirely unpleasant,"Birds do it, bees do it, even educated flees do it, let's do it, let's fall in love. It might have been the tag line for this film. When a party animal and a hard working ambitious girl end up in bed together neither of them consider the possible consequences. This is not entirely strange as they are both drunk. When the consequences do show themselves in the form of the girl being pregnant she pays him a visit and drops the bombshell on him.Films like this one have been made before. Nine Months Later (1995) comes to mind but there are a lot more examples. This film isn't entirely different from any of them apart from one thing: it doesn't really pick a genre. Parts of it are comedy, parts of it are tragedy, parts of it are the basic high school/underpants junk, parts are feel good film. It does keep itself together pretty well though. The two of them combining is hard to believe but not so hard that it is impossible and even though it is as predictable as the cycle of night and day it isn't entirely unpleasant to watch.Personally I would have liked to have seen a little less broad pick of genres. By selecting one or two less they could have made the film somewhat more stable, less chaotic, but it didn't work out completely bad.7 out of 10 accidents waiting to happen",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
GREAT Movie!!,"I loved the movie, it was way better than I ever expected it to be. I laughed so much. I felt what they were feeling. It was so enjoyable. I think Izzy is super on Grey's and she is also excellent in this movie. The rest of the cast is also great. The brother in law (I loved him on Sisters), the Dad (I loved him in Stripes with Bill Murray). The cameos were great (Ryan, Jessica, Steve, etc.) Some of the lines are so hysterical, i.e., BJ. Two of the labor scenes made me never want to have children. I loved the cast & crew photo album at the end of the movie, coordinating names would have been super. I'll see the movie again!

Hilarious Movie!,"Knocked Up is a story of a lazy and an unemployed man Ben Stone (Rogen) and a career minded TV presenter Alison Scott (Heigl). Ben is a kind of guy who lives with his folks (played by Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel & Martin Starr). All the friends have something in common - they're all unemployed & lazy and spend most of their time fooling around, partying or watching movies or working on a website project which doesn't show much promise. Alison Scott works with E! Entertainment Television. She gets promoted to work as an on the camera presenter. To celebrate her promotion, she goes partying in a club with her elder sister (Leslie Mann) and there she meets Ben who is partying out with his friends. Ben & Alison gel together in the party and under the influence of alcohol end up sleeping together. Next morning at the breakfast table, Alison finds out that she doesn't have anything in common with Ben. The two go their respective ways only to come together again after 8 weeks when Alison finds out that she is pregnant with Ben's child. What happens next? Do the two get together or end it all with a break up? Watch it to find out!The story is quite a simple one. However, what happens around the story is what makes this film a great watch. The film is laced with crude sex related humor throughout. This is what is expected when you have Seth Rogen in the movie. It also features the likes of Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel & Jonah Hill all of whom are known for crude comedy films and present their side roles in the movie as the buddies of Rogen. These characters party their heart out, tease each other, work on a p*rn website, and are lazy as shoot. All the roles have been out played flawlessly. These guys are natural at the buddy stuff and their chemistry with each other is flawless. Katherine Heigl does a fantastic job in the film. She portrays the character with finesse.The film portrays the nuisances of one night stands and the resultant issues that crop up. If you go by the story itself, it feels a little stretched. However, the fantastic performances delivered by the characters and the comic events that surround the central idea of the film makes it a hilarious watch. The plot focuses on responsibility and commitment and also the way the lives of people change by the events that take place after an unwed couple gets pregnant which they hadn't planned.Watch it for the excellent performances especially by Heigl & Rogen in the lead roles and also by the supporting characters who does a great job together to pull off a laugh riot film.Review Link: http://confusonomics.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/movie-review- knocked-up/",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Felt quite lengthy and unnecessary at times but overall its a decent movie.,"Knocked-up, The movie I was so excited about when I first met the previews. It contains all the big glorifying names which I'm particularly a huge fan of, namely as; Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jason, Jonah, Leslie, Bill Hader and Katherine. They all are the comedy heroes and deliver it with utter perfection every time but unfortunately this is not happening here besides of Seth..Although the movie started with an interesting plot and background, thus enabling viewers getting involved and laugh often but that managed to sustain only till the mid half of the movie. From there on, things started to get boring , full of clichés and predictable story. I literally lost interest in the second half; 65 minutes onwards to be specific. There were too many unwanted and irrelevant scenes dragging the entire fun to evaporate rapidly. Personally I feel that the movie could have been a 30mins shorter, I really had to suffer passing my time in the latter hour.Coming on the caste now, as just said in the beginning, perhaps I was expecting a bit more from them, given the excitement that my favorites are gathered under a single title. But only to my disappointment, they weren't supportive enough. Neither Jason nor Jonah was impressive. SSeemed like entire responsibility was upto Seth, who in turn did a great job maintaining the standard.To conclude, though my review might imprint a negative perception over the readers but it ain't that bad, trust me! ;D but yea, just be careful about the second half. Take it a friendly warning. ;p",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Sickening, Grotesque, Awful, and Disgusting Waste of Time and Money!!!","Do not spend your $8 or $10 on this movie. Save it for gas money. Do not rent it. Do not add it to your Netflix or Blockbuster queues. Do not buy it at a yard sale for 50 cents. Do not even acknowledge that it exists. Be ashamed that you are even looking it up on here because this movie is hideous. It is one of the worst movies I have seen in many, many years.After hearing how ""outrageously funny"" this movie was both from acquaintances and on the Ellen Degeneres show, I was at least curious to see it -- to find out about all the hype for myself. I (stupidly) invited some co-workers to see this movie and sat in horror for seemingly never-ending minutes watching an essential soft-core porn flick slap me in my face with vulgarity, obscenity, and sexual insult.I was absolutely mortified to watch this movie with my friends on either side. I was made so uncomfortable by the never-ending use of the F*** word, the totally tasteless, not at all held back sex scenes, and the nauseating dialogue used to insult people or to refer to body parts. I am no idiot. I know these words exist -- I know people use them -- I know it is Hollywood -- I know some people just don't care or don't let it bother them -- I know some would say I should lighten up and just stay at home reading my Bible or something -- but this was ridiculous. I can tolerate cursing. I can tolerate sex scenes. I do plenty of both of those things myself in my life. But this movie was constant, extreme cases of both to the point that I was breaking out in cold sweats and wanting to leave the theater. I have never been this uncomfortable in a film... never.And the ""outrageous funny"" parts... well, let's just say I am still wondering where they were. Two... that's right... only two one-minute scenes tops made me chuckle. I was almost embarrassed to even find them funny considering how horrendous the rest of the movie was.If you are a parent, do not (do not) (do not) (do not) let your teenage child watch this movie if you can help it. It is nothing I even wanted to see myself -- I would never want it to influence a minor. It's awful. It's awful. And, while I'm at it, it's awful.Please do me a favor and go see ""The Waitress"" with Felicity or I mean Kerri Russell for a much better movie experience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great comedy through a painful reality,"For years Hollywood has been looking for the ""high concept"" story. That's a story with a big (and highly marketable) plot twist. Now, because of Judd Apatow, that's starting to change, at least in comedy. Apatow is the father of the ""low concept"" story, and every studio in town is looking for one.Low concept is a story based on an experience that anyone in the audience could have. Like an accidental pregnancy. The potential audience for a low concept story is huge, because everyone can identify with it. It also has a built-in emotional resonance, and comedy is funnier and more successful when the audience makes an emotional recognition in their own lives.Sitcoms have known this for years. That's what the form is based on. Until Apatow, nobody thought you could pull the audience out of the house by using that approach in movies. And the conventional wisdom has some merit in this case. Because even though low concept gives you a potentially massive audience that can identify with the story, it puts tremendous pressure on the writer to come up with a new take on an everyday experience the audience knows so well.Not surprisingly for a low concept story, there isn't much plot in Knocked Up. Love stories are already plot challenged, so when you add low concept to it, you have a story with a big hole in the middle. By the time the boys visit Las Vegas, I felt like we were in another movie.So how does Apatow overcome the lack of plot and fulfill the requirement that a low concept story put a fresh face on a familiar experience? It's all in the character set up. In the Comedy Class and the Love Story Class, I talk about how these two genres depend heavily on how you set up the character oppositions. In many romantic comedies, the male and female leads are set up as opposites in some way. Then each has a friend who gives them advice, usually wrong, having to do with the stereotypical flaws of the other sex.Knocked Up starts with the classic opposition of man and woman. In fact, these two are such an odd couple that Apatow has to finesse the fact that Alison, played by Katherine Heigl, would never sleep with Neanderthal Ben, played by Seth Rogen, even if she were blindingly drunk. But this opposition-the mature woman and the man-child-provides the basic line on which the story hangs. It also gives Apatow the essential comic opposition from which he can create a lot of the jokes. True, these jokes play off the commonly perceived differences between men and women. But Apatow is so good at comic dialogue, and his story is so grounded in the emotion of the conflict, that these lines stand out from the usual and are very funny.But the really brilliant move in the character opposition-indeed what makes the movie-is how Apatow sets up the allies. Ben's ally is not a lone bachelor but a group of adolescent boys in men's bodies. Alison's ally is not a single woman bitter about love and men, but a couple whose marriage is worn to the breaking point.This character opposition takes the story beyond men and women having trouble dating to the much broader and deeper set of issues about how men and women live the length of their lives. On one extreme is the permanently adolescent man who has complete freedom but no love and no children. On the other extreme is permanent life as a couple, with love and children but no freedom, no sense of self, and the constant realization that one is growing old. By placing pregnancy within this much larger opposition, the emotional and comical resonances ricochet and build to a breaking point within every person in the audience.The lack of story means the strengths of the character oppositions play out primarily within the individual scenes. But these scenes are often very strong and well worth study. In one remarkable scene, the sister, played by Leslie Mann, and an obviously pregnant Alison try to get into an exclusive club. When the gatekeeper refuses them entry, the sister lays into him, attacking him at his weakest point, which is his pathetic job. It's so real it's painful. He calmly takes her aside and calls her on her true weakness, the reality that has driven her to embarrass herself while trying to embarrass him. She's a stunning beauty but she's getting older, and she and her pregnant sister aren't going through that door.Great comedy isn't about being funny all the time. Do that and you won't be funny at all. Great comedy is about creating a painful emotional reality, a charged atmosphere where the jokes become lightning bolts, showing you the truth, making you laugh and cutting your heart out all at the same time.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An intelligent rom com,"Ben is an unemployed guy living off a windfall he received some years earlier. He hangs around with other guys that have a similar outlook in life and enjoy watching porn, drinking beer and smoking pot. Alison is employed by a cable TV company and is just about to make her big break in front of the camera. The chances of these two guys hitting it off are equivalent to the chances of me hitting it off with Liv Tyler. Once the beer goggles are on though anything is possible and a one night stand turns out to have far greater consequences than it should do. The normal flow of a relationship is turned on it's head as the couple have a baby on the way before they know anything about one another. The film follows the development of this unusual relationship.Before seeing the film I expected it to be a bit in the mould of a Farrelly brothers production, but I've got to say the humour is considerably more subtle. Rogan and Heigl are excellent in the lead roles and I think the film is in the same league as ""When Harry Met Sally"". It is certainly nice to see a Rom Com with something new to say. It probably wouldn't lose a lot on the small screen, so if you miss it on the cinema check it out at home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Really funny & surprisingly sweet,"I really really like this film. Every time it's on tv I just have to watch it and I enjoy it every time too. Seth Roger is predictably very funny and at times shows a really sweet side which was nicely done. Katherine Heigl I don't know what she's done apart from this film but I do like her in this and she does pregnant very well. She also plays the straight man to the other characters without losing the fun in her character. A favourite part of this film for me was the bromance between Paul Rudd and Seth. They seemed to bounce off of each other really naturally and you believe the friendship. Leslie Mann played the neurotic, highly strung wife fab! The scene where she takes on the bouncer at the club is brilliant and I've since found out that she ad-libbed a lot of this including the epic shouting of DOORMAN! The film is just really funny, flows really nicely and you will enjoy it whether you've had kids or not. Enjoy it guys!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Apatow Team does it again,"The 40 Year Old Virgin was one of my favorite comedies of all time, so naturally I had high hopes for Seth Rogen's debut as a leading actor. I walked out of the theater highly satisfied the first time I saw Knocked Up and went a second time in theaters, only to find that I enjoyed it even more. Much like The 40 Year Old Virgin, I found the movie very funny the first time I saw it, but it has only gotten funnier each time I have seen it. The first time I saw The 40 Year Old Virgin, I thought it hilarious, but not the funniest movie I'd ever seen. About 20 viewings later, I now think it might be. A similar thing happened to Knocked Up. When it made its run on HBO, I started watching pieces of it every time it came on and have probably seen the majority of it about eight or nine times by now. It now holds a special place in my heart next to The 40 Year Old Virgin as a rare comedy that manages to combine outrageously hilarious situations with real life characters.Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a stoner slacker whose idea of a good time is smoking out of his bong and playing ping pong with his roommates. He is unemployed; his only money source is from a lawsuit over a guy who ran over his foot years ago, and his only ""job"" is preparing a website which tells you when your favorite actresses appear nude in movies. He is happy just drifting about in life until a one night stand with a beautiful stranger named Alison (Katherine Heigl) throws a wrench into his life. Alison is a rising employee for E!, but her life is thrown off track when her drunken night with Ben results in a pregnancy. The ensuing romance between the two consists of the bulk of the movie. The romance between the two is both believable and hilarious; the movie never gets mushy, as many romantic comedies do, and manages to find the same balance as in The 40 Year Old Virgin between vulgarity and hilarity.I would rank Knocked Up just slightly below The 40 Year Old Virgin on the Apatow scale of greatness. Both movies have the rare quality of standing up after multiple viewings; in fact, both films only seem to get funnier the more times you watch them. This is due to a great script and great comedic timing by the actors, which enables you to quote the movie endlessly to your friends long after its over. Rarely has a day gone by in the last few years in which I have not quoted either Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, or Superbad. Unlike most R rated comedies of recent years, Knocked Up isn't only appealing to teenage boys. This movie is funny to everybody, regardless of age or gender. While the humor is somewhat vulgar at times, it is there for a purpose besides simply being a series of sight gags. You really grow to care about the characters of Ben and Alison and their developing relationship. You'll also laugh along with them a whole lot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The funniest comedy troupe working in film deliver another winner,"Judd Apatow and friends consistently prove that they are the funniest comedy troupe working today. Forget Ben Stiller, forget Adam Sandler. Please forget Dane Cook, and a seemingly endless troupe of un-funny comedians trying to make their way on the big screen. There have only ever been so few personalities that are just naturally and automatically funny. Charlie Chaplin. Buster Keaton. The Marx Brothers. Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. Woody Allen. Seth Rogen. Paul Rudd.What was so impressive about The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not only the entire cast's unique ability to be naturally funny no matter what they do, but also it's heart and sincerity. While taking a sort of high-concept, gimmicky idea in order to set up the situation comedy, 40-Year-Old Virgin does succeed admirably in featuring honest, convincing and just totally real characters that you always believe in. With Knocked Up, Apatow and crew go even one step further by creating a movie so unbelievably rooted in reality, it may has well just have been a documentary about a bunch of naturally funny people and how they deal with a simple, small-scale domestic occurrence: A one night stand-turned-pregnancy.The film is surprisingly poignant and intelligent, featuring a fantastically real-world story of learning to grow up and accept responsibility. ""Life doesn't care about your own life plans,"" the movie says, and within this lies the crux of just why Knocked Up is as sweet and poignant as it is. Rogen's Ben, while essentially being a personification of Rogen himself, does learn valuable life lessons and it is simply fantastic to see with what skill Apatow integrates this fictional character arc onto a non-fictional character (in a way).That said, it is also, of course, total comic brilliance. Seth Rogen has really made a name for himself for one of the most naturally funniest performers working today - nothing he does ever feels forced, and judging by his character Ben's characteristics and history, one can easily see that Rogen is pretty much just playing himself in the movie. And he's got great taste too - t-shirts and movie discussions aside, the man has an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind poster hanging in the baby room. Brilliant! Paul Rudd also proves once again that he is comic genius.In all, Knocked Up, along with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, just prove that there are some people in the word that are almost unfairly naturally funny. You see a ""comedy"" like Dude Where's My Car?, and you can just crystal-clearly see the massive difference between the forced, un-funny, cheap-shot comedy in the latter film as opposed to the real, intelligent and natural comedy of Apatow's ventures. I hope to see much more from these performers and filmmakers in the future. Because while Apatow's productions are funny enough (Anchorman, Talladega Nights, etc), it is his in his directorial ventures where he truly showcases an unprecedented knack of naturalistic, intelligent comedy. And it works fantastically well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up's score should be knocked down,"The sole reason I decided to see this movie was because of it's high score on IMDb, and to say I was disappointed after it's conclusion would be an understatement. I caught myself laughing only a few times in the movie, and the overall message the film sends to it's viewers is irresponsible to say the least.There is no plot development or cleverness in the story and the constant bantering between Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl is the equivalent to third grade dialogue. The movie offers no general direction to Katherine's journey through pregnancy and continuity of the movie spirals into random scene after random scene. The only saving grace to the movie was that of Seth Green and Paul Rudd's ability to play off each other in what seemed to me to be natural chemistry, but still wasn't as good as how the tandem performed in 40 Year Old Virgin.Finally, the believability of Katherine Haigl's character choosing to have the baby with such a loser as Seth Rogan's character is laughable to say the least. The option of abortion is downplayed in the movie, and the whole wild ride that these two strangers venture together is as improbable and disjointed as it gets. This is honestly the most over-rated movie I've ever seen.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A sexy, vulgar, R-rated . . . family values film.","Java Man Reviews ""Knocked Up"" (2007, R). Written and directed by Judd Apatow. Starring Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Tim Bagley, Kristen Wiig & Loudon Wainwright III. Running Time: 129 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Ben Stone (Rogan) is a 20-something slacker who, like his similarly unmotivated roommates, lives the life of a college kid without actually attending classes. Their big goal in life is to develop a website that will inform its users as to the exact location of nudity in any given movie. Alison Scott (Heigl) is an unsuccessful but ambitious 20-something broadcast staffer who lives with her bitchy older sister Debbie (Mann) and Debbie's weirdly wayward husband Pete (Rudd). When Alison gets her big break by being offered an on-camera gig with the E! Network, she decides to go out on the town to celebrate. After having too much to drink she meets Ben, accompanies him to his apartment, and unsafe sex ensues.In the morning, seeing Ben in the full light of his dorkiness, she bids him farewell and is about to begin her new life as a minor media personality . . . until several weeks later when she discovers that Ben has left her with more than just memories. Do I have to spell it out? The movie's inelegant title says it all. The balance of the movie follows the mismatched couple's attempts to work out their newly altered lives.REVIEW: 3 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGSThough I don't like this movie as much as most other reviewers seem to, I must admit that it has grown on me. When I first walked out of the theater, it bothered me that the film seems to say that it is okay for guys in their 20s to do nothing but drink beer and take hits on a bong, and that it's also okay for a 20-something couple to meet at a bar and have a one-night stand. But, thanks to a mix-up in a conversation about condoms, there are consequences; and when I look at this film in retrospect, it seems to be a sexy, vulgar, R-rated . . . family values film. Yet it doesn't come off as an anti-abortion polemic: she knows she has a choice and she chooses to have the baby.But I'm getting way too serious here. The real reason to see this movie is because it's well-written and funny. Many of the scenes have a Borat-like quality of becoming even more humorous when you think about them later. Two examples are the conversation Ben has with his dad, and Ben's refusal to have sex with a frustrated Alison for fear of crushing the baby.While Rogen may be an acquired taste, Heigl and the rest of the cast are right on the mark with Apatow's insightful material. Especially good are Mann as the judgmental sister and Wiig as Alison's subtly jealous rival.As the story progresses into more conventional here-comes-the-baby territory, the editor might have considered performing some surgical snips well in advance of the cutting of the umbilical chord.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Some gold,"This week we started another ""Quickflix"" trial, and Tara loaded up our want list. The first DVD to arrive was ""Knocked Up"". Here's my IMDb.com review.""Knocked Up"" starts Seth Rogen (in his best work since a guest appearance in ""Dawson's Creek"") and Katherine Heigl (in her finest role since she played Sarah in ""Under Siege 2) as Ben and Alsion, two people who hook up in a night club and have a one night stand. Ben is a loser stoner, Sarah an up and coming entertainment reporter. The next morning Sarah realises what a loser Ben is and quickly tries to end it quickly....until she discovers she's pregnant. Sarah then decides to track Ben down and get him to be a part of this unexpected surprise. She soon learns although he's a complete loser who spends his time hitting the pipe and watching movies with ladies with no clothes on, he's sweet too. Sarah has to work out though if she wants to shack up with him and become a family or to have the child and try to continue on her career path and hopefully meet someone fancier.It's pretty rude and crude, with lots of sweet ""ohhhhhh"" moments to balance it out.... sorta. Some potential jokes were left hanging, while others where done to death. Ben's housemates provided plenty of laughs and really stole most of the great scenes. Jason Segel as Jason was probably my favourite character in the movie. Pretty funny overall, but plenty of awkward, uncomfortable moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great on multiple viewings,"I had real high hopes for Knocked up and I was little disappointed in the result. The movie is pretty good but its not all that. I thought it could have been much more funnier and entertaining. It was very boring at certain points. It was more focused on real life and drama then a straight up comedy. The title of the film suggests the type of over-the-top brainless, sexist film which conforms to all the clichéd elements that came before it. But it's not. The film has a real subtle warmth about it. The leading performers all have a under-stated likability about them. I liked the improvised dialogue that Ben and his stoner friends used during their scenes, it gave each of their characters their own individuality, each being able to hold his/her own screen presence. I suppose there is a point to be made there but sometimes you should appreciate something for what it is. To finish, this is not a laugh out loud comedy, however, if you've got a couple of hours to kill and you feel like watching something that makes you smile and forget that you live in rainy England for a while this picture is for you. There were many funny scenes and also boring scenes==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/05/17' Knocked Up is quite a much better film on another viewing. This film has lived up and has aged well. The jokes are more well thought and clever, and the performance by Seth Rogen was arguably his star turning moment. Although the leading women were unlikable, the rest of the cast make up for it. great comedy that has all the effects of a proper Apatow production.

"A knock out of a movie (Spoiler Free, you deserve it!)","I know this title may seem a bit over the top. It is not an action movie neither is it a thriller. However it has its significance for me, because this movie has made me stay up from 5am till now which is 8.10am.Now for me to delve into the details. Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a seemingly successful news reporter who has everything - Attention, beauty and brains. A perfect life it seems, but all of it came crashing down after having a one night stand with goof ball Ben Stone played by real life funny man Seth Rogen. Knocked Up will take you through the ups and the downs of Alison's pregnancy and how two vastly different people who are 'thrust' together by circumstance can actually turn out to be the one for one another.A common misconception people have for the movie is that its just crude comedy. Which is probably why many people may be disappointed or taken aback by what this movie brings forth instead. However, I for one am pleasantly surprised. The movie actually encompasses realism in its storyline along with its crude but funny humor. It shocked me with the strength of the plot. It makes you care about the character and it pulls you to FEEL like the character. You can understand the trouble faced by them and understand how different guys and girls really are. Regardless of your gender, you will understand the situation of the male or female counterpart portrayed by the two leads.When the credits started rolling, I was astounded to find out that it was slightly more then 2 hours long! Thanks to the strong cast, brilliant script, excellent character development and an extraordinarily realistic story, this movie unquestionably deserves the title of being an underdog winner Do not underestimate this movie as it may just knock you out. Like it did for me. Without a doubt one of best film this year.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not Fair -- a Rip Off,"Is this the latest strategy for movie makers to squeeze money out of their vulnerable viewers: write a screenplay that is so funny that as you're laughing, you miss the next joke, forcing you to see the movie twice? Do the makers of this movie realize that movie admission is now beyond $9? That means, in order to catch all the jokes, I have to see Knocked Up a second time. And what happens if I again laugh at the A jokes, missing the B jokes? I could end up spending not $18, but $27 to enjoy just one film. Maybe I should bring a damp towel to the theater and press it tightly against my mouth so I don't make that horsey sound that I call a laugh. Will theater owners allow me to bring in ""outside"" towels? What a conundrum this movie has left me...in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
laugh out loud,"This movie was surprisingly good. I didn't really like the 40 year old virgin, but I thought this movie was really good. I was laughing out loud. It was a shock how well Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl hit it off. They had really good chemistry; they seemed really natural together. I liked Seth's crew of misfits I thought they were really funny. Paul Rudd was amazing as per usual. Some of it was a little bit unbelievable, I thought the pregnant belly and the hospital were really unrealistic. The Las Vegas trip was priceless the part with the chairs had me rolling in the isle. I would highly recommend seeing this one. It's not sophisticated humor, but it's really entertaining. I'm probably going to add this one to my collection when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A smart cocktail of fun and ethics,"Judd Apatow, producer turned director, who wrote and directed Knocked Up scores a double coup in crafting one of the funniest films ever wrapped around a cocktail of chubby guy meets goddess, laced with everyday ethics. Against all the odds ever dreamt up by Ben's (Seth Rogen) band of failing, but tripped out internet wannabees he ends up in the sack with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), the hot media chick celebrating her promotion to a front of camera role.The script stays sharply smart throughout the film backed up with superb contributions from Alison's acid tongued, over the clubbing-hill sister, a mother of two cutie pie kids, Debbie (Leslie Mann) is still trying to blag her way into LA night spots whilst fretting that her cool, music promoter husband Pete (Paul Rudd) is having an affair.

"Rare breed of comedy that's crude,smart AND touching","Upon watching this movie recently,I was(among many thoughts)reminded of another ""Pregnancy changes everything"" comedy: Nine Months from 1995. That film,directed by Chris Columbus and starring Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore,also featured an unplanned pregnancy that was forcing an otherwise relaxed,responsibility-free(relatively)bachelor to commit to the child he's helped create AND the relationship he was in. The differences,however,are loud and clear: where ""Months"" was played for slap-sticky,almost cruel laughs and shameless manipulation(and hence the reason I've practically sworn off ANYTHING Mr.Columbus writes or directs),""Knocked"" is actually done with a sense of wit,savvy,solid character study and very deliberate,studied injections of sentiment.Schlubby,beefy slacker Ben Stone(Seth Rogen,who looks about five to ten years OLDER than his actual age)lives with his buddies with the intent that breaks down to two(make it three)elements:movies(and the knowledge of all things related),music and getting stoned. The collective ambition of he and his buddies(JOnah Hill,Jason Segel,Martin Starr and Jay Baruchel)is to start a website that is able to document any and all actresses who are naked in movies down to the minutes and frames.Meanwhile,pretty,well-adjusted and responsible Allison Scott(Katherine Heigl,a hybrid of the girl-next-door and a human Barbie doll)is seeing her career rise as she's promoted from behind-the-camera staff for E! Television to on-air personality. She and some girlfriends go to celebrate the promotion at a local nightclub.At said nightclub,the two opposites meet,charm and attract. Of course,it doesn't take anyone of great genius or intuitive skill to figure,from the title of the film,that their dalliance--a sweaty,sloppy fête accompli at her(?) place--will yield something more than merely sex tales of conquest for him and a possible ""I did that?"" recollection from her.As both Ben and Allison agree to work through the pregnancy together(A decision that takes remarkably little angst from both parties),their winding,twisting road toward love is,of course,not lacking bumps and potholes,many of them inadvertently supplied by each others' supports: his buddies and her sister and best friend Debbie(Leslie Mann,getting a seemingly rare chance to expand on a role) and her husband Pete(Paul Rudd,more comfortable than ever as a down-to-earth ""Guy's guy"" in film). Of course,the obstacles that Ben and Allison themselves have to overcome prove to be the most important to the story.Director/writer Judd Apatow doesn't miss a beat from 2005's 40 Year Old Virgin, making what could be arch-type characters and comedic situations actually have sympathy to cut the sharp edges of pathos and profanity. He is also able to make even some of the more secondary or tertiary characters(i.e. the slough of OBGYNs that work on Allison,Pete and Debbie's daughters, Allison's co-workers,her mom,Ben's dad,the girlfriend of one of Ben's friends)funny and interesting,which seems to be asking a lot of a lot of directors and/or screenwriters. Last but not least,the warm,scuzzy charm of Rogen and the soft,oh-so-human Heigl give very fitting and grounded performances. It may not be quite as daft a movie as ""Virgin',but it's made with such intelligence that it EASILY runs circles around just about any movie(genre alike or no)this summer. Pregnancy movies can be played for easy laughs or hard. The more difficult laughs are more rewards,thus so is this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Repugnant in Every Sense of the Word,Absolutely disgusting. It has to be one of the lousiest movies I ever saw. Maybe the teens dig it as well as the early '20s crowd and why not? Doesn't their lexicon demand the noun F--- or the adjective F-----G in every sentence?The gist of this mess is that a guy who needs a shave throughout the entire torture--a guy who doesn't work but instead hangs out with a group of potheads working on developing a raunchy website--a guy named Ben Stone played by Seth Rogen is lucky enough to have a one night stand with a most attractive TV personality called Alison Scott played by Katherine Heigl and an ACCIDENTAL pregnancy develops. Now what in the world Alison sees in Ben is beyond comprehension but too much liquor does odd things.The rest of this abomination for a film centers around the pregnancy and the interaction of Ben's bum friends as well as Alison's classy gal pals. And the payoff is a few perfect shots of Alison's bare genitalia in less than comfortable circumstances.The premise of the film is raunchy. The language is filthy. The whole drug scene is abominable. I estimate the picture is 30 minutes too long. Newspaper columnists are giving this excuse for a movie four stars? It's impossible to believe yet I must because there wasn't an empty seat in the entire theater.

"Hilarious, sweet and one of the best movies of the year","Look, don't believe anyone who says this movie sucks. There's a reason it's doing so well and the critics love it. Knocked Up is funny, sweet and the best movie of the year, in my opinion. The 40 Year Old Virgin was much more crude, although I loved that movie as well. Knocked Up isn't tame by any means, it well deserves that R rating, but it's more sweet and emotional than any R rated comedy I've ever seen. The characters are likable, and the performances are stellar. Judd's dialogue is fantastic and the jokes are hilarious. This movie will be known as one of the best comedies of the decade. I loved it.

Not just another pretty face.,"If you're here reading this you already know what this movie is about, and if you haven't already seen it you may be wondering ""What is the deal? It can't be THAT good."" Well, ""Knocked Up"" is about as good as a movie can get. It's a rare movie experience, because on one level it's clever and funny, but what really carries this movie are the beautifully written characters. Each is believable, likable and enjoyable to watch as they grow, form relationships and struggle with their imperfections.The premise is pretty obvious, and the aptly fitting title will flag immediately, this isn't your parent's comedy. That said, it will appeal to a very broad audience of open minded movie goers. While it is in part a stoner movie and a buddy movie, at the core of it is a heartfelt story that will touch everyone's hearts.Apatow is a consistent man: he writes about what he knows, he reuses his favorite actors, and he carefully crafts brilliant comedies. There are so many scenes I'd love to mention to sell you on this movie if you're on the fence about seeing it. So many times I'm watching, laughing, saying to myself ""God, I know what that feels like"". Then there are other times where beside me my girlfriend is laughing, thinking ""I've been there before"". Without giving anything away, all I can really hope is that you will take my word for it and thank me later when you love this movie as much as I did.""Knocked Up"" is an excellent movie if you're looking for a laugh, but it gives you so much more. With characters you can relate to, dialogue you can believe, you walk away from this movie smiling, realizing that it also teaches you that it's OK to be yourself.Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"sweet, smart, hopeful, AND funny.  just a great movie","I expected ""Knocked up"" to be another empty, mindless, overacted comedy, trying too hard and failing in the first 5 minutes. Sorry, but I've seen so many of those, that I feel compelled to give all the credit in the world to this movie, because it is nothing, nothing like that.It is actually the most decent, sweetest and smartest movie I've seen in a long time. The story, so simple, and yet so complex, is well put together, the characters are all believable and lovable even if they're far from Hollywood perfect (thank God!)The script sounds real, and the characters actually have something relevant to say every time they open their mouths. Which brings me to the much debated ""vulgarity"" of the movie, which, in my opinion, had a point. And its point was to give shape to a bunch of characters who were, well, far from English aristocrats. Hence the language.But the best part of the movie for me was how all the characters evolved, how they all changed, each in their own distinctive way, how they responded to the challenges they met. I found this just, well, uplifting.And I loved Seth Rogen. Might sound weird to some, but to me he was like a breath of fresh air. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I Loved This Film,"With grounded direction and writing from Apatow, and with a stellar cast throughout, Knocked Up isn't only charming and funny, but quite realistic, and incredibly well done. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl lead the film, and both give surprisingly impressive performances. Some may criticize the film for acting like themselves, but they truly give the characters their all by truly capturing the real actions people in situations like this are and will go through. Its timely, incredibly well written, and surprisingly well directed. I have seen a few other Apatow flicks, but none so far have proven to be as good and as memorable as this one. Besides the leads, the cast is also great with Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, and Josh Gad just providing a few of the hilarious and touching performances that grace this film. The film is a little over 2 hours long, but it never feels slow. There are hard moments to watch in the film, but they don't feel torturous, they just feel uncomfortable, as anyone would feel experiencing them. I appreciate this films simplicity, and with that its realness towards human nature and the situations that revolve from them. It's a timeless film, truly, and one of the most underappreciated comedies and flicks I have watched in a long time.
My Rating: 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"The cast behind recent ""frat pack"" adult comedies deliver yet again with another vulgar yet charming comedy","Anti-PG-13 folks rejoice; there is yet another enjoyable R-rated romantic comedy that is both vulgar and sweet at the same time, while embracing the restricted rating rather than try too hard to receive it. From the writer and director of the awesome sleeper hit The 40-Year Old Virgin comes another film about relationships and the fickle business surrounding it. While this isn't as charming or as funny as the 2005 hit that helped revive the genre of adult comedies, it still contains a heavy dosage of laughs, plenty of insightful commentary about society, and its little bit of bittersweet moments that lightens the mood of the film.Knocked Up is about two very different people that meet at a bar and engage in a one-night stand. Their moment together was supposed to be the first and only time they would see each other, but upon pregnancy tests it is revealed that Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) and Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) are going to become parents. They now have several months to get to know each other, attempt to be in a relationship for the baby; despite the circumstances and less-than-helpful insight from another couple related to Allison (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd). Can a carefree jobless druggie and a hard-working yet unsure interviewer bond together for the child they have decided to introduce to the world? The plot, while very believable, doesn't always tread down a path of predictability.The bittersweet symphony that is Knocked Up can be traced to the excellent acting staff that can portray emotions as well as deliver improvised one-liners. The main couple in this movie, Rogan and Heigl were perfectly cast and despite their obvious differences were able to have plenty of chemistry together. However, Seth Rogan and all his roommates (Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, and Martin Starr) provide almost all the jokes and laughs throughout this movie. The gags and one-liners from the roomies range from chuckles to uncontrollable laughter. Last but not least portraying the troubled couple, Mann and Rudd did a superb job on their own being everything the character Allison did not want in her life.While the casting is what excels best here, the writing and directing of rising powerhouse Judd Apatow (Virgin, Fun With Dick and Jane, Anchorman, Talladega Nights, even Heavyweights) is a big help as well. Being able to combine crude jokes, sex jokes, with commentary and light drama isn't easy, but like his previous work, Apatow succeeds. While his directing isn't groundbreaking, he knows how to maintain the pace and knows how to handle shots when the actors are in their improvising moods. He doesn't dazzle with any amazing-looking shots and angles, but maintains the humor throughout the picture, which not everyone in Hollywood can do nowadays.Where this film loses points is in the editing. Surely there are great moments throughout, but there are many moments that were not necessary, that could have been cut without damaging the quality of the movie. The jokes stop flying once the third act begins, which is around the same time then the movie begins to drag. Fortunately though, it doesn't last too long as we see the funny cast together again for the climax, and then the charming ending that doesn't overstay its welcome.Bottom Line: Fans of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and other works from this new unnamed frat pack that consists of Rogan, Rudd, Mann, Apatow will be pleased with Knocked Up. It is a superbly written comedy with great dialogue, many funny gags, a good chunk of improvisation, and a bit of heart. The acting, writing and directing is great, but unfortunately is marred by rather weak editing. Don't let that bring you down, because the cast makes up for the shortcomings in the cutting process and the running time allowed (over 2 hours for a romantic comedy is rather long). Apatow is beginning to leave a mark on Hollywood, and his cast of actors and actresses are breathing fresh life into a genre that faded into obscurity in the 1990s. These movies are becoming this generation's Caddyshack, National Lampoon's Vacation, Stripes, and Animal House. For anyone giving up hope on Hollywood, this is the silver lining that you should see so you can see the light to the end of the mediocrity tunnel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Apatow's Comeback,"Don't worry this review is spoiler free. Where do I begin? I really enjoyed ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" and after watching this, I can safely say that it's just as good if not better than his previous film. This is one of those quirky comedies that balances out the romance and drama elements within its two hours. The plot is easy to figure out. Seth Rogen plays Ben, a goofy slacker who is the life of the party. He meets a happy-go-lucky woman named Allison (played by Katherine Heigl). They have a one night stand and weeks later, she finds out that she's pregnant.There is so much to love about this film. The characters are great, especially Ben's friends who are hilarious. The writing is superb and the jokes hit nearly every time. I know some people are going to be disappointed by it, but I had a fun time watching and enjoyed every minute of it. Judd Apatow should be proud of this accomplishment of a movie, this was a comeback project that worked from start to finish. If you enjoy raunchy comedies with a lot of heart to it, this movie is definitely for you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Could use more polish, but still very funny","Judd Apatow did it again. Even better this time with this film. The story is pretty simple, girl and boy get wasted, have sex and girl gets pregnant. She decides to keep it and they start giving parenthood a shot, even though they are strangers to each other.The conflicts are pretty obvious from the start: not knowing each other and being opposite each other as well. Of course the story is about these two people learning to fall in love (or very slowly learning what love is), with a baby bringing them together. And it has a large number of very funny moments, some working better than others.There's a lot that carries over from The 40 Year Old Virgin and not all of it is good. Many of the players cross over from one film to this film, whether in major supporting roles or bit parts. The gross-out stoner comedy makes it into this one as well as the moments of real-to-life banter. And there's a surprising amount of heart stuck into this piece as well, which is all very good. I don't laugh when watching most comedies, so getting me laughing is a good sign for a comedy.But some of the weaknesses from 40 Year Old Virgin also return for this film, including several scenes, which might be funny, but seem a little forced or unnecessary. These include many of the banter scenes which do seem a little artificial because, although they might have happened in the real life, these are not the scenes that we would remember in real life. Consequently, since they do not carry any dramatic thrust, it creates a sense of ""why am I watching this?"" Or at least it did in me. But it is far more natural and flows much better than 40, so I give it credit for improvement.I think the movie could've been a little shorter with some of those scenes clipped and held a better pace. But nonetheless, the cast performs well, the story hits its marks, the direction overall is a little unspectacular, but it does what it needs to do. And it's funny. And I found Katherine Heigl surprising watchable in this film (surprising to me because I have a hard time believing her character (and most characters) in ""Grey's Anatomy"".I do wish we had a stronger understanding of why Alison decides to keep the baby or got to see a little bit more of her perspective, since we primarily stick with Ben's side of the story. But mostly, I just wished that it was tighter. But that doesn't prevent this film from being highly enjoyable and a bit more than the usual mindless comedy fare in the genre it belongs to. So I recommend it. It's funny, it's got heart and I look forward to the next Apatow film to see where he goes from here. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Highly overrated.,"Based on it's rating I was expecting to see a good movie, if not a brilliant one.Unfortunately the movie was awful...The story is simple yet it lacks credibility on some points, the main characters have no chemistry, and to top it all up it doesn't have any really funny moments.The actors seemed fit for this movie but they didn't pull it off. Or maybe it was the story behind the movie. Or the script lacked any depth. Or maybe all of the above are the reasons why this movie is such a failure...All I know is that Knocked Up is bad as a comedy and even worse as a romantic movie.So do yourself a favor and skip this one...You won't regret it",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Reviews For a Comedy?,"I had no idea who Judd Apatow was until this movie came out (shut...UP). Then I read the review for Knocked Up in Entertainment Weekly and People. Both gave the movie a great review and mentioned its constant, in-your-face realistic humor, which is a rare element in most comedies nowadays (the Chuck and Larry movie does NOT count). Intrigued, I went and saw Katherine Heigl shag Seth Rogen's stifler without protection (boo protection, yay beer!) and witnessed their physical (former) and mental (latter) transformations in the subsequent nine months. Saying the movie wasn't great would be criminal, but as I was laughing I had this slightly disturbing feeling in my gut. What hinders this movie from becoming a classic is the way it treats such a realistic, life-changing topic. Kramer vs. Kramer treated divorce with delicacy and poignance, but Knocked Up treated, well, being knocked up as if it's something that should be shrugged off and laughed about at a dinner party. ***",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

AWESOME MOVIE!!! If you are twelve,"After my friends, who I consider moderately intelligent, raved about this movie for weeks, I decided to rent It, hey why not? I'd give it a shot. The movie was a total rip off, not funny, waste of time. The underlying premise is not believable, thus every thing that happens after the initial one night stand is pointless. I don't know what star system these characters live in, but I have been to many bars and have never seen a girl that looks like Kathryn Heigl go home with a guy who looks like Seth Rogen after just meeting him at a bar no matter how drunk or how much tic she has snorted previously that evening to have unprotected sex on a one night stand. How stupid and desperate is this girl? and on top of that we are supposed to believe she is an otherwise intelligent A-type personality who has it together who just made a mistake? For a guy who looks like Seth Rogen, knocking up that girl and having her keep the baby is the equivalent to winning countless scratch and win one dollar lotteries. On top of that, no women I know are dying to go out with fat, unemployed, pot heads, no matter how funny and how big their jew-fro is or how many stains they have on their shirts, I know this because that is what I look like. It's just a movie you may say, NO this was an insult to everyones intelligence involved in the film, watching the film or citizen of any country where this went to number one. On top of all this, we have a scene of Ryan Seacrest losing it off camera, like we are getting a glimpse into his non American Idol real personality, WHO THE $$$$ CARES ABOUT SEACREST? This was weird and not funny, edgy or smart. The scene with the bouncer was awkward and strange, I don't know what they were going for but in the world I live in you don't call someone a ""Faggot"" for doing their job and if you do you deserve to be pimp slapped. The only good thing about this film that I did enjoy was it strangely resembled watching a car wreck or trainwreck, it was mildly entertaining to see how low it would sink which too me I can go to a kindergarten class during recess and watch the kids play outside in the mud and get the same effect for free. His friends were lame and uninteresting, countless jokes about one of them having a beard, wow, lets think of how many times we can come up with different names to call a guy with a beard that is so funny! The Asian girl who was laughing at everything was unlike any stoner I ever knew, and I've know hundreds, The dialog which was supposed to pass for edgy or witty was just plain stupid and embarrassing, not embarrassing as in the Amish would blush, but embarrassing in the way that if you have more than a modula oblongata operating your bodily functions, and have conscious thought, you are sad and stunned that humans can pass this off as conversation. these are the types of people I have gone my entire life trying to avoid why would I want to watch a two hour movie with them? I'm amazed that this film made so much money, truly what passes for humor in this country is unbelievable. I'm moving to Canada as soon as I can find a time machine to take me back to 1977 when SCTV is just beginning and Saturday night Live is peaking.

"Surprisingly very good, no regrets watching this.","For starters, I am a staunch opposer of Judd Apatow movies simply because he does almost the same thing in all of his movies. Nudity, obscene amount of cursing, random disgusting sexual references, the whole works. And in Apatow's very famous film, ""40 year old virgin"", that was simply horrible. However, this movie sort of deviated from his prior usual techniques and actually had a very good storyline, some pretty good acting, (mostly on Heigl's part), some good non-sex related jokes, and a few heartfelt scenes.The script was very good. There was some interesting dialogue with some good points and overall, actually taught you something about pregnancy from both a male and female perspective. However, Apatow couldn't resist adding his own kind of humor with random incoherent swearing and pointless nudity and/or sexuality. The movie was pretty funny at times and Rogen did a pretty good job in terms of his acting and impovs.Overall this movie was pretty good. It is not a classic, but it is something worth watching because you can learn something if you take the topic seriously. It is worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A Profane, Entertaining ""Romantic"" Comedy from Apatow & Crew","Judd Apatow's second feature film doesn't have nearly as much raunchy humor as his first, but injects it with more heartfelt moments to balance it all out. In the film, slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) gets career-minded Alison Scott pregnant after a drunken one-night-stand and the two come together in an attempt to create a relationship out of their situation. I didn't find the film as ""laugh-out-loud"" funny as Apatow's first movie, but this was still a great movie in it's own regard. There were points were I felt the length of the movie (the unrated version runs 2 hrs. 13 min.) but I never got bored and I never stopped laughing.One thing you'll find when watching an Apatow film is that he uses a lot of same cast for each film, and I'm glad he does because he's managed to network with some of the funniest performers in modern film. I continue to believe that Seth Rogen is one of the funniest men in entertainment and this movie only strengthens that belief. He's hilarious at all the right times here and gives a sincere performance that helps you like the character, even when he does something stupid (and he does, multiple times). Katherine Heigl is enjoyable and seems like she had a great time in her role, but I couldn't help but lose a bit of respect for her after she complained about the movie following it's release. For me, the best parts of the film involved Ben's friends (Jonah, Jay, Jason, and Martin) or Paul Rudd (who's got great chemistry with Rogen). Whenever these guys were on screen, it cracked me up.As I'd mentioned, this film doesn't come with as much raunchy humor as Apatow's other film, though it still has some. People should not jump into this film expecting the usual romantic comedy because they will be disappointed (and probably shocked). At it's core, the film has a warm-hearted story about a slacker rising to the challenge to become a father-figure for his arriving child. Filling it out are plenty of sexual humor, drug use, and the usual profanity. So, if you think about it, it'd be pretty easy for this film to appeal to both men and women.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The most over rated movie in the 21st Century,"OK I gave it a 3 because I thought as a documentary on pregnancy it may be worthwhile. A comedy it is not. I cannot classify this film. They had dozens of opportunities to make you giggle but the script is beyond poor, it's diabolical. I cannot comprehend how anyone could give this film 8 out of 10- my wife even hated it. I had to talk her into watching the last 20 minutes!!!Anyway, if you like it....please explain why...it's not a comedy if you don't laugh, what is this supposed to be? I know a lot of you are probably thinking I am being harsh here but please...before you watch this film, take heed. This IS NOT A COMEDY. I cannot understand why it has got the score it has. It's a nice story of a perfect world but not a funny one!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up,"Knocked Up is about a young man named Ben Stone who doesn't work and just sits around and hangs out with his friends hoping they can get a celebrity nudity site off the ground. One night at a bar Ben meets Alison Scott and one thing leads to another and after not seeing each other for awhile she finds out that she is pregnant with his child. Alison gets back in touch with Ben and the two of them try to work things out and accept that they have a few things to change and accept while making way for a baby in their lives. The film is a comedy, but with some heartfelt and dramatic moments as well. Knocked Up is by the co-writer and director of The 40 Year Old Virgin which is one of my favourite comedies of the last few years and one of my favourite films of 2005. Once again writer/director Judd Apatow blends together crude comedy, drama and a lot of life situations that are actually very well thought out and written. Someone going by the trailer of this film might dismiss it as being a stoner comedy or just another crudely done sexual movie. Well the film does have those moments and when it does it is often very funny and some of the jokes referencing things from pop culture to just plain buddy talk is also well written with sharp dialogue and works because of the great writing and from the great performances by the main stars and it's strong supporting cast as well. The film works also as a film about dealing with the future and issues that like it or not, may happen to a lot of people out there, but instead of condoning what they do the film shows the good times and bad and also how Ben and Alison start to grow on each other and how willing they are to work with each other for their upcoming child. The dramatic scenes are also played out with humour and work well with it's more gentle and softer side that works well also because of good character chemistry and the fact that we are able to believe these characters and what are happening to them and because of the sharp writing, performances and humour that go along with it. In a month where we are bombarded with unnecessary Hollywood sequels and just bad popcorn films, I hope that people will go see Knocked Up because of how well it works on so many levels and because of the talent and skill behind it. It will appeal to those looking for a date movie or a comedy and this film will appeal to both men and women. Knocked Up is certainly one of the most entertaining films of the year so far and also one of the most thought provoking and genuinely sincere and funny films of the year as well. This will be one of my most favourite films of 2007 and after two great films in a row I look forward to seeing what Judd Apatow brings us next because for a modern day comedy when most of what we see is unoriginal and just isn't very good, this is the exception and it is a comedic masterwork.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the funniest movies we have seen in years. Katherine Heigl is spectacular a star is born,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. Wow. Fantastic funny movie in the vain of Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller etc. The entire cast is excellent Seth Roden, Paul Rudd and every one of the boys and girls in the cast. An absolute scream of a movie.Best of the year for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Genius Work from the mind/s behind Freaks and Geeks,"Forget about the controversy. Forget about the crap that people post on this movie's page. This is one of the funniest, most uplifting movies that has come out in a while. Little Miss Sunshine set the bar in the past year for comedies and movies in general. Offbeat characters, great scriptwriting and a plot that some may find either too much or not enough. Seth Rogen proves his worthiness as a Hollywood star(even though he did that in Freaks and Geeks). As a strung out, jobless pothead, Rogen plays Ben, a man in his early twenties whose only ambition in life is to have as much fun as possible. When he has a drunk encounter with Katherine Heigel, they end up with facing one of the most traumatizing(at first) experiences any human being can find themselves in: A one night stand that leads to pregnancy.Despite the controversial title, this movie doesn't set out to gross the audience out with raunchiness or lewdness. Although, a couple of scenes may make some squeamish. What this film does is shed light on the beauty of building a relationship, or rebuilding one(as is the case with Paul Rudd and Leslie Man as Heigl's sister and brother in law). It may sound cliché, but love is definitely not something that just happens. It takes time to build.Whether it's due to unforeseen circumstances or whathaveyou, love and relationships take time and work and the end result can be a very rewarding one.Knocked Up has one of the best scripts in cinema in probably the past ten years. Funny, touching and witty, it displays real emotion(especially through improved scenes). Every character, from Rogen's lazy buddies, to the higher-ups at Heigl's job at E! Entertainment, is well built and extremely fun to watch. Every scene in this movie deserves attention. This is a must see for anyone with a good sense of humor and wit to match.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Mostly inane,"""Knocked Up"" follows a painfully simple premise as its title suggests. A respectable woman and an irresponsible man meet at a bar and after alcohol consumption there is an unexpected pregnancy. Apparently there's supposed to be humor in the fact that he didn't bother to use a condom and she didn't bother to check whether or not he used a condom.The ""hilarity"" is supposed to ensue from there. However, it does not and the jokes are mostly inane with a lot of low-brow humor, profanity and random unfunny movie references mixed in. I found the characters in the movie to be simply irritating rather than amusing as was intended. The only exception was Harold Ramis' character, who has a decent cameo appearance.I was unfortunate enough to be subjected to ""Knocked Up"". Hopefully you will be more fortunate and avoid seeing this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Comedy I Have Seen In a Decade,"This really is a great comedy. The makers of this wonderful film took a simple concept, and made it into a hilarious film with a great plot. The movie in so many ways is great, whether it is the acting or the lessons or the jokes, there was something in this movie that was just pure magic. This movie is really a must-see and it will have you cracking up. The real surprise of the movie though, and the thing that really makes it stand out is the surprise morals that you learn from this movie. It is really a brilliant piece of film history and it real is an era defining comedy. It is a movie that is not only funny but also smart and clever. The jokes aren't all dirty jokes, while many of them are.I also must say that this is flat-out the best acting that I have ever seen from Katherine Heigl, who is one of my favorite actresses. She really makes the whole movie believable, and just adds to the greatness that is this movie. It is possibly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and also just one of the best movies I have ever seen. The jokes are very fresh and the movie in no way copies of any movie. The whole movie experience is like something that I have never seen before. That is why Knocked Up is really a must-see movie event.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
If you are not sure what makes you laugh......Watch this movie ;),"There are a lot of things that can make you laugh, this is a laughter test track. You already know the plot, but you should see this movie for the message. Once you notice the message, you will be reminded that life has laughter. If Beauty met the beast just after Harry and Sally introduced them and then they asked YOU to decide if Nature or Nurture mattered........then watch this updated version of the obvious answer. This movie is a documentary starring most of us. Two sincere, likable donors find procreation. The most positive explanation of why opposites attract is because the very charming selfless insecure work to improve their accepted shortcomings with an attempt at inbreeding to eliminate any recessive ""quality"" (charm).

Saw Knocked Up Twice!,"Seth, Catherine and supporting cast were great. Some comedies are spoofs that follow a boring formula. Knocked Up, had many original ideas.Yes, men rise to the occasion, when an under employed guy meets a highly successful woman. The character of the woman is shown when she recognizes the guy to be a good guy and worth spending time with. At first she isn't sure of this, but is willing to give it a chance. Good men are hard to find, as are good women.The character of the man is spurred to improve when he realizes that a bright and personable attractive woman is actually interested in him. And although sex is important to both, he grows up when he realizes there is much more to this than sex.Kind of like a movie version of 'According to Jim', who recognizes that he married up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Funny, but disappointing","I was quite disappointed. I guess I didn't especially like Virgin when I first saw it, but it's grown on me, and I like it a lot more now. So I had high hopes for this one. And it didn't reach them. It was funny, sure, but not nearly as much as I thought it would be. There were a lot of awkward moments, where I wasn't sure if I should laugh or not; it seemed really mean-spirited at times. It was also far too long. A big chunk of it could have been shaved off and it would have helped greatly. There are a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments, and certainly some memorable characters, but there's far too much going on in this movie at once. There's the main pregnancy, but then there's Ben's stoner friends, Alison's job, the other married couple and their problems, Ben and Pete's friendship, etc. A lot of it just distracted from the main story. And the crowning scene - what the hell? Totally out of nowhere. I laughed a lot, but also felt uneasy a lot of the time. The acting is good, and it's competently made, but it's all over the place a lot of the time. Pretty disappointing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vulgar Romantic Comedy?  Perfection.,"Bringing out the ugly! What really makes this film great and uncomfortable and funny is how it lets us see ourselves. In only a few moments Ben Stone is transformed from sweetly funny stoner into a shouting, mean-spirited, insensitive child. Pete retreats selfishly from a wife, Debbie who suffocates him with insane, but strangely familiar, expectations. All the players at some point become irrational, and this is where Alison (Hiegl's character) escapes criticism. Because she is pregnant, any outburst, any unmotivated action is easily excused, and ironically, she may have the fewest anyway. She's still Izzy from Grey's Anatomy, but without the self-righteousness. She's the ideal, a little vanilla, and a little hard to identify with, but in a good way.Despite Rogen's and Hiegl's competence, it's the little characters that really make this film shine. Leslie Mann, Alison's older sister, somehow seems like both a potentially wonderful mother and potential basket case. She teeters on greatness and disaster and I love and identify with her for it. Jason Segel, whose turn on CBS's How I Met Your Mother is nothing short of phenomenal, shines here as a slacker friend, unfoundedly cocky, and somehow endearing. He effortlessly controls the screen.Most wonderful, though, is Paul Rudd's Pete. I've never seen a character like him animated on the screen. After attempting just now several times, it's impossible to describe what's with this character. I guess there's a kind of absent, off-hand responsibility to him that just makes for compelling screen time. An Oscar worthy performance that, sadly, will never manifest in a nomination because of the kind of movie this is.The film is undeniably funny on all levels. There are jokes ranging from the sophisticated pokes at pop culture, to the almost mandatory fart joke. I will say, that even the fart\poop references manage to be original and hilarious. Is the humor crude? Yes, and somehow not quite inappropriate either. We're eavesdropping on funny people with their most intimate friends.

Instant Classic!,"""Knocked Up"" is one of those films that creeps up from behind and really surprises you in every sense. What could have been a dumb, forgettable, raunchy sex-comedy turns out to be a smart, memorable, raunchy sex/romantic comedy.It's a well balanced high wire act of potty mouthed humor with sweet and sensitive elements that is pulled off brilliantly. I haven't laughed so much through a movie in some time. Although, You may need to be careful who you bring to see this movie I got to say I have really fallen in love with this new emerging comedy circle that centralizes around Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Jonah Hill and all the others that have appearances in this film.

"Great movie, hits all the targets brilliantly","Normal guys are not constantly serious. Men have hopes, dreams, fears, the need to relax, and lots of illusions of how things might be. Watching ""Knocked Up"" really makes me see the Judd Apatow was not the cause of ""Don't Mess With the Zohan"" being an unfunny unentertaining bore-fest. Judd Apatow's writing and direction in this movie keeps the scene pacing clean and the movie flows smoothly to each plot point. Judd makes each character believable with interesting complexities. Judd Apatow has a highly introspective mind which can detail the personalities of a person so that the viewer relates to the unspoken thoughts reflected in the faces of the brilliant actors & actresses.The characters were a bit generic in design, but perfectly fit this movie pitched to an audience of men deciding whether to commit to a marriage and raising an unexpected child.Seth Rogen plays the non-serious guy wanting a life of easy pleasure and no responsibility. Katherine Heigl plays the funny sexy idealized wonderful girlfriend (bizarrely ignorant of popular entertainment) who is okay with the non-serious guy, but starts needing a guy who can be reliable and trustworthy when the baby is due. Paul Rudd plays the pussy-whipped husband who is highly reliable and has a good-paying job, but is slowly dying inside from his over-bearing snippy constantly judgmental nightmare wife. Leslie Mann has the hardest role here as ""The Nightmare Wife"" in that she plays the shrew wife which unforgivably picks at constant irrelevant flaws because she is scared and bored and unhappy and unable to deny she is getting older as well as slightly less attractive. However, Leslie Mann's character is also highly supportive of her sister and she is serious and focused about dealing with life's difficulties and is thusly a highly desirable woman of character to have around even if she is an unreasonable highly demanding witch for 90% of her life. Leslie Mann has the hardest character to play because she will be the one that everyone is programmed to hate (note that she is ACTING and this character should not be considered to be the real life Leslie Mann in the same way that Ron Perlman is not a superhero demon or an alien or a circus strongman).The only flaw I can find with the movie is the problem of people doing whatever they desire and then dealing with the consequences haphazardly afterward (as this was the punchline to the movie ""Idiocracy""). However, life happens that way and this movie sells the idea that even though the circumstances are not ideal, they are tolerable and common and workable no matter how much they do not mesh with your dreams and plans.I highly recommend this movie for viewing even though it is a sales pitch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
just not as funny as I thought it would be,"I just don't find people constantly screaming ""f--- you!"" (or at times, omitting the ""you"") very funny in itself. The characters' intensity was very draining, directed at each other, at those they loved, at perfect strangers, or at themselves. The characters had no obvious means of support, nor did they have any jobs or occupation, or family commitments. They seemed to caricature the oldest California stereotypes.But to me, what was most discomforting was the anti-Muslim ""banter"" early in the film by the group of boys (men?) who had been clearly identified as being Jewish several times in the film. Maybe that was to give it a certain ""edginess"" that unrelenting sexual references no longer provide? Anyway, I found the movie to be unbelievable and tedious, and I waited out the last 10 minutes in the lobby.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Nutshell Review: Knocked Up,"Writer-director Judd Apatow is probably best known for last year's sleeper hit comedy The 40 Year Old Virgin, where Steve Carrell played the titular character whose friends tried to get him laid. In Knocked Up, most of the familiar faces in Virgin returns for Apatow's latest offering, this time with Seth Rogen cast as one of the protagonists who has his hands full when he learns that he's going to be a father. But here's the catch - the pregnancy is totally unplanned, and was a result of a drunken one-night stand.Knocked Up is fertile (pardon the pun) ground for comedy, and Apatow's script, while it doesn't have much slapstick, turns it on by having plenty of winning dialogue, as the film chronicles the entire 9 months of the pregnancy period. And at its core, it's a true blue romance movie, with some seriousness at the side as it takes a long hard look at modern relationships, and the challenges faced by the modern family. It's expectations versus sacrifice, and Apatow really nails it all in with aplomb. The entire film is witty and so spot on, it sometimes hurts when you see things happening on screen, happen so close to home.Seth Rogen stars as Ben Stone, an unemployed man living off his insurance benefits for having been hit by a truck. He spends the day idling with his geek friends, who together, are setting up an Internet website which documents the exact moments when actresses appear nude in movies. Simply put, he's your undesirable plumb nerd who girls wouldn't want to go near. But opposites attract, and in a moment of brilliance, he manages to snog Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful executive for E! Entertainment, the It-girl with a bright future ahead of her, until their unprotected tryst.So it's a tussle between the two who are poles apart, to try and learn more about each other, to see if they like each other enough to want to try and do something serious about their situation. To Alison, she's keeping the baby, and to Ben, he's in for the ride, if he can prove that he's serious about it. What I liked about the movie is the subtle reminder never to judge a book by its cover, that hey, geeks (rule) are just as fun to be with, despite their encyclopedic knowledge about totally random bits of trivia, and that they don't have model good looks.But more importantly, as I mentioned, it takes a good hard look at modern relationships, and contrasts this perfectly by having Alison's married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann), sharing the spotlight as well, with Paul Rudd as Pete her husband. They seem like the perfect all-American family, but if you chip deeper into the psyche, you can see that all is not so well, and that is contributing to the fear factor our new couple are trying to grapple with.Like The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up has its fair share of geek jokes, tons of movie references that movie fans can cheer about, and a number of uncredited cameos who just are a hoot to watch. And Ben's posse of geek buddies just about steal almost every scene they're in, despite being a little too predictable with their weed-smoking, free-loving, frequent-cursing ways.Very rarely do comedies come with a lot of heart. Knocked Up balances fun and seriousness all too well, and as a result, with its feel good ending offering plenty of hope, makes this movie one of the best this year. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Long Lasting Laughs,"Knocked Up was somewhat of a pleasant surprise for me. I came to see the movie because of Seth Rogen's awesome performance in 40 Year Old Virgin, and I expected him to do even better. Rogen did live up to my expectations. Seeing some guys from freaks & geeks was a pleasant surprise, but of course that is the genius of Judd Apatow. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann provided for a lot of humor. Their characters hate/love relationship added some good, substantial, humor. The leading lady (Katherine Heigl) was alright too.Overall this film really helped provide for some long lasting laughs.Initially when you see the movie you might laugh a little at some of the less appreciated lines, but some time later you find yourself saying things like,""Luke I am your stoner,"" or,""I won't say it, but it rhymes with shmashmortion,"" and my favorite,""No I'm just really hiiigh.""

Judd Apatow is the best at what he does,"Judd Apatow is the best at what he does;somehow he manages to grab my funny bones and is able to conjures up certain laughter and howling that I was not aware I was capable of doing. The finish product was clean, though somewhat method, a little familiar, but the overall material was totally fresh; giving us a deeper glimpse into the American relationship experience. I'm sure his next film will deal with marriage or when the children finally leave the nest; I'm sure I'll be waiting in line and buying tickets. Seth Rogen can not act. The premise behind this film was easy to execute but Rogen seemed challenged and overwhelmed; it's as if he has the same expressions for all his emotions, extremely 1 dimensional. Katherine Heigl delivered an awesome performance; she was so hot in this movie. I would definitely rob banks for her devotion and if she had my child....that would be cool. Her emotional depth comes across with beautiful intensity in her acting, penetrating, directly to the heart; I was excited and stimulated all at once. Jonah Hall was definitely the MVP of this film in my opinion; it's a shame he didn't get the lead part but I'm sure that's the politics of Hollywood. He is so assessable, mutating into that kid you grew up with and knew your whole life. Overall this movie will definitely take your mind off of whatever is bothering you and have you cheering for the underdog. A very bankable comedy.

Very funny and very sweet as well!,"Judd Apatow's first film took the simple idea of a 40 year old virgin and expanded it into a sweet and funny tale that was more than just a one-joke movie. His second film Knocked Up takes a more realistic route by showing what would happen if a one-night stand actually made somebody pregnant. Yet, like The 40 Year Old Virgin, Apatow knocks it out of the park, proving that he could rival Mel Brooks as the best living comedic filmmaker in North America. What pushes this film above the typical R-rated sex comedy is the fact that Apatow spends just as much time creating a believable script as he does bringing the audience to uncontrollable laughter. He also fills the screen with likable actors, who bring plenty of charisma to Knocked Up. Without them, it certainly wouldn't have been the same film.Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is an unemployed slacker, who just enjoys smoking marijuana and developing a website on film pornography. Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted by E! News to be an on-air anchorwoman and to celebrate, she goes to a night club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). There, she gets drunk and meets Ben and they both go home and sleep together. After parting ways the following morning, Allison calls Ben a couple of weeks later to announce that she is pregnant with his child. Deciding against having an abortion, the two bachelors try to get to know each other and sure enough (as this is a Hollywood film), the two grow very close. Meanwhile, there is a subplot involving Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd), who is beginning to get bored of his marriage and soon forms a bond with Ben. As mentioned before, this is a Hollywood film, but doesn't completely follow the typical format of an American romantic comedy and that is where the film succeeds above similar films.Judd Apatow, much like he did with The 40 Year Old Virgin, pushes the limits of his ""R"" rating and goes all the way, showing absolutely everything. Not only are there the usual breast shots and profanity-laced rants heard in R-rated sex comedies, but also hundreds of uses of drugs (smoked in ways I have never seen before), vomiting and ""doggie-style."" There is even a pregnancy scene that shows that you don't need $250 million to create realistic special effects. Yet, among the crude scenes, there are also those sweet moments which Apatow manages to keep from getting over-long and sappy. The scenes between Rogen and Heigl certainly display Apatow's ability to write great romantic dialogue, but this is surprisingly proved even more so in the parts where Rogen and Rudd converse. The more time that Ben spends with Pete, the more it dawns on him what the future will be like for him when he and Allison have a family. Even though it is not shown on screen, we can tell through all of the subtle gestures that Ben thinks he will be as boring and lifeless as Pete has become.This, of course, leads to why the film is such a major success: the performances. Apatow does not cast any devilishly handsome fellows in the roles and the actors he chooses are natural and manage to slide in their parts easily. Seth Rogen is not a De Niro or a Nicholson and nor does he need to be. He gives Ben a likable persona and even after two hours, we're still not tired of him. Ben is thrust into a situation that many people go through and Rogen doesn't play the part as over the top. He is crude and vulgar when he needs to be and he is sweet and charming when necessary. Katherine Heigl is a good match-up with Rogen, as she allows us to believe she actually is pregnant and not an actress in a fat suit. The character changes throughout the film, due to hormones and cravings, and Heigl plays it very well. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd give ample support as the film's only married couple and they're both hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time.For me, the comic delights of the film are the four actors playing Ben's best friends. All of them most likely playing themselves, Apatow doesn't overdo them and they don't enter the scene when un-needed. They are the tasty side dish to Rogen and Heigl's steak. Harold Ramis, Steve Carell, Ryan Seacrest and James Franco drop in as well for some very funny cameo appearances. Their scenes are short so they don't overstay their welcomes. Apatow gives them a rant and they're on their way. Knocked Up is one of those rare modern American comedies that manages to be both side-splitting and heart-breaking and without using the aide of humongous visual effects and is certainly worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Charming,"This movie reminds me of my own youth, when I experimented with marijuana and other drugs, and when I lived in an apartment with other irresponsible young males, living week to week, from slender paycheck to slender paycheck. And, then I found a woman, who had a real job and was not content to live on cheap thrills and silly male self-indulgence.This is the lifestyle, also, of Seth Rogen in this film, when he encounters Katherine Heigl as a young woman, who is celebrating a new job at a bar. Seth, even though he is overweight and not exactly mature, comes on to her. They wind up in bed. Eight weeks later, she calls him with the news that she is pregnant.Suddenly, Seth has to grow up fast and lose the marijuana habit, so that he can support his woman and his fast-arriving little baby. Like Sleeping Beauty, Seth's maturation, as a potential husband and father, suddenly has to quicken from its long slumber. And, Seth is as amazed as the viewers are, when all these mature feelings suddenly spring to life, like a flower that reaches its time to bloom.Another touching part of this film is the realistic depiction of pregnancy and childbirth. So soon after another pregnancy film, Waitress, this film focuses, this time, more on the male side of the mating dance, just in time for Father's Day. Don't miss this film, which celebrates fatherhood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Comedy for 15 year old boys,"This could have been a nice, average movie, but it couldn't decide who its audience was. The trailers suggest that it's a spin on a nice little romantic comedy, probably a chick flick. But beware! It turns out that the movie is really about immature geeks.The two women in this film did a nice job. Paul Rudd was fine, and the lead male was fine... You'd think that would be enough to keep the movie from being a total bust. BUT, the movie was way over the top in the amount of time that was dedicated to the juvenile behavior of the young single 'men' who were the sidekicks. I'm fine with profanity and sexual innuendo in film, but this just went on and on and on and on... These sidekicks are supposed to be in their early 20's but they are like a troupe of 15 year old boys who revel in fart jokes, pubic hair, put downs, drugs, and the dream of getting laid. It was a BAD version of American Pie. The sidekicks had nothing interesting or endearing to offer. They curse incessantly without consideration of who else is in their presence, as if they just learned these words and feel the need to practice, or out do one another.Sure, men need space, and they need to be guys... but this movie portrays single men as absolute dimwits. While the lead male evolves along the way, none of the band of buddies do. At one point in the film I couldn't decide whether it was anger or pain that was causing me to shift constantly in my seat as I watched. The film should be reedited. Cut out about 5 minutes of the sister, cut out 5 minutes of her husband, cut out 20 minutes of the 'boys' -- and give us about 10 minutes back of Katherine M. Heigl -- who is reason we came to see the film in the first place. She is the only believable character in the film--the only one who doesn't overplay her role--and she still manages to let the comedy through.Watch this one on DVD.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The greatest comedy that not's funny!,"This movie is chalked so full of so many comedians it's not even funny...the doctor does stand up comedy!!!! His friends are from shows that have not gone far (except for Jonah Hill who became popular after 40 Year Old Virgian and went on to do a few good movies like to gain popularity). These guys are hilarious and haven't been given enough attention. If you like comedies and dramas about life that'll have you thanking your parents for all the work they did bring your girlfriend (GULP!) and see this movie. I loved it!!There's some spots during the birthing that you will find to be real to life and may gross you out, but the hope is you'll be laughing too much to care ;)You also see the transformation of Seth Rogan's character as he struggles to get over his adolescence and grow up. I'm glad they didn't go with the usual one scene and he's changed either, they made you want him to change so when he does finally you're not like...FINALLY...it comes together at the end and makes you think about that time in your life, or that time that's soon to come where you will have kids.

Easily the best comedy i've seen in years...,"Saw this film recently a few months after it was released on DVD, having seen it advertised basically everywhere I didn't really think about watching it until I was literally standing in Blockbusters looking for a good film to pass the time. What I got with knocked up was a genuinely funny, sweet film which easily surpassed the 40 year old virgin.Rogen is great as the comedy lead and will clearly go from strength to strength in his future career, the rest of the cast were great as well and there was really no dead weight. Heigl is amazing and is actually funny as well as beautiful in her role. The stoner humour is an acquired taste but is very well developed to reach a wider audience than films such as 'Harold and Kumar get the munchies'.Don't listen to the negative reviews this really is a great comedy that will have you feeling good and quoting the film to your friends.

"Overpraised, overlong, and over-the-top","The critical overreaction to this movie has me flummoxed. I just don't get what all the fuss is about. I got, tops, three big laughs out of it. It goes on forever, has long stretches of dialogue that had me screaming ""CUT!"", and sticks us with some of the most strident characters I've seen in a long time. (For more than two hours, no less.) They do virtually nothing else but bicker, bitch and moan about what tough lives they have. Woe is me! I'd love a huge house in L.A. and a Lexus, or to lay around getting stoned all day, or have a great job with E!. Give me a break. At least 40 Year Old Virgin had believable characters you cared about. I couldn't give one fat turd for anyone in this movie, and I didn't believe any of the relationships anyway. One episode of ""A Baby's Story"" on TLC has more laughs than ""Knocked Up"".",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
perceptive romantic comedy,"Like many romantic comedies these days, ""Knocked Up"" can seem a bit schizophrenic at times, straddling a fine line between salty language, sexual innuendo and crude sight gags on the one hand, and a foursquare endorsement of monogamy and marriage on the other. The standard formula for such films is that the characters are allowed to be as promiscuous as they want to be in the early stages of the drama provided they see the error of their ways and settle into responsible domestic conformity by the time the closing credits come rolling by.""Knocked Up"" goes a step further than most films in this genre by turning this theme - which is usually more implied than stated - into the very cornerstone of the movie itself. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a socially backward, unemployed, loser stoner who has a drunken one-night-stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful, up-and-coming reporter for the E Channel. When, in the stone-cold sober light of early morning, Alison sees who exactly it was she had sex with the night before, she essentially brushes Ben off, never expecting to really have to deal with him ever again. Fate, however, has other plans, as she soon discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's baby. Will Ben do the right thing by giving up his nerdish bachelor ways to marry Alison and be a true father to his child? Will Alison overcome her initial repulsion to discover the true Ben and start a family with him? Even though the answers to those questions are never much in doubt given the nature of the genre, the movie has a great deal of fun getting to those answers..This is writer/director Judd Apatow's highly anticipated follow-up to the wildly popular ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" a film that most people seemed to enjoy more than I did. For despite some fine performances and some very funny moments, ""Virgin"" often seemed weighed down by both the implausibility of its premise and its dogmatic adherence to the overused ""Pygmalion"" formula. Luckily, ""Knocked Up"" starts right off the bat with a more believable and compelling premise, which allows the audience to more clearly identify with the characters and their situations. What separates ""Knocked Up"" from so many other generic romantic comedies is that Apatow has a sharp ear for the way people in the real world actually speak. The lines are not only incisive, witty and sophisticated, but they are also what we would expect to hear coming out of the mouths of individuals caught in their particular situations. He makes us laugh at all the foolishness, foibles and insecurities we ourselves are prone to as we cope with the often maddening complexities of human relationships. Apatow also has a rare gift for making even the secondary characters compelling and interesting. Thus, even though Ben and Alison are the primary focus of the movie, Alison's uptight sister, Debbie, and her beaten-down husband, Pete, are fully fleshed-out figures as well. And even though Ben's loser roommates come across as fairly stereotypical zonked-out geeks and nerds, at least they are given some very funny one-liners to deliver as commentary on the main action.However, all is not mere fun-and-games in this film. Some of the fight scenes, for instance, are surprisingly raw and cutting in their no-holds-barred brutality and frankness, and many in the audience may find themselves squirming uncomfortably in recognition of things that they themselves have said or done in the heat of anger. On a more upbeat note, Apatow also has a knack for inserting up-to-the-minute pop culture and movie references into the dialogue without making it feel desperate or forced. This gives the movie an enjoyably contemporary, ""with-it"" quality - although one wonders how far that may go towards limiting the shelf life of the movie in the long run, and how dated it may appear to audiences catching it on some cable station a decade or two from now.Apatow is also to be commended for building his romantic comedy around a less-than-hunky male lead (although he doesn't have the nerve to go for a Plain Jane equivalent for the distaff side of the equation). It also helps that Rogen and Heigl are so utterly endearing in the roles of Ben and Alison, and that they receive such fine support from the likes of Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and many others, including a handful of recognizable celebrities who make cameo appearances playing themselves.It's true that the movie runs out of steam a bit along the way and overstays its welcome by about a half hour or so, but given its broad canvas, ""Knocked Up"" feels more expansive, comprehensive and fully baked than your average cookie-cutter romantic comedy. It's also a great deal more fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is the funniest movie since the 40 year Old Virgin,"Judd Apatow brings another classic comedy home with 'Knocked Up'. I saw a screening of this film last night and can't stop thinking about all the hilarious scenes. It is an unforgettable movie that really makes you laugh endlessly. There was only a few minutes in the entire film where the audience was not laughing hysterically.The characters are relatable and you find yourself caring for all of the problems that Ben (Rogen) encounters. All of the roommates really add to the movie and are un-forgettable.This movie is the funniest film in years, if not ever!

Save the due date,"Slobby Ben and up and coming career girl Alison meet at a bar, and end up having a one night stand. Eight weeks later, Ben is shocked when Alison meets him and reveals that she is pregnant. Despite having little in common, the two decide that they have to at least try to make some kind of relationship work for the baby's sake.It's a funny thing: I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theater...well, I didn't. So a week passed. Noww I don't feel as enthusiastic about watching it, wanting to save money and wait for other summer movies. Well, I watched it and, although not great, it was a well made movie.It's like Scary Movie 4, having a joke per minute, but I find myself chuckle through most of it, since I'm more into comedies like Scary Movie 4, where I laugh at the physical and toilet gags rather than the ones in this movie. I know adults would love this movie, seeming that this is their kind of taste.This movie is also sweet and endearing, showing family and marriage. I liked the acting by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl, who both give a real ""opposites attract"" kind of people. I also loved the supporting roles by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.This is a worthy comedy, laughing out loud at some jokes, but chuckling at many.

NOT knocked out by Knocked Up.,"So much good buzz over Knocked Up. Turns out all the buzzing was done by retarded bees. This was not a good movie and I'll tell you why.The characters were mostly despicable and, worse, not believable as real people. Real twenty-something men, crude and disgusting though they may be, are not as crude and disgusting as the men in this movie. Real people as successful as Pete and Debbie do not behave the way they did in the movie.The movie was unable to convince us there was anything real between Ben and Allison. They had zero chemistry and zero physical, emotional or intellectual connection. Zero. So, it didn't make sense that they would have sex in the first place. It didn't make sense that this successful woman would EVER consider keeping that loser's baby. And it didn't make sense that Allison would fall in love with Ben. Yeah, the script can say they fell in love and the actor's can mouth the words at the right time but they sure didn't convince us.The movie employed bad actors. We already knew Ryan Seacrest and James Franco can't act. But, worse, Ken Jeong as Dr. Kuni, was awful.Cameo roles by Office personnel (BJ Novac, Craig Robinson, Steve Carell) took us right out of the story. ""Oh, look, there's Ryan.""The movie was way too long. The editing was atrocious. If I can tell that, why couldn't the director and the film editor tell?I gave it one star to counteract the mindless overpraise Knocked Up generated. It's really about a 3-star movie. It would be okay as background noise when you're cleaning your house.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly funny,"After the first half an hour I had the impression that the movie would be an awful one as it was full of low level dialogues and a poor story. But after the two so different lives of the protagonists are thrown together, the result is rather surprising and it turns out that there is a story which is truly entertaining and funny. Of course it is a movie and most probably in real life this will never happen, but we shall not always search for reality like stories. What I found very nice is the fact that we are away from the cliché of the successful man, who finds a girl who is socially not at the same level, like for example in Pretty Woman, but that this time it is a woman who plays the role of being the successful one. Very convincing and politically correct is also the situation at her workplace, were she gets her chance no matter if she is pregnant or not. She is good in her job and that is rewarded. Clean and nice movie for good entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not worth wasting your time,"I am so disappointed in this film. Maybe I'm getting too old I guess to find humor in some of the horrible scenarios portrayed here. Typically I can go by the ratings on IMDb to tell me what will be a good movie to see, but boy was I wrong this time. There was only very few good things about this film. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann were great in it, although I think it gave a horrible name to ""marriage."" Otherwise, I think that was about it. The whole plot idea that some successful young woman would fall for a lewd foul-mouthed moron like Ben is just totally ludicrous. Whether pregnant or not, it wouldn't happen. Then there's the cussing and nudity - come on, seriously, aren't we a little bit beyond that stupid humor? And did we really have to see Allison's vagina during the birthing scene? What really was the purpose of that? We get it...she's giving birth...ha, ha....real funny. Honestly, if I could've, I would have given this movie a zero because I thought it was THAT bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Just as good as 40 Yr Old Virgin,"Remember the movie ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""? Well, they've remade it and called it Knocked Up. Well, not completely - there's a totally new story. But the same writer, director, and half the cast are back (no Steve Carrell, alas). And this movie has everything that the other one had: outrageously raunchy comedy, guys being disgusting, and truly touching moments. This is a very good thing.I loved the 40 Year Old Virgin; it's one of my favorite movies. I did not think Judd Apatow could strike gold twice, but he has. Knocked Up once again delivers on every level. If anything, the plot and sensitive moments have even gotten stronger. The comedy certainly hasn't let up - I haven't laughed that hard in quite a while. In fact, I missed a lot of the dialogue because everyone was laughing so hard for so long.Katherine Heigl (Gray's Anatomy) stars as Alison, a very pretty girl with a successful TV job at the E! channel. Seth Rogen plays Ben, reprising his likable lug character from 40 yr old, and if anything he's a little more of a slob and loser. But he's still very witty and honest, which is what makes his character so likable. The two meet up at a bar where they are both drunk, and they end up having a one night stand. Of course, she ends up pregnant, and decides to keep the baby just to spite her mom. So they try to make a relationship work together.Now, from here the movie could get very predictable, but it doesn't. Sure, we know where it's eventually headed, but it sure doesn't get there the normal way. The two would-be parents fight almost nonstop, as their personalities are very different. But there's a realism to their fights that hits home. The audience is left thinking, ""this sounds like two actual people arguing, not a scripted fight."" Their frustrations come out, and the typical differences between men and women's thoughts are showcased. Just when their fights are getting really bitter, just when we've had enough, just when it seems to be heading in the direction of ""The Break Up"" (a supposed comedy that was just really uncomfortable and bitter fighting), the mood is broken up by more outstanding comedy.One sidestory involves Alison's sister and brother-in-law. Paul Rudd from 40 Yr Old plays the husband, and he and Ben instantly bond over their manly feelings. The wife is played by the actress who was the drunk that puked on Steve Carrell in 40 Yr Old. She plays a very angry, controlling, and insecure lady who ends up alienating her husband with her attitude. It is interesting to watch Alison and Ben spend time with the other family, who have 2 kids of their own already. Every little problem or argument that the family has is painfully apparent to the new couple, and they fear that their own relationship will be headed in this direction.There are many great scenes in this movie that really help it relate to the audience. In one scene, a major earthquake strikes in the middle of the night. In the aftermath, Alison realizes that when it was an emergency, Ben was not there to help her. Can she really rely on him, or is he doomed to be a slacker forever? Upon sifting through their scattered things, she realizes some other truths about him. In another couple scenes, Ben is having a conversation with his dad (the great Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame), asking for advice. His dad is kind and honest, and says nice things that any dad would, but he does not and cannot seem to really give his son any advice. It becomes clear that his dad really is just an older and more mature version of himself: he's a likable guy and has good intentions, but isn't necessarily wise and doesn't really know what to do either.If you took out all the over-the-top jokes and raunch in this film, it would stand alone quite well as its own sweet romantic comedy. But of course the jokes are awesome, and fans of Farrelly Brothers-type humor will not be disappointed. This movie has something for everyone, and unless you're easily offended by a dirty joke, should have most people rolling in the aisles. This is exactly the kind of movie I love, and I highly recommend it. If there's anything wrong with it, I didn't notice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Knocked Up-Extreme Over-rated Version,"With such high reviews on the web and so much word of mouth hype going around about this movie I expected it to be nothing short of brilliant and was I disappointed.Being a movie from Judd Apatow (the director of the 40 year old virgin) I put this DVD into my Aphex DVD player with high hopes for something funny and expected the end to get very serious as most comedies tend to do these days (for reasons unknown to me).If you actually think about it, a lot of comedies these days have the same formula- insert dick/fart/pot jokes for the first hour then make the audience cry on the last hour with ""I almost lost my family!"" Yes, I'm looking at you Adam Sandler (Click).While I somewhat enjoyed the first hour of the movie and by the movie I mean all the beard jokes and the one with ""red beard! red beard!"" (if you've seen the movie)- the pot jokes really fell through for me and if I got any kind of chuckle out of the entire thing it was brief and definitely won't be repeated. The last half of the movie was completely serious and stark of humor as if the first half was written to be some kind of comedy classic while the second half was to be a Nicholas Sparks heart breaker.And one thing that really got to me was the fact that the baby is never named- not something so big as to bring this movie down but it still aggrivates me. Being a father myself- a name was the first thing thought of when I found my partner was preggo.All in all this entire movie is okay as a rental and likely nothing more. On personal opinion I would probably buy this movie used a couple years from now in a pawn shop- that's about it. I believe the main reason this movie got a 7.5-8/10 on IMDb is because of the pot jokes- middle America loves the pot jokes.-fetus orgy",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Laughing Riot,"Running Riot. That's the term in Unreal Tournament used to describe when a player is on a roll and killing everything in sight. If I had to describe Knocked Up in one phrase, it'd be Running Riot.Knocked Up is a nonstop rampage. It's such a barrage of laughter that at times you might forget that the scene is suppose to be serious.The movie has its share of crude moments, which will definitely define the movie for some people. For example, it's cruder than Judd Apatow's last film, 40 Year Old Virgin. Personally I'm a fan of such humor, but I know there will be some shocked moviegoers because the trailers don't prepare you. If you aren't a fan of the crude, don't be deterred by those who will pen this as just a series of sex jokes. It's more than that and you won't be sorry for taking my advice.I don't exaggerate when I say I couldn't stop laughing for the majority of the movie. Serious moments almost became like timeouts where I could dry my eyes from laughing so hard.The cast is almost like an ensemble cast with the focus being on Rogan and Heigl. The supporting cast features a vast array of memorable characters similar to the formula in The Office. Speaking of The Office and SNL fans: expect to see many familiar faces.I think the average viewer may not laugh as much as I did. Admittedly I'm an easy laugher but at the same times I think there were a lot of pop culture jokes in Knocked Up and some people just didn't get them. There was a hilarious scene involving fantasy baseball that absolutely no one in theater except myself laughed at. Then there was a genius joke about Everybody Loves Raymond that again no one laughed at except a few people.If you enjoyed 40 Year Old Virgin, there's no doubt you'll die laughing in this movie. If you are really offended by sex and toilet jokes, I feel sorry for you because you'll be missing out on an excellent movie that offers much more than those forms of humor. Or at least I think it did. I was too drunk on laughter.Just go watch it. Get Knocked Up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny, honest and warm hearted!","""Knocked Up"" / 2006 / Released: June 1, 2007 / Viewed: June 3, 2007 / Comedy***.5 (Very Good)Written and Directed by: Jude Apatow / Running time: 129 minutes""Knocked Up"" is a surprisingly well written, acted and directed film from Jude Apatow ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", 2005. I have not seen ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", nor any other films from this director-writer. I was impressed by the honesty, humor and sweetness of the film. This film has a title I took a quick liking to. The title promised an honest film, and the film delivers in that respect among others.A young, attractive and ambitious female E! television host meets a young lazy, immature and unambitious young man at a bar while she is celebrating a promotion at work. They drink together and quickly become friendly. This leads to an unexpected sexual encounter. The problem is, that 8 weeks later, she learns she is pregnant from their one night stand sex encounter.Director-writer Jude Apatow shows a lot of insight into anxieties about relationships and pregnancy. With an unusually long running time for a comedy (2 hours and 9 minutes), this film takes time to really develop it's two main characters and follow their story over the next 7 months with humor, honesty and sensitivity. Considering the long running time, and this is a comedy film, the film never feels stretched out or too long. With a cast of largely unknown actors and the insightful screenplay, the main and supporting characters come across as convincingly real and ordinary.The few weaknesses are some occasional moments of humor and character types typically found in crude adolescent comedy films. What really makes this film a winner is it's screenplay, directing and acting, in that order. The film initially appears to be a man's film, however it spends a generous amount of time with some strong female characters, that convincingly speak with honesty and sensitivity.Director-writer Apatow is a former television comedy writer. With this film, he shows he is very keen on finding and exploring the anxieties, humor and warm feelings found in romantic relationships. And he is being honest and straightforward with his characters and how they express themselves. The story involves some male and female bonding, to help cope with and make it through difficult personal situations. The lead man and woman each pair off with a same sex friend, bond and travel off to have some fun together. It's here that they really learn about themselves and realize they need to return home and bravely face their difficult and awkward personal circumstances in life.Definitely one of the better written, directed and acted comedies of recent years!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Finally, a smart romantic comedy","I would actually rate this around 8.5, but that's because I had really low expectations to start with. I mean, can you imagine that the sexy yet insanely neurotic blonde from Grey's Anatomy would make a great comedy where she gets pregnant? I expected two thirds of the film to be screams of anger and screeches of estrogen. But no! This film was so funny and smart that I thought it must be Canadian!Short story long: a night stand causes the emergence of a baby. There are issues since the mother is a career woman and the father is a higher-than-life chubby bonger.What I liked most of the film is that the moments of frustration are resolved in mature, intelligent ways, not by bitching and punching. Also people are not really judged. You don't get to see a lousy bum elevated to ""civilisation"" just because he gets to slave around for 10 hours a day.Bottom line: great comedy. Appealing both women and males. It does touch a sensitive subject, having children (I very much prefer murder and cataclysm to it), but it is worth it for a rom com.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Where were the jokes?,"A two hour and ten minute 'comedy' that played out more like reading some spoiled brat's diary. Humor was unevolved and uninspired, and when present existed it existed at only the most basic of levels. A new genre of movies should be created named 'Mindless Babble' and this movie should be placed squarely in that category.Also, while Rogen and Rudd are friends outside of work, their movies do not have to play out like they are having a conversation while watching football in one of their apartments.All in all, a pointless movie to watch once. I cannot fathom how any person would crown this movie as funny, buy the DVD, and sit through it without getting paid.Studios need to take more pride in their humor and not take advantage of the mechanically and spiritually dead that would pay to watch this drivel.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"One big, laundry list of ethics-questions with enormous sprinklings of humor","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the definition of a guy who ""means well,"" but is also the definition of a total geek. He's sweet and sincere, but hopelessly unromantic in his many episodes of pot-smoking, dirty jokes, and vulgarity. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is an employee for the E! TV network, who is extremely career-minded, especially after she finally gets the job interviewing celebrities on air. Only at a club after too many drinks would these people ever meet and have sex, and fate says that they do, and fate includes that they wake up the next morning with almost no memory of what happened the night before.Ben and Alison proceed to get breakfast, before hesitantly exchanging numbers and going about their ways. Ben clearly wants Alison to like him, but she seems passively repulsed by, what she sees, as vacuous immaturity. Regardless, eight weeks later, Alison begins throwing up at work, unpredictably, and rushes home to take a pregnancy test. Well, dozens of pregnancy tests, aided by her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd). She is in fact pregnant and then tracks down Ben through his homemade, film-nudity-tracking website to inform of this occurrence. Now, both lives are enormously affected by one small mistake and the two of them must try and survive the labors (no pun intended) of pregnancy and the stress that comes with it.This doesn't sound like the makings of a four-star comedy, but I assure you, reader, it is. Judd Apatow's Knocked Up is one of the most fun comedies I've seen in a while, perfectly amplifying, while simultaneously furthering the genre of raunch-with-heart. This isn't the nihilistic, hopelessly cynical comedy one would anticipate, but rather a sweet comedy, with strong sprinklings of raunchiness, all encapsulated with a shell of poignancy and life-revelations.Only in a great comedy are the supporting characters just as good as the lead characters and there are a plethora of talents in Knocked Up. From Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr all doing a terrific job at playing Ben's sardonic best friends, there are Debbie and Paul, the only real married couple in the film. Debbie and Paul - who got their own feature film five years after Knocked Up - deal with marital issues that are likely normative in the married life of couples today. Debbie believes in a very controlled, disciplined way of governing her husband and their two children, while Paul believes in a more relaxed, laidback way of parenting. This causes, as expected, an uproar in their marriage, and also causes a pleasant ethics debate for the audience. Is Debbie's disciplining helping or hurting the family? Is Pete in the right position to be sort of ""taking nights off from the family?"" Come to think of it, Knocked Up, as a whole, is one big ethics question. A ""what would you do?"" question appears every few minutes for the audience to answer, and thankfully, the presence of the questions doesn't overshadow the humor or vice-versa. Aside from being just another comedy that provides roughly two hours of pleasant escapism, Knocked Up, in retrospect, provides roughly two hours of marital questions and situations, while combining in the humor to seem more like a presentable package.The winning ingredient for Knocked Up is definitely its heart and its smart focus on the poignancy of pregnancy, especially that of a one-night stand. While this in particular is a rare case, it is nonetheless a realistic one, provided by strong instances of comedy and, yet, strong instances of sadness and sorrow. The scene when Ben and Alison find out their reckless night of debauchery results in a pregnancy is downright soul-crushing, even though you know it's coming. In the blink of an eye, both lives are changed and they're changed so much that the only response is to cry.And yet, there are scenes of pure hilarity and fun. Take for example the scene when Alison first meets Ben's goofball friends, or when an unexpected earthquake hits, or even the subplot involving a bet that Martin Starr's character can't shave his beard for the entire year. While Knocked Up tackles some brutally honest notions and occurrences in the lives of pregnant couples and married people, it nevertheless shows the fun side of life. What some of this all boils down to is nerds having fun being nerds.Knocked Up is more-or-less a roller-coaster, as the real world often is. There are ups, there are downs, there is unconditional happiness, there is unconditional sadness. The humanity the film evokes is nearly nonexistent in the mainstream comedies today, but writer/director/co-producer Apatow knows married life, knows the quirks and hilarity in certain situations, and also knows the time when to be downright realistic and, well, sad. His material from this point looked as if he could only evolve and he certainly did. He is one of the strongest comedy-writers and directors working today.Starring: Seth Rogen. Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr. Directed by: Judd Apatow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up is Knock Out,"In an unexpectedly introspective scene in ""Knocked Up"", Pete (Paul Rudd) with Ben (Seth Rogen) watch Pete's daughters play with soap bubbles. Pete says,"" They (the girls) remind you that you will never be that happy again."" Later in a heartbreaking moment Pete's wife Debbie (Leslie Mann) cries to Pete, ""That is so mean! "" Not to give anything way, it is not an indiscretion, but to Debbie it may as well have been a crippling betrayal. Even with the hysterical sexual humor and clever four letter rifts, ""Knocked Up"" has the striking background story of a marriage enduring and working out. Writer and Director Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is raucous and smart R-rated fun that is amazingly sweet and sentimental. ""Knocked Up"" is refreshingly entertaining, and a great movie. I guess this is not very surprising coming from Apatow, who also did ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"".A week ago I read a curious review by Carina Chocano of the L.A. Times. She contended that a failing of ""Knocked Up"" is that we never get to ""wonder if maybe she (Katherine Heigl's Alison) might have done a little better."" She makes a valid point. Katherine Heigl's Alison is drop dead gorgeous, smart, has a career, and she ends up having a costly one night stand with Seth Rogen's Ben. Charming as Rogen is, he is no Brad Pitteven if you are stone cold drunk. More on that later. Though a valid observation, ""Knocked Up"" is merely a movie, and a comedy at that. Whether a slacker, apparent loser guy with a big heart would really end up with the smart and stunningly gorgeous woman like Alison would really happen, seems beside the point. After all, this is a movie. So Seth Rogen plays Ben, a smart, funny slacker dude, who along with his roommates is starting up a ""skin"" website on the Internet. Yes, theirs is a noble ambition. Ben is basically an over grown adolescent living with a bunch of well intentioned, but lovable losers. On the other hand, Alison (Heigl) works as a production assistant for the ""E!"" channel. She lives with her sister Debbie (Mann), husband Pete (Rudd), and their two daughters to save money. Alison lives in the guest-house and helps out with the kids when she can. Alison is brilliant and ambitious career woman. The producers at ""E!"" promote Alison to on-camera interviewer. To celebrate Alison and Debbie have girls' night at a club. There Debbie meets Ben and his crew. Ben recovers from an out of body charming moment with Alison. When Debbie is called away on family emergency, Alison chooses to stay with Ben. They proceed to get drunk, but also seem to have a natural chemistry. Ben ends up back at Alison's guest-house. Ben even says to Alison, ""You are a lot prettier than I am"" However, before the throes of passion, Ben does not 'snap on' his protection. Consequently, 8 weeks later Alison is pregnant. So aside from learning to be parents, Ben and Alison must get to know each other, as well as something about themselves.Here Apatow brilliantly contexts Debbie (Mann) and Pete's (Rudd) marriage. There is a lot of broadly leveled marital humor throughout, but the performances by Mann and Rudd are amazing and anchor the movie. Debbie lends insight on marriage and parenthood to Alison. Pete does the same with Ben. Debbie authentically anguishes over fears of being too old to be hot, as she comically lashes out at a night club doorman. When she feels betrayed by Pete, that is heart retching. Rudd is hilarious as he parties in Las Vegas with Ben. And he displays touching humility when Ben points out to him that Debbie loves him so much that she wants to spend all her time with him. ""Knocked Up"" is amazing in that it is completely funny throughout in poking fun at the stupid and selfish things we do. However, it also balances this with an appreciation for what is best and noble in people. Seth Rogen is completely charming and hilarious. He inhabits Ben with a gentle and caring soul. You clearly root for slacker Ben, to grow up and be the man he so avoids being. Katherine Heigl (""Grey's Anatomy) is going to be a big star. Stunningly beautiful she is so bold and vulnerable in playing Alison, the together gal suddenly facing single parenthood and raging hormones. There is a hysterical rant where she screams to Ben, ""My vagina will never be the same"" This serves as a reminder; ""Knocked Up"" is not for kids. However, for adults ""Knocked Up"" is hysterical comedy that is surprisingly sweet and poignant. Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"please, make these films stop...","Any thoughts of Apatow becoming the 2000's version of John Hughes -- several top-flight projects over a short period -- is pretty much officially dead. Sure, the prolific stream of scripts cranked out is there, but the quality? Hoo, man, not even remotely close.In what seems like his umpteenth telling of a group of one-track minded slacker idiots, we're treated to yet another underdeveloped hero who we'd never associate with in real life. This time it's the candidate for worst new leading man of cinema Rogan and the results of an utterly unlikely one night stand. He spins his wheels, trying to cope with his new predicament, all the while immersing himself as yet another failure to the ""just say no"" program. But let's get to the real issues here...1. An absolute lack of chemistry between the leads. Heigl is totally unlikable as a one-note, demanding career woman, who garners zero sympathy for her moodswings....and that's before the hormones kick in! And Rogen, if I have to listen to that stoned-out, grating cackle of his one more time, I'll beg for my death.2. The supporting couple who annoy even more, Mann as an unbearable whine-machine, and Rudd in another one his sleep-walking roles as a hapless guru of life (who sneaks off to fantasy baseball meetings?? What in the living hell???).3. People complimenting Apatow's ability to touch on ""those sensitive and telling true-to-life comments about marriage and children"". Uhhh, when a majority of the characters are portrayed as not even slightly lovable, the pithy ruminations on their lives come off as false and unaffecting. Are these people you'd really want to spend one hour with??3. A tired, tired, TIRED screenplay approach where F-bombs and female anatomy discussions that seem so painfully forced, not containing a shred of reality to them.4. And the frigging ENDLESS pop culture references that just magnify that absence of creativity at the screenplay level. I watch movies to live through the lives of the characters, NOT to listen, and listen, and listen ad naseum to their ridiculously stupid amount of movie and music mentions. The infamous comparisons to the bearded buddy character alone were enough to elicit groans and a swirling head from me.Unfortunately, what made Freaks and Geeks so good to Apatow, is what's killing his film work: the freedom and ability to rely *strictly* on near NC-17, bodily and gross-out humor. The restraints of television actually caused him to -- gasp! -- write competently and engagingly. But after the ""Anchormans"" and ""Virgins"" and now this slop (plus the fact those and this were hits) sadly signals a trend he'll probably leave on his tombstone.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up is another hilariously real Judd Apatow comedy,"Having been a fan of Judd Apatow since ""Freaks and Geeks"", I wanted to see Knocked Up since I saw the preview a few weeks ago. Boy, am I glad I did!

There's also a hilarious cameo of the host of the Most Popular Television Show Right Now. I think you know what I'm talking about. And for SNL fans, there's Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. There may be some uncomfortable scenes in between but that just makes this more satisfying when the happy ending inevitably occurs.

Funny throughout, and touching at times, Knocked Up is a baby movie for a generation who is just starting to reach that bend in life. It approaches the subject well, and Aptow does a great job keeping it fresh and never boring. (He gets in one shot I was horrified at twice!) See it, bring a date, you'll love it.

Funniest. Movie. Ever,"I like my fair share of comedies like Wedding Crashers, 40-Year-Old Virgin, Zoolander, etc. What defines a movie to be funny for me is that no matter how many times you see a movie, it remains funny. This is also why I despise Will Ferrel. This movie does have a lot of low brow humor and jokes that rely on cursing or drug use, but it also has that genius touch that only Judd Apatow can deliver. If Seth Rogen doesn't become a huge star after all is said and done, then I will have lost all hope for Hollywood. Most comedies are defined by one scene, or a couple of lines; but not this one. The movie is thoroughly funny from beginning to end. This movie was by far the funniest movie I have seen in a long time; if not ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wretched,"The point to this movie is that, no matter how disgusting and unredeeming you are, if you knock up a pretty girl, she can't help but fall in love with you. Which makes this the perfect date movie for today's youth mentality.There really was no connection between Heigl's ""I find you disgusting"" to her ""I love you, too"" except for the pregnancy. If this movie had made just one bit of transition material between the two polar extremes, it might have made it almost believable.There were a couple of chuckles in it, Heigl is lovely; Ben didn't know whether to be a lovable teddy bear or a junkie.

I applaud the writer, director, and cast for not trying too hard. Should they attempt to follow up this movie (if anyone recalls the tragedy of the American Pie series, please take note) I can only hope that it will be with a similar balance of maturity and HILARIOUS cussing Ryan Seacrest filled scenes that would entail raising a daughter around a bunch of potheads.And thank GOD that t*** Lindsay Lohan was not chosen for the lead role.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Heartwarming Film,"Judd Apatow is unequivocally a genius. While traditionally R-rated comedies mean something demeaning, raunchy, and lacking any real redeeming value, such as American Pie, Eurotrip, and Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, Apatow has managed to elevate the genre to something approaching art. I haven't actually seen the TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"", but it is universally critically acclaimed and everyone bemoans that it was cancelled, another great show lost in the annals of screwed up TV bureaucracy (Firefly, anyone?). But I did see The 40-Year-Old Virgin, a movie from which I was not expecting much (I had never heard of Apatow before), but which I came out of marveling at how incredibly smart it was and what wonderful performances the cast gave. Here was an R-rated comedy that was plenty raunchy but still managed to have something smart and true to say. Knocked Up is no different - Apatow is two for two now with this wonderful story that celebrates and embraces the differences between men and women while giving us true-to-life view on adult relationships.Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a practically broke pothead who is trying to make money through a website that catalogues films that contain nude scenes of actors and actress. Katherine Heigl is Alison Scott, an up and coming TV reporter who works at E! and gets promoted. On one side, a loser pothead. On the other, a successful drop-dead gorgeous young woman. On the day of her promotion Scott decides to go out and party with Debbie, played by the director's wife Leslie Mann, who is married to a Pete, played by Paul Rudd. The two women are having fun until of course they meet Stone and his pothead buddies. Stone and Scott hook up for a night of a wild sex, but unfortunately they don't use a condom. Eight weeks later, Scott finds out she is pregnant, and together the two decide to work things out.In a scenario as unlikely as a gorgeous blonde hooking up with a rather unattractive and unemployed stoner, the story would suck if the characters were anything but lovable and believable, and fortunately ever single one of them is both. Ben's pothead roommates border on the simply conventional and unrealistic, but I think it's okay that they're just there for comic relief, and they serve to show the kind of lifestyle that Ben leads and how important his pals are to him. Ben himself is true to life and he is played perfectly by Seth Rogen. Katherine Heigl isn't as good, but she still shares some great chemistry with Rogen. Two characters that almost steal the show, though, are Pete and Debbie, who serve as an example to both Ben and Alison about what marriage is like in real life. True, the characters are caricatured a bit, but this is the case in any movie, and I thought both Rudd and Mann had perfect marriage chemistry together and the struggles within their marriage showed admirably well the difference between men and women, which brings me to the best thing about Knocked Up.The mature view of adult relationships, the celebration of the difference between men and women, and the importance of taking responsibility and growing up are all themes that are well and competently explored in Knocked Up. Alison and Ben's relationship works because this is how it would look if it happened in real life. The two are deathly afraid of how Pete and Debbie's marriage looks like from the outside because of how much they fight, and the observations that they each have about the marriage are surprisingly accurate to what a given man or a given woman may observe in those situations. Many people complained about how unrealistic the two's love is, but this is a movie people, and it's not meant to portray real life. Besides, I easily understood what Alison sees in Ben - he's a sweet guy deep inside, and I could tell that he really cared for Alison. Like I said before, the chemistry between the two is wonderful, heartwarming, and endearing.On the whole Knocked Up is a great film. The characters are excellent, the humor uses real life situations and real people for laughs, the raunchiness is not excessive, but perfectly fits the film. Every single one of the cameos is excellent, from Steve Carell all the way to Kristen Wiig, with whom I was particularly impressed. She's only in two scenes, but her comedic timing and delivery in both of those scenes was so perfectly executed that she effortlessly stole both of them. I did not enjoy Knocked Up as much as I did 40-Year-Old Virgin, partly because 40 had the amazing Steve Carell, partly because it bothered me that one of the final revelations of the film comes about because of mind-altering substances (not pot, but something else). I almost felt cheated, but I was quickly carried away from that feeling when I got sucked back into the story. If it weren't for the R rating, this would almost be a wonderful family film - it's that good. Sweet, excellent, heartwarming, and charming, Knocked Up has me looking forward to Judd Apatow's next project all the more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Whether You Like This Movie Will Probably Depend On Your Age,"I saw this movie with a free movie pass the week before it was released to theaters and let's just say I am glad I did not have to pay to see it. I thought it was okay, not bad, not good, but sort of in the middle, hence the 5/10 rating. What I thought was funny is that all of the: ""This movie is Spectacular"" ""The Best Comedy in Years"" reviews were all coming from guys below the age of 30 or at least 35. While I must admit I am not a fan of the ""Crude Dude"" male humor we see in movies year after year I can usually put up with it. Is it me or is it a new trend in movies that men cannot be funny or comical unless they are making raunchy sex jokes, getting wasted and looking like complete buffoons? I can get into that kind of humor, but I am afraid this is Judd Apatows niche and sooner or later it will get old. The one thing I didn't like about this movie is that the women were made to seem like they had it together while the men were the ones with the problems.

A surprisingly effective mix of sweetness and crudity,"On paper, Knocked Up didn't sound like a great project. The finished product, on the other hand, manages, similarly to director Judd Apatow's previous film, The 40-Year Old Virgin, to transcend its puerile concept and become a comedy that entertains and moves in equal measure.The leading role is played by Seth Rogen, who famously said to Steve Carell (who appears as himself in a very irreverent, amusing scene) in Virgin: ""I am ugly as f*ck by traditional standards, but, I get with women."". His character in Knocked Up, Ben Stone, might agree with the first part of the statement, but certainly not with the second: in fact, he's been so obsessed with fulfilling his dream (he and his pals are working on a website which can tell you exactly at what point and for how long a famous actor or actress is naked in a movie) he hasn't even seen a woman in ages. Imagine his surprise, then, when he goes out for a drink and runs into Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a TV camerawoman who is about to get a promotion, and she accepts to spend the night with him. Only problem is, Ben's excessive eagerness leads him to misinterpret his partner's instructions about a condom, meaning that eight weeks later he gets a phone call from Alison who is in the titular condition and forces him to face his responsibilities.So far, so typical. But just like Kevin Smith, Apatow has a rare gift: he can alternate moments of pure crudity and reflections on deeper subjects without making the picture seem uneven. For every scene where Ben and his friends discuss things using extremely colorful expressions, there is a touching glimpse of the crisis that is going on between Alison's sister, played by the director's real-life wife Leslie Mann, and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd), whose bleak description of his feelings is worthy of Woody Allen: ""Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it doesn't last 22 minutes. It lasts forever."". Beyond the American Pie-style premise (albeit a more realistic one than that of Virgin) lies a daring, but also very funny, analysis of love, commitment, aging and the fear of remaining alone. Not bad for a filmmaker whose breakthrough feature had a tag-line that said ""The longer you wait, the harder it gets"" (Knocked Up's is even cheekier: ""A one-night stand to end all others"").As with The 40-Year Old Virgin, much of the fun derives from the cast: though it is unlikely he will be cast in more serious or mature roles, as was the case with Carell (Little Miss Sunshine), Rogen is a valuable addition to the new wave of emerging American comedians; Rudd develops the darker side he started showing in Virgin, confirming his status as a reliable dramatic counterpoint to the slapstick in Apatow's films, and his chemistry with Mann adds to their scenes' poignancy; and Heigl, best known for Grey's Anatomy, could easily become the new Cameron Diaz, using her looks but not depending on them (something that was actually discussed in an episode of Grey's) and proving, much more effectively than Reese Witherspoon, that not all blondes necessarily have to be stupid on camera, her performance being one of the smartest ever given by a female lead in a mainstream comedy.Ironically, the movie's only weakness is also shared with its predecessor: the running time. The film is never actually boring, but 129 minutes is a little too much even for something as funny as this, and there are a few scenes (the Vegas bit and the celebrity cameo montage most of all) that would have been better had they been shortened a bit. Overall, though, Knocked Up is the year's best US comedy so far, and further confirmation of the fact that Judd Apatow is a name that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Mel Brooks or Kevin Smith.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Knocked Me Over With Laughter!,"I believed that Hot Fuzz could not be topped this year, how completely wrong I turned out to be. Now my views on seeing Knocked Up were very mixed at times, despite the brilliant trailer and the great premise one thing still haunted me, and that thing is The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now for saying this I realise I am going to get quite a few peoples backs up, and I admit I am in the very small minority here, but the truth is that I didn't find 40 Year Old Virgin that great. I know shock horror! It was funny, I will give it that, and it helped launch Steve Carrel's career, a fact I am very grateful for, well until I saw Evan Almighty. But I just didn't find it as funny as I hoped and I found it very overrated by a lot of people. As a result of this I was praying that Knocked Up would be a bit different from 40 Year Old Virgin, or at least that I'd find it as good as the critics had made it out to be. Thankfully I did! I spent two hours last night in absolute hysterics because of how funny this movie turned out to be, and it was so funny that I am seeing it yet again tonight! The movie is funny and sweet blended together perfectly, the sentimentality factor does kick in eventually, but I didn't have a problem with it because it was executed so well. The cast is pitch perfect and hopefully this will launch Seth Rogen's career as 40 Year Old Virgin did for Steve Carrel.As I just said the cast of Knocked Up are absolutely perfect. Seth Rogen proves to be a great comedian in this movie and he's actually playing a believable character. Things he does and says are actually very believable, sure he comes across as a bumbling idiot at times, but in truth all he wants is fun out of life. Katherine Heigl does an equally as brilliant job as the lady who is Knocked Up, her character does seem a bit bitchy as the hormones kick in, but it was interesting for me to watch this as I went with another boy and two girls. Us two guys sat there and related completely to Ben, the girls on the other hand seemed to be more on the side of Alison. It was interesting as it obviously worked just as well for them as it did for us. The performances just seem very honest, and both characters, no matter how messed up their lives seem to become, both seem likable. When it comes to the sentimental scenes the performances make them work because the scenes seem sweeter than your average movie like this. But despite all my praise for these two the movie in my eyes belonged to one man, Paul Rudd. He gets all the best lines, well not all most of them. He features in most of the best scenes, most namely a magic mushroom sequences in Vegas that had me crying with laughter and a later one involving chairs that had me crying once again. His character once again is believable and his relationship with his slightly scary psychotic wife, played brilliantly by Leslie Mann, once again believable. All the supporting cast work well as well. I have to give a special mention to Jonah Hill who is hilarious in a later hospital sequence in the movie, and we will next be seeing in the brilliant looking Superbad, brought to us from the people who made Knocked Up!The comedy side of the movie is what makes this quite possibly the most brilliant movie of the year. Now 40 Year Old Virgin in my eyes relied for the most part on sex gags and Steve Carrel, which is understandable given the nature of its plot. However, after a while I found it all a little bit boring. Here while we get a hell of a lot of sex gags, all of which are superb, there are also a lot more of the smaller kind of jokes that are hilarious as well. This nice balance, as well as the balance with the more dramatic side, make this movie as great as it is. The Vegas sequence has to be my favourite scene from a movie this year, and there are a large variety of jokes to be found. One of my personal favourites involves the mis-spelling of coming which once again had me crying with laughter. The sequence where the couple meet and ""do the deed"" is also very well done and hilarious. The movie is just full of so many jokes that its impossible to pick up on them all in just one sitting, I guarantee you will laugh for the majority of this movie.So any faults? Some might question the length, hell I know I did when I saw it was a two hour running time before I went in. But surprisingly, for two hours this went very quick. This is unusual as in my eyes a two hour running time for a comedy is pretty much the death sentence for it. Fortunately the storyline works and the characters work so well that you don't care how long this is. This is the perfect date movie to be honest, it has the gags and humour for the guys, but the nice smaller romance stuff for the girls. It blends perfectly for a movie that is aimed at both sexes. In a year that I thought Bourne Ultimatum could not be topped as King of 2007, a small American comedy comes along and knocks it off its perch. This is a superb comedy here and I cannot wait to see it many times in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It is funny,"There are some genuinely funny scenes. Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Jonah Hill are simply hilarious. Kathereine Heigi looks gorgeous and plays her character beautifully. The overall film is a very smart film. The Jokes are not gross. This is a nice comedy film",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Why do we think this stuff is funny?,"Hollywood's formula for comedy today is, with few exceptions, a slap in the face to movie goers who actually have to pay to watch this drivel. It's pretty simple. The men,as always, have I.Q.'s less than 90 and operate under the belief that their behavior is appropriate for all situations, or worse yet, ""cute"" and endearing to the female of the species. The women, on the other hand, appear smart (well sort of), mature (but only in comparison to the men) and competent (but not for long!). However, this movie is an equal opportunity offender as the women quickly get dragged into the abyss and are exposed as facilitators of male behavior at best, or just ""part of the gang"" at worst. The story really doesn't matter because we'll be laughing too hard to keep up with any annoying details, plot points or nuance that could make this anywhere near an ""intelligent comedy."" And this, Hollywood informs us, makes for a great night at the movies and is, after all, what we want. And, for those who think that things are only funny when you're drunk or stoned and like their characters that way, Hollywood is right on the mark.Well, this one couldn't be more formulaic and touches all the bases. Our male lead is an immature, self-centered, 23 year old slacker who spends all his time (of course he has no job, what would be the fun in that?) smoking pot and watching porn. He is supported in this mindless endeavor by his equally hilarious roommates who deliver all the stoner and toilet humor we could want. Our female lead, is a smart, beautiful career woman who is quickly rendered incredible by actually falling for this loser who gets her (yes, you guessed it!) ""knocked up."" She soon looses her job and spends her time helping her boyfriend ""review"" adult movies proving, once again, that comedy is best when everybody gets stupid.And, you know what? The acting wasn't bad. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl did all they could with this stinker of a script. This movie puts to rest, once and for all, the question of which is worse: bad acting or bad writing. Unless you think there is an inherent humor in everybody ""gettin' stoopid,"" then there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. If, in reality, men were as childish as this and women fell for it, there would be no one laughing. But, I guess that's why they call it comedy and why humor means something different for everybody. But aren't there enough humorous situations in life that we could play on without having to resort to characterizing ourselves as idiots? This one does not pass the ""What Would The Aliens Think If They Saw This"" test.This movie may have made an attempt to touch on an appropriate subject: the choice to have a baby instead of an abortion. Of course, there's nothing ""funny"" about that so they glossed over it (in about 30 seconds of screen time) and concentrate instead on moronic humor and completely unbelievable human interaction that is all stupidity based. But that 30 seconds of screen time was enough to have the critics calling this mess a ""smart comedy.""The movie does succeed in making one (unintended) point: if people this irresponsible bring children into the world, we're all in trouble.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Realistic drama with some humour thrown in,"The premise of Knocked Up is pretty simple: unattractive slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets successful journalist Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and gets her pregnant. They struggle trying to get along romantically, while at the same time dealing with Alison's sister and brother-in-law, whose own problems affect their relationship.What struck me about the movie is despite its irreverent tone, and its obvious intention to be a comedy, it is really a realistic dramatic portrayal of two things: having a child after a one-night stand, and the tension of a romantic relationship between two people whose characters just don't fit.When I first saw the posters for the movie, I was not willing to give it a chance - I wasn't sure how they could pull off the concept without coming off as some stupid teenage boy-centric fantasy, and although 40-Year Old Virgin was funny, it did not really tackle any important issues.Knocked Up pleasantly surprised me by dealing with the issues it raises in a realistic way - to a point. I can't speak to dealing with sex during pregnancy, or parenting, but I know what it's like to have parents who do not get along but were thrown together by happenstance, and I have to say Knocked Up presents things pretty well. I could very well see my parents voicing a lot of the frustrations of Pete and Debbie, the hapless in-laws of Alison.It is this serious willingness to grapple with such difficult issues, in what is essential a comedic drama, that makes me give Knocked Up so high marks. Its brand of humour for me was really the sideshow to the more interesting story of how the characters deal with the situations life has handed them.One thing I had trouble grasping, though, was how easily the movie brushes aside the subject of abortion. I personally believe abortion is wrong, but I understand why people would want it as an option, and the movie simply does not deal with the subject adequately - Alison never has a good reason not to abort - in fact she has all the reasons to terminate the pregnancy - but yet she decides to keep the baby. This is obviously necessary for the plot, but the lack of explanation makes it a bit of a startling loose end.If you want sex and humour, without a serious message or theme, Knocked Up won't be your cup of tea. But if you can handle the movie's irreverence and want a movie that positively addresses real problems, Knocked Up is a movie you should see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
wasn't what I was expecting,"I just got home from a special preview/Q&A with the cast in Melbourne.Being a huge fan of the previous Judd Apatow films, I could hardly write this movie off. It wasn't as much of a laugh-fest as his previous shows, and I've been told its cause I'm not a young man. If you are just after laughs I would point you in the direction of 'The 40-year old Virgin' before this.But I did appreciate it. I don't think its as implausible as some people here think that a smart, gorgeous career oriented woman could fall for a 'chubby loser'. Yes, the character of Ben is a complete pot-head, porno obsessed idiot at times, but his heart is in the right place and he assumes responsibility when its needed. And Seth, being a great comedy actor, makes that work - he's a real talent.So, close - but no cigar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious!,"This is one of the better comedies of 2007. There is nothing wrong with this film. For a comedy, this movie is a little long. But, you will feel these hours fly by.

"Reaches a new low in ""entertainment""","Let me state from the onset that I don't fit the demographics that this movie surely was aimed at. It saddens and shocks me that so many ""twenty-somethings"" rated this film highly and actually found something in it to enjoy. That hints at only one thing to me: the decline in our expectation and discernment of quality entertainment. To my credit and happiness, I waited till the movie was released on DVD before wasting my money on it. Even though I found more to enjoy and less to be annoyed with in Apetow's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", something just told me that this movie ""experience"" wasn't going to be the same. And, oh boy was I right! This movie was lamely written, poorly cast and, ineptly directed. It was juvenile, low-brow (at it's worst and devalued), uninspired and, overly stereotypical. By the time the tasteless and unthoughtful joke at Stephen Hawking's expense reeled by the screen I had already given up hope but with that, I was most definitely DONE. Within 30 minutes of the film, I was already successfully predicting the next scene's dialog and the ending of the film.

Great romantic-comedy,"Rated R for Sexual Content,Language and Drug Use. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI just got back from seeing Knocked Up.I wanted to see this movie a while ago but I saw Live Free Or Die Hard instead.Its a good thing the movie was still playing at my local movie theater.I loved The 40 Year Old Virgin.I thought it was one of if not the funniest movie of 2005.There were only about six other people in the theater when I went to see it.Anyway on to the movie.Knocked Up is a fairly good romantic-comedy film.I think its a tad overrated but its probably one of the best romantic-comedies of the year.I preferred the 40 Year Old Virgin.Knocked Up is about a man named Ben Stone who is basically a party animal who smokes weed and hangs out with his friends.Meanwhile there's Allison who interviews celebrities.One day to celebrate Allison's promotion, her and her sister go to a club where she meets Ben.The two talk, get drunk and have sex.Eight weeks later however, Allison becomes pregnant.So now Ben must give up his partying lifestyle to try and be a good father.Knocked Up is a good film with some very funny parts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vulgar and unfunny,"This film was totally unfunny, crude and vulgar. It would have been half as long if the scriptwriters had taken out all the swearing. Most scenes had Seth swearing or both of the women screeching and swearing, both of which was totally unnecessary. The situation could have been handled with humour but the way it was handled in this film was gross. Why did his friends need to have pink eye, it was obviously so they could make a crude joke. I am amazed that an actor of Paul Rudd's ability signed up to be in this childish rubbish. If this is what Hollywood decides the audience wants to see then it is a shame. It aims at the lowest common denominator and I don't think that I will bother to see anything that has Seth's name on it again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Settling is funny,"Judd Apatow is something of a contemporary creative hero. He is a man who works within a rigid system and delivers consistently hilarious fare that manages to remain oddly honest and revealing. The director of THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN returns this summer with KNOCKED UP, a comedy about dealing with the unexpected that lives up to all its expectations. After one night of drunken, messy sex, Alison and Ben (Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen) find themselves in a situation many have found themselves in before, pregnant. Alison is fresh from a promotion while Ben is busy doing nothing at all. Neither expected to see the other ever again, much less raise a child together. This is horrible timing for both of them but both must learn that nothing makes two people grow up faster than having a baby. And what do two grown-ups do when faced with a less than ideal scenario like this one? Why they give up on looking for love and force a relationship to form between each other for the sake of their child and in the interest of being responsible human beings. The idea that they could actually be successful is hilarious enough in itself.Apatow sets us up from the start. We meet Ben in the middle of a stoned back yard boxing match of enormous proportions. Moments later, we meet Alison waking to her alarm so that she can prepare for her responsible day as a functional member of society. They meet each other in a bar later that day. Alison is there to celebrate her promotion and Ben is there to drink. Alison is young and vibrant; Ben is a pudgy stoner. He is not without charm but social hierarchies would keep him way out of her league. And so KNOCKED UP begins its journey into the male fantasy. In this fantasy, a male nobody can get with a female somebody with absolutely no explanation that would give it any sort of rational sense. Without it though, there would be no premise to develop. Further to this, Alison decides that she and Ben should do their best to be together. This successful woman who already has a supportive family that could help her through her pregnancy and raise the child suddenly sees no chance of finding her own happiness and learns to settle.Are you laughing yet? C'mon, this is funny stuff. The funniest thing about KNOCKED UP is that it actually is funny. Heigl and Rogen both turn in fantastic performances that will certainly leave audiences wanting even more of them. They are also surrounded by a number of supporting players who may be one-sided but make the most of their limited depth. On Alison's side, Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd play Alison's sister and her husband. They too found themselves unexpectedly pregnant when they were younger and decided to take a shot at happiness together. Only, all these years later, he makes excuses to be out of the house to clear his head and she doesn't trust that he's being faithful. On Ben's side, he's got a pack of stoner buddies (Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill and Martin Starr) who help him keep it real. They also stop him from becoming the man he needs to be if he's going to be a good father. Where Apatow's talent steps in is in making all of this symbolism apparent without being the least bit obvious or overwrought. The entire cast is clearly having a blast with their characters and with each other, making it impossible not to laugh along with them. There are also more pop culture references than you can shake a ""Gilmore Girls"" series finale at.Despite all their chemistry though, Heigl and Rogen never fully convince me that they have actually fallen in love. Sure they each learn a thing or two about themselves and how to be better to each other but in the end, Apatow does more damage than good. One walks away from KNOCKED UP thinking that a baby can bring people together or save a relationship. One also walks away thinking that to grow up means to leave your dreams and frivolity behind you, to settle in to a potential life of boredom and disappointment. Finally, and fortunately for all involved, one also walks away from KNOCKED UP laughing one's ass off and not caring one bit about convention and the dangers that stem from it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A dream cast of the new generation of comedy,"Comedy has basically fallen into three categories these days. There's the family friendly light comedies such as any of the crap Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy have done in the past 10 years, there's the moronic comedies with people like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, and there's the gross-out comedies. That's why it's so refreshing when a comedy comes along that is geared for adults. 40 Year-Old Virgin was a great recent example, and now the same team has returned with another success, Knocked Up.Based on the subject matter, language, and content, it's definitely for adults, but it doesn't need to resort to gross-outs for cheap laughs. The film has some real laugh-out-loud moments and is consistently entertaining for all of its two-hour-plus running time. While the second hour doesn't quite live up to the first, as it started to remind me more of Nine Months than 40 year-Old Virgin - not just the subject, but its tone and plot as well - it was still thoroughly entertaining. It manages to be be funny in all the right (and wrong) ways, but still ends up being a sweet film with real heart.The one thing that really makes the film work is the cast. Heck, even Ryan Seacrest made me laugh in his one scene. The group assembled here is like a dream team of the new generation of comedy - all very new up-and-coming talents (with the exception of Paul Rudd, who is only recently getting the attention and acclaim he deserves): Seth Rogen, Rudd, Jason Segal, Jonah Hill, Alan Tudyk, Kristen Wiig & Bill Hader (the only actually talented members of SNL these days), and several others from director Apatow's Freaks & Geeks and Undeclared. As a matter of fact, you could pretty much play the ""One Degree of Judd Apatow"" game with the whole cast. Practically everyone from the two fore-mentioned shows makes an appearance, as well as people from 40 Year-Old Virgin, and even the director's own wife and kids play substantial supporting roles in the film.I really hope this group continues to churn out more films, as they are far superior to the ""frat pack"" that seems to be considered the top of comedy right now - Ben Stiller, the Wilson brothers, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn (though I like some of his stuff)...

extreme right wing propaganda film,"I am shocked at all of the hidden messages. This movie should have been shown at the Republican convention. First message is that pretty white girls are taken advantage of by illegal aliens. The producers make it subtle by have the Seth Rogan character be a Canadian, but why make it a point at all. Note that the illegal alien is an unemployed pot smoker, who has no job and spends his day watching porn. Oh and he lives off of a recovery from a personal injury settlement. Suck up to the Insurance industry. So Rogan meets up with a squeaky clean American girl and gets her drunk and has sex. Of course in Conservative world, sex must always be punished in this case by the girl getting pregnant.And even though she has the ""dream job"" of being on television interviewing ""celebrities"" like Ryan Seacrest, she wouldn't dream of an abortion. Instead in the right nutjob world, being forced to become a parent forces the illegal alien, unemployed, porn watching slacker to become a responsible citizen. We all know if we outlawed abortion, it would make every lowlife into super dad/successful citizen.

Knocked Up Follows New Comedies Superbly!,"Knocked Up is very much like it's predecessors 40 Year Old Virgin and Anchor Man, it is a new comedy with a unique style in sense of humor and plot development. A very important part of this movie being satisfying and above all VERY funny, is that it is not your classic ""girl gets hit in the face"" ""rob Schneider falls everywhere"" ""Eddie Murphy gets put in bad situation"" etc, it's NEW and it's unique in it's style. While being such a clever comedy with numerous pop culture references and intelligent humor, Knocked Up also boasts a fantastic storyline and pacing, with GOOD actors. Each and every character in Knocked Up is very believable, some of the best acting I have seen this year for sure.Not to mention, the soundtrack is clean as well. The vast amount of stoner humor is definitely a plus all in it's own just because if you smoke weed, you will automatically extremely relate to Ben's roommates in the movie. The settings and costumes are very realistic and nice to the eyes as well. The clothing and styles of the characters definitely caught my attention as being very thought out and smooth. But, my favorite theme of this movie was probably the fact that the ""hero"" of the story, Ben, is not your typical good-looking, I-can-handle-anything persona, he is just like you and I: a complete underdog and a complete nerd.Cheers for Knocked Up breaking the slapstick comedy trend that has plagued modern cinema. I hope to see more movies from this wonderful director. This is a very realistic movie which I think made it so appealing to me, I feel like I have met many of the characters in real life - thats how good they are! GO see this NOW!

The way comedies are,"In the land of Hollywood, good and worthwhile comedies seem hard to produce, but watching Appatow's serial comedy hits after resisting watching them for a long time makes me wonder why that is.Appatow does comedies that have two things that seem simple enough to get: an working concept and character driven comedy. Not mindless gags of fart and sex(even tough they're also included), but instead a free for all tale of people that slide over a very earthly subject-in this case, unplanned pregnancy-with a light treatment where depression and pessimist will not have their way. Where the mood should be serious, Appatow takes it maturely in an amusing way. Where the mood should be goofy, he shocks us by making us realize there's more than just funny under the hood of his films.Seth Rogen may look fat and hopeless in this movie, but Appatow will never let him be shrug of as a nuisance to be done with. Ever since ""Freaks and Geeks"" he shows us that everyone has problems, but no one has unique problems; he wants to tell us that we all swim in the same pool, even if at different depths in different times. For that alone, his movies will always be gold in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Warm-hearted comedy,"A warm-hearted and good-natured romantic comedy with just enough off-beat moments to keep the viewer entertained. Rather long and occasionally in your face (a moment of crowning glory in fact) but so suffused with family values so as to placate the most disapproving moralist. It's nice to see the leading man as an overweight slob, but the morality of the piece means that his love affair with the beautiful subject of his one night stand will bring out his better aspects. The American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists might take umbrage at the portrayal of some of their members but it is hard too see anyone else being offended by this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Its not as good as 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' but still a great follow up,"I really did find film funny but its not quite as good or funny than 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' but still its hilarious and does show off Judd Apatow's talent. It's a good movie, it's a solid movie with clever writing and even better comedy. This is an unoriginal story line but it has a charm to it that looks past that. The film does drag in some parts in the middle but still you will be laughing half its running time. Seth Rogen is very funny with Paul Rudd, good performances and a good time all around. There are some parts that are kinda hard to watch because it so real and a little true real but still as I said its a great follow up to 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and if you liked that you will enjoy this quite a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Lame Comedy, Clichéd Drama","The inexplicable premise here is that a pretty and successful young woman chooses to have a one-night stand with an overweight, unemployed, pot-smoking doofus. Not only that, but after becoming pregnant, she wants to spend eternity with this loser. Furthermore, rather than being thankful for having snared a babe who's clearly out of his league, the unattractive slob lashes out at her. Although marketed as a comedy, the film really strives to be a penetrating and touching drama about relationships, but fails miserably due to stereotyped characters and a clichéd plot. Apatow's idea of humor is to insert the f-word into every line of dialog. Comedy or drama, the excessive length makes it drag.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""I Didn't Read The Baby Books! Hilarious!","This was such a funny somewhat relatable movie if you're expecting a child that is.

What I like about this is its not just about comedy it dives deeper into the issues nee parents are facing in this day and age and I think it was a great movie, a great peformance and a great awareness shown the message was clear and perfect, I actually saw this many years ago but I felt it deserved a review for the outrageous comedy it shows as well as the deeper message.Highly recommend it really is an entertaining watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Feel Good Fun......,"I went to see an advanced screening of 'Knocked Up' about a week before it opened across all of the cinemas. I must say that I was quite impressed with the film overall. WIth my new system of rating movies, I wish to rate this movie:Plot: 8/10 = Pregnancy is not a topic that is frequently featured in films in this day and age, either as the main plot device or just in a sub story, and I was impressed to see that such a subjective and life changing subject was present on the screen. The scenario of that fateful night between Ben (Seth Rogen) and that chick from 'Gray's Anatomy' (sorry I forgot her name :P) was very well written and should be commended.Acting: 9/10 = I rate this element very highly. All of the characters contributed greatly and the acting did not flounder once throughout the entire movie.Dialogue: 10/10 = Pure genius. Whoever came up with the lines is a pure genius. The script flowed surprisingly well with the plot. The pop culture references in addition to various perks, including Paul Rudd's hilarious facial expression of Robert De Niro was totally classy.Cinematography: 7 = Not bad. The main settings were just the houses that they lived in, but it showed the varying lifestyles of the two main characters.Soundtrack: 7 = I enjoyed most of the songs during the film. Although it would have been nice to have a very loud track during the labour scene :(Mean Score - 8.2 Overall Rating: 8/10An impressive movie which exceeded my expectations. It is definitely worth a look. My girlfriend and I were in hysterics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Fable of Modern Immaturity,"It's a beautiful moment when a 14 year old can sit can watch a movie like this with his 51 year old mother and have the two of us laughing our asses off. These twenty year old's show the kind of behavior seen in my school, but it shows that boys can be men too. Suddenly Alice Cooper's ""I'm Eighteen"" makes sense. I myself didn't care for the 40 Year Old Virgin. I thought it was just kind of bland and didn't have the charm that was expected. But ""Knocked Up"" struck gold with me. I was cracking up constantly for the first half of it, and though the laughs died down a bit in the middle, I was still entranced by it and stayed that for the remainder of the film. What's interesting is how Apatow took such an unoriginal plot line and just made it shine (hey that rhymed). This is a movie that will truly lift your spirits regardless of whether you buy your ticket as a student or a senior. This is one of the best comedies to come out in a long time.

"Yuk, Yuk, Yuk and Yuk","Shallow, exploitative towards men, dull. But I have a question. Why do so many writers in sit-coms, commercials, comedy movies want to make men look so stupid and like such jerks? I think men and women everywhere are hungry to see strong, competent men (even when they are funny). Sit-coms have stopped standing for ""situation comedies"" and have instead focused all their humor towards making men look stupid and like jerks. Is it because the writers are incompetent or do they really think that men are like that? I think it's because they have been led to believe that they are, and I even think men no longer see themselves as strong and competent. Can't we have some writing that finds humor in the situation? We find ourselves in funny situations all the time. ""40-Year Old Virgin"" was in the same genre, written to make men look stupid.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly good movie.,"Movie deals with serious subjects. Seth Rogen and Catherine Heigl excel. Both give strong performances. This movie is worth watching. This movie shows how people who otherwise have nothing to do with each other form a bond and become the roles that they are playing. What begins as a charade becomes something real and strong.

It was amazing. There was stuff for the girls and guys. It managed to pack in sex, lots of cursing crude disgusting jokes( which was my favorite parts, made me laugh my ass off) and nudity and still managed too put in a healthy amount of drama and heart. But the heart wasn't forced in like any other comedy, it was real. And the sisters side story is a good add on for the girls.

HATED this movie,"This movie was a huge disappointment. Are we to believe that a beautiful, successful woman like Alison would ever give the time of day to someone like Ben? Ben was portrayed as the biggest loser of all time; fat, lazy, broke, immature, crude, perverted, and lest we forget...arrogant despite these shortcomings! Why would she be attracted to him? Why would she attempt to have a relationship with him, even if she was carrying his child? She'd be better off as a single parent! This is the problem I had with this movie. I found Ben to be such a heinous sleaze-ball and for the life of me could not understand Alison's reason for keeping him around. What happened to chivalry? I would have loved to see Ben die in a fiery car wreck. A grenade through his window, detonating right in his fat face, would have also sufficed.

"A Crazy, Hilarious Comedy!!!","Knocked Up is a straight-out comedy with a hilarious screenplay that is filled with cultural references. The premise of the story is that two people hook up one night and it leads to an unwanted pregnancy. Due to the unwillingness of the mother to part with her baby, the two of them decide to give a shot at having an actual relationship which is what we see in the rest of the movie.Ben (Seth Rogen) is a slacker with no job who hangs around with a bunch of like-minded friends whose only ambition in life is to get high. Alison (Katherine Heigl) is the complete opposite of Ben with a settled life as an entertainment news reporter. Even though both of them cannot have more distinct personalities, they somehow manage to make things work.There is a wonderful support cast featuring Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and Jason Segel. All of the characters are well developed with Paul Rudd being exceptionally good.The minor hiccup in the movie is the development of Alison who is a contradiction. The story does take a lot of liberties when characters make some terrible judgments. However, as this is a comedy movie, we can cut the filmmakers some slack.Knocked Up manages to deal with the subject amiably without getting too preachy. If you want to enjoy a few laughs and see some terrific comedy actors, then this is the movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny, raunchy, and witty","Writer and director Judd Apatow's follow-up to 2005's ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" is, while not reaching the high earnestness of the film that basically launched Steve Carrell's leading man career, still a funny and affectionate movie.Here, Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a producer for E! who just got a promotion when the unexpected happens. He meets with Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), an indolent would-be internet businessman, in a bar. They get drunk, have sex, and before long she discovers she's pregnant.Lead stars Rogen and Heigl play their roles with spot-on effectiveness and aplomb. Rogen doesn't have the charisma of Carrell, nor is his character as lovable as the latter's Andy, but he provides enough likability and immaturity to his Ben that it's not a chore at all to invest on his character emotionally at the point the film requires the audience to do so. Heigl exudes the class and professionalism required of her character, and she shares a genuine chemistry with Rogen.All the while, Apatow's script and direction fill the film with plenty of raunchiness and wit. The comedy never fully resorts to mindless slapstick. The film does run a bit too long, but you might as well be amused you won't feel it. Besides, the movie overall feels sincere in addressing the issues it tackles it's easy not to feel dirty about it afterward.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
good old movie!,saw this movie yesterday.. quite funny and enjoyed a great deal. overall good acting my the main cast. although i suspect these things rarely happen in real life. .. like majority of the people would obviously abort after getting pregnant on a one night stand. my favourite person was of course the heroine who was pretty sensible and took responsibility in the end.. would suggest this movie to majority of ages as it a feel good movie of the good old times.. must watch for movie buffs who are into light hearted comedy .. throw in a bit of romance.. and then you have a international standard Hollywood movie! good viewing guys!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This movie is not a comedy, I didn't even laugh one time during this 2 hour + depressing hell. Acting is nothing special.. I just didn't care about the characters specially the supporting couple played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.. they are just not funny. Ben's friends are even worse: their 'jokes' are stupid pathetic and not funny at all.. the Steven Hawking joke is just sick. The plot is not very believable: Guys that get stoned all day do exist but I just don't find them funny and I don't think a girl would even try to have a family with them if she got pregnant on a silly one night stand... she would just run away and have the kid on her own.

Very Funny Movie,"I must admit, the premise of the movie was one thing that kept me away from watching this film. The idea of a one-night stand, and dealing with a pregnancy didn't seem to me good comedy, especially romantic comedy material. But I was wrong. The film is hilarious.. All the characters are likable, in their own way, smart, in their own way, funny, in their own way. Although I'm a guy, Heigl's character is probably the one I most identify with. The normal person in the land of misfits. The story is predictable,... they fall in love and raise a baby together...but surprisingly, the character development is strong between the four major characters, the minor characters are have some dimension to them. And there are some really funny moments... one of the funniest is the scene where Alison (very pregnant) and her sister try to get into the club and the doorman won't let them in...the speech the doorman gives to Alison as he pulls her aside is both touching and downright hilarious.

Dare I say one of the best comedies of our generation?,"It's true, I said it. I think this movie is a fine piece of work and should (and probably will) go down as one of the best and funniest movies of the decade (if not our generation).What makes this movie work so well is the writing and characters. You have Ben Stone, who is played wonderfully by Seth Rogen, who sits on his ass all day smoking weed and designing a website that shows you what time in a movie the female star shows some boobage. You also have Allison (Katherine Heigl) who is a successful 20 something that is more mature than Ben and just wants to try to make the relationship work out for the both of them and for the baby. Debbie and Pete (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, respectively) make up the ""main"" supporting cast. Debbie is Allison's sister who is a real bitch and who can't stand Allison to be with Ben. Pete is Debbie's husband, and he quickly forms a bond with Ben and they come to relate to each others' difficulties in kids and marriage. Every character is developed well, and most of them come out of this experience a new person.It is Ben's duty to mature throughout the film, and that is exactly what he does. It is great to see Ben become more adult as the film goes on, and for Allison to learn to appreciate him for what he is. It's a true and down to earth movie that doesn't give up on the laughs, either.The movie is quite crude and inappropriate, but by the end of the movie, some of the women in the crowd might have tears in their eyes and the film becomes more heartfelt. The genius of the movie is how Apatow can make you laugh so hard in one scene, but also have genuine feelings in the characters.It is Apatow's more mature work, because the film deals with the realities of marriage and friendships, and it plays it realistically. People change and grow, and in the film, the characters have real problems. That's what makes it so good. It is a hilarious and crude comedy, but underneath the characters have problems and it deals with real world difficulties.Unlike Virgin and Funny People, I didn't find the movie too long at all. Every scene was nicely timed, and I felt every scene deserved its place in the movie. The direction is great, as it is paced nicely and Apatow gives his performers enough room to go about their thing. He lets them party, but when he needs to them to act, he is able to get it out of them in a believable way.Knocked Up, which I think deep down is Apatow's most mature work, is also his best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Largely over rated,"Very decent romantic comedy. It has a bunch of stoner jokes that just aren't funny to me anymore, ""duuuuude"". They're just overused in bad movies. Most of the comedy was just cheesy and a few elements like the website and the phone call message never really got settled. Things just sort of speed up near the end to tie things together quickly and I didn't feel there were any significant plot twists or surprises that seemed creative. The reoccurring beard jokes introduced at the beginning got annoying because the guy is always serious and you can see them coming every time he appears on camera. The lame female boss got annoying rather than making me actually laugh. I've honestly met people like that.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Deserves Oscar for best movie...or at least most enjoyable,"This is a very very very funny film. I really can't say how funny it was. I'd have to include about 18 ""very""s which, as Ace Ventura said about three poisoned arrows, is ""too many"". Director and writer Judd Apatow has a unique and welcome take on comedy. He does not attempt to hew out its coarseness. All the sometimes gratuitous profanity which one might typically encounter in the course of a day is included in the movie and Apatow does not shy away from supposedly taboo or off-color topics. In so doing, Apatow and his talented cast have again struck a chord with people who appreciate the everyday nature of his movies.The heart of the movie is quite simple. An unlikely couple, after a little too much fun out, has sex and the woman becomes pregnant and the couple, the charming and beautiful Katherine Heigl as up-and-coming TV producer/host Alison Scott and the beefy and very funny writer/director Seth Rogen as laid-back stoner Ben Stone have to decide how they will proceed. First of all, will the child be aborted? Will Stone be involved in the child's upbringing? Will the couple marry? Will they stay together? This classic challenge makes for a rich vein of humor which Apatow mines very well. Apatow does not sugarcoat or mislead about the very real challenges facing this unlikely couple. But his characters seem so plausible and have such airs of reality about them that the challenges they encounter do not seem unreasonable. As said, his two co-stars are very talented.The one reservation I had about the plausibility of the film was the difference in their appearances. To be quite blunt, Alison is gorgeous and Ben is quite pedestrian looking. Of course, the reasons for which they were together tend to minimize the importance of that difference, but still and all, if couples who look so unconventional do exist, I have not seen them. That said, Heigl is very likable and one roots for her and Rogen delivers in spades on the promise of his one-liners and throwaway digs as one of Steve Carell's co-workers in The ""40 Year Old Virgin"". He improvises much of his work here, as do many of the actors. Rogen has an inventive comic mind which he used to help Sascha Baron Cohen work on ""Da Ali G Show"" and his quick mind is quite evident in this movie. Some of the best scenes are loosely written frameworks of scenes in which Ben and his goofy friends sit around and riff, in addition to scenes including both Rogen and Paul Rudd who is also clearly in his element improvising comedy. There are some other excellent performances, most notably Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife), as Alison's somewhat neurotic and insecure but protective older sister Debbie In particular, Jason Segel as perhaps the slickest of Ben's friends, Jason, a guy who is very smooth with the ladies in spite of his pedestrian looks. As mentioned, Rudd, as Debbie's music scout husband is also very, very good and seems to have developed a good collaborative relationship with Apatow, having worked with him on his last two movies.It will be interesting to see the success of future Apatow projects given his obvious abilities and accomplishments thus far and it will be an enjoyable anticipation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Heard of Romantic Comedy? How about Beautiful Comedy?,"I wouldn't want to emphasize this movie as being a romantic comedy because the romance part was too short.

Katherine Heigl's acting wasn't so bad either. Her years of acting experience really paid off.Overall, this movie is a very realistic comedy to the viewer. If anyone would've experience the same situation, it wouldn't be funny at all. Of course a movie can't be all so realistic. There are parts at Vegas and love making scene wasn't that convincing.

"Crude, lewd, who let the kids out?","I give it a 3 instead of a 0 because taken out of context there were some good jokes and signs of intelligence.Given the hype, I expected to laugh. I laughed like crazy thru Borat, Austin Powers movies, and other genuine comedies, but this movie was way disappointing for the following reasons, in order of importance:1. Implausible plot hinge -- no way would drop-dead gorgeous and high profile Alison keep the baby given Seth and his ridiculously comical slacker profile. How did this get past everyone involved in the film, from conception (pun intended)onward? Surely this was a nagging concern through script development and through actual filming, and it is essentially a death sentence for this film in terms of longevity in artistic merit (box office I don't care). I basically just watched the film for technical reasons after this fatal mistake. People who live in LA most of all should know that her decision to keep the pregnancy is absurd. It just doesn't make sense. They could have at least made her Mormon or Catholic or whatever, thrown in something that made it ""impossible"" socially, or morally, to have an abortion, but they went ahead with her just ""wanting to keep the baby"". What universe are critics living in?2. Gratuitous profanity. Unfricken believable. Ha ha. Especially where he cusses out the doctor for being at a bar mitzvah in SF when he really should be in LA (where way too many of these films are conveniently made)...and people thought that was funny? And the film-maker having his own 8 year-old-daughter say ""Everyone calls you a prick. What's a prick?"" I am politically progressive. I also have a 7 year old daughter. I cringed when I saw that, in the context of the whole movie. Does that make me an old fart?3. Cypher / cartoonish / cardboard-cutout / stereotypical characters. Nobody is really like those characters that Seth hangs out with (See implausible). Don't get me wrong. A movie can be implausible, in the sense that one suspends belief for some Deus ex machina type of trick (the existence of angels or Santa Claus) -- but the movie must flow off of that plausibly...the trouble with this film, is that there was NO reason that anyone with any intelligence would believe a woman deciding, with pseudo womanly emotions, to keep a baby fathered by this Seth guy. Or that Alison's sister would find Seth ""OK"". Or a lot of other things.4. It presents itself as a romantic comedy, but it's really a tween film, appealing to ""sophisticated"" 12-17 year old boys who legally aren't supposed to be seeing it, because of the R rating. Huh? Am I clueless to the hundreds of thousands of tween-mented grownups in this country?I live 600 miles north of Los Angeles. Perhaps as a garden variety citizen who loves a good movie but does not ""live and breathe"" them as apparently quite a few people do, I have failed to appreciate the special quality of this tree; but I would say no, that those who think this is a good movie are failing to see the health of the forest. They're so focused on the ""laughs"" for laughs sake, or the comic timing, or the editing technique, or simply comparing the film to other films, that they forget what movies are supposed to do.Finally, I really wanted to like the movie, and was looking forward to it, since romantic comedies are so hard to do well. But if this is what critics are hailing, we are in really desperate times in this country.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Knocked Up"" is a delightful gem of comedy, romance and drama!  One of the best films in years!","Judd Apatow, director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", has finally achieved something many modern comedic filmmakers attempt, and fail at fully attaining... He has crafted a silly, fun, touching and heartwarming movie that manages to deliver the goods ten-fold, with a tale that is relevant and astonishingly well-made.""Knocked Up"" tells the story of rising career-woman Alison (played by the very charming Katherine Heigl), whom has just been informed by her superiors that she is ready to do on-camera work. (She currently works as an assistant at the E! channel) With her sister Debbie (played by Leslie Mann, in a cute but feisty performance) by her side, she celebrates by going clubbing and having a fun time, as many would. However, on this fateful night, she meets the goof-ball Ben (played with perfection by Seth Rogan), an obnoxious but good-hearted slacker with no job, who lives with four stoner friends.Despite being polar opposites, the booze gets the better of them, and they end up in a one night stand. After having something of a falling out the next morning (Alison is slightly bothered by Ben's blunt, anything-goes attitude) they part ways.Some weeks later, Alison realizes she is pregnant, and the movie is off. After finding out, Ben goes through the round of emotions... He is angry... He is nervous... He worries... But he decides that it is his responsibility to help Alison, and support her decision to keep the baby.From there on in, it is a tale of companionship, romance and emotion... Ben and Alison slowly begin to fall in love with one another, but their circumstances (and misunderstandings) threaten to tear them apart. Interstingly, we also get a somewhat-similar parallel story happening, in which Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd), whom are married with children, go through a slew of emotions... the tolls of marriage looming over them.What makes the film work for me, and so many others who love it, is the fact that it all feels real to a degree. Unlike other comedies, which will exaggerate situations and jokes, everything feels natural in this film. I could honestly see this very story happening in real life... (Which it did, in part... As portions of the film were based on the pregnancy of Leslie Mann, whom is married to writer/director Apatow.) And the superb acting doesn't hurt, either. Rogan is charming as Ben, and you can clearly see he is struggling with his decisions... He obviously has a fairly good life, living with his best friends, his only work being the current construction of a pseudo-pornographic website... But he has to grow up.Heigle is also spectacular... She makes us feel for her in ways that many actresses cannot, and I suspect she is going to become one of the greatest young actresses of this time.Mann and Rudd are both a wonderful addition to the story, giving an interesting perspective on the situation by people who have ""been there, done that"" with kids and pregnancy, and the Debbie/Alison relationship fits right in, not feeling forced.And the comedy, though vulgar, is very funny, and never subtracts from the story.Finally, before I wrap up, let me just say that the small, cameo-esquire rolls by a number of pop-culture icons (including Ryan Seacrest in a hilarious rant) and the addition of Harold Ramis as Ben's father were nice touches.""Knocked Up"" is one of those rare films that will have you doubled-over from laughter consistently, while at the same time (and I'm sorry, I know I sound stupid saying this) tugging at you inside. It is a sweet portrayal of responsibility and love, and a rare treat.Plus, the hilarious gross-out and insult humor, and some brief instances of celebrity nudity (as seen on the guys' TV) doesn't hurt either.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Mimosa films like these,"This film is really emotional. It has comedy, drama, romance, all of it. The acting from Katherine heigl really stood out to me, she acted her part really well. So did Seth and all the other cast. You don't get films with this kinda vibe anymore, the vibe was chill in this movie but it also could be serious at times.

An interesting blend of comedy and sincerity.,"It has been about four years since Judd Apatow burst onto the mainstream scene as a comedic director with funnier and more touching things to say than practically anyone else out there. He made his mark with The 40-Year Old Virgin, but this is a more ambitious and sensitive film that is really unlike any other comedy. Apatow's discovery, Seth Rogen, is given free reign here to show off all his comedic chops as Ben Stone, a lazy slacker whose life consists of partying with his roommates and working on a nude alert website for movies. Katherine Heigel, in her break-out role, is very sweet and likable as Allison, a career girl focused on going nowhere but to the top.However, despite all that these two don't have in common, Apatow focuses more on what they do, and here they meet up at a club and realize that they both love to have a good time which is not limited to a one-night stand. Still, eight weeks later, Ben is shocked to hear from Allison and even more so when she tells him that she is pregnant and he is the father. From here on in, this is no longer you're typical comedy. Every scene with a funny line or situation is leveled with dialog that is serious and smart in nature. Watching this, it can be hard to understand why these people make some of the choices they do, but then you realize they are just like you.This is not as funny as The 40-Year Old Virgin, which itself was more straightforward in its crude and tasteless comedy. Here, Apatow shows his growth as a writer and director. He still has the ability to cast flawlessly with Heigel perfect as Allison, Paul Rudd sensational as Pete and his own wife, Leslie Mann, as Pete's wife Debbie. The real surprise, though, is Seth Rogen. He has such great timing, but his acting chops come alive here and he is given the ability to show that he is not just an actor for comedy but that he can take on any role and put his personal twist on it. I watched this in preparation for Apatow's third film, Funny People, and I only hope that it is as funny and sincere as his previous two films have been.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of seven signs of the apocalypse,"I could not laugh at all during this movie. I tried to get into it but couldn't. After maybe half an hour I couldn't stand it no more. And decided to go do laundry instead. At the laundromat in my mind.They must of picked the script off the floor and filmed it with their backs turned and their ears plugged.I'm also shocked so many people liked it. Further proof that I'm an alien from another planet.Seriously though, this movie sucks. If you like stereotypes and being able to follow the plot while going for bathroom breaks and making a 5 course meal and not losing anything in between this movie is for you.So much for modern humans wiping out the Neanderthals.

Best American comedy since Something About Mary,"This movie is absolutely hilarious, and sustains the comedy throughout, instead of getting sagged down in maudlin sappery as others in this genre are likely to do. The script is smart, with up-to-the-minute pop-culture references, and despite the somewhat amoral one-night-stand-cum-pregnancy premise and raunchy dialog, is surprisingly old-fashioned in its treatment of the romance between the main characters. There are also a number of other three-dimensional characters in the movie, each of whom is interesting in his or her own right, and comedic as well (especially Paul Judd's character), rather than dead weight or mere props. I hope this movie beats out Spiderman, Shrek, Pirates, et al as the box office king of the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pretty good,"I liked this movie but then again I knew I would a little because its basically from the same people that made The 40 Year Old Virgin and that movie was beyond hilarious especially the unrated version. This movie was pretty good though, Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd are outstandingly funny as always and Katherine Heigl does a pretty good job too even though it was a role that I never thought she would play. I thought the birth scene at the end was a bit gross, but i'm not sure if that was just in the unrated version or not. But altogether I give it an 8 out of 10 because its funny but its not The 40 Year Old Virgin.

OveR ate it  =),"KNOCKED UP 2007 (SETH ROGEN, KATHERINE HEIGL, PAUL RUDD) DIRECTED BY: JUDD APATOW ~ THE RUNDOWN: A generally distasteful comedy; 'Knocked Up' is too long, too unsuccessfully sentimental and the jokes are usually annoying, one-dimensional smart ass jokes...minus the smart. ~ You know when you're at dinner, or at a party or somewhere where people are talking and suddenly you get that strange, annoyed feeling when a couple idiots you may or may not know start quoting unfunny movie scenes line-by-line and arrogantly laughing at jokes nobody but the two of them find hilarious? Well, whether you realize it or not, 'Knocked Up' will probably leave you with that feeling. But don't worry, you're not a jackass for not jumping on the bandwagon. Here, Apatow's 'Freaks and Geeks' crowd seems to have a lot more fun than the alienated audience most of the time in this tedious, sad excuse for the '40 year old Virgin'. It's true, Apatow has shown nothing but brilliance in the past (huge Heavyweights fan...'Virgin','Freaks and Geeks','Dick and Jane'), but there's no doubt about it - he stumbles here when his usually dead-on, slightly satiric and easy-to-relate-to humor doesn't satisfy. Also, when was porn funny? Personally, I love porn. I am pro-porn all the way. But, Apatow, you need to check yo self...comedies aren't meant for epic proportions with running lengths exceeding two hours and intricately shot sex scenes. The critics may be falling for this stylized comedy sh i t, but you're not getting any brownie points from me. As for the acting: Rogen is good and kicks ass as a leading man, although I think it's safe to say he didn't have to do too much Deniro Method Acting for the role. Heigl was also good and convincing, as well as Starr, Segel and the rest of those guys. I gotta say though, Leslie Mann's crying was awful. I'm not a stickler when it comes to acting but she sucked and made a mockery of her scenes. Paul Rudd was pretty sh**ty too. Their performances were very predictable and, for me, didn't help to communicate any of the bs sentimentality. In fact, at times I felt like I was watching portions of a bad sitcom.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"'Knocked Up"" Gives Birth to A Great Movie","Knocked Up just may be the best film of the year. Why? Because it blends laughs (some of the funniest scenes in modern movie history) with drama (unsappy and heartfelt) better than any other movie in '07. You already know the plot. Ben (Seth Rogen, a breakout), a jobless slob, gets Allison (Katharine Heigl), a corporate ladder-climber, preggy. Hilarity ensues, as does thought, heart, and beauty. If you look through the maze of sex scenes and F-bombs, there are actually lessons to be learned from this film.

Mindlessly vulgar film like The 40-Year Old Virgin and not even funny,"It seems Hollywood is infatuated with Judd Apatow after the runaway success of that other movie, so they gave him another shot. The result is Knocked Up, and it's an abortion of the movie in comedy genre.The jokes are so shopworn and grotesquely vulgar it isn't funny. There are very few moments worth the barely audible chuckle, like a disabled parking spot cheat. I found the reference to Stephen Hawkings rather tasteless bordering on cruel. What, Judd doesn't have the genius level so he scoop low to the vulgar comedy of making fun of just about everyone and getting away with it?Katherine Heigl plays a convincing pretty woman and she nailed it -- she looks and sounds cute even when foul-mouthed. However, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and the fat roommate characters with the penchant for F-bombs are gratingly annoying -- so irritating they should be beaten up for scratching the chalk board with fingernails in terms of poor acting -- their grade school acting which prove this movie feeds on lowest common denominator mentality with infantile attitude and mindless profanity. The culprit is easy: Judd Apatow, deluded to believe that the more vulgar, the funnier it is. Quite the contrary. I'm not even a prude and I found ""Very Bad Things"" & ""Smokin' Ace"" hysterically funny.However, the point is, Judd Apatow writes so many throw-away jokes it gets boring, so he resorts to appallingly cruel jokes (xenophobic & sexist among other sacrileges) later in the movie. It's my deduction Judd is a depraved man with deep issues. What did Stephen Hawking do that compelled Mr. Apatow to write a shameless joke on his personal life and deriding achievement in advancing human knowledge? Mr. Apatow's mentality, like that of equally vicious & self-important comedians Sarah Silverman and Carlos Mencia ( George Carlin gets the pass because he's a genius without being needlessly malicious and cruel), may be childish, though it could be that he exhibits the characteristic trait of ""Peter Pan syndrome"" in slacker male characters, with which I might concur as I've had past roommates like that. Hollywood have proved it still deliver consistent quantity of trash for box office dollars sacrificing decency for cheap & vulgar preference. No wonder why parts of the world, particularly the Middle East outside of Israel, despise Hollywood in peddling propagandistic filth to condition North American audiences to accept the vulgar attitude and lifestyle.Why did Harold Ramis, the talented co-writer/actor in Ghostbuster movies and director of Groundhog Day, agree to a cameo in this movie? And why did Bennett Miller, who directed the well-made true crime debut movie Capote, agree to visit the set and tag along with the insanely profane Judd Apatow? (I saw ""Directing the Director"" extra and wasn't sure if it's an inside joke as the ending is obvious) Mind boggles.The ending credit with the photo gallery of the cast and crew members as real-life parents border on saccharinity for emotional manipulation, in light of the amazingly vulgar content of the movie. I find this hilariously ironic. Maybe exalting the distribution and production of child pornography should become an acceptable norm in future Hollywood productions to demonstrate the amoral perception of Hollywood producers.""Knocked Up"" is so pointlessly profane, lame, unfunny and treacly it's one of the few movies I had to take two ibuprofen pills afterwards. The ending in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was horrifically lame and contrived; Knocked Up is worse throughout. Don't bothering wasting a phony 3-dollar bill renting this despicably raunchy movie, it's more like primetime Cinemax/Showtime comedy variety that emphasize excessive vulgarity over quality.Simply put, Judd Apatow is a hack of comedy genre like Michael Bay is a hack of the action genre.* out of four",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great film and realistic in many ways,I saw the film years ago when it came out but it was on TV tonight and got my full attention once again. Everyone acts really well and you care for the characters. The only person i.e. Debbie (played by Leslie Mann) is nasty and mean to her husband played by Paul Rudd (a consistently great actor). Debbie's character grated on me because of constant insults and disses of her husband. Leslie Mann impresses as entirely comfortable playing the b_tch that it makes it seem perhaps she is like that in real life as well. Undoubtedly Leslie Mann is an excellent actress. She is married to Judd Apatow who directed the film. Judd clearly has a deft hand directing. I can't think of a film he's directed that didn't impress me except perhaps Pineapple Express which I felt bordered more on a Larry David kind of sensibility.Undoubtedly Knocked Up is an excellent film and I was most impressed by the delivery scene in which the character played by Seth Rogen comes into his own.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Judd Apatow: The Man of Fun,"Picture a passionate sceneA guy and a girl are about to have sex and he's having troubles with his condom; he can't seem to be able to put it on. The girl says: ""Just do it already"". Maybe a normal guy would interpret the phrase as what it means, but not Ben Stone (Seth Rogen): he throws the condom to the floorAnd he gets Alison (Katherine Heigl) pregnant.I haven't laughed so hard with a movie since I don't know when. ""Knocked Up"" is a romantic comedy unlike any romantic comedy and better than the average romantic comedy. The reason? I would have to say Judd Apatow: the guy who gave ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" its few laughs, the writer/director of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and the mastermind behind this. Apatow really knows how to have fun. Characters the same names as the actors who play them, freshness in each scene, unexpected comedic resolutions during typical moments; that is all Apatow.Take this for example, continuing with what I wrote in the first paragraph. Alison and Ben wake up after having sex and leave the house for breakfast. They encounter Alison's sister Debbie (a brilliant Leslie Mann) and his husband Pete (a brilliant Paul Rudd) with their two little kids. ""Don't ever do what they just did"", Pete tells his four-year-old daughter. ""I'm gonna do it"", she answers. Or another scene where Debbie thinks Pete is cheating on her; finds an address and goes there with Ben and Alison to check it out. She's angry, and as soon as she leaves the car, Ben asks Alison: ""Is she carrying a gun?"".The audience doesn't expect these lines and the laughs flow naturally. If they are improvised or not is unimportant; what matters is that Apatow is directing them and allows their inclusion in the film. If there's one problem with ""Knocked Up"" is that it runs a little bit long, but it doesn't make it worse than the wonder it is.It is a wonder because in its long duration, it manages to combine comedy, drama and romance in an enviable way. It's not always the most active movie, but it doesn't have to be; it's not always funny and sometimes it is when it's not supposed to; it's romantic in the most classic way and it's helped by a classic plot line with zero surprises. However, in all this predictable plot line, ""Knocked Up"" has a quality that only few comedies achieve: it knows its time(s).Besides, it creates its own language and it makes us part of it very quickly; it takes the chance to be critical about the Hollywood Business with intelligent humor. But most importantly (and this was also palpable in ""The 40 Yea Old Virgin""), and as another rare characteristic, it truly cares for its characters who are interesting, flawed and real human beings.Seth Rogen constructs a lovable creature, like one of those big bears you want to hug, surpassing the promise he showed in 'Virgin'; while Katherine Heigl looks more beautiful than in ""Grey's Anatomy"" and creates a completely different and believable character from her Izzie Stevens. When I wrote about 'Virgin' I said Apatow was more a planner than a directorHe still is, if we consider Eric Edward's cinematography, with very little creativity.But the directing side of Apatow comes to light from another side: from the double sense of names (Ben Stone; you'll see once you're inside the movie), from little posters in rooms and books in bookstores and photographs and references that seem to declare his inspirations. Then, we can see him through these things. We can see the man behind the camera, and let me tell you it's a good place the one where he comes from.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Entertaining and rewarding adult Rom-com,"Hilarious tale of the misadventures of an average Joe after a one night stand culminates in pregnancy, this is a major step forward from Apatow's directorial debut 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' in my opinion. More so than his closely related peers' the Farrelly brothers and Kevin Smith, Apatow walks the line between sentimentality and crudeness so easily he practically dances across it. It's about time films as R rated as this could be commercial successes. Although future performances have shown him to be slightly one-dimensional Seth Rogen stands out here as someone so average and lazy that he has been living off an insurance claim for five years. In a film where every support character steals most of the scenes they're in - Jason Segel being overly sleazy towards Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill getting pink eye, Craig Robinson declaring that Mann is 'Old as f**k' and Heigl is 'pregnant as f**k', as excuses for them being denied entry into a nightclub - it speaks volumes that we still remember Heigl and Rogen afterwards; Heigl propelling herself to the top of the Hollywood female Rom-com list. After the initial dent in the narrative equilibrium Apatow eases into what he does best in creating a very satisfying 'bromance' between Rogen and a superb Paul Rudd, the latter seemingly improving with each new role. This somewhat subtracts slightly from the central romance but nevertheless where the plot seems to stutter the laughs never do and ultimately most will be won over straight away or converted at some stage as the it heaves its way towards an amiable, if slightly predictable denouement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A film that shows life in a complete,"Anyone who gives this movie a bad rating is a Mormon, I swear to you. I hate being prejudice like that, but there are just some very unhappy, terrified people in this world.I am frustrated. I believe this is by far the best DRAMODY in the history of cinema. (Also I'm majoring in filmmaking, so am very into the art of it.) If you are the church-going, one track mind type, and you live your life being offended by every sex reference you hear, this is not the movie for you. I was raised in a very intelligent, loving family of doctors and credential college and high school teachers. I have been taught, PEACE, love, and human nature by some very smart people that I guarantee you are far from anything close to the devil. Being written by Utah Entertainment, I'm sure many Mormons have seen this movie and are the ones giving it bad reviews, because of it's raunchiness. DO NOT GET THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT THESE LOW REVIEWS, unless of course you are one of those people. If you understand why South Park is so genius, as my family does, you will love this movie. (I do happen to also know some people who don't care for South Park who loved this film.) I would say this film would be loved by ages 15-75 (yes my Grandma liked this movie, a lot.) You would pretty much have to be someone who is totally freaked out about the world and think you were going to hell if you like a movie with premarital sex, drugs, and vulgar language in order to be turned off by this film. I AM TELLING YOU I could list two dozen very intelligent people that loved this movie. These are people who have very good paying jobs, who are happy, peaceful, and high on life; not burnouts or delinquent teenagers. The people who do not understand this film are strictly those who are afraid of the world, which I'm sure you've come across plenty of them. They are the types of people who are 'happy' but when you get to know them, they're not really happy, they're terrified. This is a very well written, intelligent piece of art. I promise it will bring you many laughs, and a warmed heart. This is a beautiful portrait of life, love, laughter, friendship, and everything in between. Don't even pay attention to the low ratings/reviews, watch the movie; it's very raunchy so of course there's those people who will be offended. If you are one of those people, then don't watch it.

She is having a baby,"Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow make a film about relationships and pregnancy as slacker Rogen knocks up Entertainment reporter Heigl.

The men act liked doped up adolescents with an interest in building a website that points out when the actors get naked in movies yet in the film Heigl always has sex with her bra on.However as a comedy the film is less successful, it failed to even make me chuckle slightly, its also overlong when it should had been snappier and I never really bought the relationship between Heigl and Rogen as a couple who would ever get together for a one night stand, never mind be with each other whilst she is expecting.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good acting, bad premise","Katherine Heigl is awesome in this movie, but her character is a pure joke. - Can anyone believe that a seemingly intelligent woman really fall for the stupidity of marrying a complete loser?

She must be a hardcore Republican not to abort in this situation.Single mothers are the worst kind of ... I don't even have a word for it that doesn't have a negative connotation. It's too illiberal to abandon all your responsibilities and just pop out something she doesn't even know what's going to be.Perhaps for this generation it means only career endings, for the child to be born, it can be ghetto, it can be drugs - serious drugs, it can be theft, burglary, rape, murder and all kinds of downfalls. Why? Because the mother didn't bring the innocent baby to a world with the maturity to take care of it.Has anyone ever thought about why in general the more babies in the family the poorer it is? Because it's usually those who cannot give enough support of their offspring that decide/ or be forced to have lots of children. Of course one can say that some well-off families have a couple of more children than average, but they are able to provide.I'm from poor poor poor poor China. Ever wondered why it's like this? Hasn't it always been a rich country? Because in the past few decades they encouraged every woman to have 6, 7, 8 or even 15 children. They can't find enough food, so one generation was devastated. Then there came a second, a third - and very soon it's like what it is today. Of course there're regulations nowadays, but it's more like guidelines 'cause even in China you can't just kill anyone (unlike the majority of Americans think).The world will become Africa very soon if we keep having babies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Genius in story telling/ Honest driven storyline,"This movie was excellent. Just in the way that EVERY character spoke their minds about everything. They wrote this movie perfectly! Seth said the things that every man in his situation THINKS at those times. From talking about having sex again after he finds out she is pregnant to the argument with the bouncer, the actors really put it out there. The movie was about TRUTH. It could maybe be called LIAR LIAR II it was so honest and straightforward with situations and responses. For those who are too sensitive for this movie (I can't believe some comments I read below) and it's 'no beating around the bush' technique's in humor, go watch some PC rated G comedy like ... actually don't know any :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Comedy Classic,"I Just saw this Movie and just like 40-Year old Virgin this movie is Funny.With Good Acting,Interesting Plot and Brilliant Performances.the movie is About slacker Ben Stone who plays a pot-head slacker who is going no where in life and tries to make a stupid website with his pot-head friends.then there's Allison Scott who works a E! entertainment and is now becoming a host.after getting her promotion she and her sister Debbie go out to celebrate.They go to a club and Allison meets Ben.at first they have a five minute talk, soon enough Allison and Ben are drunk they leave the club and go to Ben's house and they have sex but Ben can't put his condom on so he has sex with her without the condom.The next day Allison throws up at work and finds out she's pregnant.She then tells Ben at first he's shock of the outcome but agrees to help Allison to raise the baby.so now Ben has responsibility to help Allison raise the baby and gets ready for fatherhood.first I tell you one thing even though it's a comedy it still has a message that not everything in life is what you expect and that all slacker dads should raise there child.as for the acting and the cast of characters it great.Seth Rogen character is since he's the main character he's the most developed.at first he's lazy slacker later in the film he gets his life straight and gets a job and a house for himself and Allison and the baby.Plus his character is more funnier than his role from the 40-year old Virgin.Katherine Heigl who plays Allison is a hard-working woman but now has to go though the fact that she is having a baby.even she's somewhat underdeveloped still she gives a good performance.Lislie Mann who plays Debbie Allison sister tries to help Allison with her baby but goes through a lot of things that even though she's hot but is getting older and starts to wonder if her husband is cheating at her at all or even cares about her or her children at all.Paul Rudd Plays Pete Debbie's Husband who is probably the funniest character out of the cast with his insulting jokes and his impersonation of Robert De niro are laugh out loud.he also goes though stress at home with his wife and kids.and goes out several times to stay away from his family.as for the rest of the cast they do good of what there giving work with.but another standout character would have to be Ben's Dad played by Harold Ramis even though his performance is short his acting performance was great and funnier than any of the supporting characters Except for Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd.as for that I suggest you should see this movie you'll laugh out loud, and enjoy the movie.so go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Knocked Up"" and out...of 2 hours I'll never get back","I feel it is my duty as a proactive thinker and cinema fan to level some serious complaints against the unfunny, un-moving, un-touching, un-realistic farce of a farce called ""Knocked Up."" I know film does not need a basis in realism, but when critics hail a film for its sense of 'accuracy' in real-life terms, I carry a whisper of that with me into the theater, whether it is comedy, drama, horror, or avant-garde surrealism. That ""Knocked Up"" has a 92% 'fresh' rating at RottenTomatoes implies one of two things: 1) that film critics need to leave their homes/apartments once in a while and experience life outside the vicarious lens of cinema; or 2) that said critics, in their bubble of maintaining a bar by which the public sets their tastes by, are very out-of-touch with humor derived from real-life situations (a possible 3) is that the other summer comedy offerings are simply so bottom-of-the-barrel that this looks brilliant by comparison).Or perhaps it's because writer/director Judd Apatow is just so ""hot"" right now--hey, he made ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (which I loved, by the way), and ""Knocked Up"" can only be as good, if not better! Right?!? Well, NO. ""Virgin"" was not a solitary Apatow effort; in the co-writer's chair was the very funny and talented Steve Carrel (who has successfully picked up the Comedy Crown once held by James Carrey), and after seeing ""Knocked Up,"" you can almost tell where the Apatow/Carrel script gradations occur (Apatow: the bar/pick-up scenes; Carrel: the whole of Andy Stitzer). ""Virgin"" had a strong anchor in Carrel, who also hit the right notes of depression, anxiety, joy, and sarcasm in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" In ""Knocked,"" Seth Rogen (a funny supporting character in ""Virgin"") shows no leading-man quality, even in the 'unlikely' way the film laboriously sets up; Katherine Heigl, the E! producer (yeah, very realistic, isn't it) to whom he does the titular deed, brings nothing exceptional out of his character, since her character is also a shallow, contrived cliché (and certainly acted as one).Like an extended sitcom (Apatow worked in television before becoming a Hollywood hitmaker), ""Knocked Up"" writhes in textbook stereotypes, clichés, and generalizations. As other critics have keenly pointed out, Heigl's 'attraction' to Rogen is a Screen writing 101 contrivance, and the film ultimately gives us no satisfactory justification for this relationship (of course, the film progresses under the 'realistic' pretense that we should not care about such unimportant details). Does it even need saying that this unlikely couple will try to make things work, have some arguments, and wind up together as Better People in the end? Countless films with predictable structures have held my interest better than ""Knocked Up,"" through innovations in character, dialog, or simply plot twists.I kept wondering, as the audience broke out into roars of laughter, if there was something I was missing. For the record, I am a 26-year old, single white male, and I do have a sense of humor. My mind cycled through potential audiences for ""Knocked Up"": married couples, people in long-term relationships, parents, and...potheads. While it is Apatow's clear intent to have me rolling in the aisles with every stale-in-five-years pop-culture reference (of which there are many, camouflaged as 'punchlines' to 'jokes'), I came to the conclusion that, if nothing else, I should be LOLing at Rogen's pathetic roommates. You see, they want to start a website displaying video clips of celebrity nudity (any Howard Stern listener will see this unfunny 'punchline' coming from the get-go)! They all get pink-eye! They make Taliban jokes about a roommate who's agreed to a beard-bet! And, they...smoke lots of pot! In another movie, these gags may have worked, but Apatow's method is to just have the audience gawk, expecting the sheer simple overstatement to elicit impressed guffaws. Tenacious D invoked that type of humor in a more creative and FUNNY way last year, but their movie tanked (explains a lot, doesn't it?).While I sat waiting for ""Knocked Up"" to unveil some revelation about existence that I was somehow missing, I could only come to one conclusion as the credits began rolling: audiences and critics alike want their 'realistic comedy' coated in an impenetrable layer of super-sweet sitcom frosting. Oh, yeah, and for the slob hero to 'change' so he can earn the affections of a girl who looks like Barbie. LMFAO.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An very humorous look at relationship dynamics at two very different stages of a relationship,"Obviously inspired at least in part by the hit Indian comedy Salaam Namaste, but taken to the limits of bad taste that only an American comedy can. This is better-acted and has a better portrayal of the dynamics of a married couple in crisis and some genuinely funny moments. Rather than just focus on the challenges faced in the relationship between Alison and Ben, it also gives a well-written insight into the interplay between individuals in a relationship that has matured, but the individuals within it are not fulfilled. A couple of the dialogues between Debbie and Pete are absolutely classic. Ben's friends provided some additional comic relief and its good to see that the likes of James Franco haven't forgotten their roots. However, I'm not so sure that it merits being listed in the top 250 movies of all time though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sophomoric,"There were some great one-liners in the move but the writing was basically very weak. The writer used the ""F Bomb"" to excess and this illustrated a sophomoric sense for script writing. Also, the male lead, Ben Stone played by Seth Rogin,ending up with the female lead, Alison Scott played by Katherine Heigl, reminded be of another movie, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" in that the lead role ended up with someone way out of their league, ie. Seth Rogin, aka, Ben Stone, could never, repeat NEVER, get a girl like Katherine Heigl, a.k.a. Alison Scott. Of course the premise being that when one is drunk they lose their common sense. Believe me, NO women gets drunk enough to sleep with Seth Rogin. Although I found a lot of laughs in the movie, I also thought the use of vulgarities to be excessive and offensive. It's sort of like when you go see a stand-up comedian live, you know right away if he's got great material by not only the laughs he receives but also the number of curse words he uses, i.e., if he has to use a lot of curse words it means he probably depends on the words to prop up an otherwise humorless routine.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Knockout!  One of the Summer's Best,"Director Judd Apatow knows how to get the audience's attention with sexual titles such as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and this movie, ""Knocked Up!"" He specializes in raunchy, foul-mouthed comedies that don't resort to external gross-out humor a la ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Wedding Crashers"" with talented frat packers like Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson. Right now on my mind, speaking of such, how about a movie getting back Stiller with Cameron Diaz and she gets to work with Wilson, someone she never worked with yet. These two guys could play men in love with her, fighting over her, with uproarious results. Wouldn't that be a riot?But getting back to Apatow and his own style of comedy, he has a wonderful troupe of sarcastic actors - Seth Rogen, his real-life wife, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, to name a few - lending a hand to the leading lady, Katherine Heigl of ""Grey's Anatomy"" fame. And like ""Virgin,"" the themes are love, sex, family, and laughing with groups of good friends, something we can all relate to.The title tells all - Two yuppies - Rogen, an internet nerd accompanied by his buddies, and Heigl, a promoted TV network reporter accompanied with her older married sister Mann, meet in a bar, and without thinking about it, have a one-night stand. Both agree to keep the baby and become devoted parents. They are confused about how to maintain the relationship, and in some parts, are not so sure whether they want to stay together. But all works out, and baby is born. Watch for hilarious cameos by Joanna Kerns as Heigl's Mom and legendary funnyman Harold Ramis as Rogen's Dad.This is a fresh summer movie where the audience laughs themselves silly. You can laugh so hard you won't be able to hear the lines. This is my blurb - Get Knocked Out at Knocked Up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ughhh,"I should smack myself for expecting more than what I got, and that is saying a lot considering I lowered my expectations, a lot, of what I expected from this movie. I wasn't expecting North by northwest with this one that much is certain. I figured if I got a movie like Dodgeball which is lowbrow, but still funny, I would be happy. Boy were my expectations too high.The movie was aimed at 15 year olds and people who still think they are 15 years old and it showed. The story progressed exactly as you would think it would, no surprises there, but the part I found really surprising was the dialog was actually more embarrassing then it was funny. None of the characters were enduring in the slightest other than Katherine Heigl's, and even then it wasn't enough to save this movie. Also, the movie is riddled with excessive drug use for absolutely no reason other than to get the ""stoner"" laugh.I was so disenfranchised at the midpoint of the movie that I spent money to come see this I almost had to force myself to laugh at the few things that actually did make me laugh. Even still, the next day, I am really disappointed with this movie and that is still with the extremely low expectations I had going into it.Go see Shrek, PotC or Spiderman 3 if you haven't saw either of those yet, they are light-years ahead of this garbage.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"hat rare thing, a modern Hollywood comedy with a heart","Much like Judd Apatow's preceding film 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', this takes a silly high concept Hollywood idea (slacker slob impregnates upper class hottie, and in spite of all odds they have the baby and fall in love), injects it with both high and low-brow humor, pathos, good acting, and real insight. Seth Rogan is terrific, but so is Catherine Heigel, Paul Rudd, and everyone in the big supporting cast.On second viewing I experienced it as having more heart but fewer laughs than I remembered - an OK trade off. Also, a couple of plot jumps bugged me a bit more - the fact that abortion is never even really considered or even discussed feels like a dodge, and the transition of this unlikely twosome into a couple, even an awkward one feels a bit quickly skipped over for a film that runs over 2 hours. But neither of those points are enough to really hurt a sweet and wonderful character comedy.Side note: I saw the 129 min theatrical version the 1st time around and the 133 min version on the blu-ray the 2nd.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"the world is waiting for Apatow and co. to fail, but they will have to wait a little longer.","Knocked Up, the new movie from 40 Year Old Virgin co writer Judd Apatow and first time leading male Seth Rogen has received many plaudits in recent months, and therefore, many will be cynical upon entering. But they needn't be, because Knocked Up is a hilarious, emotive and sharply written romantic comedy that manages to avoid all the overwrought clichés of the genre by introducing the spanner in the works of an unexpected pregnancy to the newly acquainted couples lives. Firstly, Knocked Up is hysterical. Apatow's willingness to let his actors improvise gives the dialogue a sense of realism, the punch lines are numerous, unrelenting, and the sub plots of Ben's house mates and Pete and Debbie's marriage ensure the laughs are ever present. However, what justifies the hyperbole surrounding this seemingly average comedy is the storyline. During Knocked Up, the viewer is never left with the feeling that, (unlike Dodgeball, Wedding Crashers or Talladega Knights) the story is superfluous to the jokes, simply a platform for a group of predetermined one liners. Put simply, if you removed the jokes from Knocked Up, there would still be a worthwhile movie, one with themes of accepting the ones we love for who they are, maturing to provide a role model for our children, loss of youth, how random and insignificant events can change our life ""plans"", and the ugliness women feel during pregnancy. This is not to say Knocked Up is a perfect film, occasionally characters or sub plots are introduced too quickly, so that jokes don't have the full impact, or characters actions seem irrational (for example Pete's sneaking out on Debbie, we knew they were arguing but not really why, a simple scene showing them arguing would have been helpful). But this is understandable, seeing as though Knocked Up is a long film for a comedy, which is not a criticism, there is never a moment in the film that the viewer is bored, but at 124 minutes, it is easy to see how Apatow would have been stretched to find time to fit in these scenes. This, though, is simply nit picking in a film that successfully manages to bridge the gap between gross out teen flick and mature, bitter sweet romantic comedy. A film, which contains more laughs, a better storyline, and a sweeter relationship between its lead couple than the more anticipated comedy of the summer, the Simpsons Movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Judd Apatow created another comedy that will be remembered and talked about for years to come - its funny and well cast, no jokes fall flat","Seth Rogen stars in the lead role, I won't lie that's the main reason why I watched this comedy.

Judd Apatow is a pure genius in the comedy genre, making hilarious and incredible comedy films. Knocked Up deserves all the critical acclaim it got. Apatow wrote, co-produced and directed the film, it's very much a Judd Apatow film which is a always a good thing. The writing is extraordinary and the trust he has given the actors makes for some fantastic and hilarious improvised lines, pure comedic gold. It's also nice to see Seth Rogen in a role like this, interesting as he have said he doesn't want children, his and Katherine Heigl were some of the highlights in terms of drama. What I found interesting about the characters were how well written and flawed they were, but likeable non the less, mostly because of their performances.Village Voice said it perfectly ""Ultimately, what makes Knocked Up a terrific film--one of the year's best, easily--is its relaxed, shaggy vibe; if it feels improvised in places, that's because Apatow trusts his actors enough to let them make it up as they go, like the people they're playing""I didn't expect Knocked Up to be this good, it was probably one of the best comedies I have seen. The concept wasn't really that original but Judd Apatow went with something common and made it his own, creating a memorable romantic comedy that's truly worth watching at least once but I'm sure I'll be coming back to this film.

Knocked out,"Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a slacker who represents many of the problems with society today yet somehow he's supposed to be a good, sensitive guy. He has sex with a drunk Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), impregnating her and putting the narrative proper into motion. His only means of support for the baby are a get rich quick scheme. This scheme is a website that tells its patrons what part of a movie naked women are in. Even with this disgusting idea, he bullies the aesthetics of others by putting down Steely Dan to his pal Pete (Paul Rudd). Writer and Director Judd Apatow might get male bonding between Ben and his friends as well as Pete and Ben right, but the female characters are treated less equitably. Alison's girlfriend Debbie (Leslie Mann) is portrayed as a controlling bitch and Ben tells her to get out of the room after arriving late to his baby's birth. Even Heigl criticized the film for its taut misogyny. Pete points out late in the movie that marriage is like ""a long episode of Everybody Loves Raymond, except without all the pissy dialogue.""

Quite possibly the most overrated movie in film history....,"When I heard about this film, I really had no desire to see it. Then seeing that it was one of the best reviewed films ever on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to see why many of the nation's critics were proclaiming this film to be a major masterpiece, on line with some of the greatest comedies ever committed to celluloid. Normally, when a film has a 90 percent approval on Rotten Tomatoes, I am suspicious. The vulgarity of the film doesn't bother me. The childishness of most of the main characters doesn't bother me. What deeply offends me is the preposterousness of the main story. These 2 characters would never get together in real life, only in a contrived, forced feel good movie such as this. This is another variation on stoner slob ""regular"" guy meets impossibly beautiful woman, and they get it on. Hollywood is probably to blame for bad relationships across the board in this country because of films like this. In reality, if a woman got pregnant by a guy like this, she would either have the baby on her own, or more likely, procure an abortion (probably the latter). It feels like that cliché that the ""couple should stay together for the kids"", which in the long run hurts the children. In reality, the woman would have woken up the next morning, realised she made a mistake, and would have taken care of it.The film does have some funny moments. I especially like Ryan Seacrest, who is actually the funniest thing in the film. There's a scene where Seth tokes on a bong with a gas mask on, which I found to be cool. And some of Seth's friends repartee is amusing, though not incredible sweet, touching, and hilarious as the critics are trying to make us believe. It boggles the mind that the critics would make this film sound like a masterpiece. Maybe Judd Apatow is a really cool guy and treats critics well. Or maybe our standards are pretty abysmal right now, so a mediocre film like this gets raised to the level of Duck Soup and Lawrence of Arabia.Overall, there's a few funny bits here and there, but the main story is so preposterous it's insulting.

This movie also explores the depth of self-eating that often happens with women also thanks to the movie industry. Alison, once pregnant, feels fat and ugly and calls herself a big whale, Debbie is crying all the time because she feels old and guard at the club confirms that. Both wear make up all the time and have perfect hairstyles 24/7. It makes sense because if you are so self-insecure about your looks, don't you dare sleeping without lipstick otherwise your partner will leave you. 2007 is all about objectifying women.And this whole story lasts for two hours. You hope it will unfold sometime and you will die laughing, but instead you can't help but check your phone hundred times during the movie. I'm not trying to preach here on how this movie sends a bad message, I'm not trying to be a feminist, I just like honest movies, which are believable and make sense.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Seth Rogen plays an underachieving stoner...good to see him branching out.,"Seth Rogen is courageously cast against type to portray an underachieving slacker in the role of a lifetime in Knocked Up. For accepting such a risky role and giving a performance that ranks with the likes of Olivier in Hamlet, Mr Rogen was unsurprisingly awarded his first of many Oscars....oops sorry! Well, at least he was nominated....oops sorry!",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This Movie JUST WASTING TIME,"This movie is stupid, i saw the rating at IMDb, and all about it is fake the acting is bad, the woman is like bit*h,the guy is like she male don't watch it. i've watch this Movie in one hour, and that was so boring, and then i shut it off, but in 10 minutes, i've watch it again, 10 minutes before end, i shut it off again, cause the movie was very very very boringI was uncomfortable through out this film, having to watch stereotype after stereotype, mean-spirited ""jokes"" and juvenile toilet humour. Let's look at the good:Leslie Mann: Her shallow, annoying character was played very well by Ms. Mann; and by the end, she was even somewhat sympathetic. Harold Ramis: His two-minute scene was the ONLY truly likable character in this entire film. I loved him. Paul Rudd: Despite his woe-begone fatalistically brow-beaten character, Rudd was genuinely good. Too bad his character was ""resigned"" to what looked like a life not worth living.This film wasn't completely unfunny. Some of the scenes with the Hollywood execs. played quite well by Kristin Wiig and Alan Tudyk, were humorous. ""This is Hollywood. We don't like liars here..."".",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't waste your time with this junk,"This movie was a f*****g piece of sh*t.Jokes weren't funny at all. Acting was crap. The story was more of a ""college level"" with dudes, smoking weed, and racist, sexual, non-funny sh*t.I even watched the bonus material.""Directing the Director"" showed me that the director of ""Capote"" supervised Judd Appatow, the director of this movie.Wow, there you see why a movie needs only ONE director, not two....But I think this was all staged.

This movie was awful!,"I have never seen such a mind-numbing movie like this one. Just because we have survived ""Jackass"" and ""the simple life"" does not mean that we have to get this served in Hollywood movies too. I was getting ready to watch a movie with humor and cliché scenes where also expected. But instead I had a very unpleasant surprise coming.Knocked up is not your average girlie funny move which we love to watch once in a while.The whole movie contained foul language and bigotry. You have to be a slow thinker not to seize the hidden ciphers in this movie. The little girl in the movie are blood fond. And the character looking like a middle easterner being used as a punching bag to make fun of middle easterners and their religion was mind-shocking . unfortunately to see Katherine Heigl play in this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is no 40 year old virgin,"I realise they are two very different films, but the anticipation i had waiting to see this film because i enjoyed the 40 year old virgin so much meant i had high hopes.i was really disappointed, it went on far to long with too few laughs.i realise a lot of it was improvised, the dialogue in the main just wasn't that funny, they rambled through scenes filling in time, like a really bad whose line is it anyway (improv comedy series on channel 4 1980's).its a shame, cos i'd heard such good reviews, i'm just glad i rented it and didn't buy it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You cannot be serious,"I've always trusted IMDb.com as a reliable judge of a film's quality - the higher the rating, the better the film, and vice versa. I am staggered.. no, blown away by how far off the mark you are with ""Knocked Up"".. for this dire piece of clap-trap to achieve above 7 is a complete mystery to me. Without wishing to go into too detailed an analysis as to why this film is simply abhorrent, I would list the three main failings as these1) the premise is simply not believable; that a woman like this would attempt to form a relationship with such an obvious loser simply because she mistakenly became pregnant with his child.. this isn't stretching credulity, this is akin to asking people to believe the moon is made of cheese..2) it is impossible to empathise with ANY of the characters (even the children are odious)3) is this extreme level of profanity truly necessary? I'm surprised the baby didn't say ""F*** this"" when it popped out at the end..What a truly execrable and miserable excuse for a film. Seth Hogan did his best and Katherine Heigl was occasionally endearingly vulnerable, but I simply fail to see how this film is any higher than a 5, and that would be generous.IMDb...... you have let your readers down on this one. Do NOT see this film!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Depressing, Disturbing Movie","This is the second of the Judd Apatow movie's I've seen, the first being ""40 Year Old Virgin""; of the two, this was the more depressing and gut-wrenching of the two. Above all, this movie symbolizes the loss of individuality and freedom for the conformity of married life. The movie was full of too many dramatic, serious moments, and not nearly goofy enough. The raunchy toilet humor was totally out of place in what was an otherwise tragic story.This movie presents a very grim view of married life and interpersonal relationships between men and women. One feels very sorry for the brother-in-law of the pregnant woman, who only desires some alone time from his nagging, unbearable shrew of a wife; and yet, we're supposed to buy the fact that he's going to crawl back to her as a devoted husband? What's more, Heigl's character is willing to go through with pregnancy with Rogen's irresponsible shlub? The pairing in the movie is one of a cycle of bickering and forgiveness, with no end in sight. The bickering isn't even funny, like the kind you see in ""Married With Children"" or ""War of the Roses""; it's rather creepy, especially with the fact that Rogen's character takes it all in stride and responds with fawning affection. One can smell the train wreck of a relationship that's coming, and it won't be funny in the least.One can criticize this movie for its theme of a libertine man trading in his life for responsibility and domestic bliss. He is forced into a politically correct mold which gives this film a flavor of the generic and mainstream. Apatow does not seem interested in going against the grain; he is content to please mainstream America with a happily-ever-after of a sappy love story of a fawning husband and his demanding wife. This is not a goofy parody or tongue-in-cheek approach: Apatow is content to shove the idea of Rogen being a ""changed man"" down our gullets, until we see him as following the straight-and-narrow path to pleasing his rather demanding girlfriend.This movie follows the formula of using toilet humor paradoxically interspliced with mainstream morality. Sure, we may chuckle at stoners giving each other ""pink eye"", or playing murderball in wheelchairs; but that's a given in any mainstream comedy nowadays. This movie dares not even mention the word ""abortion"" by name; even if one is morally opposed to the idea of an abortion, and sees it as evil, the word can at least be mentioned. This seems like an act of cowardice in the scriptwriter's part.In short, the movie is not goofy or silly enough to warrant a recommendation. It takes its message far too seriously, and presents a view of life between men and women which will make one pine for a bachelor's life forever.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Insultingly ridiculous premise custom-made for the adolescent  man.,"As many reviewers have already stated, this movie is based on a premise that is incredibly unbelievable, even for a comedy, even for an Apatow comedy. At least in The 40 Year Old Virgin, you could kind of barely understand the appeal of the main character. Not here. Ben is a little too realistically lame to be funny or sympathetic. The movie shares space in that uncanny valley that ""King of the Hill"" occupies, where you realize with slowly growing horror that thousands of emotionally and intellectually stunted ""men"" like these characters exist. Although the movie makes light fun of their lifestyle, it ultimately excuses and justifies it. And so we reach the crux of the problem:I don't care how drunk she gets, an intelligent, attractive, successful woman is not going to sleep with Ben, ever, to say nothing of not having an abortion if she were to become impregnated with his loser-spawn. Movies like this are comfort food for teens and man-children who shirk responsibility and spout lazy profanity all day because they have nothing interesting to say. I'm sure that if I were thirteen again, I would find the constant use of the F-word, homophobic jokes, and ""stoned guys think everything is funny"" scenes to be works of comic brilliance, but it all sounds pretty trite to my ancient 29 year old ears.I liked Mallrats, Austin Powers, even Dodgeball and Zoolander. I have no problems laughing at a low-brow comedy, even profanity if it is used in interesting ways, but screenwriters need to stop insulting the intelligence and judgment of their female characters. If the movie poked fun at its own stupidity with more vigor or provided some meaningful character development, it would be less of an issue, but the tone jerks violently back and forth in a half-hearted effort to shoehorn some kind of life lesson into its ludicrous plot.The end result of this bipolar sitcomminess is that the target audiences leave with the suspicion that their fruitless, ignorant lives are actually not so bad. After all, a heterosexual relationship with a beautiful woman and the miracle of childbirth are all it takes to turn everything around. Why waste time maturing into a decent, intelligent, tolerant, productive member of society? That's so lame. Just let your brain idle in that adolescent sweet-spot and fantasize about having sex with every attractive woman you see without ever taking the time to actually get to know one. Your penis will work its mysterious magic, and presto! you shall become a man. This is not a helpful message for the already ignorant youth of America.Even if you thought The Forty Year Old Virgin was a work of genius, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed by this one. However, if you thought Wedding Crashers was hilarious, this will be right up your alley. Of course, if you happen to be a lazy slob with a dead-end job who hangs out all day gaming and getting high with equally brainless companions, maybe this movie will bring you some misguided hope that a wonderful woman you don't deserve will decide to clean up your life for you just because you're so damn irresistible... or maybe you'll be depressed about how ridiculous and unfunny it all is and just want your money back.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Movie with bad message!,"Ugh...I absolutely detest movies that give the message - ""It's okay to be a slacker as long as you're a nice person ultimately things will be all fine and dandy"". Most romcoms cater to the female fantasy where a man with the killer combination of looks, smarts and riches falls for the girl next door damsel in distress and sweeps her off her feet. This is a romcom catering to men, where a hot, successful woman falls for an ugly, good-for-nothing slacker. Not only am I not in the target audience (I am a woman), but the realization that the movie attempts to manipulate the viewer into liking it (through aforementioned pandering to base male fantasies) makes me hate the movie even more. The jokes are terrible (and I am saying this as someone who can handle crude humor pretty well), acting lame and the plot absolutely unbelievable, except that this movie isn't pitched as a fantasy. I give it 2/10, and I am being generous.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Long,"First of all, it should be noted that the Heigl-Rogen hardly works and there is little chemistry between their characters, which is pretty bad in the first place.But the most annoying thing is that, like always with Judd Apatow, Knocked Up lasts more than two hours, when clearly there wasn't enough material to do so. Just by reducing the film to a 1h45 cut for example, it would have gained consistency and interest, because the good lines, the interesting passages and the funny scenes are embedded in the mass.And it's a shame because the potential was there, whether dramatic or comic, but one can't stop wondering why the director persists in not doing more restrictive cuts that would hugely improve his movies.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
this requires a strong tolerance of low culture,"If you've seen any of Seth Rogen's movies, then you should know that he always plays a laid-back goof-off whose life revolves around getting high. Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" is no exception. I thought that the funniest scenes were the ones where Katherine Heigl's go-getter meets Seth Rogen's slacker friends. This story of an unexpected pregnancy makes no pretense about being completely silly.As to Heigl's claims that the movie was sexist, I can see where she's coming from. According to the movie, men are degenerate morons who want to sit around getting stoned, while women are sexy, ambitious types who snap easily. There's no shortage of movies that depict that, and I wouldn't say that ""Knocked Up"" casts aspersions on anyone.The main point to take is that Seth Rogen revels in low culture. You can bet money that his next movie will cast him as a stoner who talks about sexual organs and bodily functions all day. As for the widespread dislike of Katherine Heigl, it seems misplaced. She strikes me as an obnoxious individual, but is she really a worse person than, say, the Koch brothers?I liked ""Knocked Up"", but it won't be for everyone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Knocked Up a Bore,"knocked up was a big disappointment after having many many people tell me it was better than 40 Year Old Virgin. KU seemed like a SNL skit gone wrong, the first few minutes were good the rest was boring. The few funny moments in KU are provided by the stoner crew, they seem to be a less funny knock off of cheech and chong or harold and kumar but without them KU would have about 30 seconds of funny material. Don't believe your friends when they tell you ku was tons better than 40 year old virgin or wedding crashers don't believe them, ku is a terrible movie, I give it a 3 out of 10 stars, I would have given it one star but I save that for horrible movies like scarface.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a reason to not hate himself,"Seth Rogen is a unattractive, short, non-funny character* that uses his mediocre success to lure a beautiful talented actress (wearing a pregnancy vest... obviously to make the act of intercourse (or so he wishes) a bit more bearable) into making a unfulfilled rotten fantasy come true.

don't go thinking your going to see a comedy,"When I went to see this movie I was expecting a comedy similar to the 40 year old version. it was not. Maybe the 40 year old version wasn't as funny as I thought. Maybe it was just Steve Carrel carrying the movie. Basically the cast in Knocked up is exactly the same at the 40 year old Virgin with the notable missing Steve Carrell. Seth Rogan can't carry this movie. I see him more as a sidekick or a buddy, but definitely not a leading man.I thought the first 45 minutes of the movie was funny, but I literally stopped laughing after that. It wasn't serious, it wasn't cute, and it definitely wasn't funny. I'm not sure what to classify this movie as, other than just plain 'bad.' Don't waste your money on this one.

A Loser Movie for Losers,I'd give this a 0 if it were possible. What is really disturbing is that there is such a large audience of people who really thought this movie--any of it--was funny. I would grant that men--and I use that term loosely--between the ages of 13 and 30 who were real losers would like this movie because they would think it might be possible for them to live a life of bongs and bangs forever with no responsibility because the main character seems to have managed to do it. I can't imagine any female liking this--it is offensive and makes marriage and having children seem like some kind of life-in-death from the mind of Samuel Taylor Coleridge--only without his actual writing skills. I think generally that the reliance on the f--- word for comedy is inversely proportional to the writer's actual skill.

A Really Rotten Movie,"We really liked American Pie but this is absolute garbage. I found myself wondering who is paying for the ""good"" reviews we read. Really, just watch the first 10 minutes or so if you must, but otherwise do not waste your time with this movie.Something is inherently wrong when people find humor in a bright, attractive woman getting so drunk she makes it with a total drug using slob. And talk about a movie sending all the wrong messages to young people about safe sex and drug use! I can only imagine how many STD's she would be infected with in real life with her behavior.We get most of our movies from Netflix, including this one and there are hundreds of much better movies available, including many foreign movies which would be more entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Such a shame,"Wasn't looking forward to this film anyway as I know from the description it's not my kind of thing at all. However, after first 15 minutes was pleasantly surprised and to my horror was quite enjoying it. The main protagonists had a good chemistry in the fact that they're at opposite ends of the spectrum and was funny to see Ben's comments. However, all starts to turn sour with this film once we hit 40-45 minutes. What was once a decent light comedy with a serious side... turns into a dull , predictable rom/com without the com or the rom in fact hahaha... it's literally a dreary hour that somehow just turns into a meadrama and loses ALL interest. Ben and Alison are now just going through the motions and there's no light relief...In fact I can say I've never been so bored with a film ever, which was a shame as upto 45 minutes, it was certainly a decent 6/10 simply because of some great one liners from Ben... however, it's like the makers have got to the half way point and thought, lets make a serious film?

"wow, disgusting foul and RAWNESS at its finest","Another movie to add to the ""Insulting women"" of the decade award. The competition is getting stiff! there's a lot...thank you judd apatow and all the others like him, what a positive contribution they make... Jesus... I am able to laugh at a good movie. Well, I didn't laugh and this movie was NOT good. It sucked rocks. I am so unbelievably surprised at what a high rating such a crap movie got. Seriously??...I mean really? Are people paid to rate this high or something? speaking of high, maybe thats why the rating, cause the only comprehendable reason to me for rating this anything over a 1 would be if I got together with those bong smoking losers and took a hit. WOW, I literally had my mouth hanging open at the non stop vulgar language (no one talks like that, come on) the over the top sexual content and constant boob shots (give me a break, what are we 13?) and the continuous drug jokes and references. I guess if I was a couch surfing, stoner, that dropped out of school and couldn't get laid so I hung around seedy strip bars oggling strange women like a pathetic nasty perv, then I could see appreciating this movie because of the relation. But being a self respecting adult that believes I have the maturity higher than a teen and not the reading comprehension of a ten year old, I didn't find this movie to be my style. Completely grossed out by it. Kathryn Heigl what the F_ck were you thinking taking this role?? its beneath you WOW I cant even look at you the same anymore. A movie is really bad when you actually lose respect for an actor. The other actors, not surprised, they are losers. But she was a shock and partly why I saw this.
