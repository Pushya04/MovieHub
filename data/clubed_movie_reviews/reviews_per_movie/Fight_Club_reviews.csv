HOW THIS IS NOT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE MOVIE IS BESIDE ME,"I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.I saw it again when I was 13 and just started seeing movies for what they were - a language. A language through which the filmmakers interpret their own views on the world. I understood more of it, especially being part of ""the middle children of history"" generation.After that, I saw it at least once per year and every single time, I realized something new or different about it, and the world itself. I grew with this movie both intellectually and spiritually.Still took me another 12 years to understand this movie is THE textbook for Jungian psychology BESIDES already being the single greatest social critique of the consumer era.It's ridiculously smart, deep, beautiful and cool. I've watched basically every movie out there, and nothing comes even close to the degree of greatness of Fight Club.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Superb,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not about fighting,"Fight club is not at all what I expected, but I was surprisingly ecstatic about what the movie was.

The first rule of Fight Club: You never talk about how over-hyped Fight Club is,"I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Extremely Overrated,"Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.

G.O.A.T.,"This movie is one of the greatest of all time. It is adapted from a book by Chuck Palahniuk.

The direction is sublime. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly. Also they did a good job with the inter-cuts.

A unique film,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming.""

Welcome to movie heaven!,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me.

Life-changing Fight Club,"I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than I can remember.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the nearest videostore!5/5",,Anonymous,Drama
a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
My first review about my favorite movie...,"If you read the opinions about the film from different sites from different people, you can find out that basically you will either adore ""Fight Club"", or in the opposite direction you will dislike it to the same extent. I am one of the first. Moreover, this is probably my favorite movie.I liked everything here - from the actors' acting to the plot itself or the production of shots. The film is at least memorable and obviously will not leave anyone indifferent. The plot and motivation of the characters have long been known to everyone, if not, then it's for the best, a brief description and understanding will be enough for you.It's up to you to decide whether to watch or not. For me, according to the assessment and the above-written - ""... favorite movie ... "" I do not need to write a lot about my opinion.Speaking about this particular painting, it is difficult to say anything. Each person will accept it in their own way.

This movie is overrated,"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Pretty Looking Nightmare,"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"You love it or  you hate it, personally I loved it","Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The things you own end up owning you.,"I wasn't prepared for an existential trip about life. I thought it was just going to be about fighting.

The film is replete with phallic symbols and decries the femininization of men.""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""Fight Club gives us an emphatic NO to that question. But, then, what is Marla's role? To show us that we are lying to ourselves?

It's one of the best.,"An Office worker spends his time looking for fulfilment in various support groups, when he randomly encounters a soap maker named Tyler Durden, the pair discover a mutual, but strange and violent past time.There is no doubt in my mind, Fight Club is one of the best films of all time, a story like no other, even for someone that doesn't care for this film, I'm sure they'd agree that it's original.Fight Club is fast paced, action packed, intriguing, sexy, revealing and timeless, it's one of those films that it doesn't matter how many times you watch it, it doesn't lose any of its appeal. At times it is genuinely outrageous, and therein is its monumental appeal.Helena Bonham Carter steals so many films, and she's terrifiic here, but it's the combination of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt that makes the film, they are outstanding, I still think it's Norton's best performance to date.The wonderful, late Meatloaf adds a nice bit of humour.The moral of Fight Club......don't have the soup.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I am Jack's kick-ass review,"To be honest with you, when I saw the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be another mindless action film.  But then something happened.....I actually watched it.  I thought the movie was genius.  It wasn't so much about fighting.  It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered from insomnia.  Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly.  Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep.  With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems.  I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's Hard to Take Your Eyes Away,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie.

Great Film: Deserved Several Academy Award Nominations,"The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign.  The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters.  This is one of the most underrated movies I know.I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both.

Revisiting Fight Club,"Fight Club isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly as good as people make it out to be.It really comes off as a pretentious piece of work for film students to study to the point of exhaustion, but I don't think it was ever intended to be that. The movie plays out, with a few key alterations, as a scene-by-scene retelling of the book, sometimes going so far as to lift paragraphs of inner monologue directly from the novel and plopping them into the script.It's a movie that requires at least two viewings but, beyond that, it gets boring in a pretty big hurry. Particularly toward the end of the second act/beginning of the third, it's so painfully bland and boring that it's difficult to care about anything that's happening at all (around the whole Project Mayhem stuff). It's difficult to maintain any kind of focus throughout.There's a lot of stuff hidden in this movie for people to go back and revisit, too, but most of it is inessential. Honestly, having looked back at some of the Easter eggs, it leaves the question: who cares? And of course this is an unpopular opinion to have, but I held off on reviewing this title in the honest hopes that multiple viewings would raise the rating. I even read Palahniuk's novel to try to derive some additional meaning out of it.Without giving away the ending, it makes you think, and it creates a nice gimmick to get people to watch it again but, as I said, beyond that I'm perfectly happy to close the chapter on this one and leave it in the past.The first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club. And I'm happy to be done talking about this one for a good long while.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing movie,"Fight Club is one of those movies that sticks with you. It's not just about guys fighting in basements-it's way deeper. Ed Norton nails that whole ""lost guy"" vibe, and Brad Pitt as Tyler? Unreal. He's got that wild, untouchable energy. Together? They kill it.The story's layered: identity, control, freedom, all that stuff. You think it's one thing, then boom-the twist flips everything. It's raw, gritty, and full of moments that make you go, ""Whoa, what's even real?""The dialogue? Sharp and loaded. Stuff like, ""You are not your job"" or ""The things you own end up owning you"" hit hard. Plus, the visuals are insane-dark, edgy, perfect for the vibe. And that ending? Pure chaos but so fitting.It's not for everyone, sure. It's violent, it's intense, and it messes with your head. But if you're into movies that make you think-like really think-this one's for you.

It doesn't get much better than this,"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A rare film that challenges the viewer to come up with his own interpretations,"Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brilliant Direction and Superb Acting,"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating.

Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
My favourite movie of all time,"I'm a huge movie buff, and never have I sat through a movie as intense, gripping, well acted, directed, and incredibly written as fight club. I wish I could talk about it but the number one rule is, you can't. So I won't talk about anything that'll spoil it. First off. This movie is a work of art and is the reason I'm an inspiring screenwriter. There's so much they got right in this movie. 1. It has a clear vision and allows us audience to fall in love with a whole new directing style (for its time) almost. 2. The characters feel real and the chemistry is gold. 3. The plot is crazy but it works so well. Just, watch it if you havnt. Pls.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fincher's half,"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""The first rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club.""","Fight Club is an American film directed by David Fincher. It is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter are perfectly cast as the three lead characters.Narrator(Edward Norton) is an unnamed ordinary guy who works for an insurance company. He makes a decent salary, he can afford every material good the heart could desire, but the man is deeply depressed and develops insomnia.The Narrator starts attending self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people in these groups and meets another 'fake' named Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter).His life changes when he meets a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden being a rebel and an anarchist convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots. Then Tyler and The Narrator realize that they love fighting because it makes them feel alive and ""real."" After that Durden decided to start fight clubs across the country; and eventually turns the clubs into aggressive criminals releasing their hatred on corporate America.Everything is amazing about this film: the gripping plot, the acting, the soundtrack, the plot twist. I wanna talk more details but we all know rule #1.My only criticism would be that I can't erase my memory and watch it for the first time again.Not only is this a complex and absolutely thrilling film, but also it's thought-provoking and tackles some seriously deep issues, such as social pressure, consumer culture and radicalization.Strongly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Probably the best movie of the decade,After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Generally positive comments,"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not what I expected. One of the best movies ever made.,"I had avoided this movie as I had assumed it was 'Rocky Goes Underground'. Saw it last night (May 2013) only because my son wanted to watch it and I was too tired to get off the couch. I was totally blown away. It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie.Can't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.I unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A NO HOLDS-BARRED CULT CLASSIC KNOCKOUT! MY TAKE ON 1 OF THE GREATEST!,"If ever there were a Film in a CLASS ALL OF ITS OWN.... FIGHT CLUB IS IT!But before diving in.... FIRST... Let us FOCUS on the Title´s Content and Context:Surrender to FIGHT CLUB...A No-Holds-Barred Knockout! If you haven't seen it...See it! If you HAVE...See it again! In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT... Or shrewdly pretended not to! Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!Here is a film that almost cries out, ""HATE ME! DESPISE ME!"" An occasional film will step gingerly on the toes of audience sensibilities. Fight Club drop kicks them!Yet, it is so relentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantalizing...you will LOVE it...and then HATE yourself for it! Make no mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic Hollywood film.The term ""Ride"" is employed so freely to movies today, that it has become rather meaningless. Fight Club re-invents the word! Literally, from the DNA Roller-coaster opening Credits (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical equivalent of a sustained amyl-nitrate rush!), to the metaphoric wailing (""We're still men!"") of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton-Bonham Carter-Pitt, to the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise-control, hyper-consumeristic lifestyles......FIGHT CLUB synthesizes both our pent-up frustration and our self-induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE #1...""You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!"" This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one ""RIDE"" you CERTAINLY DO NOT want to miss!10**********.....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there","Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Style over substance.,"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc.When all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, ""Fight Club"" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe ""go let it out"" or ""if it feels good do it"". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. ""I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom"", he reasons. Until..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.The story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal ""Being John Malkovich"" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to ""Fight Club"" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

All they need is a leader or two,"It's the late 90s. Gen Xers are dissatisfied. The Narrator (Edward Norton) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) release their pent-up rage in bare-knuckle fighting, then create 'fight clubs' for their peers. ""We've all been raised to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't,"" Tyler incites the recruits. ""We're a generation of men raised by women.""Well, yes, that is what mothers do... but Tyler isn't recruiting geniuses. Feckless young white men respond in numbers, eager to prove their potency with bare knuckles and a safe word (a phrase coined in 1979, so this is Gen X to the core). The clubs grow, satisfying Tyler's true ambition: Project Mayhem, turning the mindless fight club members into domestic terrorists.It's a dark satire, highlighted by crisp and amusing arguments between the disheartened Narrator and despotic Tyler. Early on, support groups are lampooned, including one for testicular cancer attended by a female imposter ('imposter syndrome' dates to 1978), who becomes the movie's obligatory hot girl (Helena Bonham Carter). Black humor peaks with Tyler's bungled burglary at a liposuction clinic, stealing bags of human fat to be used to make soap and explosives (his chemistry lesson is a treat, if you overlook The Narrator's ignorance). And there is a grimly derisive Orwellian scene following the death of a Project Mayhem terrorist (Meat Loaf).Bottom line, though: I'll never watch ""Fight Club"" again. The violence is just one element of a visually unpleasant movie, and an overly long one thanks to Bonham Carter: her scenes add nothing but more confusion to a plot that manages to be puzzling without being suspenseful. I was bored long before the big reveal at the end, and after it I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not a bang but a whimper,"It's a challenge to say something new about a cult classic like ""Fight Club,"" but here goes: after all these years, the story seems to have lost some of its punch. The film, which once felt groundbreaking and audacious, now reveals itself as inconsistent and repetitive.Edward Norton plays the anonymous ""Narrator,"" a man so revolted by consumerism that he channels his frustration into rage, because, you know, being male and self-centered, what else can he do? He starts attending support groups to vent his feelings, only to have his emotional outlet spoiled by the arrival of Marla, another ""tourist"" in the world of misery.Then, during a business trip, he meets Tyler Durden, who has a ""briefcase exactly like his"" (wink, wink). They start a ""fight club,"" where disaffected men gather to beat each other senseless. Sure, it's a healthier alternative to domestic violence, which remains inexplicably popular. After plenty of bruises and a descent into squalor, things escalate with Project Mayhem, a ludicrous plan to obliterate consumer society and return us to a prehistoric paradise, because life was just grand back then.Norton's Narrator is suitably neurotic and deranged, while Brad Pitt's Tyler is the charismatic, nihilistic antihero we all secretly wish we could be (minus the nihilism and the fighting, of course).That's the gist, delivered with exceptional visual flair and style. I loved the film on my first watch, but subsequent viewings made me realize how underdeveloped and catty the Marla character is (with Helena Bonham Carter being completely miscast) and how absolutely impossible some scenes are (Tyler extracting the Narrator from the car? WTF). Also, it seems this was the peak of David Fincher's career, which has been on a steady decline since. Similarly, Chuck Palahniuk found his niche audience but never quite hit the mainstream jackpot again.Instead of a bang, it's seems that for Fincher and Palahniuk it's a slow and endless whimper.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"It shouldn't be just my opinion that Fight Club is the best movie of all time. It should be on number one of everyone's list. For me Fight Club isn't even just a movie.

Even if you don't really deal with the message the movie gives (what you definitely should) it has everything you want in a movie. Fight Club has a great directing style combined with a masterpiece of a story and a breathtaking plot twist. The acting performances of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter make the movie so much more authentic and fun to watch. You can watch Fight Club to really every time and how often you want. It doesn't get boring. In the end everyone has his/her own taste in movies but for me Fight Club is just a masterpiece that changed my life and style of living.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
fantastic on the technical,"This movie is fantastic on the technical side. Most of the movie is set at night, which serves as a perfectly dark tone for the events that transpire. There is excellent camera work, particularly during Durden's iconic speech regarding the eight rules of Fight Club. There are innovative special effects, such as when the narrator describes a possible explanation for an explosion in his apartment building. The movie moves at a brilliant pace, so though its 151-minute runtime seems like it'd be a chore to get through, the film never feels boring even once. Most of the main characters undergo a significant trajectory throughout the film, which is very satisfying to watch. The final shot of the film, which is one of my favorite scenes in movie history, uses awe-inspiring effects, meticulous framing and a legendary song choice to overwhelm the viewer with acute emotions. Once the credits start to roll, you'll be awestruck, still recovering from what you've just witnessed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A controversial satire and a contemporary classic. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11,"Solid Acting and Amazing Direction A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness both geopolitical and especially economic, that would erupt globally in the decade to come. Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool. Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.Essential Hollywood film of 1999.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Best of 1999,"You would only do a flick like Fight Club if you had total disregard for the opinion of (so called) critics, because of the gargantuan leap into unknown territory.  Fight Club is more of an experience than a 2-hour way to forget yourself.  It could of been 5 hours, I would not have known the difference. Although dark, it is truly the best film I have seen, period.  Pitt and Norton are both genius...truly out there as actors.The range of Fincher is amazing...dark to serious to funny to Holy Crap!See what happens when you take a chance?  Must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Undoubtedly my favourite movie of all times,"When I first saw Fight Club, I was sitting dumbfounded for 10 minutes after it ended and titles went on.
This is pure masterpiece. Everything in this movie is perfect and creates a whole ideal picture. THE CAST. I adore and admire Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. The colours, the light. The image and vision of the city that inflames and creates a constant tension. Emotions and mental state of the narrator, feelings and condition he experiences, especially in the beginning scenes - I felt it to the bone.
Worth multiple rewatching - you will notice new things and details every time.
Final scene brings goosebumps.
David Fincher is a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the most overrated movies of all time.,"Fight Club is overrated. When you love a movie and someone else says is overrated, it sounds like they're saying the movie's bad. That's not what im saying at all, is far from being bad, it has some great moments, but it's not a great movie. Norton and Pitt are pretty good, the soundtrack is amazing, the editing and sound design are also good. However, the plot is convoluted and absurd to the point of being annoying, not to mention the ""twist"" that makes almost zero sense. I like David Fincher, but this is not his best work, his direction feels too heavy handed here. Good movie, but overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

You never forget the first time you watch Fight Club.,"This movie is absolutely amazing. It's got a perfect plot, perfect cast, perfect script, perfect twists, perfect ending, perfect everything. This is definitely David Fincher's best, the only other answer I'll accept when asked what his best film is is Se7en. Anything else, and you're just trying to be different. Anyways, I cannot stress enough how much I like this movie. It's my 4th favorite at the moment, and it has defo earned that spot. Once again, being a 16 year old dude, I was destined to love this. But weren't we all?I've already broken the first two rules, but this needs to be talked about: This is possibly the greatest twist in cinematic history. I did NOT see it coming at all, and when it happened I was shocked ngl. The way it was executed was perfect. It's one of those twists when it subtly hints at it the whole movie and when it finally reveals it you're still shocked.This movie is just made so well. No wonder it's one of the most cult films ever made. It's just too perfectly made, and it's stays with you for a while. Definitely will forever be one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

There's Dead Poets Society & the Sandlot (Lol) but every year it seems like a coming of age movie for women comes out (not that, that is a bad thing) the problem is that young men don't have many movies that explain our frustrations like fight club does. It shines a light on what it feels like to be a young guy in our generation, while telling a wild ride of a story. Not only is the first time u see this movie a mind blower and a twist, you get even more out of it the second time around, with things you might not have noticed the first time.

What about Helena?,A woman needs to speak up for Helena Bonham Carter's incredible acting performance in this movie. Because it's guys who post for the film she's been overlooked because no man can relate to how anti-female this woman is and how far from the real Helena. Women who can treat random sex and despicable grunge as a natural and casual form of life have gone off the path somewhere and this girl isn't looking for redemption. She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here. So much so that she sinks into the movie like a dead body into a sewer and has been ignored on these boards thus far.,9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very better than Inception,"Is definitely much better than Inception. At the moment, the rating of this movie is higher, but if it comes above Inception, I will no longer appear on IMDb. Because this movie is not science fiction, but it is ten times more effective than a good science fiction. And this is very important. A realistic film is so effective in terms of storytelling. You see, at the same time, there is a lot of complexity in it. And you can enjoy watching it many times. Brad Pitt is completely one with his role. And it doesn matter that the movie is criticizing politics. What is most important is the depiction of modern man, and it is one of the few films that is even better than the original book.Of course I am fan of Nolan.....",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Quite an accomplishment,"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are in the ""Fight Club,"" a 1999 film directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls. The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.Edward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc.He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.When Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house.The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.Okay, like ""Mulholland Drive,"" that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.""Fight Club"" starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending.Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.The performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job.Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ingénue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.""Fight Club"" is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Ultimate Cinematic Trip,"When Fight Club was released to theatres i refused to go see it. The previews made it look like it was movie purely about senseless violence without a point or a message. One night while at a friends house they were raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't into seeing it but what else could i do. When the movie was over i couldn't believe what i had just saw. All my negative feelings about the movie were put to rest and i realized that i had seen a great movie and now it's in my top 10.I won't go into the plot because i think that the viewer should experience that for himself instead of reading this review. i will however say that it's not all about violence and the violence that is displayed in the film has a reason for being there. it's all about letting out aggression and finding out who you are. The violence is just a small part of a bigger picture.The acting is top notch. Brad pitt is in a lot of my favorite movies(Seven, Interview with the vampire, snatch).He's a very good actor and he jsut has a certain charisma when he's on screen. If anyone hasany doubts about his abilities they should see tihs movie. Edward Norton is also very good in the film. He's a very versatile actor and he fits intot his role very nicely. Helen bohnam carter is very good as the sole female in the film. she can more that handle her own with the 2 male leads. good supporting roles are also give by meat loaf and jared leto. Meat loaf is especially good in his role as bob.The direction by David Fincher is excellent. This film is a little dark like seven but there is more of a visual flair in this film. he's a brilant director and he has a eye for what's good in a film.In closing fight club is a movie we all should see and hope everyone gets a chance to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

wonderful and mind blowing,"If I have to describe this movie in one sentence, I have to say: wonderful and mind blowing.""Fight Club"" is a dark and thought-provoking film that delves deep into themes of masculinity, identity, consumerism, and rebellion. Directed by David Fincher and released in 1999, the movie is based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. It stars Edward Norton as an insomniac office worker, referred to as the Narrator, and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, a charismatic soap salesman.The film follows the Narrator as he becomes disillusioned with his monotonous existence and seeks an escape from his mundane life. He forms an underground fighting club with Tyler Durden, which evolves into an anarchistic movement that challenges societal norms and values. As the story progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to discern reality from the protagonist's unreliable perspective.""Fight Club"" is renowned for its visual style, gritty atmosphere, and Fincher's skillful direction. It is filled with intense and visceral fight scenes, which serve as a metaphor for the characters' desire to break free from the constraints of society. The film's exploration of masculinity is particularly striking, criticizing the shallow materialism and emasculating effects of consumer culture.Edward Norton delivers a stellar performance as the troubled and fragmented Narrator, capturing his internal struggle and descent into madness. Brad Pitt brings a captivating charisma to the screen as Tyler Durden, the enigmatic and rebellious figure who becomes both a mentor and a destructive influence.The film's nonlinear narrative, coupled with its psychological twists and turns, keeps viewers engaged and guessing until the final reveal. While ""Fight Club"" received mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a cult following and is widely regarded as a modern classic, primarily for its social commentary and its bold exploration of unconventional themes.Overall, ""Fight Club"" is a provocative and thought-provoking film that challenges societal norms and offers a scathing critique of modern life. It demands multiple viewings to fully grasp its complexities and symbolism, making it a compelling and enduring piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Life-changing masterpiece,"I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the cliches but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time On Line and get to the nearest video store!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brilliant,"I, initially , was not quite big fan of these kind of deeply meaningful movies , may be to the reason that I could not fully understand them. Nevertheless, directed by David Fincher, the""fight club"" became one of my most preferable movies of all time. The promise that was taken by film was more vital that it firstly seems as. The plot reveals the life of depressed man Edward Norton, who searches for peace in different type of clubs which are based on meetings sick people. A little time later, he faced an individual after whom his life had changed.
Under the direction of phenomenal producer , all the way of the film was interesting to watch. The breathtaking scenes and thrilling phrases that are directly connected with the contemporary world, which made a tremendous impact on my view to everything. Nevertheless, the movie is not easily accessible to community, due to the reason that not of all part of society are really understanding the position of director. I personally did the same at the beginning. After the passage of several time I managed my time to rewatch the movie, and felt an opportunity to comprehend my lifestyle.
To recapitulate, this is the most influentials movie which has powerful meaning in the background( even bizarre) that Fincher had ever filmed. I strongly recommend to watch it until the very end.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Profound standpoint about shackles and freedom, material and spiritual.","In Nietzsche's philosophy, there are three states of the human mind: the camel, the lion and the baby. The first state camel, endure humiliation, passively obedient to the arrangement of others or fate; The second realm of lion is to change passivity into initiative, from""you should""to""I want"". I will take the initiative to fight for everything and take the responsibility of life. Third state baby, this is an ""I am"" state, living in the moment and enjoying the present.In the US in the 1990s, the domestic economy boomed, giving rise to a surge of middle-class consumerism. What is consumerism? Life goals are closely related to the acquisition of goods, even if those goods are not needed for survival or for the traditional purpose of showing off. In consumerism, people are obsessed with the process of acquiring goods as the basis of their identity. The social system also serves for consumerism, such as designers who are specially responsible for enhancing the attractiveness of goods and ubiquitous advertisements, etc. The biggest spiritual shackles of consumerism lies in this. The process of acquiring goods has become the basis of people's identity.Jack is such a consumerist. He worked in order to make money, and to make money in order to buy more and better material, goods became the purpose of Jack. Jack did the same boring work every day, and his boss was bleeding him. Jack is portrayed as a consumer in a society where consumerism is prevalent, and he is caught in the trap of consumerism, in the cycle of work and consumption. He is a prisoner of the spirit, unable to feel his own worth, unable to feel the vitality of life. He began to lose sleep, and he began to look for a way out of his pain.Jack is a submissive camel enslaved by the material and system, while Tyler is a lion who dares to fight against material society, opposes all rules and advocates spiritual freedom. When Jack met Tyler, fight club was born. Fight makes people devote themselves to it and release their wildness. The pain brought by fight makes people feel their own existence, makes people temporarily break away from the cycle of work and consumption, and makes people throw away all the troubles and discomforts of life. This method is popular with many people and more and more people join fight club. Taylor yearns for a world that reverts to a primal time of instinct, and Taylor still becomes an extremist. Taylor wanted to liberate mankind from modern material and institutional civilization, and he did it by destroying it. But this is not desirable. Although we are constrained by the social value system and rules of modern civilization, they also bring us social order and progress. Although the social value system and rules of modern civilization shackle part of our nature and become the shackles of our spirit, they guarantee the higher efficiency of social operation and the guarantee of our high standard of living. So it is not feasible to throw away material and system completely. So the lion evolved into a baby, and Jack killed Taylor. The baby represents a new birth, re-establishing its own worth and will.In the beginning, we are tamed as a camel, taught what values are and told what to do. Then we began to question and reflect, becoming lions of confrontation and destruction. Eventually we become babies, abandoning our old values and rules and perceiving the world all over again, reevaluating everything we come into contact with. Jack eliminated the split personality of Tyler, brought himself to a state of harmony, reached the infant state. Newborn babies have the will to choose actively, no longer blindly pursue the value defined by the external world, feel their inner world, redefine and create their own value, and achieve spiritual freedom.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fight Club and Calvin and Hobbes,"WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW.I saw Fight Club a month or two back, and was kind of unimpressed with it. It was a decently made film, with good acting and good directing... but something about it just didn't quite work for me. That is until I began to examine it more closely. Then I realized what it really is: It's not a life-altering drama or a vicious black comedy, as it is proclaimed to be... rather, it is a cleverly disguised attempt to bring one of the greatest comic strips of all time to the big screen.That's right, Fight Club is really an adaptation of Calvin and Hobbes. Just take a look at the similarities...Fight Club: The Narrator (hereinafter ""Jack"") feels depressed and alone, which leads to his fabricating Tyler Durden, a friend and companion who is everything Jack wishes he could be.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin has no friends, which leads to his projecting everything he wishes he could be into his stuffed tiger, who becomes his friend and companion Hobbes.Fight Club: When Jack looks at Tyler, he sees Tyler. When anyone else looks at Tyler, they see Jack.Calvin and Hobbes: When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a tiger. When anyone else looks at Hobbes, they see a stuffed toy.Fight Club: Jack simultaneously detests Marla and desires her. He projects his desire through Tyler, though in several scenes we see this desire in Jack himself.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin simultaneously detests Susie and desires her. Throughout the course of the strip, we see this desire manifested in Hobbes. But in the very early episodes, Calvin expresses the same desire himself, if only to himself.Fight Club: Jack expresses his dissatisfaction with his father, and the job he did as a parent.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin frequently speaks of his father doing poorly in the ""polls"".Fight Club: While at work, Jack is under the thumb of a demanding boss, whom he does not like.Calvin and Hobbes: While at school, Calvin is under the thumb of Miss Wormwood, a demanding teacher whom he does not like.Fight Club: When frustrated with the world around him, Jack goes to a place in his imagination (that place with the penguin) where all around him things are serene.Calvin and Hobbes: When frustrated with the world around him, Calvin goes to places in his imagination, where he is Spaceman Spiff, Tracer Bullet, Stupendous Man, etc.So, thus we see that, though Bill Waterson himself forbad the filming of his strip, a few brave men had the courage to go behind his back and do what they felt was right. Never has there been such a courageous act by filmmakers since the days of Nosferatu, which was another thinly-disguised attempt to bring a beloved character to the screen...

Most overrated POS on the top 250,"I went to see this with a friend because I'd heard 'it was good' at the local IMAX theater, no less. I went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever. Once I actually saw it, I realized it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some real stinkers. I'd rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back Ed Wood marathon.I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about Fight Club. What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.The secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.I could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.Is Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth? The cinematography is choppy, and there's only so much I can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason.They should have used some of that soap to clean up the film.From me, 1 star.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Wow, what a fun ride!","From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Maybe Golf Can Fill The Void!!,"It is nice to have all the material accoutrement of a thriving, cosmopolitan guinea pig. You are raptured by consumerism, which includes owning several hundred pounds of Scandinavian furniture.You have a precocious infatuation for a white collar title, and your lackluster, extra curricular activities have dictated that you mollycoddle someone with testicular cancer!! As enticing as all of this sounds, you know what sparks your interest even more, BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF SOMEONE!! (I have been underemployed for over eight years now, I am all ears!!) What do you really want out of life? Recognition at the Neanderthal level, or, to be another citified anonymity? The former, of course!! Brad Pitt conveys his message to Edward Norton very convincingly, and now, the trick is to spread the good news, but, remember rules one and two, you are not allowed to talk about it, and, you are not allowed to talk about it!! How do you persevere under such a deranged set of circumstances? Yes!! Boredom constitutes a first rate felony. Fighting to a near death represents an exuberance that has titillated Edward Norton's character to a personal Nirvana!! Dangerously convoluted logic is the ultimate spirituality. You have experienced excruciating chemical pain, someone torched your condo because they want to get to know you a little better, you got fired because you always have blood stains on your clothes, you want to blow up a credit card centralized information building complex, and sex has not been this sensational since seventh grade!! Nobody said that this was a family oriented film!! The aggregate depravity for all of the characters in the movie transcends a diversified experimentation with needless destruction, their devotion to the non-conventional is a little too difficult to comprehend!! What does anybody really accomplish by going this route anyway? Capitualation to the bizarre? This movie's charades of insurrection are exhilarating to the clinically demented (Otherwise known as the fight club) The less I know, the better off I will be I think!! Banalities pertinent to the Bourgeousie have brazenly threatened this bevy of belligerent overgrown boys who wish to brandish their high levels of testosterone... So Now!! Life is one big boxing ring!! This is a potpourri of apocalyptic misgivings which are socially perverse!! How do you empathize with any of this?... You don't!! This website has ranked this movie the 31st best film out of the top 250 ever made.... To concur with these findings would be tantamount to indulging the character that Brad Pitt played, to the nth degree!! The psychopathic rumination involved in all of these felonious antics are even more repugnant than the eating habits of an alpaca!!! It is truly indicative of human nature to favor the form of fruition which is pecuniary, their form of fruition deals with societal malcontent and mutilation!! The resonating agitation, which serves as an inspiration to everyone in this movie, is commensurate with the film ""Clockwork Orange""!!! Both films possess a ruthless determination to establish an adamant,counter-culture militancy with a bunch of immature misfits!! The macabre actions to both of these movies signify a heinous non-justification which is pertinent to everything!!! This is not what the phrase ""Change your sedentary lifestyle"" means!!! There are other recreational diversions out there, maybe golf can fill the void!! As far as unprecedented creativity goes ""Fight Club"" gets a resoundingly perfect ten!!!

The things you own ends up owning you.,"What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course ""Dr Jekill and Mister Hide"" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,""a clockwork orange"" ,""rebel without a cause"" ""bad influence"" and Joel Schumacher's ""falling down"",the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in ""primal fear"".Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says ""the things you...""The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,à la ""sixth sense"" ,""Jacob's ladder"" or"" Usual suspects"" ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of ""clues"":the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.The last picture seems now terrifying.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A must watch movie.,"This movie isn't just about acting or story or narration and not even the mind blowing twist that you'll ever see. It has something more than this that you need to experience in first hand.It discusses about a lot of interesting topics like consumerism,nihilism,chaos,denying existentialism, how the modern man is becoming more materialistic than spiritual.Well, if these topics don't appeal to you. You will watch it like a normal movie and even though you will like it because of the mind blowing twists that you'll ever see.If you want to experience this movie to the hardcore level, observe every dialogue and try to understand what does it mean. This is one of the rare cases where the movie elevates the book but not the other way around.Brad Pitt's acting is one the highlights of the movie. No one could have done better than him for this character. Unlike many movies like shutter island,predestination where the twist had made the movie better, this isn't the case here. It is already a way better movie but the twist makes it even better.It's no wonder the movie had developed a massive cult following since its release. Fightclub released today would have made more sense than in 1999.

Pretty Good - But Not Great,"This movie has been hailed by many (mostly men) as the greatest movie of all time. It has been continually rising up the ""Top 250"" and now ranks as the 10th best on IMDb.I'm sorry, after 4 viewings, I still do not get to that level. I don't think I ever will.I have read many of the reviews and I agree with most of the positive comments and do not agree at all with most of the negative reviews. The movie is not dumb by any means. It is not an experience in testosterone driven world of violence. It is anything but a mess.It is a very well written, extremely well directed, view into a dark anti-consumerism world.The movie's message is recognize consumerism and reject consumerism. As such, it presents the conflict between two characters Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and someone who is called Jack, Rupert or Cornelius and who is played by Edward Norton.Jack is quite a consumer, or at least at the start of the movie he is. There is also Marla Singer played by (Helena Bonham Carter), who is both like Tyler in most ways and like Jack in other ways.Tyler is basically against everything society values, and virtually anything positive. He argues with, and eventually begins to win Jack over to his thinking. At one point, he fights Jack and the two of them create fight club. Tyler also has a sexual relationship with Marla, despite the fact that his friend Jack can't stand to be around her.The movie has a good and memorable twist. The movie is loaded with numerous unique and memorable quotes. Most of the quotes are very negative. The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.If we desperately needed a movie against consumerism: this is it! Here is one of the quotes:""You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.""If we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way,This is not it,andThis is anything but it.Here is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than once:""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.""Here is another line that someone shouts:""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.""If you like dark negative movies, this is a good one.

Precious and obvious,"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.)""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

Watch this movie anyway.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it.

Their portrayal of split personalities and the desire to rebel against society's superficial consumerism is compelling and convincing.The plot of ""Fight Club"" is full of unexpected twists and subtle hints that constantly make the viewer reinterpret what is happening. The film encourages contemplation on identity, conformity, and the impact of capitalism, leaving room for various interpretations.The visual style of the film is impressive.

The Ultimate Rule Breaker,"Fight Club is without a doubt one of the most unique movies ever made. Its perspective on society is very accurate in its point of view. Even though anyone could say that its philosophy is partialy wrong and I don't think anybody could argue that it is not. The way it ends is also extremly special in the fact that its hard to tell if its the bad guys or the good guys that won. Its hard for us to know if we are supposed to rule or not for a character like Tyler Durden. The final twist is extremely good and its presented in a very unpredicted way. This movie is like somebody with a mental dissorder. Everything is chaotic, brutal, controversial and suddent. Most of these things are in part because of David Fincher's direction. Its direction is simply flawless, there not a single error in the direction! And it might seem like it is fully flawed when you look on its surface but if you look closer you always find out that it has no error!

WORLD NEED OLD MAN,"The movie talks about how we should give up on the new world because it has obscured reality with the luxuries we have to chase after. The fight club was created to help modern men return to primitive man doing the things that men did, should and will do. That is violence, that is not a proof to become a man, but violence makes a man. Violence helps release this new world that holds us back and forces us to be peaceful. When doing the first exercise, people tend to avoid violence, so exercise number 1 is difficult to complete. Tyler's goal is to return society to the old world, the primitive world. See the world through our own eyes, not through the eyes of others. The world enslaves us with frivolous, annoying, time-wasting things that we don't really enjoy every moment of. If we enjoy, no moment is wasted. No matter whether the old world was good or not, this world is not. How much can you know about yourself if you have never been a fight?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Visually stunning, conceptually brave and only the odd sag","Our narrator is a white-collar worker who has his life to a point it could be called normal.  His home is decked out in the pornography of IKEA catalogues and he is professional.  However he is somehow dissatisfied with his life as it is and drifts from various support groups faking disease just to get love and emotional outlet.  A chance meeting on an airplane with soap salesman Tyler Durden gives him pause and, when his flat is destroyed in an explosion, he turns to Durden for help.  Together they begin to move into a world that isn't commercially based, where pain helps them to feel more alive.  Together they start a small group called Fight Club where men can experience the thrill of a fight without the danger.  However the groups grow rapidly and begin to carry out subversive activities at large.  When confronted by our narrator, Durden disappears our narrator in charge of a semi-cult group that is operating without his knowledge.I didn't get round to seeing this film until it came to TV in the UK recently.  So over several years I had generally been told that it was a `great movie'  mostly by people who had HEARD it was a great movie rather than those who had seen it.  So I expected greatness and was taken a little aback by the fact that this wasn't a normal Hollywood film but something much more worth while.  The reason I'm surprised that it ranks so highly and did so well is that it requires concentration and thought.  The plot is basically a comedy, making fun of us.  That's how I saw it  that we are like the narrator but we must accept that this is our lives to some extent, to go to the other extreme is just as bad if not worse.  It is a very clever story and it only dipped in quality at one point for me  where the clubs first begin to become something more sinister (more!) and move into terrorism.Part of the reason it was so well watched is the stars but also the very cool direction that made it stand out to the student generation as something deep (even if they didn't get the film).  I think this ironic as they haven't hit the stage of our narrator and can't fully relate.  However the direction is praise worthy and Fincher was the best man for the job.  Full of clever shots and great images the film is a joy to see.  The one flaw I had was the sincerity of the film.  Many love it because it is anti-capitalist in nature, making fun of IKEA-love etc.  The film is preaching to us about this (and the other) extreme  but most people watching and making it will be living that exact life!  However this is minor and it became less as the film went on and mocked both ends of the scale.The stars do well and I wonder if they worried this would be too highbrow and flop?  Norton is simply a great actor when given the material and he delivers here.  Even with the more extreme actions (that aren't real) he carries them off as convincing.  Pitt enjoys himself well in the joint lead although his character is basically one dimensional (for obvious reasons). That said he is very strong and takes you with him as he gets more extreme. Carter is a weak link to me and I never really bought her character.  A shame as she is quite central but it doesn't spoil it too much.  Support cast are good, but putting a face like Meat Loaf in a very unusual role just made him stand out and distract from the role.Overall this is an excellent movie.  Even if you don't get it, it is still great fun to watch.  It is a brave story to try in a Hollywood film and it is superbly directed, acted and told.  Some may rave about it too much but it is well worth a look.  If only out of interest rather than to change your life.",,Anonymous,Drama
Yet Another Victim Of Keyser Soze Disease,"Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.The film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing young man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog.  To alleviate his misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings for depressed people.  Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors, drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the Narrator starts to feel better about his own life.  It's perverse and macabre, but it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club' really shines.Unfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets two people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and depression of being forced to live a homogenized life.  Durden's solution to this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap out of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.As Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply awesome in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt, as Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that it at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept, and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp.  What was a clever movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's where `Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger plans just bring the film to a grinding halt.Part of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions. However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead seems to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it. Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the point of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to be. Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need.  There's a certain irony to `Fight Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.Without giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end of `Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In `Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced, and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have relied on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to fall back on, this gimmick usually backfires.  It definitely backfires in `Fight Club'.`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a great film.  Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film with a garbled message.  Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this film - it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much better. `Fight Club' is forgettable. Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot.","In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: ""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression."" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.The main character continues: ""We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't"".Well, learning to differentiate between yourself and ""movie gods [and] rock stars"" and learning that life is not all beer and skittles is what growing up is about today.So, Brad Pitt et al., grow up. And go read a book or something.The rubbish quote sums it up pretty good: ""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men that have ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas or waiting tables; slaves with white collars. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don't need. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off.

This movie will leave you in awe.,"Fight club is a movie by David Fincher and star Edward Norton as...well, its not clear but he's called the narrator and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. It stars with with the last act of the film but then takes us back to the star. We see the Narrator and he tell us about how he has insomnia which has taken a toll on his mentality making him look lifeless and tired. He works for an automotive company with means he has to travel all the time and record wrecked cars from accidents. On one of his travels he mets Tyler Durden, a free spirited guy with a disdain for consumerism and confirmative society. He's views and ideas are appealing to the Narrator and circumstances lead them to live together. After a short time, they started a club where men from different walks of life can join and in this club, members fight each other one on one till one surrenders. Firstly, I would like to say that is one of the best story in film. The script is one the smartest I've ever seen. The first act feels like a dream like world with The Narrator's smooth, simple description of the events of his life. Personally, I could related very well to him, during the time in which I first saw the movie, I was in the midst of an insomniac phase similar to the Narrator. I watched the movie movie with some of my friends and saw them getting lost as the movie progresses. They were expecting some brain dead action flick that has Brad Pitt in it. All of them dose of eventually while I was left glued to the spectacle of events that transitions in the movie. Tyler Durden, Brad's character is such a memorable guy that makes him seem larger than live. The lines in he delivers are absolutely brilliant and make you question the norms of life and exactly how absurd they really are for example "" We're consumers. We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession "". His view's made us question our life goals and how much of what we do is just society telling us we should do. This is the power of this movie. And when I said earlier that it's not a brainless action movie that doesn't this movie is a bore fess. Its a very intriguing with mixture of action, psychological thriller, comedy(the humor is frequent and well done) and mystery. There are a few questions I had that were answered at the end. Overall, this movie is deserving of the people's praises and cemented David Fincher as a brilliant, unique director who brings a tone and look to this film which complements the story well.

#10 in the IMDb top 250.....really?,"Having just watched this film, I honestly can't believe it is ranked in the top 250....let alone in the top 10! Don't get me wrong this film was good but I just can't see why it is rated so highly. If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system.After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best.I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me.7/10.",,Anonymous,Drama
ULTIMATE Dumb Guy movie.,"How can we get Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Meatloaf to beat the c**p out of each other?  This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedo-philosophies and violence.It's just dumb.  Don't try looking beneath the surface, because nothing is there (maybe that's the point).  It provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life...  their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions.  In order to escape, you fight.  It's so simple!  Give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black t-shirt fight gang.  Makes sense.  Teenage males will certainly think so, since it is filmed in the MTV style...  bright color palette, fancy edits, blood... mesmerizing (and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic).It actually starts our promisingly.  I loved the first quarter.  Only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are, sorry, far out of the grasp of the writers, does it fail.Film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest, tacked-on ""surprise"" endings in cinema history.  I could only laugh.  Bottom line: Dumb.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
I could rewatch a thousand times,"I've been told so many times to watch this movie. Finally, I've watched it and I just don't know where to begin. This movie is absolutely amazing in about every way. You never expect the ending or the plot twists as you keep trying to predict what is going to eventually happen. It takes you on such a good journey of the development of the MC and it gets more interesting as you go further. Sure, the beginning was slow and boring some people have said but it was worth the entire movie. The building point just leaves you blown away, in my experience. I love how everything has been left up to the viewer's interpretation, you connect the dots and you can create your own interpretations of the ending and overall the entire meaning of the message being portrayed. This movie was an eye opener and it has done its job beautifully. Feels like throughout this movie I started second guessing myself, I got pretty confused at some points, and then later the movie %100 satisfied the confusion I had. This movie deserves the hype that it has, it truly is an amazing watch. It was naturally funny, dramatic, motivating, eye opening and definitely gore filled. The cinematography was very well done, the actors gave a great performance, and the climax was great. Feels like I'll never see a movie that could be as great as this movie did with its plot. Fight Club makes you want to change your view or perspective on things and in life in general. It focused on corporate issues, materialism, the modern slavery of man kind today and much more. Fight Club makes you want to get up and fight just to feel excitement in any miserable experience you had or going through. I will definitely rewatch this movie and I feel like the second rewatch will be even better as I recognize all the hints and connect even more dots than the first watch. A genius made this concept and executed it perfectly, nothing can really change my mind about this movie. I loved it, 11/10 I recommend if you are not sensitive to the very graphic content of gore in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"This is not any beautifully written, grammatically accurate review","but the same worthless piece of writing written by a person's organ just as everybody's else. The movie revolves around a man 'The Narrator' (Edward Norton) who is bored from his life joins a group where people share their feelings, there he meets an annoying girl who plays an important role in the movie named Marla Singer, then he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), initiates a group named Fight Club where people fight with each other and commit crimes in the city. It changes his life but he gets embroiled in relationship with him. The movie is divided into 2 halves. One that develops the character of 'The Narrator' throwing light on his boring (for him) yet interesting and relatable life (for us). The other part of the movie is psychologically thrilling. The 'thrilling' part of the movie is insanely effective. It can change one's perspective towards life for an hour at least, although that is very short period of time but you would see the world from a much better perspective. In that part of the movie, 'The Narrator' fights with his own philosophy to make the moral choice (stop the chaos in the city). The characters are one the coolest characters of all time. They are inspiring, cool and relatable especially Tyler Durden. The Narrator is an antisocial insomniac, critical thinker. He pays attention to almost everything surrounding him. He uses scientific terms and complex words while framing sentences so as to appear clever. He is bored from repeating his everyday life. He lacks friends and family. The 1st part of the movie is great because it's interesting, it's relatable and the narrator narrates it in his lovely emotionless voice, with humour and sarcasm at times. Tyler Durden is also an anti socialist who have radical methods to spread his philosophy i.e renunciation of modern society, facing pain and death as major part of the life. He hates the fact that people are bound with the laws of sociality & government and cannot do their will. He is like a teacher. He wants people to do what they want to. He does not like all those boring stuffs people do such as watching flashes of pictures bring projected on T.V. You must have got the idea. He initiates Fight Club where people fight to experience physical pain, not to win so as to get people out of stupid socialism. The ideas of spreading ideas through violence may sound idiotic but is beyond awesomeness because it is only when you are tortured that you would reveal your true reaction to something. You wouldn't be afraid to do anything. You wouldn't be shy to remove your pants and when you will adapt to pain, there would be nothing in the world that could frighten you. Tyler Durden is not afraid of anything, he cannot be tortured. That's what Tyler Durden makes of The Narrator. He makes him beat himself ruthlessly without the fear of pain. Both are each other's best friends. Tyler Durden does a lot of things to make the narrator what he wants him to become. He successfully does it to the members of Fight Club but it was quite a challenge for The Narrator. That part of the movie begins when 2nd half starts. The 2nd half of the movie is psychologically thrilling. Although it is one of the best psychological thrillers but since the 1st half of the movie was completely drama, it is not considered a thriller film by IMDb or Google. The scenes of the 2nd half are quite intense, insane, inspiring and disturbing. The background soundtrack played during those scenes are mysterious, noisy representing chaos and confusion. That's why it received Oscar nominations for that category. Sometimes , there is no background soundtrack at all, it's just the solid acting and intense emotions that dominate those scenes. The Narrator, then begins narrating with confusion with all the chaos going on. There's always a psychological atmosphere maintained in that half. It have aspects of neo-noir movies but is not actually one of them.Then comes the plot-twist. If you have googled Fight Club you must be familiar that it is also known for its mind blowing plot twist. Unlike other movies, this one continues even after the plot twist and The Narrator becomes more connected to the audience and the movie becomes even more mind-fuzzing. It's like The Sixth Sense running even after the plot twist. There are tons of hint. In fact the whole movie is the hint. You would never be able to spot all the hints or predict the plot twist. After typing ""hints for Fight Club's plot twist"" (don't do that if you haven't seen it) you would realize that this is one of the most clever movies ever made. Marla Singer is the girl in Fight Club. Although, she may not seem important but she plays a very important role in the movie. It is difficult to understand her, from that statement I am not referring to what people say for girls nowadays, Marla Singer is just weird. She is not afraid of death, she is also anti social and talks weird things. The plot twist could have been even more mind blowing if it included her. Fight Club is actually a moral movie in its own dark way. Dark morality is a much better term for example Joker's quote (The Dark Knight). Some people didn't liked the movie. Some people hated the very idea of the movie, that's the reason why Academy Awards didn't liked it. However David Fincher will never be able to make a better movie, neither will Church Palahniuk ever write a better novel. They both made a masterpiece. Directing skills, screenplay, writing and acting is great too. ^- I am Jack's honest review.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A good film; NOT a great film.,"""Fight Club"" is a very good movie, but it is held up much higher than it deserves to be.  It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this movie ""underappreciated"".  The truth is that it's OVERappreciated.  ""Fight Club"" is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call it.  There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club itself.  The film is pointlessly overlong, with a ridiculous ending that was not at all needed.  So I see no reason why anyone would ever think that this movie was underappreciated.  It's obviously not the case.  However, it is superbly directed, well-written, and well-acted, so I fell good giving it a rating of 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

The first rule of Fight Club,"FIGHT CLUB premiered in the US with a wave of publicity focusing on its violence and nihilism; some critics countered this with the statement that it was an anti-materialist jeremiad.On a 2nd watching of the film, it seems like neither to me. It's easier to see it as a thoughtful, strong and complex movie. Director David Fincher once again dazzles us with his work, which is as brilliantly energetic as the acting of Brad Pitt and also talented Edward Norton.What's really impressive is the manner in which the film manages to tease us with an anti- materialist, hyper- masculine message even as it suggests that we're all a little too sophisticated to buy into it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Only at the end of the film, during the scroll of the credits, was I made totally certain that it was indeed Helena. Meatloaf also is worth mentioning, for the role of 'Bob', needs giant kudos as well.

My Opinion: Fight Club,"This Movie it's just great! One of the films which EVERYONE has the obligation to see. The critic to the consumerism in our society in it it's so deep and intense and it tell us that in great dialogs.

We actually feel the frustration of the character with this world. We believe that our lives will be great and awesome but that ain't going to happen. And this movie shows us that fact. It opens our eyes to where we're living and it makes us doubt if we are indeed living. Again, the way that this movie tells us not to be dependent of what we have and to be prepare that our lives ain't going to be that great but still we can make a difference, it's great. We do have a lot of potential. Just like this movie. So, let's live like we really should. But first, watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

David Fincher's Fight Club,"We follow the narrator, played by Edward Norton, as he struggles with insomnia and the lack of meaning in his life. Fight Club was directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. It's a Dark Comedy which explores the ironies of our society, Fincher holds a mirror in our face show how disgusting we are and then he makes us laugh at this. This movie is masterfully directed and edited, beautifully filmed and decorated, it features some of the best performances by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. It is hard to understand what people didn't see when it came out, even though the magic was a bit lost when this movie became so popular, that now holds the tenth spot in the IMDb's Top 250, in my opinion it deserves this status, if not to compensate the hate or indifference it received when it came out then for its achievements as a stupendously well done movie. It deserves a 10 in my view. Would recommend to any person who wants to think a bit about life or/and wants to watch a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Something doesn't quite fit with this movie...,"As an earlier comment stated, the first 2/3rds of this movie are truly intriguing. The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).Edward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.However, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this ""anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched"" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in ""6th sense"", another recent movie, there a ""shocking"" twist near the end.

"110 Minutes of Pure Greatness, but alas...","Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end.

WAIT! READ THIS:,"Like 4400 others I could write now: ""a masterpiece"" and give the film 10/10 stars.But I'd rather tell you that it's exactly these reviews that make me laugh and cry. They rate a film 10 and say it's a masterpiece, but don't even begin to understand what Fight Club is actually about? This film is not about toxic manliness, or rebellion or whatever nonsense. I'll tell you straight up what the misunderstood story in Fight Club is. This is a comment I wrote under a blog ""everybody misunderstands the point in fight club"" in which the blogger himself doesn't understand the point of Fight Club.. The comment that I wrote seems like understandable by some people at least,
so I copy paste it here.HERE IT STARTS:
People don't even understand the main story of Fight Club, because they only analyze parts of the movie. Like overlooking the sinking ship in Titanic, but analyzing the love story between Rose and Jack.The main story in Fight Club is about the process of enlightenment caused by a huge amount of mental suffering. The suffering is a result of identifying with the ego, the things we own and the roles we play in a society of hypocrites. The narrator's subconscious mind creates a hallucination: Tyler Durden. It's a self healing process, a psychosis. The narrator thinks, Tyler is a real person. Tyler shows him, what he needs to change in life in order to find his true self, which will end the suffering:letting go of attachment. Stop identifying with your ego, the things you own. The roles you play in society. It is in the nature of the ego feeling incomplete. Buying new things and a better job makes the ego feel better temporarily, but the feeling of incompleteness will return. All of these are teachings of ZEN Buddhism.Tyler says: ""....never be complete, stop being perfect...."".Be what you really are. Fighting is the meditation/stop thinking aspect. There are countless more hints in the movie for the process of achieving enlightenment:destroying the ego of new project mayhem members. Intentionally losing fights, Tyler and Ed Norton destroy fancy cars with baseball bats, but they stop at the ordinary car, and move on to the next ego-feeding car.Enlightenment is mentioned several times in the movie, for instance the chemical burn scene which teaches: don't run away from suffering, it let us evolve and grow.At the end of the movie the narrator realizes, that Tyler is a hallucination, and shoots himself. Injured, he is telling Marla: ""I am ok, I am really ok, trust me. Everything is gonna be fine"" the injury doesn't matter, because the narrator's suffering has ended.He kills Tyler, because he wants to stop him (himself) from destroying buildings and harm other people. Tyler was his ideal self, but he can't allow him(self) to do that, even if he feels like to do so. Tyler didn't care, because he is created from his subconscious mind, where emotions and beliefs have priority.END OF THE TEXTand I want to add: the rule ""do not talk about FC is, because if everybody would talk about it, the narrator would realize, that there is no Tyler Durden in the real world.

Lame,"I won't try to write an outline of the film, others have done a good job of that here already, I'll just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it: This is one poor movie. Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale.

Get's Me Every Time,"The brilliance of Fight Club lies in its ability to deconstruct societal norms and challenge the audience's perception of identity, consumerism, and mental health. The film follows an unnamed narrator (played by Edward Norton), a disillusioned and insomniac office worker who finds an unlikely escape through an underground fight club led by the enigmatic Tyler Durden (portrayed flawlessly by Brad Pitt). Together, they embark on a reckless journey that blurs the boundaries between reality and imagination.Fight Club delves deep into the themes of masculinity, existentialism, and rebellion against a soulless society. It presents a scathing critique of consumer culture, urging viewers to question their own values and choices. The film's visual style is captivating, with Fincher's meticulous direction and the striking cinematography emphasizing the gritty and raw nature of the story.One of the film's greatest strengths is its exceptional performances. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt deliver career-defining performances, showcasing their incredible range and chemistry. Their characters' intense dynamics create a sense of urgency and unpredictability that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Fight Club boasts a legendary twist that has become a staple in pop culture.

My view,"I have just seen this movie and I do not really know what this movie is all about! Is it the fashionable ""easy-mindedness"" which awaits the hero at the end of the rabbit's hole as a final finding about how life should be lived? Is it the invention of violence as a healing therapy which would be infantile and motivating to crime? Or is it a fashionable exposition of a schizophrenic attitude which finds his answer in losing the point? There is not a clue given to help us decide. I have rarely seen such a mess as this one. There are more and more topics from under the pen of modern authors the contents of which are contradictory and nonsensical. This trend seems to have begun by the admired ""Terminator"" and its like the topic of which, its rational and real possibility, is off line.

Great Films Club for Fight Club.,"If we're all just ""polishing the brass on the titanic"", and everything is going down anyway, what's the point? You get up in the morning, you go to school, study and succeed with the hope of one day becoming a doctor, a lawyer or a whatever. But if we know as we do that humanity will cease to exist in the near future, what with global warming and all, why do we bother improving existence? Shouldn't we give in to the beast we all know exists inside man? For the little time we have left, isn't a better idea to destroy, fight and kill? Anarchy seems to be the best thing to abide by in these dark times. Of course, David Fincher's Fight Club doesn't advocate these ideas; it brings them up in order for us, the viewers, to think of reasons why they are wrong.With recourse to the everyman, Edward Norton's character, only known as the Narrator, Fight Club involves us in the film. We are the Narrator. We are the ones who need every piece of furniture in Ikea catalogues for our homes in order to feel whole. However, the everyman in the film happens to have a day only seen in the movies, but we still identify with him: His luggage is lost at the airport, his house blows up and all his possessions, even the furniture, are gone. As a direct result, he is no longer a person because his possessions have been destroyed.Now he meets a guy, Tyler Durden, who tells him he could be more than his possessions, he could be free of the superficial society which creates the needs he does not (""in the hunter-gatherer sense"") actually have. He could be, that is, if he hits his friend as hard as he can.Our Narrator does; he likes it. Soon enough, other young men begin to like it too. These young men are also tired of mindless work which consists of helping a society that just enslaves them more as they make it more powerful. What's the point? So they all listen to Tyler, a fervent leader of men who initiates a club in which, every night, these young men can pound on each other. As they experience real freedom through pain and domination, Tyler, the giver of this wonderful experience, hands out homework assignments. His minions happily execute.This is how anarchy begins: A fervent and relentless leader with the wrong idea. I will not divulge any more, because of the many surprises this film has near the end. Any film with these ideas can just as easily fail. Fight Club does not. It is masterfully wrapped in a package of light, sound and images by David Fincher. The film looks good and has the smarts to back it up.Proponents of classic films see modern day cinema as being all style and no substance. Scenes are cut too fast to even get a feel for them, a little gift, they say, from television. Well I say look at Fight Club. What we have isn't so bad. It makes us think as well as being entertained.Edward Norton gives us many performances in one: he is an insomniac who knows there's a void in his life but doesn't have the will power to fill it, preferring to merely go through the motions of a life headed nowhere. Then he becomes ""enlightened"", finds meaning. Then he discovers what his life really is... Brad Pitt is a charismatic leader able to subdue any lost soul. Helena Bonham-Carter has fun with her intermediary character.Great acting and great directing have always been essential to great films. So has being thought provoking, and you know what? For 7 years ever since its release, everyone has been talking about it. It hasn't stopped; even people who hate it love to talk about it.So should we just stop our productive lives? Boys, let's just pound each other because, hey, it's more productive then anything we're doing now. It liberates us, for a given time period, because short term desire satisfaction is more useful than anything else. Somebody please prove that wrong, because that's what the film wants us to do, and I'll be damned if Tyler Durden is right.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Yesterday, I finally watched it, and boy, it was even worse than I thought it would be! It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.This movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived.

Probably one of my favorite movies.,"I think the plot twist is very particular, it's a kind of movie that plays with your brain, it gives you joy and also sadness, i don't know if i can describe everything you feel while you're watching it, for me it's very important how you're feeling through the movie, and i love it when i can be laughing at something and then feel terrible about a character. For me, it was easy to get attracted to Norton's character, really simple and mundane, nothing special. I've not read the book yet, probably i will do it someday, but i know a book cannot be compared to a movie, they're different but i'm sure they have the same essence. I know it's easy to find movies like this, i watched recently ""the revenant"" and it gave me a similar feeling, i was up, and then was down, i was happy, but then concerned, movies are feelings, not just shots or frames or if it has a good photography, it helps of course, but as a screenwriter, i'd like to think about the screenplay and characters more than anything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the Best Films Of All Time With a Perfect Script,"Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a ""fight club,"" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

fight club movie review,"It was an amazing movie starring Brad Pitt in the lead role. It is adapted from a book which is written by Chuck Palahnluk. The story was interesting, there is a club which named fight club and at first time few people knew about this group because there was a rule, 'do not talk about fight club', but after a while everyone heard the club and everywhere in the world, the head of the club, Tyler Durden had become a known person by everyone. How is it started? We have one more starring role named Jack. He was an asocial person and he had has a routine life. One day he met with Tyler Durden and after that, his life has changed. One day when they were drunk, Tyler provokes Jack to shoot himself. And it started like that, they create this group under the leadership of Tyler.

"Brilliant acting, a famous twist but still overrated","Yes, this one is are very good and entertaining movie with an interesting twist, not the best one in film history as some people say but still a quite good one, and a good acting of the two brilliant main characters without any doubt.What I dislike about the film is its slow paced introduction which I found somehow long and boring, the idea of the fight club and its intentions itself and that the whole thing seems logic to its members, the somehow exaggerated end and the fact that you don't get to know what the whole sense or intention of the terroristic organisation has to mean or not to mean in the end.All in all, this one of the movies you should have watched once in your life and which you should know to make yourself an opinion. This one is very popular and many friends from different countries are quite often talking about this movie so you should watch it to be able to discuss about it. I'm one of the rare people who don't give 9 or 10 points because I know weirder non mainstream movies with better twist, but from the popular ones of the genres, this one may be the most interesting movie and become somehow a kind of drug you get addicted to which may introduce you to other movies of the genre, for example the movies of David Lynch or Shyamalan or the real underground stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Breaking the first rule,"Fight Club is a distinct film. It has great actors like Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, great producing and the plot of a life time. Theres almost nothing not to love.The film is about an un-named depressed man (Norton) attempting to hide from his insomnia, by going to therapy meetings designed for men with testicular cancer. However, after going on a trip, his apartment burns down, forcing him to move in with the person he was sitting with on a plane.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.,"One of the most interesting and entertaining movies I've seen.At the beginning of the film, we follow the ""Narrator"" and his struggle with insomnia, and going to various support groups. On one of his flights, he meets Tyler Durden and the two become friends. They soon start an underground fight club that starts to develop into something bigger.The film is interesting for several reasons, not only because of the interesting plot, but because it is contradictory in itself. The film deals with how people have become a kind of shapeless mass, without a purpose and ultimately without what makes them human.When the Narrator meets Tyler, he draws out of him what is deeply suppressed within himself and it surfaces with interesting results.The director brilliantly explained in the film how subliminal messages are sent to the viewer in various segments, this is not something new, it is known to be done, and some things are particularly disturbing.The film, when watched to the end with understanding, provides an interesting perspective on the things that affect us as humans. The ending is particularly intriguing, precisely because it is contradictory and actually ends up turning out the way you might have thought it wouldn't. That's exactly what's interesting.In the end, the primordial in man actually wins, regardless of the fact that the story may at times suggest that it is not so, and even just before the end a change happens, but in the end it is irrelevant, the subconscious wins in the end regardless of everything.What the Narrator imagined and wanted to discard in the end, although he partially succeeded in the end, but the subconscious in him still did what it set out to do. To understand what I mean, you have to watch the movie.As humans, we are often in conflict with ourselves, and we struggle to let our good side prevail, which is what makes us human. Not everyone succeeds in this, and the consequences are often unfathomable. It is interesting that in this story both sides have their own arguments that are difficult to refute. That's what makes this movie interesting.In the end, the Narrator calmly accepts the inevitable and makes peace with himself.The film is truly exceptional, one of those films that became an instant classic. Definitely a film that is worth watching and which, in addition to excellent entertainment, gives us something more.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"If 'Donnie Darko' is the mystery edition of high school movies, 'Fight Club' is the mystery edition of Lethal Weapon... or something...","Just what the flippin' heck is this movie?!..The first third is ugly revolting dry nonsense.

If you think this is about fighting you fail to understand its message,"Fight Club stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, and is directed by David Fincher. The plot revolves around an unnamed narrator, who is bored with his job, until he befriends Tyler Durden, a care free person, and together they start a fight club. Fight Club was one of those movies where I watched it, and I felt inspired. Not inspired to start a fight club, but the overall message was what really spoke to me. Fight Club teaches the audience that we are scared of our lives, which is why we work those boring nine-five jobs because we do what society tells us to do. And that's why we buy stuff we don't need so we can also fit into society as well having the media hypnotizing us that one day we'll be happy with that one special person, but that's a lie. And if people refuse to accept that, well then you just haven't discovered the big picture. And no one explains that well than Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is the person that everyone wants to be him and act like him and he's my inspiration to me because he has a care free attitude toward life and I admire that. When Fight Club was released, it got terrible reviews, but later on it has become a cult movie. And i think the reason it has such a strong cult following, was because when it first was released, nobody understood it, but they instead they thought it was just about fighting. But there's more to it than fighting and that's where people fail to understand this film. And every time I watch Fight Club, the more i understand what it was trying to tell us. So in the end, Fight Club is a punk rock version of A Clockwork Orange, has a very strong message, and something you shouldn't ignore just because it has to do with fighting. And remember the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Beyond appearances: a critical examination of Fight Club,"There are movies that grab you by the throat and don't let go easily. ""Fight Club"" is one of those. Directed by David Fincher and based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, it's a cinematic work that has sparked discussions and controversies since its release in 1999. But while many praise it for its visual aesthetics and bold themes, it's important to dig deeper and look beyond superficial admiration to reveal its imperfections. One of the most problematic aspects of ""Fight Club"" is its portrayal of violence as a tool for liberation and self-realization. The film glorifies ruleless fights and the escalation of violence as a rite of passage for its male characters, a morally questionable and potentially harmful message. Violence should never be idealized as a means to resolve conflicts or achieve personal fulfillment, yet ""Fight Club"" seems to embrace this idea fervently, fueling damaging stereotypes about masculinity. Furthermore, the lack of coherence in the narrative is another Achilles' heel of the film. While it aims to be a social satire and a critique of rampant consumerism, ""Fight Club"" loses itself in its own ideals, shifting from insightful criticism to an unintentional celebration of what it seeks to condemn. This lack of clarity and coherence compromises the film's credibility and makes it subject to ambiguous and misleading interpretations. I found myself questioning multiple times what the film's true message was, without ever finding a satisfying answer. One of the most significant criticisms concerns the representation of female characters, particularly Marla Singer. Portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter, Marla is reduced to a mere love interest for the male protagonists, deprived of her complexity and humanity. This reductionist approach to the characterization of female characters is not only disappointing but also contributes to the perpetuation of gender stereotypes rather than challenging them. Women deserve more than being reduced to mere accessories in a film's plot, and ""Fight Club"" fails to recognize this fundamental truth. Finally, the film's ending was a blow to my sense of logic and coherence. The revelation of the connection between the narrator and Tyler Durden seems forced and unconvincing, undermining the plot's credibility and leaving many questions unanswered. After investing time and emotional energy in the story, I felt betrayed by a conclusion that seemed more interested in surprising me than in satisfying my narrative expectations. ""Fight Club"" is a film that finds itself in a sort of limbo between its potential and its imperfections. I cannot deny that it has moments of brilliance and provocation, but these qualities are overshadowed by its numerous shortcomings. The glorification of violence, the lack of coherence in the narrative, the representation of female characters, and the pretentious ending are all elements that compromise the overall quality of the film and limit its appeal. However, despite its imperfections, ""Fight Club"" continues to provoke discussions and reflections, a testament to its lasting impact on contemporary film culture.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Greatest movie ever, will make you think every thing our lives and how they play with us","Mind-bending and rebellious ride with ""Fight Club""! Here's my opinionated take on this cult classic:""Fight Club"" is a gritty and thought-provoking movie that packs a powerful punch. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are an explosive duo, delivering exceptional performances that will stick with you long after the credits roll.Norton plays an insomniac office worker who's disillusioned with his mundane existence. Enter Tyler Durden, portrayed by Pitt, a charismatic and anarchistic soap salesman who challenges everything our protagonist knows about life. Together, they form an underground fight club as a way to break free from society's constraints.What starts as a testosterone-fueled outlet for frustration quickly morphs into something much deeper. The movie delves into themes of identity, consumerism, and the human desire to break away from the confines of modern life. It's a dark and twisted exploration of masculinity, rebellion, and the human psyche.""Fight Club"" is raw, unapologetic, and thoughtfully chaotic. It's not just about the physical fights; it's about the internal struggles and the search for meaning in a world that often feels empty and superficial.The plot takes unexpected turns that will leave you questioning reality itself. It's the kind of movie that demands multiple viewings to fully grasp its brilliance.Aside from the thought-provoking themes, ""Fight Club"" is known for its iconic quotes, stylish direction by David Fincher, and a killer soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's edgy atmosphere.Now, be warned, ""Fight Club"" isn't your typical Hollywood fare. It's bold, it's daring, and it'll challenge your perceptions. But if you're willing to embrace its unorthodox brilliance, you're in for a cinematic experience that's unlike anything else out there.So, if you're up for a dark and mind-twisting journey that'll leave you questioning society and yourself, ""Fight Club"" is an absolute must-watch. Just remember, the first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Breaking Free: The Raw Truth of Fight Club,"""Fight Club"" isn't just about fighting. It's a movie that takes a hard look at life, showing us how easy it is to get caught up in what we own and what we're told to be. Through the eyes of the main character, played by Edward Norton, and his wild friend Tyler, played by Brad Pitt, we're taken on a journey that challenges everything about modern life. These two start an underground fight club as a way to deal with their frustration, but it turns into much more.This movie makes us think about our own lives, questioning how we live and what really matters. It's about finding out who we are when we strip away all the stuff we buy and the jobs we think define us. ""Fight Club"" tells us it's okay to push back against what everyone expects of us, suggesting maybe there's a different path to being truly happy and free.In simple words, ""Fight Club"" is a powerful reminder to not let life pass us by. It's for anyone who's ever felt stuck or wondered if there's more out there. It teaches us to look deeper at ourselves and the world, showing that sometimes, breaking the rules is the first step to finding out who we really are.",,Anonymous,Drama

Do you want to buy some soap ?,"10/10/2019 (4) Fight Club (1999) 9.6/10Non-spoiler-ish ReviewI'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Just straight up, this movie is ahead of its time.The story is a non-stop grandeur development.I can't spoil any bits of this masterpiece. Can only say: this movie is about a man. That's IT. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE. Or else, I'm gonna break the 2nd rule.When I first watched Fight Club in the 2nd year of university, I felt really skeptical. I was scratching my head throughout the whole movie's set up like why the hell is this even in the top 10 IMDB list.And I gotta admit, Fight Club is weird. It's complicated and it might feel like it's going nowhere. I could almost say that I was losing interest in the first act of the movie.But as things build up and just keep building up, I saw the beauty. For the first time in my life, I felt enlightened. I felt something more than just a movie. I was laughing throughout the middle act and then, I got hit really hard in the most disturbing and oddly satisfying way.A movie that can always provoke your thoughts the moment you start watching it again. Fight Club is vulgar, intense and so damn emotional.I would always say that this is neither an action movie nor a thriller movie. But it is Fight Club.

I need an 11th star... My personal favourite movie No. 1,"Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time, deserving an exceptional 11/10 rating. It stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic history, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional storytelling. David Fincher's direction, combined with a stellar cast, delivers an unforgettable experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. From the moment the film starts, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The brilliance of Fight Club lies not only in its captivating plot and visceral action sequences but also in its profound exploration of societal discontent and the human psyche. The enigmatic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are beyond extraordinary, capturing the raw essence of their characters with unparalleled intensity and authenticity. Pitt's Tyler Durden is a charismatic force of nature, while Norton's unnamed narrator is a haunting embodiment of disillusionment and suppressed desires. The chemistry between them is electric, fueling the film's unrelenting energy. The plot itself is a rollercoaster of suspense and unpredictability, leading to a mind-blowing twist that has become legendary in the annals of cinema. This revelation turns the entire narrative on its head, challenging our perceptions and forcing us to question the very nature of identity and reality. Fight Club's bold social commentary on consumerism, masculinity, and rebellion resonates deeply, making it a film that transcends mere entertainment. Fincher's meticulous direction, coupled with its gritty visual style and the iconic narration by Norton, creates an immersive atmosphere that is both dark and visually stunning. The film's impact goes far beyond its release, continuing to influence and inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. Fight Club is a groundbreaking work of art that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance. It is a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic gem, and a testament to the power of storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I am Jack's love for Fight Club,"As my movie-buff persona started growing, I decided to find out what movies were everyone's favorites. I looked at IMDb's top 250 and I was familiar and unfamiliar with some of the films on that list. I decided to watch some of the films on that list and I wanted to watch Fight Club first because it just attracted me in ways I can't explain. Watching Fight Club was an amazing and great experience. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but for me, it actually felt like the whole film was an hour and a half long! One of the many great things about Fight Club are the acting. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have oscar worthy performances in this film, and they are very different and unique characters. Helena Bonham Carter has very good acting in this film as well, and her and Brad Pitt are the funniest things in this movie. This film is probably one of the best dark comedies ever. The camera work in this film is outstanding. The zooms, the wide angle shots, and every frame in this film is beautiful. The ideas that Brad Pitt's character expresses are very thought provoking, and proves that this film has the style and the substance as well. The soundtrack is very catchy and the editing is also praise worthy. The twist (that I won't spoil) is also executed in such a creative way, it is one of the best parts of this film and it gives this movie rewatchability. I showed this film to one of my family members, and she said that the film was satisfying. I actually 100% agree with her because all of the lines that are said and the things that happen in this film all add up and gives out the sense of satisfaction.

Irresponsible filmmaking,"The fact that so many people liked this movie disturbed me. Is violence really the only way to escape societal constraints? Using consumerism as a straw man, the movie says that all males are, inherently, prone to violence and that society is denying them the right to exercise this innateness. After glorifying violence for 2 1/2 hours, the filmmakers decide to say ""but really violence is not quite as good as we might have led you to believe."" Most males will come out of this movie saying "" cool man. we should start a fight club so that we can be real men"" and that is irresponsible filmmaking.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama

Thethemes and events in the film are indescribable.Also, this is one of the few films that has PERFECT actors for its characters.Edward Norton is frighteningly convincing as the narrator, and Brad Pitt plays the incredibly strange character of Tyler Durden absolutely flawlessly.If you haven't already seen this movie, I would strongly recommend it. Gentlemen, fasten your seat-belts...Welcome to FIGHT CLUB!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Fight Club: A Dark, Daring Exploration of Identity and Rebellion","Fight Club (1999), directed by David Fincher, is a provocative and intense film that delves into themes of consumerism, identity, and rebellion. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the story follows an unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) who forms an underground fight club with the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as an escape from his mundane life. The film's dark humor, gritty aesthetic, and sharp social commentary make it a cult classic. Its twist ending challenges the viewer's perception of reality, and while some may find its violence unsettling, Fight Club remains a bold exploration of the human psyche and modern disillusionment.",,Anonymous,Drama
this level of nihilism is very hard to enjoy,"I hadn't watched this for twenty years and whilst I found that it had lost none of its power, it had more humour than I remembered (or perhaps was unable to take in on a first viewing) but was perhaps a little long. Intense with incredible yellow stained darkness throughout and brilliant performances from Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. Edward Norton is more subdued but this is intended and although his part is central and the largest, he is supposed to better represent the viewer. Apart from the nightmare sets there is the amazingly effective choreography of the fight scenes. Often hard to watch, the combination of fear and horror with a degree of sublime ecstasy creates an undoubted frisson. This becomes increasingly worrying, however, the deeper we get into the apparent organisation of something too big to control. Writer Palahniuk s probably one of the most imaginative, but concerning, talents today and this is a near faultless interpretation of his work. Its just that this level of nihilism is very hard to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"f**king unbelievable, that's what it is","before writing anything about this movie, i've to tell u that i'm a movie freak;i wouldn't be able to sleep if didn't watch a movie someday.i saw this movie in someone's hard disk,i saw the rating on IMDb was excellent but i didn't watch the movie then because the story didn't seem interesting to me.while watching other movies this one will always pop up in front of me,but i kept ignoring it.when i watched social network and the curious case of benjamin button i didn't bother to know who the director was, but when i watched seven i searched for the director and got the name David fincher;when i watched the game i searched for the director and oh it was David fincher again.then i thought if fight club is directed by David fincher then it must have something and gathered the courage to watch it....and then it just blew me off.how could i not watch such a movie before?how could i kept delaying it? this movie had so much to show me,it kept me engrossed the whole time that i didn't even bothered about what's happening around me, i just couldn't take my f**king eyes off the screen. i must tell u that this one is more than worth your time and of course edward norton and brad pitt;these guys are awesome.especially edward,he's one of the finest actors i've ever seen and he has shown why",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterpiece,"This is a superb movie on so many levels. Sometime movies get mixed reviews from critics due to the concepts or themes portrayed, or lack of understanding of a complex plot - that is exactly the reason here.If you are thinking you are going to see movie that just involves people kicking the crap out of each other, you would be very wrong. It is so much more than that.Just go and see it!The undertone attacks the society we live in today - consumer driven and unrealistic expectations. It also has themes of violence but at the same time has elements of black comedy.The acting throughout is superb - great performances from the 3 main character played by Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.***Spoilers***You may have to watch this movie several times before you fully understand it and pick up on all the nuances but I outline some below.When I first saw this I thought there was something wrong with the DVD because at a few points is seems to flicker (and does) not until I put it on super-slow motion did I realise it was intended. If you slow it down you can see it's his alter-ego starting to form. Not only is this alone brilliant but later on it is revealed that Tyler working at a movie theatre does the same thing - edits movies to insert just a frame or 2 - something you notice but are not entirely was there (like when I first saw it - as I said I thought there was a slight DVD fault). Extremely clever.When he is beating himself up in his bosses office he says ""for some reason I thought back to my first fight with Tyler"" why? Because it was exactly the same situation.How could a fight club possibly form? If you see 2 guys fighting in a parking lot you aren't exactly going to join in - but if you see a crazy guy essentially fight himself you could conceivably approach to see what is going on.When Tyler is banging Marla he speaks to Ed Norton and then slams the door, Marla says ""who are you talking to?"" we get to find out. There are many more instances like that, the film doesn't cheat but when you find out the incredible twist you aren't expecting it.The palette used is superb - bland, subdued, fitting in perfectly with mental illness. Then you get Brad Pitt, looks striking, blonde hair, unusual outfits - He doesn't fit in at all - again, we get to find out why. Superb.The themes about modern society are absolutely bang on too if you think about them. Are you rich and famous? Weren't we lead to believe we could be? Do we need most of the things we clutter our lives with?These a just a few things, there are so many more things you will notice, when you see it again and again.Like I said.

Powerful movie that changes your perception,"I saw this quite a long time ago and i think it was exceptionally brilliant. We think a movie can have certain limitations on its effect and direction but this movie shows you how awesome and well-directed a movie can be. This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die.The acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised. According to me this has one of the most unexpected endings and a moral message i have seen in a movie. You have to watch this 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
My most favorite movie,"almost 10 years have passed and I have not seen better movie than this. Many people are mistaken when they think that this film is all about fighting and nothing more. The truth is that it contains the most interesting and useful moral as you can learn in any other movie. In a few words the moral is that a man can obtain freedom (and therefore happiness) only when he/she has given up his needs and fears, that most of us are living according to society standards, living according to the style that we hate and in front of which we are actually made ourselves dependant. I have seen it more than 10 times and always noticed new ideas which are worth to think about, and most of viewers, who watch this movie many times, have said that they experience the same experience. I have also read Fight Club book and honestly and liked the movie better - this doesn't happen often - David Fincher did excellent job - the film has very unique and accordant style without exaggerations and the crew was very successfully build, actor play is faultless, there is nothing you would want to change.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Best Movie Ever Made,"When I entered IMDb.com the first thing I did was to check if anyone actually disliked this movie. And YES, there are people who gave the movie one star. This is a proof that every movie can be disliked by SOMEONE in the world, because Fight Club is with no argument the best movie ever made. It's the best combination of a great writer, great director, great actors, great music makers. And the outcome is a movie which needs to be watched 7-8 times to understand it. I watched it probably more than 8 times, and I still discover something new in the movie. Maybe a hidden frame, or an important word or sentence which I couldn't understand before. The enjoyment you'll get by watching it once is limited. You will like the movie more and more every time u see it and finally think it is the best movie ever made. There's no end to depth of the movie. And to my surprise, for the first time I see a movie is BETTER than its novel. The script writer took the novel, converted it into a movie script removing the boring and dull parts, and made it ready for an outstanding movie. This is actually why u need to watch it several times, because EVERY word, EVERY sentence has a meaning and no time and no line is wasted in the movie.If you're a movie lover, you have probably seen this movie.

Stunning film which needs a second watching,"i first watched this film a week ago, and since then bought it and made my girlfriend watch it with me. the opening sequence as the camera travels thru a human body while zooming out is breathtaking. it sets the motif of the film which is looking inside of oneself. the settings really lend themselves to Jack's life and the twisted philosophy that man can only achieve happiness thru self destruction is almost believable. the film has great performances from Norton, Pitt, Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf's tits, and reaches a shocking conclusion (which is why it needs a second watching). my girlfriend didn't really like it, complaining it had no real plot (which it doesn't especially) and the only good thing is the ending. i feel this is wrong, but the ending is what we end up judging all films by, ultimately.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Over-rated,"This is a set-piece for two of the finest contemporary actors in Norton and Pitt. Their performances as the narrator and Tyler Durden are superb, as any other review herein will show you. The cinematography is good, directing fine and the script at times good.However, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. The actors are clearly leading up to a climax which was predictable, had you seen more movies of this thriller/drama/action genre. If you want a brilliant ending, watch Primal Fear (Norton excellent), if you want a suave and well written script watch Chasing Amy and for an action movie with brutal fight scenes Raging Bull. For a complete movie that will move you and not leave you feeling empty and short-changed then the superb American History X or Marathon Man may be more your scene.The plot and so on is probably heavily disclosed in the reviews contained before and after this, beware reading these may lead you to anticipate the easily predictable ""TWIST"".Disagree with me after seeing all of the suggested movies, I dare you, here is the list again: American History X, Chasing Amy, Marathon Man, Primal Fear and Raging Bull.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fight Club: an Aristotelian look,"There's no doubt that Fight Club is one of my favorite movies. Its attractive and original style, its trapping story, its performances, its ending and its message turn this sequence of images with sound into an authentic masterpiece. I consider this film to be one of the best of all times.Fincher tells us the story of an unnamed character (the narrator) who has entirely devoted to his job and whose life completely lacks of meaning. This guy, who is very well interpreted by Edward Norton, suffers from insomnia and can't find the solution to his problem. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, which at first seems to be the cure to his sleeping disorder, but the presence of another impostor named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) ruins everything; Norton starts feeling uncomfortable. The narrator meets the man who is going to help him solve his problem, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden will try to open Edward's eyes; he will teach him how to leave everything behind, how to forget about the material stuff in order to discover the meaning of his life. They will co-found an underground club known as Fight Club.This film is the story of us, the story of everyone. This is a love tale that, camouflaged by a critic to capitalism and consumerism, talks about the pursuit of happiness, talks about finding the right person, the person that takes out our best selves. It is a story that strengthens values such us compromise, conviction, devotion, determination and love.Ten out of ten",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Its majesty Figh Club,"I've read few 1 star rated comments of FC and I got amazed how people who dislike this movie enjoy trashing and insulting people that find it masterpiece... I didn't like it at all first time I've seen it and if I knew about IMDb then, I'll surely give it 2-3 stars. But when I've seen it for the second time (even if I wasn't keen of it, friend made me) – all bits and pieces came in their places and I've realized that this is the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict, uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star givers classified us. It's their problem they want from movie to be linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters etc. It's their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is that ""this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain"" or ""it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem intelligent; instead of what it is insanity"". If it isn't sad, it would be funny...People can't make difference between satire and critics on the one side and glorification on the other side...

The people that don't like this movie generally fall into 2 groups,"The people that don't like this generally fall into 2 groups: Those that approach it believing its central theme is fighting and those that think it is shallow and represents everything it claims to be against.9 out of 10 people fall into the 1st category and feel let down when they realize that fighting encompasses a relatively small amount of the movie's content. They are what I classify as ""mouth breathers"" or the ""lowest common denominator"". They are incapable of ignoring their preconceived notions of the movie's theme and unable to judge the movie on what it really is. To them, it is a disappointment that they saw a completely different movie than they expected, and it is therefore sub-par in their narrow little world.The other 10% see the themes and story for what they are, but feel it's over-produced and ""too stylish"", something the movie purports to outright protest. What is lost on these poor souls is that was the exact point of why it is the way it is. It makes fun of itself, all the while protesting our modern culture. It's the ultimate self-deprecating humor.I know there are others who don't like the movie for a variety of reasons, but these are generalizations and are, therefore, generally true. There are exceptions, but these are what the majority of negative feelings for this movie encompass.To me, this movie is clever and full of great, dark humor. The violence these men engage in is the same kind of self-destructive behavior that ""cutting"" is for young women. They both feel numb to the world and cutting or fighting is the way they have chosen to ""feel"". Of course it's not a healthy way to address these emotional crises, but the movie uses it as a way of illustrating the lengths to which people sometimes go in their search for a cure to their despair.I enjoy watching this movie over and over again. It's one of the few movies that never gets boring no matter how many times I see it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant. Masterpiece. Soap.,"Fight Club. What can you say about Fight Club. It's awesome? Not enough. Brilliant? Not there yet. Should've won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress and Adapted Screenplay? You're on the right track. Stay with me and I will run you through the whys.Why should it have be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay? Not just because it was adapted from a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, because it spoke to a generation that understood all the philosophical bullcrap that came out of Tyler Durden's and the Narrator's mouths. But the philosophical bullcrap actually makes sense and shows perfectly each character's state of mind.Why should it have be nominated for Best Supporting Actress? Helena Bonham Carter was the only person who could've played Marla Singer. No one else could have acted as perfectly in the role as she did. As probably the only main female character in the film, she performs just as well as the rest of the male cast.Why for Best Supporting Actor? It should need no explanation. When you finish watching Fight Club, what do you remember most about the film? Brad Pitt. As Tyler Durden, he is more than perfect. He is the spokesperson for rebellious outcasts, a role that has done many times before, none as good as Pitt who immerses himself into the role. Slick, cool and crazy, it is undeniably one of the best performances of all time.Best Actor? Edward Norton matches Brad Pitt's performance with the key component of subtlety. Norton gives the performance of his career as the Narrator, a guy who has taken so much crap, he doesn't really give a damn. His performance as the Narrator tops his other brilliant performances in Primal Fear, Red Dragon and even American History X.Best Director? Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk's twisted novel and twisted it even more to make a world of his own vision. Without Fincher, this movie wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be the same cult classic that a lot of people come to love and worship.If you put all of these element's together, you get Best Picture. A story of violence, philosophy and soap. Fantastic direction, amazing cast and a brilliant screenplay put the pieces together.There you have it. Also, kudos on the editing and the music.Fight Club ****out of****.Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Language and Sexuality.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fincher's best film along with Se7en,"""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club""I will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list. In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.The movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing: jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously.Edward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

To looong,"I agree that the movie is good on many levels: the interesting characters, the visuals and the unhinged ending but I feel that this movie is way longer than it needed to be. Now, the story itself don't really have a plot it's more character driven, which I think was a bad choice considering that the characters never really have a goal they just do things to shock the viewer and that doesn't necessarily make the plot move forward. I also don't understand the character of Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) since she's just there to have another unhinged character in the movie , she's not really useful nor relevant for the plot she's just there to give you a few emo monologues and then disappear.

The Best Movie Ever Made,"As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year 2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it.Undoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of destructive concepts.The collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person experience in his book.Fight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the destructive side of humanitarian spectrum.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The film of an entire generation... masterpiece,"If someone has told you that ""you need to see this movie,"" then they're not far off. They're probably in their 20s or 30s and lived through that time when Starbucks was the next big thing, companies were starting to ditch dial-up for DSL, Casual Friday was the only motivation they ever had to live through the week, and their parents were too busy getting divorced to force them to go to graduate school.When it comes to periods within these eras of self-reflection, satire movies like Office Space come to mind. However, Fight Club goes a step beyond and then some, taking a look at how this lifestyle obsession invades every aspect of life, sinking into our personal lives, making it impossible to find a woman who doesn't despise your guts outside of the physical side of your relationship, where being clever and funny are the only things you have to keep yourself sane, and where a generation of MTV-raised, Saturday morning cartoons, post-Reagan politics, Hollywood-worshiping, McDonalds and 7-11 Slushees men are being turned into demasculated raving psychotics trying to find any escape from their misery.Fight Club comes along at a time in history where it's perfect. We have our narrator and his miserable insurance salesman life with a job he hates buying all the useless crap he doesn't need to fill his apartment to satisfy himself with what he thinks makes him perfect and socially acceptable. He becomes so sick of himself that he seeks any escape. He finds hope in support groups for men with testicular cancer and starts to regain his sanity, only to have his hopes shattered when he finds another faker in the group... a woman. Things spiral out of control when he finds a strange soap salesman on a business flight and starts to take great interest in his life. He then leads him to a path to hit rock bottom, to live among the dregs of society, redefine his masculinity and prove it to others. What begins as a weekend hobby soon collapses into a downward spiral of complete and utter destruction and a seemingly hopeless struggle to put the pin back in the grenade.The film contains line after line of brilliant writing and takes twists and turns where you least expect. Every character is acted perfectly and not a frame of film is wasted. Some have claimed this as quite possibly the least predictable movie to ever come out of Hollywood. I would completely agree. However, this is not its only strong suit. Fight Club incorporates elements from almost every genre: drama, horror, thriller, action, suspense, mystery, and romance just to name a few. It tackles so many subjects and has so many messages it's really hard to know what to look at first. This is one of those movies where everyone has a favorite scene and no one has the same favorite quote. A film that speaks for an entire generation of men and the future of our lifestyle obsessed society, Fight Club is an all-time favorite for me and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone.

"Fantastic, A must see","Chuck Palahniuk creates thrilling, captivating works for the mind of his readers. He is the author of 14 novels, two of which have already been made into movies and three other novels being considered or already in production to be major motion pictures. The first of Palahniuk books to move to film was Fight Club. Fight Club is a gripping page-turner unable to be put down until you realize you've read through the entirety of it in one sitting. Luckily, the movie held true to the book and might've even done a better job telling the story of Tyler Durden. The twisting thriller keeps you suspended until it blows your mind. The actors in Fight Club carry the movie fantastically; Edward Norton as the narrator, Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. Norton narrates as a character in the movie that moves in a run down house with Tyler Durden and then shares the life of Tyler Durden with the viewers. Marla Singer, the antagonist works her way into their lives, driving them crazy. To unleash their building frustration and deal with their excess testosterone, Norton and Pitt create what they call ""Fight Club"". ""The first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club."" The subtle hints in this film foreshadow beautifully. Small special effects and the ability to physically see the raise of an eyebrow or hear the narration while watching a fight scene actually happen add up to effectively blow your mind and make you question how you didn't see anything coming. The director, David Fincher, certainly shows his skill through this film. Seeing Fight Club and another of his dark, intense movies, Seven, it's simple to day this man has a unique vision. Fight Club is a must see. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One Of The Most Remarkable Films Ever Made.,"Fight Club Is without a doubt the craziest film I have ever seen. The twist in the film was spoiled for me so I won't spoil it for any of you guys. It took me way too long to finally watch this film and I regret not watching it earlier, it stars my favourite actor, Edward Norton, who's performance in American History was jaw dropping and another great actor known as Brad Pitt who stars in se7en which is also directed by David Fincher. Fight Club see's a no named man known as The Narrator (Edward Norton) go through his life dealing with insomnia. During this remarkable journey he meets a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on plane. After an accident which causes The Narrator's apartment to explode, then leads to him living with Tyler. After a night of drinking, the two drunk friends then start to fight each other, however, it isn't a fight to do with hate, the two remain friends. They fight once again after another night of drinking but this time they are spotted. The two that found Tyler and The Narrator fighting then ask if they can join in, this leads to more and more people joining in. They decided to call it Fight Club. I won't go any further as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone. Fight Club is probably my favourite film of all time and it should be watched ASAP. The acting and story make Fight Club arguably one of the greatest films ever made. I give Fight Club 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The most thought provoking movie ever!!!,"When I watched this movie for the first time,It was just another movie with some looser narrator trying to change his life. When I watched it again I started realizing the layers of this AMAZING movie.And now this is my favorite movie ever after GODFATHER. The narration with its DARK HUMOUR is absolutely amazing.Hats Off to David fincher for his visual style. The quotes in this movie are amazing, the ones like ""We are a generation of men raised by women,I don't think another women is the answer to my problem"".And the best part is the Awesome Twist in the end,The Twist would have been a clichéd one if it was not for the script writer and the director. Its a movie worth collecting and watching it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The rule of the Club is not to talk about the club. Is it necessary at all?,"The movie ""Fight Club"" was recommended to me by many friends who saw it before me. ""An interesting story, an amazing philosophy, good actors,"" they told me. I agree only with the latter. The cast and acting are top notch, but there are a lot of ""buts"" for me.I watched the movie for the first time many years ago, and I didn't like it. Years have passed and relatively recently I decided to revise it, thinking that since everyone praises it, then most likely I did not understand something, I missed it. And I looked at Pitt and Norton again. And, you know, I suddenly realized that nothing was missing. The emotions were the same. Movies are not for me.Acting, as I have already said, is at the highest level. Edward Norton is gorgeous. Perfectly conveys a certain note of schizophrenia of his hero, who seems to be chasing a shadow, and the vis-a-vis is literally one step ahead of him. And it's interesting to see who it will be in the final.Brad Pitt perfectly conveys the energy of his hero. He is fast, decisive, confident in himself and his rightness. He's like a mentor to his new friend, played by Norton. You agree with him in many ways, but the whole film does not leave the feeling that he is fundamentally wrong.Helena Bonham Carter is one of my favorite actresses. She always has some wild roles. And here she successfully fits into the gloomy scenes, accompanying the main characters. She manages the image well. He is both attractive and repulsive, causes contradictory emotions in the viewer. That's what's great about him.But when the film ends, you suddenly realize that the ideas they are trying to present to the viewer lead to nothing. A fight club where everyone can find themselves, their perfection, ideas about undermining the current world. Probably, someone will say that I did not understand the meaning of the picture. Let. I saw in this film the idea as follows: they are trying to impose on me the illusion of another perfect world, calling for the destruction of the current order. Blow up the houses, see how this world will be reborn.The finale of the film makes me personally regret the time spent, because it is illogical, even chaotic. It is shown that the accumulated anger towards everything unfair in the protagonist can lead to such a finale, he will create something that can blow up the whole society. But all this looks unreal, as does the general narrative.I love the main actors, they have many wonderful works, but I didn't like the work in this film, like the whole picture.3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing Satire and Philosophy,"Undeniably one of the best films of the tremendous cinematic year that was 1999, David Fincher's Fight Club is a cultural landmark. Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic first novel (and still the best the 5 of his books that I've read) is visualized with Fincher's stylistic creativity and the result is a modern classic.Edward Norton plays a white collar stiff, whose life is so nondescript that he is known only as The Narrator. He acknowledges that he is mired in shallow consumerism; a slave to the ""IKEA nesting instinct."" He is also an insomniac and can only find catharsis and sleep after sitting in on 12-step program meetings for dying people. This strategy fails, however, when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) pulls the same stunt and ruins the reality that he has found. After an explosion that destroys the narrator's apartment, he moves in with soap salesmen and revolutionary Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, they start an underground society in which men reject civilization and unleash their primal urges upon each other.Fight Club is often described as anti-consumerism or anti-establishment. There are, however, two less talked about ideas that I take away from it. The first is the conflict between biology and society. Sitting on a bus, the protagonists see a rather gaudy advertisement for Gucci underwear. Durden asks derisively, ""Is that what a man looks like?"" I would argue that it is the insidious nature of the consumer culture, that it actually emasculates men by tapping into their male drives. It is the natural role of the male to be the hunter/gatherer, so buying things has become the modern incarnation of this. Another example of this interplay occurs when the narrator described how his father would leave his family to start a new one every six years. ""Setting up franchises,"" says Durden. Interestingly, the behavior described here does approximate the behavior of human males, pre-civilization. The short average duration of modern marriages suggests the hard-wired nature of this behavior. The fight club, however, is an outright rejection of modern society, in which men revel in short bouts of non-lethal violence, perhaps as they were meant to. When these urges are bottled up, it may not be too much of a stretch to suggest that the result can be wars and genocide.There are also, I believe, religious implications to the fight club and to Project Mayhem. Tyler Durden's philosophy seems to be part anarchism and part determinism, behaviorism and materialism (in the metaphysical sense; certainly not in the consumerist sense). He is about three parts B.F. Skinner and one part Henry David Thoreau. It is those facets of Skinner-type philosophy that are of the most interest to me and that Durden espouses most fervently. Like any good materialist, he utterly rejects the notion that human beings have any special worth. He extols to his followers: ""You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else... We are all part of the same compost heap."" Yet ironically, in supposedly freeing his followers from consumerism, he makes them slaves to his own purposes. They are shaved to become like the oft-mentioned sacrificial ""space monkeys."" They are removed of their names (this has a very anti-Christian feel to, since the having of and giving of names by humans is considered an important gift from God among the most meticulous followers of that religion). ""Sooner or later we all became what Tyler wanted us to be,"" says the narrator. Durden also expropriates the idea of 'hitting bottom' as the beginning of salvation (the 12-step program is a fundamentally religious construct), further casting him as a sort of Anti-Christian. B.F. Skinner suggested that understanding the science of human behavior was the key to controlling that behavior benevolently. Similarly, Durden exerts control over his followers for what he believes are good ends. Whatever the merits of those ends, there is no doubt that Tyler, in some ways, becomes very much like the corporate fascists he despises.Finally, Fight Club is a definitively 'male' movie. This is neither good nor bad, but it is undeniable. The character of Marla is entertaining, but almost entirely defined by her relationship to the two male protagonists. The picture would have almost worked without her. The idea of castration is presented as a deeply held male fear and is used skillfully throughout the movie. If we can take one thing away from this film, it would be the danger of denying the difference in biology between males and females. Males have a need for some level of violence and it is important that we have acceptable outlets for it. Conversely, it is interesting to take note of some of the ways in which society attempts to homogenize the sexes. Take the idea of ""paternity leave"" for new fathers - it's great in theory and it should certainly be an option, but I can almost guarantee that it will never become the norm, because it is a practice that is just so contrary to our deeply ingrained biological drives. To deny this is the height of naivety and will do no one any good.Overall, Fight Club makes my top 10 list for superb acting (especially by Norton, the best American actor of his generation), great humor and satire and its excellent script, thanks largely to the excellent source material. To conclude, I'll quote the deterministic, yet strangely comforting words of Chuck Palahniuk, from near the end of Fight Club (the book): ""We are not special. We are not crap or trash either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This movie is beyond perfection,"This is the kind of movie that when it ends your not really sure what to think about it but after a couple of days you totally love it and want to see it over and over again. Seeing Fight Club is an experience totally new for everybody, there is no other movie like it and there will never be, not until i´m guessing 10 years more. Because thats the time it´s gonna take (i hope) to people to understand the movie and really understand it. If students of film making are now studying Kubrick i´m sure they will study David Fincher in the future. Fight Club has great speed, in dialogues and actions, it has a great cast (even Meat Loaf was good) and most important it was deep, so deep that nobody notice it was deep because the deepiness of Fight Club is beyond tears and silences like the usual deep movies.

One of the best films of the decade and also one of the most important,"The first time I saw ""Fight Club"" I despised it. I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including ""The Matrix"" (which is not quite as realistic as ""Fight Club""). I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible, but still didn't enjoy it much.However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb (it's now #41).Well I'm happy to report that I found ""Fight Club"" utterly brilliant on third viewing. Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time: Tyler Durden (whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of ""Taxi Driver"" - according to something I read the first name is harsh, the last name simple and soft).Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator, ""Jack,"" whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed. (Many people don't seem to notice this.) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well. Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful. It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being ""a laborious dog"" on its initial release. The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish, and I can understand why some might view ""Fight Club"" as a very childish, contradictory film. (After all, I used to think the same thing.) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws. I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary. Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly. Fincher is great behind the camera.And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed, but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now.Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people (myself included) back in 1999. In a year of some really good movies ""Fight Club"" was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films.It's easy to see how this might be considered the next ""Taxi Driver"" thirty years from now.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Film that you hate to love,"I still think that I shouldn't like this film. That I shouldn't allow myself to like this film. Its worldview is so ugly, so nihilistic and corrupted, that you actually fear that your own morals darken just by looking at it. Sure you justify it to yourself by telling that it's actually telling us not to give into hate, not to believe that our lives have no meaning, not to realize that we're just corporate puppets. And yes, the film actually carries a warning undertone, showing why people like Tyler Durden cannot be correct.It's hard to tell yourself that when you're watching the actual film though. Because in all honesty Brad Pitt is so good in this film, so magnificently charismatic, that it's no wonder that some people actually went and started their own fight clubs. No wonder that Tyler Durden has been voted the best movie character of all time numerous times. The man is that good in his role. And it is a distinct possibility that our society would be better off if he weren't, because in all honesty Tyler Durden is everything that we shouldn't be.And that's what makes this film so damn good. It is the ugly underbelly of human condition, of modern society. It's not nice to look at, it won't make you feel any better, but damn if isn't one heck of a trip to experience. This movie is so convinced that what it's saying is the God's truth that you have no choice but to be pulled in, even momentarily.But it's not just the message. It's a great movie even without the story and the character of Tyler Durden. The style, the art direction, the camera work, the rest of the cast, the music, the dirty jokes, the plot twists, the sheer ugly charisma. You might never like this film, no matter how often you can force yourself to watch it, but you can never deny that it's not a brilliant piece of film making. And that is why I think everyone should see it at least once. Because it's the end of the spectrum, as of now.

"And I thought it was a ""Van Damme-style"" action movie...","I won't write a lot about this film, mainly because my English is very poor, but also because the most important things about ""Fight Club"" were said and written in previous comments. What I'd like to state here is: I sat down one night in front of my TV set and started watching ""Fight Club"", because I really hadn't anything better to do that very night. I remember I thought ""it should be another ""Van Damme-style"" action movie, with a bunch of tough guys trying to beat the crap out one to another, with the power of their fists"". Well, the title didn't gave me any hope of getting something better. The movie started and the fights didn't, at least for a long while. What i saw was a very philosophical movie that captured my attention from the very beginning to the very end. And yes, if I expected for some action, the action was there too... but just as an exclamation mark, to enforce the whole idea of the film.

A movie better than its book,"I first saw Fight Club about two years ago.  Of course, I loved it.  I own the soapbox DVD.  So when the time came for me to choose some reading material last summer, I picked the book to read and see how it compared. I actually liked the movie better than the book.  I think it is better than the book, something that does not happen often (see Jurassic Park, both versions of Red Dragon, many Stephen King translations to film, etc.)The book is definitely unique.  It is told like the poems the Narrator reads about Jack's organs.  It is a lot of first person dialogue from a guy you are sure is a wimp.  I think the movie improves on it by the gimmicks like the changeovers and frames inserted.  Moreover, I feel the ending to the book was rather lacking and disapointing (maybe because of the great ending to the movie).  Most importantly, I think the movie emphasizes the actual Fight Club/Project Mayhem aspect better.  It is a major source of conflict in the film, while more of a backdrop in the book.  The book is more of an exploration of the relationship with Marla and the narrator's state of mind. It's also very short (if you try, you can read it in a day), while the movie is over two hours long.  If you read the book, you'll see a lot of the dialogue is lifted from there, but I think some of the quotes from the movie are snappier (the ""I want to have your abortion"" line on the alternate take found on the DVD is from the book, but the line ""I haven't been f**ked like that since grade school"" is just hilarious.)  About the only scene I could see from the book making the movie better/funnier is Tyler cooking Marla's mom's collagen ""gift.""The movie's very deep.  We, the audience, see characters in the same light as the Narrator does as the movie progresses.  Though Tyler seems to be the perfect buddy and collaborator, we all soon find him to be just a psycho and the liberated space monkeys as lemmings.  The despised Marla (I am Jack's raging bile duct) we all come to find endearing... somehow. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most significant movie in my life,"One night I decided to intrude into neighboring computers in the local dormitory network. Nothing personal, just looking for movies and mp3s. The very first file I came across was an avi version of ""Fight club"". It was a stroke of luck since all I could find in the next few months was almost worthless, but as for this movie - it was SO about time for me! The last thing I paid attention to is the fights proper. But I was appealed to this ingenious depiction of the suffocating atmosphere of contemporary consumerism and inability of an average person to lead a meaningful, and therefore satisfying, life. The movie deals with insomnia and its underlying causes, the charm and usefulness of self-destruction as well as the limitations of this approach. It also makes you wonder how far you would go with transforming your personality to avoid desperation, as opposed to changing yourself for the one you love. The picture radiates an unexpected healing power - neither due to the cinematographic merits per se, nor because of a happy ending or positive message. I suppose, at least for the actual target audience, it is the feeling you're not alone and there are many other ""lost souls"" out there choking and coping with it just the way you do. For me and a good friend of mine the movie actually meant accepting our attitude towards existence and trying to live up to this perception. We often found each other drinking and watching the movie simultaneously when one emailed his buddy and passed him a reflection that occurred to his mind during the film. Now this period is over but we still know many episodes by heart and keep a very warm feeling to the movie for all it gave us then. I guess there is no need to discuss the excellent work by David Fincher and the cast  the well-earned praises abound elsewhere. But I do highly recommend finding the script by Jim Uhls (available in the internet) and purchasing a double DVD set. The extras, such as ""This is your life"" music video, render it an excellent bargain.Go ahead and watch the movie. It's not about fighting others; it's about challenging your life of convenience and compromise. Watch, then think, then watch again. Just like that special ""Paper street soap"" by Tyler Durden, it both feels good on the skin and it actually cleanses you.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
the poor vicitimized upper-middle-class white man?,"Despite the clever crafting of this film, it is basically a complain-fest about the poor upper-class privileged white male blaming all his woes on Ikea.

Is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up? It's even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 9-11 take this film's logic into reality...is the point of this movie to say that American commercial freedom SHOULD be attacked?With all the sexification and glamorizing of violence, and its poor-me ranting against consumer products (rather than taking responsibility for one's own commercialism or participation in it), it's hard to find a redeemable net-sum to this movie.Ed Norton is, as always, terrific.

Fincher will always be one of the best modern directors but this film is undoubtedly the high point of his career.

The characters are portrayed remarkably, and the main actors gave brilliant performances. The movie is quite difficult to grasp at first glance and you may need to watch it a few times to fully understand. However, this may just be my judgement.

Don't talk about Fight Club,"The first rule of Fight Club is ""Don't talk about Fight Club."" But we're going to break the first rule of Fight Club and talk about Fight Club.Fight Club is possibly one of the last original movies made, before Hollywood started ripping off, reimagining and remaking everything that ever made Tinseltown money.So if for some reason, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, when you get done reading this, go out and rent Fight Club.A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And Fight Club is a good movie. And one that stays with you long after the credits begin rolling.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Brad Pitt (Who I'm not a fan of by the way) is perfectly cast as Tyler Durden (and he seems to be having a very good time here) Helena Bonham Carter can always be relied upon for a good performance, here once again, she is superb. As for Edward Norton, it became apparent the year before this movie, with 'American History X' that he was one talented actor destined for great performances in great roles.His first movie was opposite Richard Gere in Primal Fear in 1996. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting actor which he lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. for 'Jerry Maguire' He also won a Golden Globe. Not bad for his first time out. He the. Worked with Woody Allen before his second Oscar Nomination for 'American History X' he lost this time to Roberto Benigni for 'Life is Beautiful'. Benigni also beat out Tom Hanks for 'Saving Private Ryan'. Boy did the Academy get that one wrong!But this was to be his last great movie. (As of 2014 at least) He has had had a few minor hits since then but there has been something missing in most of his work between then and now.So, what the hell happened?Bottom line, Norton got a reputation for being difficult. Lots of people think of Norton as an absolute control freak. That Norton is not someone you want to work with.Also, Norton isn't shy about airing his opinions to anyone who will listen. If Norton feels like he hasn't gotten the credit he is due, he will shout it from the rooftops. If he isn't happy with the final cut of a movie, he simply promote it. That is frowned on in Hollywood where stars are expected to support their movies no matter what.Brad Pitt (as I've said I'm not a fan) settled for being a famous A List superstar than making good movies I often said outside the Oceans Franchise ensemble, and with the exception of 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'The Assassination of Jessie James By The Coward Robert Ford' Pitt has not made a good movie since Seven. But I love his performance here. I don't believe another actor could have played the role of Tyler Durden as well as Pitt.But back to the movie.Given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience despite the premise of the movie. The studio wanted to market Fight Club to women because of Pitt. But they knew the film's violence would appeal more to men. It was a tricky one. In the end they hired an ad agency. They did a great job of promoting a tricky movie.Go watch Fight Club.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best movie I've ever seen,"This movie has a lot of good things for just one review: A brilliant script, wonderful direction by Fincher, beautiful performances by Pitt and Norton, perfect soundtrack...",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Fight-Club Manifesto,"This is how `Fight Club' operates: through the emblematic `bar of soap' which decorates its marketing posters (and rather extensive ad campaign including fake office-equipment brochures), the presentation of a harmless icon gives way to a sweepingly critical exegesis of consumer capitalism. David Fincher's adaptation of the book by Chuck Palahniuk offers a quasi-postmodern view of Marxist themes as they apply to the culture of early twenty-first century capitalism. Fincher's `quasi-postmodernism' comes through in his presentation of the bi-level narrative within `Fight Club;' his Brechtian disregard for conventional aesthetic form is enacted by his consistent breaks `through the fourth wall' (i.e. narrative exegesis of plot details directed toward the audience). His use of `C.G.E.' (computer-graphical-effects) throughout the film are unobtrusive, and serve to visually heighten the suggested themes of technocratic, `corporatarchic' (ruled by corporate interests) fears which are implicit within the culture of late capitalism. Thus, while the film's narrative thread is presented in a chronologically linear fashion, the paroxysmal, disjointed presentation of its bi-leveled crescendo toward climax distances the audience in a manner similar to any non-linear film. Essentially, in postmodern terms, Fincher perfects the `verfremdung' (alienation) effect without having to resort to the manipulation of chronology. Not coincidentally, the term `verfremdung' has its roots in Marxist theory: `Capitalism is only second to slavery in its ability to alienate the worker' (Marx, Philosophical and Economic Manuscripts). This concept of `alienation' is at the root of the central tension within `Fight Club:' just as capitalism's exploitation of productive forces alienates the proletariat from the fruits of her/his labor, so does the culture of late capitalism's forced sublimation of impulsive action alienate the individual from her/his emotions. To put it plainly, the culture in which a Twinkie-factory-worker must purchase a Twinkie with a portion of her income is the same culture in which she is forced to find emotional catharsis in furtive forums of collective release. Tyler says: ""we're an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; we're slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy sh*t we don't need. We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We have no great war, no great depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off."" . . . And thus is summarized the `Fight Club' manifesto.",,Anonymous,Drama
Truly a thought provoking film,"It's strange that I put off viewing this movie for a long while. The title is misleading and does not summarise the true notion of this film.'Fight Club' is a top notch movie in all aspects. The introduction sequence cleverly interests the viewer from the moment the feature begins. It's truly amazing that this movie works on so many levels, from the ideas that it puts forth, to the way it's shot to convey them.Both Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's characters are excellently portrayed, and they pique the viewers curiosity in many ways; despite being seemingly polar opposites, they have great chemistry. Their growth throughout the movie is exciting, and Marla's (Helena Bonham Carter) character adds the little bit of 'love' interest to mix things up (hectically). It was intriguing that I found Tyler's (Brad Pitt's) character more likable than The Narrator's, (Edward Norton) despite him being a rambunctious anarchist and The Narrator being the typical materialistic consumer. It's strange, in a way, that I should think this; Tyler's actions are extremely questionable, but I felt envious of his personality and behaviour. This movie's ability to question your own morals and today's views on society are well thought-out and acted.Fight Club not only invokes feelings for the characters, but the very society we live in today. Granted, it is a character-driven plot which formulates this. The pacing of the movie is perfect despite the long running time; the story slowly and steadily flourishes as more and more of the main characters lives are revealed through the Narrators dialogue and his interactions with them.Another thing I should mention is the superb directing. David Fincher creates a great mood with camera views, musical score, dialogue, and lighting. The characters never seem out of place, and the mood of the scenes are subtly (and not so subtly) interwoven. The plot twists towards the movie's conclusion are not complicated as to completely confuse the viewer, however, they are clever enough to keep you guessing until 'the revelation'.Overall, Fight Club is an excellent movie with many strong points, whether it be direction or production. It almost instigates the viewers need to come to terms with themselves and their lifestyle, something that many movies do not do.Do not misjudge this movie simply by the title, or you may miss out on one of the most greatest and thoughtful films ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""The First Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club. The Second Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club.""","Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrator's only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn't care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - "" Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry, so once again I couldn't sleep"".Shortly after Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is introduced into the story, the main character loses everything he valued. Deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. If the narrator is a worker who's way too worried about his condo and his job, Tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn't care less about all those things. The contrast between them is clear; Tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - ""Right. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession."" The characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free, while the other is not. Tyler, in a nihilistic way, helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. The self-destruction promoted by the Fight Club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. Little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job, about behavior and the value of things. It's interesting to note that the narrator doesn't quit his job immediately, picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.Many subtopics are discussed through the movie. We see the narrator and Tyler, now living together, talking about many things. They talk about how both had an absent father, how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - ""He says, 'get a job'. So, I'm 25, I call again and say, 'now what?' He says, 'I dunno. Get married"". The nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we're born, while both of them agree on that, they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. It's important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people, especially with women as Tyler comments - ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need"".As the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don't need"". Tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator, but they're striving to be more like him. At some point, Tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call Project Mayhem. While the original Fight Club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom, through self-destruction, to its members, Project Mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. The frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel's back - ""We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pi**ed off"". However, the narrator starts to slowly go against what Tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it's the moment the movie reaches its climax.The genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that Tyler Durden and the narrator are the same person, they have always been the same person. Due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life, he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn't as a system abiding person. The contrast created by Tyler's different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about Tyler Durden is even more marvelous. This movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number, just a braindead member of society, having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. In the end Tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can't be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. The final scene is beautiful; what could be better than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while ""Where is my Mind"" plays? This movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. It is provocative, funny and thrilling and most importantly: It is so damn real. The plot aged perfectly and I don't think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Greatest Film Ever Made,"It had me at, ""When there's a gun in your mouth, you can only talk in vowels."" When I discuss this to those who've never seen it, I don't know where to start, and when I talk to those that have and they say ""it was okay"" or ""I didn't get it"" they make me want to grab them like the narrator wanted to grab Marla. Simply put, it's flawless. From the way it's adapted through the writing, to the way it's shot, Fincher's choice of music, editing, and of course performances. It's pacing should be studied in every film school and it's style is simply organic and original. The character development is uncanny and it's subliminal yet outward messages of a primal world is like heroin for the soul searching self-help enthusiast. I can go on and on, I actually love that this film is so often overlooked and has since been deemed a contributor to ""toxic masculinity"" because it removes the wannabes and hypebeasts. It's unapologetically truthful and raw, and that's what hits you to the core if you're a true lover of this film (if you can't tell this is my favorite film of all time already).

Up to you...,"After reading numerous comments I feel it's safe to say that this film has gained somewhat conflicting responses from its viewers. I honestly loved this film, the story is incredible, and the execution from novel to motion picture is brilliant.The majority of the ""Hated it"" comments (that I read) were somewhat contradictory. It seemed that the people who disliked it did so because they saw a standpoint on western society that they did not like, they saw something that they disagreed with and were discomforted by it. However, I feel that this is what Fight Club is all about. This film shows the discrepancies between those who question purpose and those who don't. This movie affected me because it made me see something in myself and the people around me, something that I did not necessarily like. Not many films have the ability to that that to a person, and I feel that's what makes Fight Club so excellent.I can see how this film could be considered depressing or twisted by some viewers but I feel it's anything but.Chuck Palahniuk uses Fight Club as a vehicle to express his own thoughts and to depict the spiritual struggle of the modern man. Ironically this film provides relief for those feeling mediocre, or slaves to the ""IKEA nesting instinct"" through the catastrophic outcome of the fight club mentality. This film provokes thought by showing that the seditious behaviour of middle-aged men searching for meaning solves nothing but their own psychological battles.Casting, screenplay, cinematography and story, all excellent in my own opinion.10 Out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS.,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Fight Club is one of those movies that is so unique and really shows how much movies have evolved since classics such as Double Indemnity or Vertigo or The Third Man. This movie is psychological testosterone. There's so much depth in the dialogues such as 'This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time' or 'We're the middle children of history man' or 'You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world' and my favourite 'How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?'I would go as far as to say that this is an important film. There is so much the film asks of the viewer.

I kept hoping that it would get better.I understand the ""materialism is bad"" theme. I also understand the concept of Ed Norton's character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with Brad Pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted.What I don't get is after starting the fight club, why start making bombs and blowing up buildings?So, the point that I get from this movie is that it is OK to start and/or join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy, pathetic and generally miserable with their life.I guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous, did not have friends or love ones in the World Trade Towers or the Pentagon.Because, wasn't it a bunch of unhappy, miserable, materialist-hating people that bombed both of those places?The only thing that makes me depressed are movies like this.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

I want you to hit me as hard as you can.,"This is your movie. It's playing one minute at a time.Ladies and Gentlemen, this film will forever be in my top 5 favorite films of all time. I've never been more impressed with editing and storytelling done so stylish yet clearly readable at the same time. Every shot has a mood. Every cut is perfect. Every poetically narrated line is memorable. Every scene is profound. The strange music gets you into the original mood that the film emulates. Every character is defined. You can relate to every character in some way, whether it be a bit of yourself or a bit of someone you closely know. This film, if you're open enough to pay attention to its meaning, will set you free of the burden of becoming a pack rat trapped in the rat race. Of course, in the end, we're given a balance of philosophy. ""The Man"", and the human spirit can manage to find harmony, once given the proper grown-up philosophy, I suppose.The only god I worship is Tyler Durden. Well...maybe not worship. More like agree with and try to live by the same thoughts. Don't get me wrong. If I were that close to his lifestyle, living in a dilapidated house in the middle of a seedy part of town, I probably wouldn't be able to type this review. I also wouldn't be sharing fluids with the likes of Marla Singer. Ewwww...Joon B. Kim is one of the luckiest guys in the world in my book. Not only did he get his own scene with Brad Pitt holding a gun to his head in back of a convenience store, but he participated in what I think is one of the most inspirational scenes in cinema history. Just ignore the soda machine advertising itself in the background. Why is it that those set dressers think that convenience stores would put their soda machine in the back? Not a a very convenient convenience store.I can never get sick of this film, unless I watch it over and over for every waking moment for every day of the rest of my life.

Pet dogs do a pretty good job of subsuming their aggressions. But they have one hell of a pack instinct to help them out.

"A fantastic political statement, not to mention a genius of a film","This is truly superb, one of the best films I have ever seen. This film has a very funny sense of humour, gritty fight scenes, clever concepts, a very clear political agenda and most importantly, one of the best endings of all time.David Fincher has seriously come on leaps and bounds since the disappointing Alien 3. As with Seven, his directing is spot on. It's dark and murky just like an underworld fight culture would be. At the same time, very good special effects are integrated within the film. The plot moves forward tremendously and sets the viewer up nicely for the ending. There is a fair amount of shock imagery in the film such as Norton's fight against Jared Leto. I don't mind violence in films but that particular scene is so relentless that it is hard to watch.Acting from everyone in this movie is superb. Norton gives his best performance after American History X. His delivery of dialogue is laden with sarcasm and is a joy to watch. The many character transformations he goes through is entirely believable. Pitt is also on top form, definitely better suited to playing edgier roles such as this and Twelve Monkeys to Meet Joe Black et al. Helena Bonham Carter is very sexy in this role, whilst at the same time, utterly repulsive. A very strong lead certainly does this film many favours. Meat Loaf is also a great character in the film who has a great rapport with Norton's character.A surprisingly psychological film, I would like to know what Freud would have thought of this film. This film actually got mentioned in one of my University lectures so it obviously has impressed the academic world somewhat. What is really fascinating is Tyler's anarchic solutions and how his ideology, whilst floored, does have its intentions. His Marxist beliefs are much more pure than those of Lenin in the Communist Russia era as Tyler even intends for himself to be insignificant within Project Mayhem. The relationship between Pitt and Norton is great to watch as it leads to great character development and adds to the humour of the film.Anyone in to suspense, black comedy, psychological thrillers or action will love this film. It is definitely one of the best films of the decade and has a massive following that will love it forever. Brad Pitt has never been so good and his performance as Tyler Durden is now legendary.

David Fincher's Best and One of My Favorites,"I'm just going to cut to the chase: FIGHT CLUB is awesome. I wish the marketing for the film had been a tad more honest because I put off seeing this movie until almost a decade after it was released. And, even then, I only watched it because I was at a buddy's place and needed something to watch. I was totally caught off guard because I'd always assumed it was just some testosterone-fueled beat-down with some bare bones semblance of a plot. This was before I knew of the awesome that is director David Fincher or author Chuck Palahniuk. This movie is much more than I expected, it's masterfully done, and it's developed a bizarre following on the Web. I just think it's an awesome movie. It's become one of my favorites. The movie follows a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) who narrates the film. He's an insomniac wallowing in his empty life when he crosses paths with a charismatic soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the Narrator's apartment goes up in a mysterious explosion, he turns to Durden and together they form an underground fight club where men can let loose and beat the tar out of each other. The fight club is only the beginning, as the clubs gain popularity and spread across the nation. The members eventually devolve into a near cult status with Tyler Durden as their leader and the next phase of his grand schemes comes forth: Project Mayhem. Have I mentioned that FIGHT CLUB is awesome?The movie's got everything I could ask for: slick humor, brutal fights, a complex plot, and great characters. I really enjoyed SE7EN but FIGHT CLUB would be the movie that solidified David Fincher as one of my favorite directors. It's become a modern classic that I've seen on countless top-ten lists. The movie touches on a variety of subjects that brought controversy and mixed reactions from critics and audiences. The movie (or more specifically, the character of Tyler Durden) has become an icon for his anarchistic views and anti-establishment terrorism. His anger towards consumerism and our culture's obsession with its possessions is a powerful message, but his acts of domestic terrorism don't seem to hurt his cause much. There is a lot going on in this movie and, with its perfectly built reveal at the end, there is a lot to love here. Even knowing the ""surprise"" from the end before settling in to watch this movie, I was blown away. I love the dark humor in the movie, with some of the best moments occurring when characters break the fourth wall. The style of the film works perfect with the dark content and would become the first of many collaborations between Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth with a visual signature that's easy to recognize. All of the elements of this movie come together to make one of the best modern films and a favorite to many (most of them apparently on the Internet). Really, I'm not surprised.I figure it's a given that Edward Norton is a talented actor. I've loved his performances in pretty much every movie I've seen him in. So there's nothing to worry about here as he plays the nameless Narrator, a corporate drone whose life has been much been sapped from him. Norton makes a perfect straight-man to the insanity he invites into his life. His introduction to Tyler Durden is both the best and worst thing that has ever happened to him. Durden is, of course, Brad Pitt. The best part about Pitt in the role is that it made me respect him. I'd always seen Pitt as your average Hollywood pretty-boy but his turn as a total lunatic in FIGHT CLUB proved that he had some skills. He's insane and totally charismatic. It's not hard to see how people could buy into his crazy anti-establishment preachings. He's equal parts hilarious and threatening with absolute confidence in his practices. And then there's Helena Bonham- Carter as Marla Singer, a walking corpse fresh out of a Tim Burton movie. She somehow manages to be attractive while slinking through the film looking like a meth addict. She's the ""not love interest"" to Edward Norton. A bizarre parallel to the Narrator's skewed views of reality. Finally, I have to mention Meat Loaf. Yes, for those of you who somehow haven't seen the film yet, Meat Loaf is in the movie as Bob. He's a minor character, but there's no forgetting Bob and hisuhdeformity. Good stuff. There's a hundred reasons to give this movie a chance so I recommend it. If nothing else, it's a great movie to provoke some interesting post-viewing conversation.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I waited 14 years to watch this movie,"Okay, I didn't get to watch this movie from start to finish until 2013. Fight Club is based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It is a about a man named Jack (Edward Norton) who is stuck in a depressed state. He is unhappy with his job so he tries to delve himself into creating the perfect apartment, when this doesn't fill the gap he goes to support groups for people with terminal diseases hoping he will find fulfilment there. While at these support groups he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who he later takes an interest in. On Jack's journey to fulfilment he crosses paths with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler believes in fulfilment though loss and pain and he and Jack fight. This leads to an underground group called the Fight Club and a journey of fighting and violence embarks from there.Fight Club is a dark comedy which was directed by David Fincher who had also directed Seven, which Brad Pitt had previously acted in. Fight Club portrays controversy and diverse degrees of masculinity and extremism including terrorism. I didn't wait so long to watch it on purpose, life just worked out that way. Fight club is certainly one of my favourite movies now and I finally understand all the fight club references that are used by others in daily life. Brilliant movie, I highly recommend to those who feel stuck in a rut.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Infinitely Quotable, Ruthlessly Unpredictable, Genuinely Unforgettable","What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after almost two dozen viewings. Its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk- smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That's what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can't imagine I'll ever grow tired of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Omg,"Best movie ever, I couldn't believe it. The way the story is told, the perfect acting from both character and Helena Boham Carter who makes everything go smoothly... A match made in heaven.

A Masterpiece,"Every time I watch Fight Club, it reveals something deeper. The first viewing was a jaw-dropping experience, with one of the most brilliant plot twists ever crafted. On the second watch, I saw the film in a new light, but it wasn't until the third time that I fully understood how it critiques not just consumerism, but also toxic masculinity. If you believe the movie glorifies senseless violence or encourages the creation of real-life fight clubs, I urge you to reconsider-it's far more nuanced than that. David Fincher's direction is nothing short of genius, and this might just be his crowning achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Disturbing and brutal, yet has a distinct message.","After viewing Fight Club, a lot of ideas will run through your mind. This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark: a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and easy to hate at the same time, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a strong supporting role. However, it is the work of Edward Norton that makes this movie memorable and stays with you long after it is over. In every scene he is in, and there are a lot of them, Norton perfectly captures the attitude and feelings of the Narrator. At first, he is depressed and out of touch with reality. As the story moves on, he becomes more aware and self-destructive. The audience also becomes more involved as we wonder where this could lead. Perhaps the most striking thing about Fight Club is that the premise is entirely plausible. It is not ridiculous at all to think that such an idea could spring up and alter the course of many peoples' lives. Still, this film provides more warning than suggestions. Simply put, this film is not just for entertainment value. There is much more here than meets the eye. Of course, not everyone will take it for anything other than face value. But, if you look closer and really try to understand this fascinating story, you will see a message; just don't be able to decipher it anytime soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fight Club-A movie that keeps you thinking for days.....,"Fight Club is an excellent movie that keeps you thinking about it for days....at least that's the effect it had on me. There are elements in the film that make you laugh, (such as the dialogue between the narrator and ""Tyler Durden"" when they're on the plane. ""Do you know why they put oxygen masks on planes"" ""so you can breathe"" ""Oxygen gets you high........calm as Hindu cows"" The movie can also make you confused in the way that The Wall does. It can also make you gag with all the bloody fight scenes. In short, Fight Club is somewhat a comedy and action film with a touch of creepy. Fight Club isn't for everyone, especially those who lack satirical humor. When you watch it the first time, it may be quite confusing until you reach the end where you get a better understanding of it. When you watch it the second time, you begin to notice more things (""subliminal Brad"" appearing for instance, when the narrator's doctor turns away or the quick flash of a penis as the movie comes to an end lol ) I watched the movie, trying to figure out what the message was. You think, is Fight Club the form of therapy for men? Is it about denial and self hatred that drives a person to imagine themselves as another person-someone who they'd like to be, but could never be? Is it about the conformity of society...or cheating death so that you can live tomorrow as though it were the best day of your life? You are alive the most when you're almost dead...and that was my take on the film. Marla never looking both ways when she crossed the streets...Tyler Durden and his acid burn...the men of Project Mayhem and their near death experience, and Tyler Durden giving the liquor store owner a chance to live so that he can accomplish his desire to become a vet. Whatever the movie was about, it's all in perspective, and every time you watch it...you manage to think of a new opinion. Fight Club is truly a great film, and without a doubt, an interesting one! But of course-The first rule of Fight Club is, you do NOT talk about Fight Club...so I guess you'll just have to watch it and see what it's all about!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Finding enlightenment thru beating each other to a pulp,"A 30 year-old man in Los Angeles works the office drudgery, but suffers insomnia (Edward Norton). He's finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.""Fight Club"" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless ""revolutionaries"" (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc.That's all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn't compelling. I sat there bored and couldn't wait for it to end. ""Donnie Darko"" (2001) had the same problem - promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it's relatively interesting.Moreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one's life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn't emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?Cult flicks like ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.The film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

This film has aged well,"Back in 1999, I was 28 and much too happy with the world to go see a Brad Pitt movie. So I watched it now when I'm 50 and alone. And I was pleased with the experience: As any good film should, it leaves you shaken and stirred. It awakens inside you the same rage that the hero of the story couldn't suppress anymore.Although not an action fan, I didn't find the violence gratuitous or sickening, the nudity excessive, or the special effects gimmicky. The twist at the end is both brilliant and extremely valid; and the final scene prescient and timeless on multiple levels: Slice it any way you like, it is we - the conformists, the office crowd, the middle classes - who are afraid of our own power, and never fail to construct a prison for ourselves.I deducted a star because the final cut should have been edited more vigorously (there's at least 10 - 15 minutes' worth of dead weight in there). And also because the naturally stunning and usually memorable Helena Bonham-Carter is so hung up on looking ugly and sounding American in this vehicle, her otherwise prominent character adds nearly zero depth, nuance or development to the story. Given her role as the narrator's mirror-cum-doppelgänger, she simply fizzles out.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Undoubtedly..... one of the best mystery thrillers i have EVER seen !!!!,"Fight club... the most intelligent work of the director David Fincher till date. The main cast include Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter... all well suited to their roles.After watching the American History X (1998) i understood that Edward Norton is an actor who can handle any sort of role exceptionally well. he proved the same here as well. But the one who completely surprised me in Fight Club was Brad Pitt. His character was so cleverly plotted that it bears the entire base of the movie over its shoulders. i doesn't want to go much deeper into this character otherwise it will ruin the entire excitement of the viewer.There are only two mystery thrillers that i personally believe can compete with Fight Club. One is the Usual Suspects (1995) and the second is Reservoir Dogs(1992).If you haven't watched this film till date then don't wait further and watch this film now. I strongly recommend Fight Club to you. exceptional film.... 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A satire,with dark provocative comedy.","In the summer of 2000, when I had absolutely nothing to do, Helena, my neighbor knocked on my door. When I opened the door she excitedly asked me if I had seen the movie Fight Club yet. At that time I was sure that I had never heard of it, but I became interested after seeing her be so enthusiastic about it. So I went next door and watched it with her. Since then, this film has become one of my all time favorites. Tyler Durden's character is insanely likable, because he is full of enlightened information. He is obviously a sociopath making him seem terrifying, witty, funny and brilliant. He is not a one sided character as some would think from the title of the film. Tyler makes you question some, if not all, of your conservative beliefs. I've actually found myself quoting some of the things Tyler has said, years after I've seen the film. Tyler believes the world has turned into nothing more that a commercialized way of life. Some of the things he does will blow your mind and will definitely make you a little squeamish. Unlike many of us, Tyler wants to hit rock bottom, because he believes, ""It is only when you have lost everything that you are free to do anything."" His dreams are for the world to go back to a more primal state. His outlook on human life itself may be somewhat disturbing, but it makes you stop and say to yourself, ""Wow, that makes sense."" The cast of Fight Club is superb, and Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden is incredible. He makes you believe that Tyler is a part of his personality. Even Brad's twisted laugh through out the film makes you believe he has a loose screw. Also, I could not help to hang on every word that Edward Norton said through his narration. His acting ability many would say is always worth seeing. In the beginning of the movie his character is an insomnia-tic zombie living the mundane corporate life. He transitions his character right up to the end when you can see that he is a changed man. Marla's character is someone that really doesn't care what anyone thinks about her. Her philosophy of life is that is she might die at any moment, and the tragedy was that she didn't. Helena Bonham Carter is a perfect fit for her part, her statements make you want to laugh, but also make you feel a little uncomfortable. Some of the scenes are ad lib-bed and Helen definitely contributed to some of the taboo aspects of the film. The time line for this film is done in a way that jumps along through different parts of the story, but is so fluent that even the most average movie watcher will know what's going on. This film also has everything a seasoned movie watcher comes to see. The imagery and the cinematography are done flawlessly, the witty irony will make you laugh out load, and the dark and grimy scenes go hand in hand with the dark comedy.. Just remember that this is a satirical work and once you get to the mouth dropping explosive surprise ending. It cohesively brings the whole film into perspective. I believe that this film should be watched more than once, simply because you will be able to see the imagination and effort behind every scene. To me I honestly think that this is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. My opinion of this film is that it is a dark and honest poem that speaks directly to my male generation, and I urge you to give it a chance so that you may witness the genius behind it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?""","You know, it's hard sometimes when you see this extremely thought- provoking movie that thought-provokes you SO much, that you have no idea how to start your review. Other movies have hit me in some emotional way, but Fight Club did it in a secretive way. A way that I don't know what exactly hit me, but I know something hit me.. So instead of blabbering on about how much it 'hit' me, how about getting into actual stuff?The acting was surprising from both leads. Brad Pitt surprises me left & right, but this was the first time where I saw Edward Norton, and thought: ""wow, he CAN act!"" And he rightfully can. The plot, at first glance, may seem like your typical boxing movie that adds in one new thing and stamps itself ""the best movie ever."" Well that's not the case. In the first ten minutes, I thought I was watching an entire different movie. Edward Norton narrates every little thing he does, sees, or thinks. It was a really strange set-up, but the strangeness was intriguing.. Then there's the people who bash this film because they find out the twist, finding it silly. I'm sure none of these people ever heard of multiple personality disorder? I thought it was a surprising twist. And for a film like this? A fantastic twist...But plot, characters, acting, directing, sound design, cinematography, and screenplay do even qualify to compete with this film's brilliance. Strangely enough, you don't even know what was so brilliant about it. You just know that something was there that made you go ""wow"" and think and think. That's film-making.. But the whole atmosphere of the movie, the whole directorial style Fincher creates, is mystifying. He has created this genre that I can't even get a grasp on. And it contains philosophical elements as well, which further enhance the underlying brilliance of it all... And Fight Club also works as a comedy. A dark, dark comedy. Some parts are so devilish evil that you can't help but smile. Need more? Fight Club works as a counterpart. Let me rephrase. It works as a study. It works as a masterpiece. Everything and anything the movie contains was surely not what you'd expect. ""Fight Club."" You hear those words and think another attempt at creating yet another boxing movie. No depth, no substance. But when you see it, you'll understand. You'll understand a lot more of everything...Fight Club is much more an audience film than it is a critic's film. Critics rate the film itself, not even attempting to appreciate it's social commentary or it's brilliant message to the world. But I did. You will too. Fight Club competes with cinematic classics. It works as everything it's not. It's a favorite of mine. A brilliant, clever film. A film that will engage you with it's warm embrace. To have you reconciling every bit and piece. So what are you doing reading this review on the internet? Get off your lazy ass, and get out there. Do something with your life. While your sitting here doing nothing but reading this film, people are appreciating this film, while you are just reading the synopsis, trying to understand something you can't.

Overrated,"The biggest problem of this movie is that it is so overrated. For years and years I have been hearing how amazing this film is. Two times I watched it, two times fell asleep. Was too tired probably. Today I watched it again, once again expecting something great, and again fell asleep. I started watching it two hours after I woke up after a 9 hour sleep!Face it, this movie gets really boring at times. Pitt is often mumbling useless phrases, dull story (after the two get together) and there is an illogical ending.But for me the most disturbing is the whole idea of changing your life, becoming sensitive again(what??) by engaging into bloody, futile fights. Who would do that? You wanna fight, go to Darfur and fight for the starved women and children getting raped and killed every day. Trust me, you'll make your life interesting, you'll escape this ''stinking'' consumer society and on your way might just save someone's life or raise a few eyebrows. I am not from USA and not really aware of this ''horrible'' life of the American white collar worker, but if this movie has ''opened your eyes'' then my friends you really are in it deep.On the good side the movie is very stylish and the acting is first class. 7.5/10 just for these attributes.

Overhyped and Overrated: A Disappointing Dive into Machismo and Anarchy,"I recently watched ""Fight Club,"" and I must say, it left me thoroughly unimpressed. Despite its cult status and widespread acclaim, the film falls flat in several key areas.First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. What starts as an intriguing premise quickly descends into a chaotic jumble of poorly executed ideas. The supposed twist, which many hail as a brilliant revelation, felt forced and predictable. Instead of a clever narrative device, it came across as a desperate attempt to salvage a sinking storyline.The characters are another major issue. Edward Norton's portrayal of the unnamed protagonist is lackluster, and his character's motivations remain unclear throughout the film. Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden, while charismatic, embodies an obnoxious brand of toxic masculinity that is hard to stomach. The film's glorification of his anarchistic and violent tendencies is both irresponsible and distasteful.Moreover, the film's message, if one can call it that, is muddled and contradictory. It seems to advocate for a rejection of consumerism and societal norms, but does so in a way that is nihilistic and ultimately pointless. Instead of offering any meaningful critique or alternative, it revels in chaos for chaos's sake.The dialogue, often hailed as sharp and witty, comes off as pretentious and heavy-handed. Lines that are meant to be profound instead feel like they are trying too hard to be edgy and provocative. This forced edginess permeates the entire film, making it difficult to take seriously.Visually, while the film has its moments, it relies too heavily on dark and gritty aesthetics that become tiresome after a while. The constant use of grim settings and stark contrasts feels like a cheap way to create a sense of depth and atmosphere.In conclusion, ""Fight Club"" is an overhyped film that fails to live up to its reputation. Its confusing plot, unlikable characters, muddled message, and pretentious dialogue make for a disappointing viewing experience. It's a movie that mistakes chaos for profundity and ends up being little more than an exercise in style over substance. Save yourself the time and skip this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""This is your life.""","I am Jack's review of the movie Fight Club. If you don't know what that means, it's just a small taste of how sardonic this whole film is.At first, I assumed Fight Club was just a movie about a bunch of guys beating each other up. From the moment it starts, however, it proves to be much more than that. It's actually a very strangely neurotic and mesmerizing descent into a testosterone-fueled madness. Actual fighting is limited; what you get instead is a storytelling experience that's so warped, it will challenge your perception of what is and isn't real in the film. The film itself even gets warped, with such bizarre effects as having single frames of images mixed into random spots, and one frenetic scene where the negative appears to come undone. Throw in some wild computer-generated modelling effects and some brisk editing, and the film becomes a highly stylized and entrancing experience.The story is a real doozy. It kicks off strong and hard, showcasing the insomniac protagonist and chronicling how he went from being an average office worker with everything into a deviant with nothing (and nothing to lose). Things get thrilling when the actual fight club takes off and anarchy starts to spread, but the main focus is always on exploring the characters, and it all builds up to an unpredictable climax. There is a massive plot twist in the mix, but it's one of those that holds up extremely well on repeat viewings (even though it can be a little hard to believe). Characters shine really well, thanks to their nuanced performances, their sharp dialogue, their convoluted relationships, and the nature of the plot, which really makes us stop and think about what's going on in their heads.There are a number of themes that can be extrapolated from this crazy story. The most blatant messages concern anarchy, as the characters constantly criticize the modern consumerist culture and emphasize ""letting go."" Much of the story is really about them abandoning the common goals of wealth, success, or material things, and just being yourself. There are moments where the film also seems to dig up deeper metaphysical questions and meaning, especially regarding morality and the perception of reality.As noted above, the film has one heck of a style. The camera work is very solid and good, while the editing tends to be very inventive and wild. Acting is great; Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are effectively perfect in their roles. Writing is awesome, and there are tons of great lines. This production uses some very great and detailed-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music by the Dust Brothers can be a bit nutty, but is mostly pretty awesome.Fight Club is a movie with some serious attitude and style. The experience of watching it is like going through that feeling of wooziness after being punched in the face, for it is that trippy. I could say more, but the first and second rules of Fight Club forbid me...5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I don't know why this is rated so highly on IMDb,"Not sure what I'm missing about this movie, maybe I'm missing the context of the times, this film could have been ground-breaking for its time. But for me, in 2021, this film doesn't quite hold up, even if it's antebellum theme and spirit of anti-work and anti-capitalism seem coldly familiar in the modern political climate.As far as performances go, Edward Norton plays his character very stiffly, not a particularly captivating interpretation of his (admittedly) straight-laced character. Brad Pitt puts up a great performance, though it's in line with the other roles he seems type-casted for: nonchalant charismatic good-looking dude. Jared Leto is in it. Not a terrible performance, but always fun to see him get beat up. Oh also, Lauren Sánchez is in this. Jeff Bezo's girlfriend. She's the Channel 4 reporter when the news is reporting one of the first major acts of Project Mayhem and then Jared Leto's character comments that she's hot. Crazy what it takes to make her look ""hot"", blown out video, low contrast shot, low resolution TV screen, and young. Anyways, I think it's funny that perhaps what Jeff sees in her originates from this film. And also that in this anti-establishment, anti-capitalist anthem of a film, the in-film reporter's real-life actress is now dating one of the most prominent capitalist figureheads in the history of ever.Movie is fine, a bearable watch even if parts of it are filthily gruesome and disgusting.

Why can't they make more movie likes this?,"The writing is brilliant, the voice of the ""Narrator"" is honest and the acting is just right. Norton and Pitt make such a great team, I wonder when they are going to make their next movie.And the comments about consumerist society ring very true, even though we probably won't admit it to ourselves because it's a shell of comfort that even we ourselves are not ready to shed.The plot isn't too heavy, and the reveal at the end progresses perfectly.

SLEEPER.,"I am back for my second review of Fight Club. Why, you ask? Because I  was told I had an ""inadequate"" amount of evidence to prove my point! So  here I go.  Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly,  nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes. It seemed that the  whole movie revolved around an insomniac! And that's true--this movie  is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep. For over half of it seems  to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what  kind of main character is known only as ""The Narrator""?), and a crummy  soundtrack. I was SO disappointed.  ""Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become  encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of  life.""  Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't  come in until WAY later. And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it  is hardly shown. Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm  sorry, but how utterly boring! From the commercials and video cover, I  was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group  that doesn't serve a purpose.  I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter. Hey, lady, you did excellent  in Planet of the Apes! But in this movie she plays as a rival  counseling group member (speaking of which, what purpose do these  groups serve for the movie?  NOTHING!  The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so  cool) is fighting ""himself"", is utterly pathetic. How boring. And then  the buildings topple... and that's the end. Ho! Wait! I see a naked man  from the waist down at the ending! Maybe this is the second reason  people liked this stupid, boring movie so much. It shows both female  AND male anatomy.  How stupid! Repulsive! I DESPISED this movie. Now you know why. If, in  fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely:  1. Boring 2. No plot (adds to number 1) 3. Shallow characters 4. Actual  film has hardly anything to do with its title 5. Constant  swearing/nudity that sickened me 6. Music was cruddy  Basically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity. I was so sick of  it before the first half hour was up.  I will never watch it again. And I hope my review will help keep you  from watching it as well.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama

Misconception Analysis,"While universally praised by all types of people, teenage and young adult audience members in specific tend to gravitate towards Fight Club, hailing it as one of the greatest films of all time and currently placing it at #10. on IMDb's Top 250 films. However, there are plenty of people that deem this film overrated, and while I can't quite agree with that, I would say, much like Pulp Fiction, people tend to consciously praise this film for the wrong reasons and through superficial means. For the fairly shallow reasons people claim to like this film, I would say in that sense, it is overrated. I would argue that this film is quite misinterpreted by common audience members and even by well-known film critics. Edward Norton's narrator character is not named, to serve as a vehicle for the audience to adopt themselves upon. He is a regular American white collar Caucasian male in his thirties. He is a regular person. He is a loser to many as his life is empty. In essence, he is the audience. Tyler Durden represents the other extreme, while being a different side of the same coin. Audiences generally love Tyler Durden, and it makes sense that they do in a way, as he embodies everything they wish to be or wish to have. Tyler Durden is the ideal masculine role, but the Narrator is given the task to redefine that role.Tyler Durden influences the Narrator to give up his dependent and materialistic lifestyle and embrace life for what it is; in essence all that matters is up to the individual. I think the film is also about finding a balance and not going too far in a way. The film is about how people should strive to improve, accept their worth, or lack of, but not give in so far that they lose sense of their individuality.There's an over growing sense that one should not give in too much. The fight clubs and Project Mayhem begin to form a cult with set rules and priorities, embracing a mindless sheep like organized role, which is what they are set out to go against. They ultimately and ironically are fighting against what they are, which gives more insight and meaning to the film's twist. The twist is what audiences tend to focus on, while thinking the film is actually endorsing what the fight clubs and Project Mayhem stand for. The answer is neither 'no' nor 'yes' but rather 'sort of'. As mentioned before, the film argues for balance. The narrator, while ultimately agreeing with Tyler in some ways, feels things are getting out of hand, especially after a man is killed. Once he kills off Tyler, he is then ridding himself of the extremist side of him in a way, though not fully as he is still adopting some of that side. Tyler taught him not to need consumerist products and lifestyle, but he went too far and the narrator realizes he does not need Tyler. The film is about gaining a little bit of both sides. Tyler is not the hero. He is going too far and the audience needs to catch onto the fact that he is not the ideal one should strive for, but rather strive for that of the protagonist at the end. One should be their own individual but strive to improve and not give in and embrace extremes. The film is first about ridding one's self of the materialistic means and ideals society sets forth, including hyper-masculine extremist role models that Tyler embodies. The film is being more like the narrator than Tyler. Despite this, audience members lose sight of this and still view the film of being film as being for Tyler's philosophy and character ideal.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the dumbest movies ever!,"Yes, these days it's hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb, when people rave about crap like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix', but this must take a special prize.  At least in this case, this qualifies as a 'so bad it's good' exercise, whereas the others were just mindless bores.  Of course, it's largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, who should form a triumvirate with Keanu Reeves as the most overpaid, talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent.  In fact, the only good performance here is by Meatloaf, which is saying a lot.  If you think the plot is original, it's not.  The same idea was presented in a half hour episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' over 30 years ago, that was directed by the master himself. Still, even if it was faked, I did greatly enjoy seeing Pitt and Norton beating each other to a bloody pulp.  They both certainly deserve it for their past (and future) 'work'.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing,I watched this movie yesterday for the first time and I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever watched!! I didn't want to watch this movie at first because of the people around me (mostly toxics guys that are obsessed with going to the gym) because they see it like it's some movie about depressed guys fighting to get masculine and tough. But for me it's more about trying to escape the exhausting everyday life (I'm going to stop here to avoid spoilers) One things I don't get is why the age rating is 18+ because I'm 16 and usually I'm very sensitive when it comes to brutally scenes but actually for me only one scene was a bit too much (it was still ok) because you saw like a head that was shot by a gun (you saw little bit of brain dripping out) It's very well done and I recommend it to everyone on this earth!!,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The problem with Fight Club isn't Fight Club itself.,"My first instinct was to write some witty, over-used joke about the first rule, but then I realised that I actually had a decent chunk of serious things to say about this movie, so here we go. Speaking of the first rule, I just broke it.Fight Club is another one of those films that the so-called filmbros will tear you from limb to limb for not liking. Ever since its release, to say that it's built somewhat of a cult following is an understatement. It's been so ingrained in popular culture that even I've got to admit I made the ""first rule"" joke a couple of times before I had even watched it. And the problem is that ever since then, it's been worshipped as the epitome of filmmaking, the most profound commentary on culture, the greatest movie of all time, etc. Etc...Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Fight Club a lot. I've always been a fan of Fincher's, and this film, stylistically, is a beautifully gritty thriller, the kind that I've come to love. And it certainly deserves a lot of the praise that it gets. I don't think that it's the greatest movie in existence, but I did like watching it a lot. And a lot of the stuff that I'm about to say is going to make it sound like I hate this movie, and I don't. Fight Club is a good movie. However, I think that the biggest problem with this movie isn't the movie itself, but rather, the culture of people who have come to worship this movie like it's some sort of cinematic god. You know, those same people on Letterboxd and Instagram who think Parasite is an obscure foreign film and think that Joker is ""relatable"".And it's honestly kind of annoying that this perfectly great movie had been ruined by this filmbro culture, to the point when someone says it's their favourite movie your first thought is ""oh s**t"". And that's the thing - I have nothing against people who do say Fight Club is their favourite movie, but just because of that small percentage of people who are just... like that, your mind will automatically go RED FLAG even if it completely isn't. And it's almost ironic how this movie has been packaged and adored by the masses, adored for its anti-consumerist culture by the very consumerists that it criticises.I'm realising that this has veered away from being a review and is slowly turning into an essay about how much I hate filmbros, so let me just wrap it up with some final thoughts. I don't hate Fight Club, but I hate the people who have ruined it for people who genuinely like it.-Sasha.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The world's greatest movie?,"Fight Club is a phenomenon of popular culture, maybe a cult classic, a miracle for some, but is it really that great or a mind blowing cinematic journey? or a real piece of cinema? No, it isn't. Maybe, Fight Club is little thought provoking including some ""cool"" aphorism or lines, but it is Fincher's most mainstream work and designed to be understood by everyone because it is a ""product"" of popular culture. I know that why is Fight Club appreciated and loved in that grand scale by population, because it is so called a ""cool"" movie. Brad Pitt plays a tough alpha male, Helena Bonham Carter plays a reckless femme fatale, there is rebellion, disobedience, ""fight clubs"", cool lines, etc. with a fast and dynamic editing. Fight Club is considered as a criticism of consumer society, capitalism and modern community, but there are movies which do that criticism better: A Clockwork Orange, Sidney Lumet's Network, Charlie Chaplin movies, even Watchmen! By the way, there is a twist about a character in the movie, but if you think about it, it just doesn't make any sense and that makes the movie illogical. The ending which is considered one of the best endings ever is lame and controversial in many ways. Fight Club underlines and explains its will and subjects in a loud way. This is not a subtle film, so it is little didactic and there is not any unforgettable scene to watch over and over again like some other great movies. I prefer even the director's Zodiac over this, a masterfully told, great piece of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
An exhilarating journey in understanding consumerism through aggressive events.,"Fight Club is one such rare movie that deserves to win many nominations and awards,clearly and literally.It is one the best films of 1999.This dark story takes place through the unnamed protagonist-The Narrator essayed by a brilliant Edward Norton.He delivers a power-packed,energetic,deep-in-the-character performance which is immensely commendable.Although most of the movie is shot in dark,lurid atmosphere and there is no glitterati or lights.Edward Norton suffers from chronic insomnia and cant sleep for days together.The only way he can find peace,solace and ultimately sleep is by going to various body- afflicted problem groups where seeing people suffering a plethora of pain makes him calm and retains his composure.Here he meets a weird emo-like woman named Marla Singer portrayed equally well by a weird- looking Helena Bonham Carter who has a lot of uncanny(peculiar)idiosyncrasies.He creates a virtual and visual alter-ego or a persona named Tyler Durden acted by the most exuberant,jovial and boisterous Brad Pitt.He clearly gave and electrifying,stellar performance that deserves sheer accolades.How he takes on the monster of Tyler Durden forms the crux of the story.Tyler is a nihilist who creates a ""fight club"" to ease the tension,agony and anguish of the people living boring,mundane,robotic lives.A clear must-watch if you want to understand consumerism in a novel but violent way.Thumbs UP!!!MY RATING-9 ON 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A truly unique movie. Exploring the fragility of the human mind,"Norton and Pitt are fantastic together as The Narrator and Tyler Durden. I find myself quite often being able to spot how a plot will play out, and it frustrates me when a good movie is ruined by an obvious ending. Fight Club had me genuinely gripped in the latter stages of the movie and I was left feeling extremely satisfied with the conclusion. I have read a little post watch about what the movie means and the truth is that it has many different theoretical possibilities . The one I like most is the train of thought that the movie is simply created to make you question the movie itself. To spark your brain into a barrage of questions about life, love, ego, sanity. And the justification for actions that are questionably right and wrong at the same time. Bonham Carter is also brilliant and I can't think of anyone else who could have played Marla better. She genuinely looked devoid of hygiene and depicted a person who had lost their own self respect and had past caring. She played her role perfectly. The movie offers a refreshing approach to cinema. Reminding us that it doesn't always have to be shiny , blingy and cardboard which we are bombarded with from Hollywood today . The portrayal of the darker side of the human psyche can offer a far more intense and thought provoking 2 hours. A well deserved 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Dimaov20,"""Fight Club"" is a riveting and thought-provoking film that delves deep into the complexities of modern masculinity, consumerism, and societal disillusionment. Directed by David Fincher and based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, the movie follows the journey of an unnamed narrator (played by Edward Norton) as he becomes entangled in a clandestine underground fight club led by the enigmatic Tyler Durden (portrayed by Brad Pitt).At its core, ""Fight Club"" is a dark and gritty exploration of identity, power dynamics, and the search for meaning in a world driven by materialism and conformity. The narrator's descent into the chaotic world of fight club serves as a metaphor for his inner turmoil and dissatisfaction with his mundane existence. As he grapples with feelings of alienation and numbness, the brutal and primal nature of the fights allows him to confront his own sense of self and tap into a raw and unfiltered form of masculinity.The dynamic between the narrator and Tyler Durden is central to the film's narrative, with Tyler embodying a charismatic and anarchic force that challenges societal norms and encourages rebellion against the status quo. Their complex relationship blurs the lines between mentorship, friendship, and manipulation, leading to a series of shocking twists and revelations that force the audience to question the nature of reality and perception.""Fight Club"" also delves into themes of consumerism and the emptiness of material possessions. Through Tyler's anti-establishment philosophy and radical actions, the film critiques the shallow values of a society obsessed with wealth, image, and instant gratification. The destruction of property, the rejection of societal norms, and the embrace of chaos serve as a form of catharsis for the characters, highlighting the destructive consequences of unchecked capitalism and the pursuit of superficial happiness.Visually, ""Fight Club"" is a masterclass in cinematography and editing. Fincher's meticulous attention to detail, coupled with Jeff Cronenweth's atmospheric lighting and innovative camera work, creates a gritty and immersive world that mirrors the characters' inner turmoil. The film's use of dark tones, stark contrasts, and frenetic editing techniques enhance the sense of disorientation and unease, drawing viewers into the chaotic and unpredictable world of fight club.The performances in ""Fight Club"" are nothing short of exceptional. Edward Norton delivers a nuanced portrayal of the narrator's internal struggle, capturing his vulnerability, confusion, and growing disillusionment with precision. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Tyler Durden is electrifying, exuding charisma, intensity, and a dangerous allure that keeps viewers on edge. The chemistry between Norton and Pitt is palpable, adding depth and complexity to their characters' evolving relationship.The film's iconic twist ending challenges viewers to reevaluate everything they thought they knew about the story, blurring the lines between reality and fiction in a mind-bending conclusion that leaves a lasting impact. As the credits roll, ""Where Is My Mind"" by The Pixies plays in the background, underscoring the film's themes of disconnection and existential crisis.In conclusion, ""Fight Club"" is a cinematic tour de force that pushes boundaries, sparks debate, and leaves a lasting impression on audiences. Through its exploration of masculinity, consumerism, identity, and rebellion, the film invites viewers to question their own beliefs, values, and place in society. With its striking visuals, powerhouse performances, and provocative storytelling, ""Fight Club"" remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"good movie, book is better","While I used to consider this movie to be my #1 pick, that has shifted to magnolia. The movie is still good, and I like it just as much as before. However after reading the book, it just seems flat.  Life is a series of comparisons, and while comparing this movie to other movies it's #1, but comparing this movie to other messages that I find through media, it's not, simply because the book's message is way better, with a lot more depth. Fight club was #1 in my book due to its original meaning but now that I found this meaning expanded upon in another medium, fight club has shrunk. There is just a lot more to it.  A lot.  I don't think the characters, especially Marla, are well developed.  Upon seeing the movie for the first time I had a feeling like Marla was supposed to be a big part of it, but she wasn't.  From the start he even says ""all this is because of marla"" or something like that.  But in fact, it wasn't really expanded upon at all. There were a lot of other things too, the whole #69 thing was rather pointless.  And just little things throughout. I'd still give it a 10/10 for sure, I would just recommend reading the book over watching the movie (but doing both works too).",,Anonymous,Drama
If pent up rebellion and self help books had a baby,"Fight Club is a mildly interesting tale about one man's reaction and response to a dreary work life and his own mindless consumerism. It centers around this unnamed main character, as he battles to gain a taste and feel for life. He meets and befriends a guy named Tyler Durden, who ultimately steers that battle towards the forces that he thinks stand in the way. There is a prevailing sense of empty progression through the story, because quite frankly not a whole happens in terms of plot. So in the end you're left with a lot of style and not a whole lot of substance, which is ironic considering that is pretty much what the characters bemoan in the first place. Worth seeing at least once, because it has some clever moments, but I almost half expect there to be copies of it for sale at Ikea.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Bloated, irresponsible, self-indulgent trash!","Typically over-directed David Fincher nonsense.Is he actually able to direct a movie that isn't dank, grimy and depressing? There are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard. Perhaps they confuse the muddled and self-congratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful.I found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless. It became increasingly obnoxious and irritating. Edward Norton's character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally. If this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts. Granted, there is a lot of fake, unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at. Not everywhere is a dull, grey office or a miserable, rainy alleyway.It is also very, very slow. 139 minutes have never seemed so long.A lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no MAJOR difference to the story I like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society. This should have been exploited more. But we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics. But, the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me. I didn't find it ironic, subtle or meaningful. Sorry.The sub-text about man becoming primal again, and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives, is lost on me too. It's practically non-existent. I have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting. It was really rather boring.The DVD has a loads of features, annoying and headache inducing. Why did Fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hour-long documentary? The menus are confusing as is the multi-angle function on the 5-minute ""scene deconstructions"". Who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer?

good,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequence-less violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends. 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

This is a powerful movie which will make you believe that chaos can end all existence. I think EVERYONE should see this movie. It is gruesome and violent at times, but it's worth it!

Fight Club Movie vs. Book,"I Love the Movie, but that being said the book is better. This is true for most book to films. I think the only reason I loved the movie was getting in the mind frame of putting it as a separate entity from Chuck Palahniuk's novel. In comparison Brad Pitt definitely took the character and ran with it making it his own. If you have not read the book I highly recommend it. I recommend anything from Chuck Palahniuk! Fight Club (the movie) is one of my all time favorites and has become a cult classic. The following and the message are edgy and fun. Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Norton are incredible together and the fight scenes are satisfying. The only thing I wish there was more of, was details with the actual missions of project mayhem. I also would have liked a little more of the psyche of Tyler Durden. Great Character development and twists. The plot was outstanding. Palahniuk's brain is a dirty masterpiece!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Perhaps it was the creator's idea to fashion a film that outlines the downfalls of nihilism, and then create a similar reaction in its viewers. Perhaps the fact that so many people don't seem to understand the true meaning of this film was the intention of the creator. If this is the case than I can recommend the film as a razor sharp satire. If not, then this film falls under the same category as SCARFACE.

The worst film ever.,"I had high hopes in this movie with all the positive reviews I saw. But in the end it became the worst movie I saw in my life.

I never read it, but it shows that it was copied faithfully. I felt as if the author was smoking marijuana while writing the book, there is quite a chance that it is true. It was an insult to writers who at least know that someone is going to read their works and they take seriously the construction of the plot by making a beautiful rise and fall with the subplots. Arriving at a conclusive climax.Contrary to the fight club that throws up the viewer showing random scenes without relevant content and sex scenes or related things without context that did not contribute to the plot just because, ""I am very depressed and edgy""In the end it is only a film that was the most popular because certain stupid Yanks had never seen any work related to depression and went to the first film they saw of that style and called it a masterpiece to reflect their pathetic life in that. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

what a movie,"listering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology. Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain ""modern classic"" status. The trajectory of Fight Club is baffling. In its first hour or so, this picture appears to be a gloriously spiteful and well-acted satire of our bogus contemporary ""crisis of masculinity"": self- pitying guys hugging in groups and claiming victim status - modern consumer society having allegedly rendered the poor dears' hunter- gathering instincts obsolete. But, by the end, it has unravelled catastrophically into a strident, shallow, pretentious bore with a ""twist"" ending that doesn't work. And it is a film which smugly flirts, oh-so-very- controversially, with some of the intellectual and cultural paraphernalia of fascism - but does not have anything like the nerve, still less the cerebral equipment, to back this pose up.Edward Norton gives a compulsively twitchy, nerdy, hollow-eyed performance as Fight Club's Narrator: a 30-year-old single guy with a white collar job in the automotive industry and a secret addiction; he loves attending support groups posing as a sufferer.

"A Riveting Cinematic Experience: A Review of ""Fight Club""","""Fight Club"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves an indelible mark on its audience with its raw energy, thought-provoking narrative, and powerful performances. Directed by David Fincher and based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, this film defies convention and dives headfirst into the dark underbelly of modern society.From its opening moments to its jaw-dropping conclusion, ""Fight Club"" grabs hold of your attention and refuses to let go. The film follows the unnamed narrator, played brilliantly by Edward Norton, as he grapples with the emptiness of consumer culture and seeks meaning through his involvement in an underground fight club. Norton's portrayal of the narrator's descent into chaos is riveting, capturing the character's inner turmoil with haunting authenticity.Opposite Norton is Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, the enigmatic and anarchic force who becomes the narrator's mentor and tormentor. Pitt's performance is electrifying, infusing Tyler with a charismatic yet dangerous charisma that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The dynamic between Norton and Pitt is magnetic, driving the film forward with palpable tension and emotional depth.What sets ""Fight Club"" apart is its bold exploration of masculinity, identity, and the pursuit of freedom in a world suffocated by conformity. Through its unflinching portrayal of violence and rebellion, the film forces audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about society and the human condition. It's a wake-up call wrapped in the guise of a visceral and adrenaline-fueled thrill ride.In addition to its compelling story and performances, ""Fight Club"" is a visual tour de force. Fincher's direction is masterful, immersing viewers in a grimy yet stylized world that feels both hyper-real and surreal. The film's iconic cinematography and editing elevate every scene, creating a visceral experience that lingers long after the credits roll.Ultimately, ""Fight Club"" is more than just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that continues to resonate with audiences years after its release. Its themes of rebellion, self-discovery, and the search for meaning are timeless, offering viewers a mirror to reflect upon their own lives and society as a whole. If you haven't experienced the adrenaline rush of ""Fight Club,"" do yourself a favor and watch it now. Just remember the first rule: you do not talk about Fight Club.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Critique of Anti-establishment and Masculinity,"To me this film is great in the sense that it provokes me enough to see messages perhaps exceeding the original intent of both the author and the film maker. The irony is that the film in really serves as a strong critique against the two main characteristics that Tylor represents: anti-establishment and masculinity.To begin with, the movie was produced by one of the biggest media corporates in the world, cashing on the corporate hatred and self- hatred generated precisely by those corporates. The crowd who followed Tylor thinking that they are liberated from the capitalist treadmill are in fact merely shifting from one treadmill to another. Same as the fascist followers who felt empowered carrying out the orders, in the process of working for Tylor they are really being exploited and given a tiny share of the power and resources they gathered - exactly the same as working for a company. Will their lives really change after credit records are destroyed? We have seen how communist revolutions rose and fell. What is, then, the whole point of the movement? It is a project of the protagonist set out to find his own value, instead of being defined by others. It is a process that requires internal examination and self-awareness. The crowd he draws is used for his personal project; eventually he becomes aware of his other self, Tylor, examined his own actions and those of Tylor's, and finds peace again with himself.Another mockery the film makes is towards the concept of masculinity. I quickly noticed the crowd drawn by Tylor consists only males, and the character itself is the projection of perfect masculinity perceived by the society. In a civilised society where powerful positions no longer require physical strength, certain male members feel a great sense of insecurity – exactly the members fight club attracts. Frustrated by their failure to gain influence in the establishment, they go to the gym and boxing clubs to regain confidence, or engage in reckless behaviours to show how daring they are. The film portrayed these people as flat in character and seemingly stupid. The only trait that sets Tylor apart from them is his intelligence. In fact, it was the intelligent part of him that woke him up from the corporate slavery, not the masculine part. Violence and sex are used as a tool to express power, but after the short-lived pleasure derived from the power trip, the ensuing wounds and pain are long-lasting. While Tylor dominated Marla in bed, the protagonist does not even feel the pleasure from sex. In the end, the feminine and powerless Marla saves the protagonist by reconnecting the conflicting parts of him and completes his self- searching journey.My mood was manipulated by the film the first time I saw it; the motivational speech about self-discovery and pursuit of passion sold me. But when I realised they were blindly targeting companies, I suddenly realised the stupidity of the ideology with which the crowd was bonded, and from that departure, I felt alienated from the protagonist and from the film and was able to see the bigger picture. From the interviews of the author and the director I did not see the same interpretation I had, however, I believe an art piece has its own life after its creation. From cinematographic perspective, this is a very well made film. Once again Fincher did an excellent job. I recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
10,"Great Movie.  When I entered the movie  theater I did not know what to expect. This movie is very anti  pc (political correctness), the director sets the mode that many people can relate to.

He has to be very organized, careful what he says, and follows what society and corporate cultures tells him.  As how one should think, and what is considerd sucessful.   Fight club evolves from this foray as and escape from societies pressures.  A sort of mid-evil escape where prime evil urges can be played out. fight club it self grows from this environment.

David Fincher has a unique style that just fits with kind of a movie.In the most basic sence , this movie is a fight against a cruise control life . It mocks the life most of us live , it mocks the society will live in and it is scary just how relatable this movie still is and will be for years to come.However , this movie is still not a 10/10 for me and here is why.This movie succeeds most of the time to deliver the message and make you think about a deeper meaning but sometimes it gets overcomplicated with delivering those magic words. It feels too much like a book and that creates a slow pace with too many words. The movie has some parts that could easily be erased but the twist at the end makes it seem worth it but ...
by the end it gets a little too detached from the basic message and what it is actually trying to say that you quickly lose focus.I think the movie is and wil always be a cult classic masterpiece but the premise of the movie could have been better done like Parasite.

The twist ending challenges the viewer, leaving a lasting impression.

"In a Utopia, ""South Park"" vs. ""Fight Club"" for the Oscar","Mr. Fincher, Congratulations on another coup de gras that undoubtedly takes Hollywood by storm, and raises the blood pressure of the P.C. crowd.  I can not comment on the truth to the novel as I have not read it.  But the version I witnessed was mesmerizing.  The two leads, ironically considered two of Hollywood's leading ""Pretty Boys"" turn in gritty, adept performances that certainly don't ring of ""Pretty Boy"".  Helena Bonham Carter proves she'll do what a role calls for.  The remainder of the prominent cast, in their small but important roles provide the necessary gung-ho to make this movie fly. If they remade ""Terminal Man"", they'd call it ""Fight Club"".  As Brad Pitt calls in the trailer, ""Fight Club"" takes it up a notch.  Those who criticize this movie for it's ""brutality, glorification of violence, love of pain"" are, I'm sure, the same individuals who looked the other way during ""Private Ryan"".  The violence in this movie is pervasive and graphic.  It is not, however, gratutitous or unnecessary.  It sets a tone.  Think ""Clockwork Orange"".  The plot was NOT predictable, thereby thwarting the normal Hollywood method.  I felt like I was watching the European ""The Vanishing"" when it all played out.  And it made me smile and wince.  Smile at the surprise, wince at the gripping story.  Obviously, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  And it is not often I think how I can't wait to see it again.

Hello,"Nstead of starting with a general statement:Jump right into your movie experience: ""I finally watched Fight Club, a film I'd been putting off because I planned to read the book first. But then I figured a classic wouldn't be ruined by watching it first, especially since the plot seems secondary.""
Instead of summarizing the plot:Focus on your initial expectations and how they were subverted: ""Going in, I braced myself for two hours of preachy 'be your own man' cliches, fueled by those overused quotes and some local rock bands. There's a hint of that in the first half with Tyler Durden's speeches.""
Instead of listing pros and cons:Explain how the film's presentation of Tyler Durden is complex: ""The interesting part is, the film presents Tyler's philosophy in a way that makes you agree with him sometimes ('Attaboy, Tyler!') and disagree with him at others ('Hold on there, buddy'). It's not a simplistic good vs. Evil or rebellion vs. System message like a pop-punk song.""Highlight the development of the main character: ""While the film respects Durden and his ideas, the unnamed narrator is important too. He initially embraces Tyler's rebelliousness, but gradually finds his own path.""Instead of explaining Tyler's flaws:Focus on the film's critique of blind following: ""Tyler's methods, despite good intentions, become extreme. His rigidity can be comical, but more importantly, he takes away freedom in his quest to liberate everyone. Initially, only the narrator is on equal footing; the others seem brainwashed by Tyler's forceful personality.""
Conclude with your takeaway:Briefly summarize the film's message: ""Ultimately, Fight Club shows how rebelling against one form of control can lead to another. The fight for individuality needs balance.""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

There is a plethora of reasons. However, the main reason that Fight Club is so fascinating is because it has aspects that everyone enjoys.

Another Fincher fairy tale,"I've heard many people say (and seen many reviews written) that Fight Club is a classic.  Mind blowing.  Completely fresh.  Sorry, but I just don't see it.I'll start with the positives.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt were excellent. Pitt perfectly captures the super-cool, no attachments, nothing-to-lose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth.  Norton is also perfect as the uptight, frustrated yuppie bored with life's vapidity.  Even Helena Bonham Carter, who I normally don't much care for, was okay in the generic girlfriend role.Now on to the negatives.  The story is just utterly preposterous.  Maybe even more so than Fincher's last absurd movie, The Game.  The movie really lost all believability when Fight Club turns into the cult, Project Mayhem. Although it has a nice twist ending with the Pitt/Norton dynamic, I couldn't buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless, fanatical followers.  Pitt's charismatic, but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft.  The movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but I thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where Norton describes his perfect condo, filled with things he really didn't need.  Everything else is overkill.  And the final big plan to blow up (I won't say what in case you haven't seen the movie yet) in order to level the world playing field is...well....pointless.Just like The Game, Fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity.

A pulsating investigation of broken masculinity,"Adapted from the transgressive novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club is a tour-de-force in violence, action, provocation and unreliable narration. Its story is meticulously crafted so that the great reveal, whilst shocking, also makes a great deal of sense. Brad Pitt's iconic performance as the now infamous Tyler Durden is never less than engrossing and the twisted bromance/romance menage-a-trois which provides the film's heart is delightfully unique.Fincher's direction is pulsating, unforgiving and slick. The film broods with intensity but never takes itself too seriously. In fact, its at times off-beat quirkiness somehow enhances the most disturbing scenes. There's a nonchalance to the psychological and physical suffering that takes place in the film which is as well-judged as it is disturbing.This is not a film for all tastes; however, unlike a number of films which came out around a similar time, there is real substance which underpins the film's iconic style. It is a deeply masculine film about the need to feel connected. It's a film which revels in nihilism that is about the need to find some form of meaning. It's a film which seeks to provoke but not idly or immaturely; at its heart, it seeks to stand up for the down-trodden, the neglected, the marginalised, the weak. It wishes to say, whoever you are, however low you have fallen, there is a place for you and your journey may yet remain to be defined. After all, if a character as maladjusted and confused as the unreliable narrator of this film can find some sense of meaning in his life, then there must be hope for all of us yet.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

College-Aged Males: This is your anthem,"For a child of the 80s, this was perfect...the antidote to feeling hemmed in and impotent. i'd imagine this movie is less appealing to today's college-aged boys, but maybe i'm wrong... i hope that masculine-ideal-related anxiety is becoming less pervasive... although the internet may prove otherwise. this film features a stellar soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, high replay-ability (thanks to lots of little Easter eggs) and a pretty dynamic cast...

One of the best films of the 90's,"I did not know what to expect from Fight Club, but I gave it a try since I am a fan of Fincher's films Se7en, Zodiac, and the more recent The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film surprised me in it's style and tone. It has a very inventive narration and surreal images that only help make us go deeper into Edward Norton's character and his mind. I can safely say there are not too many films like this. The main premise seems simple, two men create a combat group that soon turn into a large cult or society. Although it is simple, the film's choices and execution are not simple. I was confused by a lot on this film, and I am sure this is a film I will have to watch more than once, but I was deeply invested in these characters. I felt the reason for the main characters' choices and the struggle with their lives that they felt they needed to overcome, and the only way to do that was by fighting, not for winning or losing, but to feel important and feel more absorbed in the practice of it all. Very original idea. I thought the writing was sensational, a lot of very thought-provoking ideas and dialogue in the film. I did not know what to expect, but the twist actually shocked me. I have seen a lot of films with twists similar to this, but the film executed it in a unique way and thought it fitted well. David Fincher's direction seemed more confident and mature here than in any other of his films. I cannot believe the screenplay writer from this also wrote Jumper(WOW). The performances here were brilliant. Norton was great, but the ones who truly shined were Pitt and Carter. I always feel both these actors, especially Helena, create some truly fantastic characters, and this is no exception. I did not always think Pitt was a capable actor, but with films like The Assassination of Jesse James, Benjamin Button and Burn After Reading from 2008, he has proved he is great. I am surprised neither Carter or Pitt got many awards or nominations.I thought Fight Club was fantastic, and in a truly weird sublime way, it was entertaining. Like I said, there were some tricky parts, but I thought it was a film that could be a disaster but had so many elements to it. Probably Fincher's best, along with Benjamin Button (I'll see which stands stronger as time goes by). Along with his other film, Se7en, one of the best of the 90's.",,Anonymous,Drama

A wild film about the ordinary...,"When Fight Club first appeared it became an instant cult film - a ""modern classic"". Back then I gave it 9/10. Just watched it again after a 8-10 year gap and now I'm giving it 8/10.Fight Club hasn't aged that well, and for all the wrong reasons. In 1999, there weren't many films or series like this. 25 years later - there are. Fight Club doesn't stand out anymore.It's still a good film though.Edward Norton is excellent as the ordinary guy who, bit by bit, entirely loses it. Brad Pitt is Norton's wild side: alter-ego Tyler Durden. What follows is an inner journey, exploring sexuality, control (and deliberate lack of...), self-harm and rule-breaking. Who/what is Norton? Who/what is Tyler Durden? There are a very wide range of interpretations open in Fight Club.This film is more or less dark in virtually every respect!Bonham-Carter is good in a supporting role, and Meat Loaf gets a good cameo.Fight Club is a strange film - one that has almost too much going on.

G.M.O.A,"In a world brimming with cinematic offerings, opinions on movies can vary as widely as the diversity of the films themselves. Among the plethora of opinions, there exists a sentiment of bewilderment when a particular movie fails to garner the admiration it seemingly deserves. This sentiment is perfectly encapsulated in the statement: ""I don't get how people don't like this movie. I mean, it has a great plot twist, the ending is perfect, it is written so well, you never get bored watching it because every scene has a purpose, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are literally perfect casting. I don't get why people hate this movie. For me, it's the Greatest Movie of All-Time at the moment.""At the heart of this statement lies a passionate defense of a film that, to the speaker, holds a special place of reverence. It's not merely a casual admiration; it's an impassioned plea for others to recognize the merits that the speaker perceives within the movie. Let's delve deeper into the reasons behind this fervent endorsement.First and foremost, the speaker extols the film's ""great plot twist."" A plot twist can be the make-or-break element of a movie, capable of leaving a lasting impression on audiences. When executed masterfully, as evidently observed in this film, a plot twist can elevate the entire viewing experience, injecting a surge of excitement and intrigue that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. It's not just about surprising the audience; it's about challenging their perceptions and offering a fresh perspective that enriches the narrative.Furthermore, the speaker lauds the ""perfect ending"" of the film. A satisfying conclusion is essential for any narrative, as it serves to tie up loose ends, provide closure to character arcs, and leave a lasting impact on the audience. A well-crafted ending resonates long after the credits roll, leaving viewers contemplating the themes and messages conveyed throughout the story. In this case, the speaker's assertion of a perfect ending suggests that the film delivers a poignant and memorable finale that effectively concludes the journey embarked upon by the characters.Moreover, the speaker praises the impeccable writing exhibited in the film. A screenplay is the blueprint upon which a film is built, shaping the dialogue, character development, and overall narrative structure. A well-written script not only captivates the audience but also serves as a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the writers behind the scenes. In this instance, the speaker's commendation of the film's writing implies that every line of dialogue, every plot twist, and every character interaction is meticulously crafted to create a cohesive and engaging cinematic experience.Additionally, the speaker highlights the film's ability to captivate viewers from start to finish. In a landscape oversaturated with content vying for attention, a movie that can hold the audience's interest throughout its runtime is a rare gem indeed. The speaker's assertion that ""every scene has a purpose"" suggests a narrative precision that ensures no moment is wasted, with each scene contributing meaningfully to the overarching story.Furthermore, the speaker lauds the casting choices of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, describing them as ""literally perfect."" Casting plays a pivotal role in bringing characters to life, and the chemistry between actors can elevate the quality of a film exponentially. In this case, the speaker's endorsement of Norton and Pitt implies that their performances imbue the characters with depth, complexity, and authenticity, further enriching the viewing experience.In conclusion, the speaker's impassioned defense of the film underscores the profound impact that cinema can have on individuals. Whether it's the thrill of a plot twist, the satisfaction of a perfect ending, the brilliance of the writing, the captivating nature of every scene, or the stellar performances of its cast, this movie has left an indelible mark on the speaker, cementing its place as the Greatest Movie of All-Time-at least for the moment. While opinions on films may vary, the passion and enthusiasm with which the speaker champions this movie serve as a powerful reminder of the transformative power of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fear Factor,"I think that the majorities' high appraisal for ""Fight Club"" reveals that society as a whole loathes the work force, obviously.  If not, then we come to know them as ""workaholics""--which I can safely say because I am one.On a personal level, I enjoyed ""Fight Club"" a great deal because of the psychological implications throughout, but it also indicates a disturbing theme as blue/white collars buy into the whole Durden philosophy with whole abandon.  The creator of Fight Club signifies the terror of a meaningless existence, especially retaining a Sisyphus-like mentality of waking up, working, eating, sleeping...  In a sense, this Durden figure is the Messiah, liberating the people from thinking for themselves, thus confirming a philosopher's saying that ""people would rather die than to think.""  (I apologize that I cannot deliver the philosopher's name due to my lack of memory.)  With that in mind, the movie also explores the domains of a life that can be possibly achieved once the drudgery of life is melted away, but only first through death.  ""The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity - designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final destiny of man."" (Ernest Becker in The Denial of Death)  Perhaps the alter ego remained in the narrator's subconscious, but gradually acquiesced as his desires surfaced and overruled the desires of his heart.  Opposingly, the narrator seemed to loathe his secret desires, for it allowed him to do things that procured undesirable effects in reality.  That is where the dynamics of this movie takes play, as a sinister dual personality is comprehended during the narrator's revelation amidst his oblivion.  Henceforth, the audience is understandably enraptured by the subplot of dual personality as well as the nightly releases of a pseudo-masochistic society.",,Anonymous,Drama

Fight Club: A Dark and Gripping Exploration of Disillusionment and Masculinity,"In the depths of modern society's consumerist culture, David Fincher's 1999 film ""Fight Club"" erupts as a visceral and thought-provoking exploration of disillusionment, masculinity, and the human condition. Edward Norton stars as an unnamed insomniac office worker, trapped in a monotonous and unfulfilling life. His desperation for change leads him to Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman with an unorthodox view of the world.Together, they form an underground fight club, a place where men can shed their societal masks and engage in raw, primal conflict. As the fight club gains popularity, it morphs into something more sinister, a twisted reflection of the very society it seeks to reject.Fincher masterfully crafts a visually stunning and darkly humorous cinematic experience, seamlessly blending elements of satire, drama, and psychological thriller. The film's unconventional narrative and audacious themes have challenged audiences for years, sparking debates about masculinity, consumerism, and the nature of reality itself.Norton delivers a tour-de-force performance as the nameless protagonist, capturing his growing alienation and desperation with raw intensity. Pitt's portrayal of Tyler Durden is equally captivating, embodying the character's charismatic charm and dangerous allure.""Fight Club"" is a film that lingers long after the credits roll, forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about themselves and the world around them. It is a cinematic masterpiece that has earned its place as a cult classic and a cornerstone of modern filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Horribly Overrated,"Fight Club is the most over-rated movie I have ever seen (barely beating out Gladiator).  It is also one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates - except in that light, its quality ends up seeming like someone's final project for their high school psychology class (as in, amateurish and not very detailed).People talk about its ""depth"".  My answer to that is, ""What Depth?"".I have no problem with its premise - people are dissatisfied.  Hey, I could handle ""The computers that rule the future can build a nearly-indestructible attack robot out of liquid metal"" in Terminator 2, dissatisfied people is nothing.  Even the incorrect placement of blame is believable.What bothers me, though, is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world.  I'm not saying there aren't people like that.  What I'm saying is that they aren't right.  They aren't automatons, they're unambitious.  They aren't ""suppressed by an overly-materialistic society"".  They're just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems.  I have an easier time believing Marx's nonsense about class identity than I do the things this film tries to pass off as ""meaningful social commentary"".Fight Club doesn't have a social message.

"Psychological abyss of ""Fight Club""","Alright, let's delve into the psychological abyss of ""Fight Club."" From a psychoanalytical perspective, we can draw heavily from Freudian and Jungian concepts to understand the intricate layers of the protagonist's psyche.Edward Norton's character, known as the Narrator, is a textbook case of dissociative identity disorder, a condition where a person's identity is fragmented into two or more distinct personality states. Enter Tyler Durden, the alter ego born out of the Narrator's suppressed desires and frustrations. The film presents an intriguing exploration of the unconscious mind and the conflict between societal expectations and primal instincts.Freud would likely point to the repression of the Narrator's true desires and emotions as the catalyst for Tyler's emergence. The mundane, consumer-driven life of the Narrator creates a pressure cooker of unexpressed desires, and Tyler becomes the outlet for this repressed energy. The Fight Club itself can be seen as a manifestation of the id, the primal, instinctual part of the psyche seeking release from societal constraints.From a Jungian perspective, Tyler Durden can be viewed as the embodiment of the Shadow archetype. The Shadow represents the hidden, repressed aspects of an individual's personality, aspects that society deems unacceptable. Tyler emerges to confront and embody these suppressed elements, forcing the Narrator to confront his own darkness.The personal transformation from Edward to Tyler can be seen as a desperate attempt at self-discovery. The Narrator's dissatisfaction with his life and the societal expectations placed upon him drive him to create Tyler, a charismatic and uninhibited character who embodies everything the Narrator wishes he could be. Tyler is essentially a projection of the Narrator's unconscious desires, representing a rebellion against societal norms and a quest for authenticity.The film's twist, revealing the true nature of the Narrator's identity, underscores the psychological toll of denying one's true self. It suggests that the path to self-discovery often involves facing and integrating the darker aspects of one's psyche. In the end, the violent and anarchic journey of ""Fight Club"" becomes a metaphor for the tumultuous process of individuation and the quest for authentic selfhood.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Not as provocative as it thinks, but still a hit","I was looking forward to this since I'm a fan of David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter, and since I read and liked the novel.  For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, until the end.  Not the plot twist(when I read the novel, I thought it was a rip-off of a famous thriller, which I won't name, since it'll give away this one, but it plays much better in the movie.  Also, you have to admit Fincher et al played fair with the audience before pulling the twist), but Project Mayhem and so forth; that seemed out of control and unnecessary.  Still, this is almost nothing like you've seen before, and unlike many visually-oriented directors, Fincher puts his talents in service of telling an interesting story, so you're carried along.

The first rule is.WATCH THIS!!!,"A visually amazing update on the Jekyll and Hyde story, with a twist that will have you pressing rewind as soon as the closing credits start rolling (much in the same way as the Sixth Sense or Memento). Pitt, who, following Twelve monkeys and Se7en, is gradually endearing himself to me, gives a mesmerising performance as Tyler Durden, a dark, modern-day philosopher. Norton is even better as the monotone narrator, as is Bonham-Carter as Marla Singer, a FAAAR cry away from Merchant-Ivory; and Meatloaf is surprisingly good in a veeery bizarre role. Maybe it's the quick-fire editing, the incredibly dark humour (which is often very funny) or the dialogue that makes you think twice, but I just can't get enough of this movie. Forget any political, fascist or homosexual subtext, and accept this film for what it is: a unique blend of intelligence and entertainment. Mr Fincher, I salute you.However, when I watched this first of all in the cinema with a friend, she drew my attention to how violent it was; c'mon, I've seen a LOT worse. And hey, wouldn't we miss out on some great cinema if certain other movies that have 'inspired' infamous true-life acts of violence were never made: Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs etc. ? I rest my case.So, if you are squeamish, my advice is to find a friend who has already seen it to guide you through the violent parts, because if you are put off solely for that reason, then you would be missing a great movie. 9/10, deducting one for the utter confusion that reigned after I first saw it- repeat viewings clarify things!And ladies, for God's sake, don't just rent it out for 'Brad's abs', because there is a lot, lot more to this film than bloody well that!",,Anonymous,Drama
Let's Talk About Fight Club,"Looks like I'm going to be breaking the first two rules of Fight Club. This is a hard film to talk about without also talking about the fandom of this movie. This movie has a legion of ""Film Dude Bros"" that base their whole personalities off this film. There is an odd irony that, in the film, Tyler Durden spreads his philosophies around America and puts together a large cult. In the real world, the movie ""Fight Club"" likewise spread its philosophies around America and got a large cult following.Now like any piece of art, there are multiple interpretations and themes one could gather from this movie. But people, Tyler Durdan and the Narrator are not heroes. They are no more role models than any of David Fincher's film characters. Some people might read that and think I'm a moron who has not reached enlightenment.Now, don't misunderstand me. I still think this is a good movie. I'm not setting out to destroy something beautiful. I know I'm not special, I'm not saying anything new about this film. It is a well-directed, tightly written and a truly unique picture.

Worst ending ever..,"Two great movies, in my opinion, are `The Game' and `Seven'-- Both directed by David Fincher.  So, obviously, I went into `Fight Club' wanting to love it.  And I did.  Well, the first half, anyway.  From there on, it went straight downhill into just another Hollywood-produced uncreative clone-movie.  I could go in and pin-point the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing, smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that I've seen:  `The Matrix' and `Dark City'.All three of these movies seem to have a common  `new-age' theme.  They all convey the message, `The individual can do anything, and as long as they don 't seek aid  from an outside source, their power is limitless.'  Maybe these Anti-Establishment / Anti-Religion ideals are just a faze in modern media, but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future.As for `Fight Club' on its own, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play their parts well, and the movie does have some redeeming elements, but overall I can't recommend it.

"In a year of amazing films, this one always stands out for me.","Whenever I talk about different years in movies, I always pick 1999 as my favourite year. So many amazing films came out such as American Beauty, The Green Mile, The Matrix and Being John Malkovich. Out of every movie that came out this year, one stands out for me and that is Fight Club.The first time I ever watched this movie was really late at night and I had waited for it to come on T.V and had to wait until everyone was asleep. I was in absolute awe over the sheer brilliance of the film. everything about it is amazing.The first thing I noticed was the cinematography. Every time I watch this movie, the opening shot gets me excited and ready for a powerful film.The story itself is so interesting, it doesn't have any dull moments. Even when a character's life is portrayed as boring you are just hooked in wanting to see what will happened next. The way the story develops also is very fascinating.Then we have wonderful performances from both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. But I think that the real standout here is Helena Bonham Carter. She plays one of the only female characters in the movie and truly makes you think about everything in the movie.There is one negative point though, the fact that a few scenes feel random and tacked on, along with some plot holes.Overall, if you haven't checked this out, this is a must for every person as long as you aren't squeamish.Rating: 6.8/7 (or 9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Classic Thriller,"I love this film because of the twist. It makes you think, and made me watch it multiple times. Fantastic writing and the actors really sold the film to me. I love this type of dark film. The director and the director of photography also did a wonderful job...I love the scenes in the abandoned buildings...They add to the darkness of the film. This film is unmatched in it's performance and in a class all by itself. The gritty film noir type has been copied, but never duplicated. The dual personality of the lead actor was delivered wonderfully as was the supporting actor. Brad Pitt delivers a stellar performance and makes us believe there is actually another person in the movie when there was not. The only other film I can think of that pulled this off was ""Sixth Sense"" with Bruce Willis.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
overrated and kind of too much nonsense,"Gaspar noe is know for his shocking movies.david fincher is respected by his movies, but here he tries to copy gaspar noe, so the movie is more shock after shock, than some meditation or some deep.Also this movie started a bad trend of real fight clubs...thats where a movie goes too wrong.Gaspar noe made shocking movies, but nobody tries to copy in real life, and this movie weirdly inspired real people...looks like david fincher in that time was lost.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fascinating piece,"It is quite rare thing that movie may be better than the book it is based on. And Fight Club actually is. I have watched it many times, the shrill still there, while the book gathers dust on a shelf.I read the book in English and in Russian (BTW the translation, at least the one I got in hand, sucks). By its sctucture it is very easy to be turned into a script exactly like it should be POV the narrator; OTOH it's not rich with descriptions, visuals are rather scanty. So I think the director and the cast did a perfect job to make movie pretty close to the book in pace, action and picture, giving the story greater power and subtlety by the means of cinematography; with one caveat - the ending. I know many people like the film ending and Palanniuk himself was quoted to prefer it. But it really doesn't make sense to me and makes the story more surreal and more shallow than one might digest.The acting is superb. Both Pitt and Norton are at their best and though I am not much into Helena Bonham Carter, she is amazing as Marla. Supporting characters are all well done, too. I also always love change of color scheme into sepia once we get into the Paper street world. Many things like that, you just must see it. It's an excellent film that will blow your mind anyway.That said, I am far from thinking this movie (and the book whatever) to be anything of a message. It is indeed thought-provoking but it actually doesn't offer a solution, nor a hint. Quite contrary it shows how much more preferrable the existing system would be comparing to the offered ways to get up at it. This rebellion without a cause, within the system, against its most obscure and superficial features is just a childish tantrum. That will pass and that is sad. BTW I would really like those many posters who state the movie changed their lives, to specify - how exactly? Oh wait I guess. They must have been purchasing Che Guevara t-shirts. Those do look nice with CK briefs.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of a kind movie.,"There never has been a movie like ""Fight Club"" before and there never will be again.""Fight Club"" is a great movie mixture of a great story, acting and style. Movies that have all those elements are rare and often a great and one of a kind movie.Director David Fincher's directing works effective. It gives the movie both style and substance with a lot of depth. The story makes you want to see the movie over and over again, so you can understand and discover some more things on every viewing.Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a great acting job, although I probably wouldn't have picked Pitt as a leading character. His role comes too soon after his in ""Twelve Monkeys"", both the movie and his character show resemblances. Meat Loaf has a fun role as Bob with the big man-breasts.The story is way more different than you would most likely expect. When you are first watching this movie you expect it to be a fight movie with street boxing. This is not the case, ""Fight Club"" is a personal movie in which the main focus lies on the main character and the anti-society message much like in Kubrick's movies was the case.Highly recommendable movie, although not a classic or masterpiece in my book.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Rule number one about Fight Club; you do not talk about Fight Club. Rule number two about Fight Club: you do not talk about Fight Club!,"1999 was a great year for film, with many great films releases that year: The Matrix, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2, The Sixth Sense are just a few examples. To join them was Fight Club, a controversial film based on a popular novel and directed by David Fincher, a man whom career was on the up.Edward Norton play an insurance clerk who was suffering from insomnia and struggles to deal with it. He starts by attending support groups for people suffering from long term illnesses to cope with his issues. Yet that disappears when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts to attend these meeting and takes away their edge. Whilst on a business trip the man meets Travis Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and salesman. They quickly becomes friends and move in together into a dilapidated house. They also start to take joy when having fights and the popularity of these fights quickly expand into Fight Club. But under Travis' leadership Fight Club soon takes an even darker turn and it's up to the man to stop him and his plot.Fincher is a very skilled director and with Fight Club he gives audiences his most stylist film. He uses a lot of visual trick and starts to play around a lot more with the camera. He shows confidence with CGI and the nature of how it was used was fitting for the film. There is a dark style and tone throughout, Fincher does not hold back the violence or some of the more grim aspects of the film. There is a lot of dark humour in the film, particularly during the early part of the film. Fincher with a screenplay by Jim Uhls which is based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk tell a very complex story and there is a lot of themes throughout. There are themes about people trying to find their identity, how the human mind works, criticisms of modern advertising and consumerism and how people could use it or become hypocrites, how a cult would function and of course, man's desire for violence and destruction. Despite it's title this film does not focus to much on the underground fighting. This is an intelligent film which will allow the audience to think.There is some excellent acting in this film with a great cast. Pitt and Norton were brilliant in the lead roles, with Pitt having a potent charisma throughout whilst Norton is effective as an everyman character of the piece. Bonham Carter was also great in this film and these 3 actors were a dream team together.An excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A sardonic satire that gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings.,"To say this is a film solely about grown men punching one another is like saying 'Dances With Wolves' is about a bloke and his pet trying to win a weird cross-breed calypso competition, for the flick is actually a satire centred on our consumerism and commercialism consumed society with a successfully sardonic tone and a keen set of delightfully devious twists and turns, the least of which being its focal reveal which is one of the most lauded and documented twists in cinematic history but is also vastly overrated in terms of why 'Fight Club (1999)' is so successful despite it being a truly clever and revolutionary reveal. It's the taut pacing and screw-tightening screenplay that ratchets up both the tension and confusion, the perfect performances that sell the sometimes silly seeming goings-on and the perfectionist grimy direction that points the viewer in one direction while doing something vastly important in the other that all add up to make the experience a lasting and memorable one that feels as though it has something to say, gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings to equally successful effect. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Alternative story,"This film impressed me because it is not the typical story you find in books or movies. I'm a fan of black humor and it is quite funny how the characters laugh at themselves, at their lives and problems, and I think even moral fags will laugh on this and will be surprised. Also I found interesting the way the story develops, which has an alternative end that one doesn't expect to happen at all, but if one pays enough attention, there are a pair of details that suggests how it might end. It is a movie that makes you think about your own life, about scary things that happen around you and you don't even notice it. So it is not actually so far from reality.

Overrated crap,"Fight club represents all that's worst in the 90's, coincidentally also stars Brad Pitt in it, something that amuses me i must confess.Few other movies are as hyped in IMDb as this one, this movie created an enormous legions of fans all with their little own understanding of what the movie represents, every single Fight Club fan has it's own idea what the movie is about.As for the movie itself it's fairly decent and the acting is good. Unfortunately i can't stand Pitt, both his acting and his face ,so the whole process of watching it was unbearable.I won't dwell on what the story is because no fight club fan would agree with me, like i said beforehand, everyone has a different thought on what it represents.The story doesn't really entertained me, i feel this movie has a very specific audience in mind, like people who work in same office for 30 years and lost their balls, and viewing this they can dream a bit.Anyway i despise pretty much all Pitt movies, i hate this one even more because of their fan base.

High on adrenalin and visually inventive,"This often pretty brutal examination of the male psyche is certainly a very dynamic piece of film-making. David Fincher has to be given a great deal of credit for imbuing his film with an enormous amount of energy and invention. It's a movie infused with adrenalin both thematically and stylistically. So job well done. The two lead actors are massive in contributing to this. Ed Norton supplies the edge, while Brad Pitt the movie star charisma. Both are ideal in their respective roles. There is a wicked sense of humour present throughout the film with a number of very funny moments. While the sense of the bizarre is ever present. This is hardly a realist strand of film-making. Fight Club is a dramatic film that is very fantastical. It doesn't really make it's intentions very clear cut. It leaves you the audience to decide for yourself what you make of it. This no doubt contributed to it's initial failure at the box office. It requires a bit more work from the viewer than most films. But it is also one of those movies that demands to be re-watched; it comes at you from an entirely different angle when you know the outcome in advance. Definitely one of the 90's most original studio releases.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Chuck Palahniuk... even if it is not good it must be fun :D,"I wouldn't align it with all-time masterpieces, but it definitely is a great movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton nailed the lead character, but from them, I didn't expect anything less. Meat Loaf additionally spiced winning combination. But my biggest surprise was that movie was based on Chuck Palahniuk novel. Although I saw it many times, that ""detail"" never caught my eye. Chuck is completely nutz, but the movie did not indicate his style to me. Now I definitely have to read the book. The movie itself is fast, entertaining and with good twists, although the main twist is somewhat predictable if you are watching the movie carefully enough. If there is anyone who didn't see it so far, you should correct that mistake urgently, and for others, it won't harm you to refresh your memory, there are always new details you missed before.8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The best film ever made!,"Where to begin? I loved Fight Club, along with many other people, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an 'open mind' and does not get offended easily. Fight Club had a dark feel, with very black comedy and a touch of mystery.Fight Club is about one man's journey through a weird part of his life. He (Edward Norton) has a good job working for a car company, he has nice IKEA furniture in his nice little condo. He was almost a complete man. Until, his condo explodes while he is away and he looses everything he owned. So, he rings Tyler (Brad Pitt), an acquaintance he made on a plane on one of his business trips. He goes and has a few beers with Tyler. After they finish they come out of the pub and Tyler asks him to hit him as hard as he can. After some hesitance he does, Tyler hits him back and they fight the night away. They get a buzz from fighting and that's how Fight Club starts. I won't give anything away but the story twists and turns ways you could never imagine.What made Fight Club so great was a combination of many different people doing a great job.  The novel buy Chuck Palahniuk was brilliant and I personally thought that it could never be brought to the screen and be as good as the book. But, Fight Club exceeded its limits and went a step further with a great screenplay by Jim Uhls, without the great screenplay the film would have flopped. Then there is the extraordinary acting all around, it was undoubtedly Edward Norton's, Helena Bonham Carter's and Brad Pitt's best performance ever and other small roles were played well too, such as Meat Loaf, playing Bob. And of coarse, last but not least, David Fincher. David exceeded all expectations making Fight Club. The film was given the prefect feeling thanks to David's precise direction, if you listen to the commentary and see all the extra features on the DVD you will be sure to know how much effort David put into Fight Club to give it the perfect feel, just like the book.Overall, Fight Club gives us some very strong messages, but I thing the very essence of the film is to take what you want from it. This is a must see for everyone, because in my opinion this is the best film ever made and you will most probably enjoy it. If you don't like it, watch it a second time, it will likely change you opinion. A definite: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Overrated but good,"Fight Club, directed by David Fincher, is a provocative and thought-provoking film. It revolves around a group of individuals rebelling against the modern consumer society.

I mean, it's so bad that I almost threw a flower pot at the TV screen. And don't be misled by the title. It's not really about a fight club, it's about something more absurd. Edward Norton did the best job he could with this lousy script, and even Brad Pitt did a mediocre job. The surprise ending is nothing like The Sixth Sense.

Surrealistic Dreams,"******SPOILERS****** The movie ""Fight Club"" starts off where it's about to end as Jack the narrator, Edward Norton, looking the worst for ware, recites his story that led him up to where it got him to that point.Living the life of a 90's yuppie, enslaved by his job and his material possessions, Jack developed a very bad case of insomnia due to the hours he worked and lifestyle he led that made him go for medical attention. Going to see a doctor forp Jack is told that his insomnia is not the end of the world. If he wants to see real suffering to go to a testicular cancer support group and what he sees and hears from those unfortunates there would make him forget he problems.Taking the doctors advice Jack go to that support group and is struck by the suffering that those inflicted by that terrible disease go through. He develops a friendship with one of the members of that group Big Bob Paulson, Meat loaf, a former body builder. Because of his heavy steroid use Big Bob not only lost his testicles to cancer but his wife and two sons as well as his money. Not only did Jack feel he was doing something constructive, by crying along with Big Bob, it also help him cure his insomnia.Jack started going to all kinds of support groups during his time off from work and tried to help those needing his support. Jack also helped himself by his very giving comfort and help to those that needed it. At the meetings Jack noticed a woman Marla, Helena Bonham Carter, attending the same meetings that he attended. It became obvious to Jack that she was not suffering the traumas, like testicles cancer, that those at the meetings were suffering from. It also made Jack very conscious of himself who was doing the same thing.All this brought Jack's insomnia back with a vengeance and one night he confronted her about being a ""tourist"" and not being honest in attending these group meetings. Coming to a decision with Marla not to attend the same group meetings they both exchange phone numbers to keep in touch.Later on one of Jack many plane trips, that's part of his job, he finds himself sitting next to a very interesting man Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt. Tyler happens to have the exact same suitcase that Jack has. Tyler is everything that Jack wishes he could be; free independent and not stuck up with the yuppie lifestyle that Jack so much wants to get away from but can't.After the plane lands two things happens to Jack that changes his life forever. His suitcase is missing in the baggage department and when he goes home to his high-rise condo he sees that it was blown to pieces by an explosion. This sets the stage that led him to get closer to Tyler and at the same time to get involved with Tyler's pet project the weekly Fight Club matches. These strange events started in the basement of a local bar and also brought Marla back into Jacks life, for better or for worse.The Fight Club matches also revealed something very deep and personal about Jack that was locked deep in his sub-conscious mind; they changed Jack forever in his thoughts and actions. In depth and surrealistic film about couping with the stress of modern life and how the mind works in ways that we can never understand to get us through situations that seem almost impossible to handle. Explosive ending shows how ones suppressed and constrictive mind can become mightier then the sword when it unleashes itself on an unsuspecting public.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Male identity in the 1990s,"No spoilers here, but this may be a comment for those who've seen Fight Club and are thinking about watching it again.After looking past all the violence, extreme cinematographic techniques, computer-enhanced images, and other tricks Fight Club plays on us, we see another level to this film.  It's a show about young men trying to find their place in society at the end of the 1990s.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play a couple of typical guys in typical situations for men of their age, with no idea where to go with their lives. (Okay, you can argue that Pitt's character isn't so typical, and that he has some idea what to do.  I'd say he's only about a half-step ahead of Norton.) These guys went through school, graduated college, and got normal, thoughtless jobs (jobs, not careers) because they felt it was expected of them.  Now they don't know what's expected of them.  Their fathers are gone--can no longer tell them what to do.  They've been confronted with opposing images of what constitutes a man all their lives--the cold, power-hungry yuppie; the sensitive, caring friend to the environment; the politician that cheats and lies to the people he represents; the attractive actor/model who don't seem to be capable of having an original thought.They're finally coming to a point (and this is where Pitt is ahead of Norton) where they have to figure out what _they_ want to do with their lives, or give up live by these images society presents them.Convinced that real life and growth come about from conflict, they start fight club.  Norton and Pitt's characters discover that in this repressed, politically-correct society, the best way to really know yourself, the only way to really grow, is through conflict.  They fight to see what they're capable of giving out and taking.  They fight to conquer each other, but more importantly to conquer themselves.  They fight to recognize each other as human beings and to gain respect for themselves and each other. Whether you're offended by the violence or not, you have to appreciate the symbolic importance of the conflict here.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A High Schooler's Dream,"I saw this movie late one night on HBO my junior year in high school. I bought it the next day and probably saw it 25 times that week. This was the first movie I ever saw that gave me reason to believe movies could be more than entertaining or heart warming. Movies could say something intelligent. Of course, the fact that this is one of the most entertaining movie's EVER only makes the watcher want to listen to what it says all that much more. And despite it's presentation and even content, it does say good things.I won't talk, at least that much, about how amazing Pitt, Norton, and Carter are. I won't focus on the twist that no one ever sees coming and yet makes so much sense. Even without the twist, the movie would have become a classic. I won't talk about the interesting homoerotic themes, and I won't go on about how this is the modern western. Let's talk about the book instead.I'll say it. The movie is better. While the book obviously made the movie possible, the movie is an improvement, a realization. Even Palahniuk says so concerning the end. A difficult story to put on film, but the effort was not in vain. Just as harsh, just as (and I hate this word) unflinching, the book may actually be a bit clumsy, things about beaches and Marla's mother really aren't necessary or even interesting. The grittiness of the movie is superior to anything I could have imagined, and I have an okay imagination.I mean it, that this is a high schooler's dream. Having never even imagined things like Nihilism or self sustained living or even the virtue of pain, this film was eye opening. This movie hits like a brick, and you want it to keep hitting. Oh, and it's super quotable.It's embarrassing to say, but this movie shaped me to some extent.

This is your life and it's ending one minute at time. A MASTERPIECE!,"This is an incredible movie. I've seen ""fight club"" when it was released in 1999; stunned by that movie i read the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and i've discovered an incredible writer too. It's too complicated to describe a movie like this. It's a crude, realistic, nihilistic vision of our lives, our crisis, our world filled with clichés, with media that tell you how you must be, how you must act, how you must live. It's not only a fighting movie at all. It's about deconstructions, about pain, about the use of a struggle to feel human again. The acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are great here. Both seems to dive like a fish in their roles, and the character of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is simply flawless. From beginning to the end the movie caught you in an alienated, but incredibly real web of a twisted mind, struggling for freedom, raging against everything. I can't tell anything more 'cause i'll ruin the atmosphere of the flick... The novel it's great too (like all others works by Chuck). The movie is almost identical to the book, apart for the end. In conclusion i consider ""Fight Club"" one of the deepest, darkest and twisting movie of the decade. It's a masterpiece and you must see it at least once, and if you think i must have my head examined, well, you've totally missed the point!!!

"All Pretension, No Punch","Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in only three films has already set his stamp on filmmaking.  Of course, we didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic ""Seven."" But in retrospect ""Seven "" was as bleak and despairing as anything done in mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less.  Then came ""The Game,"" a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish ""game"" learns to live again.  ""Carpe Diem"" a la Kafka.  This same premise is put into a societal point of view with ""Fight Club.""This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation.  ""Fight Club"" comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk.  The film relates the story of a successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an insomniac.  He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life. He can't feel emotion anymore.  On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis group and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a rare cancer (insert laughter here).  This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts.  Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.Things are moving along great.  Never mind that he's using these victims as emotional pumps, the point is he feels again.  Then comes an uninvited femme fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she used to do Merchant-Ivory?Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere. Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in his customers' soups.  These two bond by beating the crap out of each other. ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can, "" Durden says.  Norton obliges by punching his ear.Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a freak fire.  Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other.  Naturallly, other men gravitate.  Finally, a club is established in which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators in a self-imposed ring.  The object:  Fight so one can feel masculine again.As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban terrorism group.  Nihilism by way of Fascism.  You see, ""Fight Club"" is about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to what they truly are, hunters.  Only problem is where does one draw the line?First off, the positive.  ""Fight Club"" is technically brilliant. Audacious and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator. So Norton talks directly to the camera, stops the film for a bit of background information on characters, and lets other characters comment as well.  Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted.  The camera swoops into Norton's brain at one point and we take a stroll around his pad even seeing the price for each item.  The energy is infectious and the acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are top-notch.Is there any negative?  Yep.I felt dirty watching this film.  I felt the same way when watching ""Natural Born Killers.""  Yes, it was satire as I'm sure ""Fight Club"" is as well. But the satire seems to be unfocused.  What  exactly is the point of seeing guys pummel each other and pick fights with innocents?  Does Fincher support the premise of violence to save souls or are they all doomed anyway?  And I must be getting soft, but there were scenes that grossed me out, specifically the human fat scene (Don't ask).  Satire does not work by exaggeration alone; there needs to be purpose.  That's something ""A Clockwork Orange"" had. Yes, it was violent and disturbing.  But there was a point to the film. Science cannot curb man's morality nor should it.  What does ""Fight Club"" say, let's all revert back to cavemen?  Sorry, not interested.The ending is just plain dumb.  I will not reveal anything, but be prepared for pretension deluxe.A friend of mine compared this film to ""American Beauty"" saying that both films dealt with changing one's humdrum existence into a life full of meaning.  But ""Beauty"" had something that ""Fight Club"" lacked.  Humanity. At the end of ""Beauty"", Lester Burnham thinks he has found purpose in enjoying life again, but he realizes that his life had purpose all along because of his family.  Burnham comes full circle.  We never get that kind of revelation in ""Club.""  The selfishness in achieving nirvana through nihilism remains and a hollowness remains at the film's center.Fincher's movies are disturbing, that's just a given.  But their saving grace, especially in the case of ""Seven,"" is their imagination and story. ""Fight Club"" has its imagination as well.  However, because of its trite story, I can't say it was a saving anything.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
no Exit,"When watching a movie what sets it apart from other films? is it its style, its story, characters, moral or message?I like style, but when the rest sucks, it feels like a designer cupboard with no space to put something in, and you're left with something nice to look at but with no use... Well fight club is A DESIGNER CUPBOARD with plenty to put in.First of all the visuals are stunning and top notch all of them.Colours are balanced the editing is clever and well placed, wardrobe and settings all urban,beautifully realistic without glamorizing its emptiness or its decay. This is what ""we"" live in, everyday.Then there's the story and its messages and morals...frustration, boredom, emptiness and the feeling of being the 2nd born in history...no direction to go, but to go ahead in a society that takes all but doesn't leave but the option of being a customer, a lifestyle obsessed doing jobs we hate copping things we don't need.Break out, start a revolution, don't give a damn, and become... Tyler Durden. Smart, witty, good looking and willing to sacrifice anything for point zero. Don't hold on, let go...what makes you ain't got no use at all. Don't solve nothing...for what anyway? Learn society and learn how to trick it, learn how to live without it, give up all be free and survive on its edge. Start a fight, get punched and get to know you, go on shave your head, bomb a building, sacrifice status and lifestyle become a brain dead space monkey and find out you've been punk ed again this time by Tyler and his world view.Like Brett Easton Ellis wrote: ""No Exit"" for none of us.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film about our generation.,"Well what can I say? This film is amazing. It has everything that an MTV generation boy or girl could want, all neatly packaged in this gem of a movie. I must say the book was amazing, I loved it, it really gave some fresh ideas to life, and why we act the way we act. But i feel the movie is a better medium in which to show this to mass audience. First things first, every actor in this film is marvellous, a joy to watch. Edward Norton is God, when it comes to really nailing a character and slipping into a role, he is close to DeNiro. Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto all are a pleasure to watch. But I must say this film is about one man, Tyler Durden... ladies and gentlemen... Brad Pitt rocked in this. I could never possibly imagine anybody else in this role, he magnificently slips into a potentially hypocritical role, looking good and acting the part, my hats off. What makes this film so great, naturally the twist is always important and a real brain teaser, is just how glorious it is after you realize the truth. On second viewing you pick up more details, the tiniest of things that just make the film worth watching over and over again. But most important is its visual flare. It is as if we are in the mind of Jack [or the narrator - take your pick] The constant jumping back, going forward, skipping to and throw, picking up were he left off, it represents beautifully what a modern mans life is like, full of constant hectic day to day monotomous work routines, all becoming slaves to the fashion and food industry, as if image were really the most important aspect in life. This is a rant on capitalism, and all the better for it, me and my friends enjoy it particularly for that reason, because it laughs in the face of democracy, not in an attempt to [as some American critics failed to understand] promote Fascism as an idealised movement, but just to stand there and say ""Hey this is what's wrong, I don't like this and that, F**k you and your rules, lets do something worth living about."" It really tunes into modern perceptions of life: Work, Sex, Fashion, Religion and Security... and just really mixes them around. I came out of the cinema bedazzled by the whole look of the film, but watch it again and enjoy it for what it really has to offer... everything.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant,"easily one of the most poignant, and effectual films of our generation...Edward Norton has surpassed his stunning performance in American History X and Brad Pitt has legitimized himself as a serious involved actor who's limits have yet to be seen.

These people are ""consumers"" and are threatened by the movies message.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Full of action-packed, uh, social commentary, with lots of violence",My opinion?  One of the best movies this year.  And I've seen them all. Even the Haunting.  The shared acting of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt was visually stunning and left me entertained for hours afterwards.  If bloody fistfights are not your thing then this is definitely not the film for you.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Intense!,"When I first saw the movie trailer of Fight Club, I thought that this has some potential to be a good movie.  But... I didn't get to see this movie because of a hectic schedule that I set myself up for.  Exhausted, I stopped following my schedule a few months later.  I went out, got myself a membership to a local video store and decided to become an instant movie buff and got a whole bunch of newly released video tapes.  Out of all the movies I saw, Fight Club stood out and was the only movie that I repeated over and over.  I knew about the great actors, interesting idea and the violence of this movie, but I was shocked to find a thought-provoking and breathtaking film.  I have seen hundreds of movies before this and I was impressed to say the least.  This is the most relevant movie for me.  Like the main character, (played effortlessly by Edward Norton) I also was and still is suffering from insomnia and also from, what looks to be the same reasons as he was.  He was suffering and needed something in his life.  He meets Tyler Durden (seemingly played with great ease by Brad Pitt) in a plane trip and becomes his new best friend.  Together, they develop Fight Club (self-explanatory isn't it?).  I will not say more about this movie because I want people who haven't seen this to not know what to expect like I did when I watched this film.  The surprise does help give the film the feeling that it needs.  Not a film for everyone due to excessive violence, sex and gore ,but for anyone who can stand it all and hasn't seen it yet, watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Man O Man O .....,"The movie starts off in a harmless way. Having you believe that it's just another frustrated males twisted life story.Half way in to it and I was totally possessed by it's disturbing darkness and at the same time the brilliance of it all.I may as well add that fellas with weaker stomach will find it hard to digest this one.And towards the end a great depression took over me. I felt 'There is no way this one will leave me with anything but depression, what possibly can happen to alter the course NOW?'. But then, I should have known better....Having been a great fan of Edward Norton from his 'Red Dragon' days, I know that he has a peculiar taste in selecting films. His movies are anything but ordinary.The climax of course turned everything up side down and I slipped from the chair and rolled over...Nothing I say will ever fully describe how I felt. You just GOT TO see this one.And I never took Brad Pitt seriously before this one, even after watching se7en. But I have developed a deep sense of respect for this guy.Teens watch out, if you haven't seen this one yet then 'Tyler Durden' is gonna blow you over.An amazing movie, fantastic script, superb direction and extraordinary acting. This one is a collector's gem.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good but predictable and overrated,"While I believe this film is overrated, it is a very unique and original piece of work with great character development throughout with brilliant acting from both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I love a film with a plot twist but sadly saw this one coming from the start. I appreciate the cinematography and originality but found parts of it getting slightly boring and predictable. It does, however, definitely require a second watch as you will notice a lot more details the second time round. I do believe that it is lacking something that I can't put my finger on but maybe this will grow on me after a rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best flicks in the world.,"When I first saw Fight Club I was 11 years old, and after seeing it at that age I thought it sucked, mainly due to confusing story, and me not being English I couldn't really make much out of it, hence the hateful attitude I got for the movie.However, after seeing it again several years later, and then once more when I'm 18, I first noticed what a true masterpiece this movie is. Norton and Pitt simply ace their roles by far, and show that they both are world class actors.Not all credit goes to them, as the movie is very good by itself, and the great acting only boosts the score. It's masterpiece, and one of the absolutely best movies in the world, ever, seriously.Honestly I cannot understand why Fight Club 2 hasn't come out, but then again, it might destroy the first one because it's that good, and I don't think the producer would want that, and it'd most likely take a lot to get to those standards set.If you want to see Norton and Pitt at their best when it comes to their acting skills, then look no further, this is it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
More than a great movie,"A movie about enlightenment, discovering and using the primal power within, and making your life better, not by building up what you don't have, but by destroying the things in your life that do not truly matter. Fight Club also has very clever humor, and a decent love story that won't make you cry but won't make you laugh either. Fight Club discusses the hidden harm caused by consumerism and being a slave to a market-based society. Not only a great movie, but therapeutic to many who feel trapped by the unnecessary rules and standards of their society. This movie is a wake up call for anyone and everyone out there who works a job they hate so they can buy sh*t they don't need.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Blunt, important and stylish -- not just a guy's movie","""Rule number 1 of Fight Club: You do not talk about Fight Club.""Satirical, entertaining, bold, challenging and heavily stylized. Usually if a film has one of these qualities it is a good accomplishment. But David Fincher' acclaimed Fight Club (1999) has all of them, thereby cementing its status as upcoming cult in cinema. This is an important film that bravely plunges into the exploration of human issues like violence and depression, and that does so with flair and fury. It also sprinkles good doses of humour onto its final product, making Fight Club an enjoyable ride.Edward Norton is a thirty year old office worker, lazily frozen in a comatose state of ordering IKEA furniture and getting hounded by his boss. What takes him and shakes him is the arrival of Tyler Duren (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to a subculture of anarchy and a club called 'Fight Club'.Fight Club is an extremely graphic, violent and blunt portrayal of society and it looks into human nature. While Edward Norton's character as 'The Narrator' is an extreme case study, we all recognise aspects of his life and the thoughts in his head. The only problem as far as I'm concerned are the actors. You can never get away from the 'Pitt factor' in Brad Pitt's performance and it is often distracting. Edward Norton's narration often feels flat and emotionless. This would have been very appropriate in the beginning of the film, but as it progresses and he begins to feel more alive, his lifeless tone drags down the quality.This wouldn't make my top 20, but it'd probably make my top 30 list.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A radical, dark film presenting new standards in narration","No doubt, Fight Club is one of the best films of the decade and it deserves its overwhelming good reputation. Edward Norton plays his second-best role after his terrific performance in American History X and Brad Pitt does best in dark and bizarre films so he is absolutely right in Fincher's masterpiece. From the beginning it becomes clear that this is no film for people who just want to relax in their seat with some popcorn and a cola trying to spend a smooth evening. You really have to think and this is what makes it a good film. A man is frustrated about his life and searches for something completely different. Honestly, that's not a very new idea but Fincher is able to give it a new direction. He radicalizes his characters and shows brutality in a direct and uncovered way. The perversion of society gets a face in Tyler Durden and the ones who follow his ""new way"". The narration is what impressed me most. Who are absolutely shocked when you have to realize that Tyler is not the one he seems to be... To give a conclusion: Not my favourite, but a very, very good film!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A film desperately trying to justify itself without succeeding,"As you watch the film from the beginning, there is a chance for a deep film that goes inside the mind of the narrator (Edward Norton) and his counter-part Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and mostly the film succeeds for showing the slow transformation of the narrator into Tyler through the creation of an underground fight club. The premise works, however, there are too many times where the movie switches from the surreal to the utmost impossible. Though the film builds up in the first 2/3 the last is disappointing with just an idiotic ending plot along with an incoherent story. Though the narrator goes into a mode of ""self-discovery"" and the idea of man vs. himself in the end, which works, it isn't enough to save the film from keeling over from the abomination known as the human thirst for quick sell-outs for which the book version tries to state to all. A sad and pathetic form of a movie which could have been so much more.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Edward Norton rules!!!,"Man, enough cannot be said about that man, he is an incredible actor. ""Fight Club"", ""Fight Club"", man, what hasn't been said about it? ""It's an awesome movie, everyone should see this movie, this movie is the bomb"". Although I would agree that this was a great movie, do I think it should be on the top 100? No, maybe top 250. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is one of the best movies ever. But the acting is very good and the story is f----- up as hell. That's all I give the film. That's pretty much it. I would recommend this for Ed fans or Brad as well. I expected a lot and only got about 89% of the film's satisfaction. That's all I have to say about that.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Top 10 Movies Ever Made!!!,"Over the past few years, Fight Club has become my favorite movie. When I begin thinking about what actually attracts me to the thriller so much, the first things that come into my mind is uniqueness and completeness.Few movies have successfully captured such a twisted plot and produced an enjoyable, edge of the seat movie like Fight Club. From the beginning, the camera shots and ideas really get your adrenaline pumping. Combine the unbelievable graphics and stunt-effects with a boring turned exciting story and you have the makings for one hell of a ride.Fight Club truly has the entire package. Many good movies are close to being complete, but typically lack one or two key aspects for entertainment. Fight Club has the actors (Brad Pitt and Ed Norton's best acting jobs), the plot (unique and relative), and one of the best endings in movie history.You must ride this baby out because if you miss anything, you may be sorry.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Young men getting angry at consumerist society?,"This is an interesting film - the violence appears more a side issue to the really acid take ""Fight Club"" has on society. Then again, the violence is why quite a few people went to see it. If they went for straight out gore though, the hopefully left considering more interesting issues.I thoroughly disagree with those who state this is an irresponsible pion to Nazism... heavy-handed, sure (black shirts and soap) but, I don't see why it was particularly at fault: after all it drips cynicism and just cannot be read as a straight ahead film. I don't think it was saying men are defined only by aggression, rather that - men can easily be defined only by aggression. I particularly liked the creeping madness infecting the men of America - the idea of a surreal, out of control secret society. The lead two, Pitt and Norton, are great... unhinged, and repressed respectively.Helena Bonham-Carter is actually really good too(in a fairly slight role) as a rather dysfunctional love interest. I thought it quite a thoughtful film (if you reference Emerson, you automatically get a brownie point from me!) The incredibly eye-catching/hyper real visuals added to a sense of subverted reality. It does rather seem to be a film of two (long!) halves - the first rather more spiteful and sharp, the second violent and surreal.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disappointing,"After having my little brother and friends hype the heck out of this film and claim it to be the greatest thing since sliced bread this came as a disappointment. There were too many boring stretches for me and not much in the way of story. It was like a (no pun intended) one-punch joke that fell flat about 30 minutes into the film. Brad Pitt was good, if out of place. Ed Norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a second-rate John Cusack wanna-be. Helen Carter is funny in parts and Meatloaf is just hilarious. Thumbs in the middle for this one. This movie fell flat at the box-office as struggling 20th Century Fox (and this is NOT a bad thing) tries to come up with fresh ideas to lure the teenage audience, without having to recycle 30-year old science-fiction films.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
