Unforgettable,"This is the kind of film you don't see too often. It is truly a visual masterpiece. I haven't heard about this french director, but ""Mr Nobody"" really blew my mind in all its images, dreams, romance and complexity. The movie has similarities to films by Michel Gondry but i think this film was more magical. Dreamlike and existential films. Some might think Mr Nobody is too complex, too demanding. It is not for everyone, but I loved it. Like other surreal movies, Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"", and ""Synechdohe: New York"" ""Dr. Parnassus"", ""Micmacs""- these dreamlike and ""difficult"" films must be terribly expensive to produce and I ask myself how can the companies go through with these productions? These flicks never generate big box office money. Im amazed that they still make this kinds of demanding visual movies for cinema. And glad.I discovered the greatness of Jared Leto as an actor when he played John Lennons Killer in Chapter 23. That was a truly disturbing and amazing acting of a disturbed fanatic loner. Mr Nobody is however the role of his life! If you like this kinds of movies I recommend ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"", ""Synechdohe: New York"" and ""THE FOUNTAIN"". They really make you think!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Awesome but not for everyone,"How to review this film without giving too much away? Throughout the film, I was constantly surprised and amazed. I think my mouth was hanging slightly open a few times from the brilliance on display. I was totally captivated from start to finish. Taken simply, it's a philosophical sci-fi film, but it's so much more than that. It's about choices, destinies, astrophysics, dreams and memories, just to name a few themes. Taken at its simplest, it's the jumbled recollections of the last mortal man, 118 years old, on Earth in 2092. The problem is that his memories are in total disorder and contradictory. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way. It doesn't focus on just 2 alternate lives either, things constantly branch out. You would think the film would be a mess, but it's surprisingly cohesive, gripping and even quite touching. I'm sure some will find it confusing, but that's part of the point: Mr. Nobody's memories seem confused and appearances might be deceiving.I found it extremely romantic despite the fact there are 3 very different love interests. One might say that sometimes the dialogue in romantic parts was corny, but I think that the most beautiful declarations of love can be the simplest as long as they are sincere. They felt that way here. The acting was top-notch all over the board with no weak performance in sight. Mr. Nobody's makeup and voice as an old man were perhaps a little distracting but nothing major. It's not a special effects extravaganza, but what was seen was quite imaginative and beautiful to behold. I think the contrast with the more mundane stuff going on makes them even more impressive. Visually, it has an incredible number of different angles and viewpoints all extremely well shot. What's amazing is that the (often) brilliant transitions flow so well from one to another without being jarring.There are so many story threads (most fascinating), so many changes of tones (whimsical to tragic) and so much range (from intimate to grandiose). I think people who like to analyze films would have a field day with this one although it's possible they would nitpick on the borrowed elements. There's also lots of food for thought and should provoke very interesting discussions afterwards especially on what might have happened if choices in your life had been different. Contrary to most films where I tend to think of what I will write in my review as the film is going on, it did not really happen here. I was totally absorbed and that's rare. The choice of songs and musics, mostly known, was excellent and added a lot especially in romantic parts. I'm even considering buying the soundtrack. Mr. Nobody is a challenging but very rewarding film to watch . I don't think it's for everyone, mostly because of its non-linear structure, but those who appreciate unconventional films like Brazil, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Vanilla Sky or Big Fish should be quite pleased. I loved Mr. Nobody and it has become one of my new favorite films. To be quite honest, I wish I could see it again right now... Very highly recommended particularly with someone special.Rating : 9.5 out of 10 (not full 10 because ending could have been better)",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Why are you not watching it RIGHT NOW?,"There's one thing about this film that makes me overlook the flaws:it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Some people walked out 20 minutes before the movie ended. I can't really explain to myself why ANYONE would do that (it was really tempting to ask but I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen). It's really pointless to describe the plot because this movie is so much more then any summary could say. This film has so many stylistic, tonal and narrative changes that it seems absolutely mad for the first half hour. It's easily the most unique and worthy cinema experience in the last year, its feels very current. I could go on and on about the things I loved about this film but there's nothing right now that I would recommend seeing more to a person of any age, sex or taste in cinema. It's everything I could ask for in a film:funny, touching, thrilling, surreal, beautiful...",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Genius,"Just caught the north American premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. This is my first IMDb comment, doing it cause i saw no one else has written anything yet.Jaco is an absolutely brilliant writer/director. I haven't seen too many art-house films, but I was pleasantly surprised by the tone which wasn't too serious, or pretentious. There were laugh out loud moments during a movie with themes concerning choice, destiny, and metaphysics.I was enamoured by the love story, it was feel good without being Hollywood.The visuals were amazing. I believe that Jaco explained that he used different DP's to film the different possible lives of Mr. Nobody. There were scenes set in the year 2092 that were absolutely stunning on the big screen.I found the soundtrack to be awesome. Any movie with ""Mr. Sandman"" and ""Where is my mind?"" is alright by me.The movie was extremely imaginative, original, funny, and will probably have me thinking about it and my own life for days after viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Astonishing and profoundly moving!!,"This is the first time I have felt the need to post a review of a film, but the experience that this movie provided was so unique and profoundly moving that I feel compelled to post something of my thoughts.I have just finished watching Mr Nobody after knowing nothing about the movie beforehand (perhaps a good thing as I may have avoided it otherwise), but was simply astonished by the originality, cinematography, acting, script, soundtrack and profoundly thought provoking ideas.I realise that this film will not be to everyones taste, certainly I think it will not be fully comprehended by the younger generation as it does require a certain lifetime of experiences to relate, such as birth, love, marriage, children, separation, divorce, death, life changing choices etc.., but nevertheless it does make you deeply consider your own past decisions and future choices, and everyone of all ages will have made and will make these decisions.The production values are very high and would not look out of place in a 'hollywood blockbuster' but it is the mix of cinematography and music mingled with the dramatic scenarios that make it truly memorable.It is a difficult film to describe as it does not follow a traditional narrative structure, but that is what makes it so unique and truly memorable. An experience that will hopefully stay with you long after you have seen it. It certainly made for a hugely memorable experience for me. Others may differ in opinion, but I don't think anyone can argue that it is not intelligent, fresh, original and thought provoking.Well done to all involved in providing something original, intelligent and very entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle applied to a life,"This film is not for everyone. It has a sprawling, non-linear, non-conventional approach to storytelling. It follows the life (lives) of a man called Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) whose life could have followed multiple different paths depending upon the smallest of chance occurrences.Whereas films such as Sliding Doors follow a simple two-path narrative, this film has multiple branches. The achievement is that all of them are interesting (in different ways) and it never feels confused.The central theme is love, and how random chances affect who we love, and how that love changes. There is joy, loss, betrayal, grief and a whole swath of other emotions on display here. My only complaint is that there is no really satisfying conclusion to the film, but I am not even sure that such a thing is possible.If you are willing to try something different, something unconventional, that doesn't necessarily make sense, then give this a try. If nothing else, it will give you something to think about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An experience of a lifetime,"Jaco Van Dormael's third & long awaited movie is a sensation. It is a real shame that this masterpiece didn't won lots of awards at different film festivals. How could they be so blind ? Mr. Nobody is a unique cocktail of drama, love story & science fiction. It's an odyssey about making choices and the effect it has upon our lives. The songs ( Buddy Holly ! Pixies ! Satie ! ) are well chosen and the acting ( Jared Leto ! Rhys Ifans ! ) is outstanding. Some might say that this is a difficult movie and a bit ""arty farty""... I agree that you won't understand everything, that's for sure, but what the heck, just sit back and enjoy the ride ! This breathtaking tale of imagination leaves you astonished in your seat. Not to be missed !",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Time-Traveling Through Confusion,"The film ""Mr. Nobody"" is like a puzzle box that's both intriguing and frustrating. It's a smorgasbord of visual feasts, sci-fi concepts, and existential musings that at times feels like a philosophy student's fever dream. The film's unique narrative structure, jumping between timelines and possibilities, makes for an engaging watch. However, it's also its Achilles' heel. The ambitious attempt to explore the nature of choice, time, and love often becomes muddled in its own complexity, leaving the viewer both dazzled and dazed. It's a cinematic rollercoaster that loops and swirls with such intensity that you're not sure whether to applaud or reach for the motion sickness bag.Jared Leto, as Nemo Nobody, delivers a performance that is as enigmatic as the film itself. He portrays multiple versions of Nemo with a certain depth that is commendable, yet the character often feels like a mere conduit for the film's philosophical musings rather than a flesh-and-blood individual. The supporting cast adds color to the narrative, but they too seem lost in the director's ambitious vision, like stars in an ever-expanding universe. The film's visual aesthetics and special effects are a high point, crafting a surreal, dream-like quality that is both beautiful and haunting.In the end, ""Mr. Nobody"" is a film that tries to grasp the ungraspable - the infinite complexities of life, choice, and time. It's like a beautifully crafted watch that's fascinating to look at, but hard to read. It's a film that you respect for its ambition and creativity, but don't necessarily love. For those who enjoy a cinematic challenge, it's a must-watch. But for those seeking a coherent narrative, it might feel like a jigsaw puzzle with a few too many missing pieces. A solid three stars for daring to dream big, even if it doesn't quite land perfectly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Great promises gone wrong,"Since this movie got so many positive reviews, I decided to write about it to give potential viewers both sides of the story.Mr. Nobody is one of those movies with main plot transcending reality. If you've seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Butterfly Effect, you'll find yourself on similar territory with this one. Without spoiling too much, main character (Jared Leto) tries to regain his lost memory through hypnosis, which uncovers a lot. The only problem is: he re-experiences more than one linear life.Sounds promising? Unfortunately, people responsible for this movie fail to squeeze any serious quality out of this potential. Jared Leto plays very well all the time, and the movie is shot with interesting style. First problem lies in the script. It just doesn't make much sense. For example: we are introduced to Superstring Theory, which doesn't have any relation to the movie, which is explained like a methhead would explain it after being sober for 36 hours. Throughout the entire movie, we are shown various little science facts and theories, all making no sense in the contexts, and making impression like a late night 2 hours google search put into movie to add to the overall ""credibility"".There's a great love story in the movie, which resembles Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and really improves the experience, but unfortunately it's just one of many plots. Half of the movie it grows on the viewer, and promises a very unique experience. The other half it fails, fails and fails to deliver again, until a very unsatisfactory finish.If it would have been more organized in structure, instead of random lazy scene by scene mash up ultimately leading nowhere, it could have been so much more. Still, many people find it entertaining, so it might be worth checking for yourself ;)",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Mind-blowing,"This beautiful surreal movie is full of memorable lines that will make you reconsider your outlook on life, but this one is my favorite:""At my age, the candles cost more than the cake.

"Brilliant - highly original, intelligent, thought-provoking, engaging and entertaining","It is the year 2092. Nemo Nobody is 118 years old and is the last remaining mortal human on earth, as, due to medical advances, all other humans are immortal. He is being interviewed in order to document his life, but the stories he tells seem to run parallel to each other. How could he be in several places at the same time, living, as it were, multiple lives?Brilliant drama. Highly original concept, mixing physics and the choices one makes and how these affect (or don't...) your future. Incredibly intelligent, interesting and plausible, in an existential, philosophical and mathematical sort of way. Makes you ponder life and the paths ours can take.Not just an academic rumination but a great human drama too. Some wonderful relationship-based sub-plots. Quite emotional at times and always very engaging.Clever plot with a great revelation at the end. Very entertaining.Jared Leto is superb in the lead role, effectively playing several versions and different ages of Mr. Nobody, including the 118-year old one. Good supporting cast.One of the most original and intelligent movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Beautiful film.  A gem!,"I saw Mr Nobody last night in a jam-packed theatre. I guess that the main reason for this is that I am in Belgium and the writer/director is Belgian. The response of the audience was amazing. I was in Flanders and so the film wasn't dubbed.The film is magical and surreal. And yet it makes sense. Not many have achieved this, but Jaco Van Dormael seems to have done it with ease. It did take him 13 years however. If you liked Toto Le Héro, you should love this film too. Switching between the UK and Canada works brilliantly and Jared Leto, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple steal the show. Ifans and Little are also fantastic. Diane Kruger's strong German accent is unfortunate as the film needs no unintentional surrealism added to it. I think her role needed a stronger actress (she looks very beautiful though).In all I recommend everyone to go and see it. The only reason the film gets an 8 (and not a higher score) is because towards the end it seemed to go on a bit. I will go and see it again however. The story really draws you in and I need to go back to search for some answers. I also want to see it again because it is so beautifully filmed. Van Dormael is an artist.I enjoyed this film as much, if not more, than a David Lynch. And that truly is a compliment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A meta-physical, philosophical love letter to the universe itself,  thwarted from being a masterpiece by it's own unbridled ambition","What would happen if ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND and 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY had a love child? Not MR. NOBODY, but it could be the nephew of said love child. Because although it sports ambition, some of the time it feels like one influence is killing off the emotional or intellectual resonance of the other.To further elaborate, I liked large chunks of MR. NOBODY but can't embrace the whole as a success. Even a cirque du soleil juggler drops one every now and then when he's got too many balls up in the air.On a side-note (before I forget), I found the music to be bloody aggravating. I find that's a common complaint with Belgian or French films. Something a little more haunting along the lines of the violin tugs of the REQUIEM FOR A DREAM score or the subtleties of the BENJAMIN BUTTON score might've done more to reinforce the poignant scenes.The Belgian director is drawing heavily from films like BENJAMIN BUTTON, DARK CITY, AMELIE POULAIN, ETERNAL SUNSHINE, 2001 and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. To make a film with such diverse influences that still makes the tiniest bit of sense is a feat. If there were an Oscar for best casting, this would deserve it with flying colors. I don't think I've ever seen such striking resemblance between actors portraying the characters from several different ages. Jared Leto is back in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM form, and I like the fellow's daring. Heavily heckled after 2007's risky indie CHAPTER 27, he dives into the deep end again and this time it works out brilliantly. His dreamy, cloudy, confused stare into the camera lens defines the protagonist perfectly. The supporting cast is in ship-shape form as well, Diane Kruger with the brittle ghost of the naive lovesick puppy teenager still in her, Sarah Polley's self-destructive depressive is thoroughly sad and convincing and the actress whose name I can't find on IMDb (the one who played his mother) displays the right degree of life-weariness that comes with being a single mother.Unlike Nemo Nobody, I claim no ability to see the future but I am adept at educated guesses. Quite easily MR. NOBODY could become a cult classic and hailed more with every passing year by film aficionado's. Quite easily could word-to-mouth be the salvation of a film so poorly marketed. Let's hope so. It'd be a shame to see this fine film disappear from mainstream audience's reaches.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Mix of Great Things,"As I'm writing this, my brain is still analyzing and thinking of ""Mr Nobody"" which I just saw at the Stockholm film festival. Everything from the beginning to the end, moved me. This could be one of the greatest masterpieces this year and I'm hoping to see this score multiple awards of different kinds.Jaco Van Dormal was not a that was stored in my memory, and I had a hard time remember just who he is. After this movie I'll never forget. ""Mr Nobody"" was a movie with many questions and theories. Confusing but still dazzling. The shooting was really great, I love the type of filming when you cross from scene to scene with a continuent flow of events. When ""Nemo"", the lead character switched from dimensions it was often expressed by him waking up from a dream. This was very interesting but I don't really know what to make out of it. Life is nothing but an illusion, perhaps?",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of my favorite movies of all time,"Arguably one of the most ambitious storylines in all of cinema. Jaco Van Dormael is a director known to take fantastical weird storylines, and turn them into thought provoking film. Mr. Nobody is no different. I'm not stating that this film is perfection. With a storyline this ambitious, it's flaws are inevitable. But even with its flaws, it still shines as an intriguing si-fi flick. It's a fun film to analyze and break down because there is various ways to interpret it. It leaves you with a message of longing. It reminds us that our childhoods are our most formative years. And even the smallest of descions could have the biggest of outcomes. For those who have yet to see this life changing film, please do. You'll probably want to read a forum thread or article explaining the ending and themes. Even after seeing it multiple times, there are still new interpretations to take away from it. What I took away from it was the obvious. Every descion you make counts and effects your life to some degree. Sometimes the only viable move, is to not move at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
We cannot go back. That's why it's so hard to choose,".Mr. Nobody is definitely one of my favorite movies. I had the opportunity to see it again 10 years after his release (in a wonderful director's cut version) and I am convinced that he is aging very well. Initially it was not taken into consideration in my country (Italy); then in 2016 the Italian distributors perceived the enormous success they had decided to take it to Italy. My advice is to watch it in the original language (you can find it on Netflix); dubbing,in my humble opinion, is done in a hurry and doesn't fully make the beauty that the film carries with it. Why did I like this movie so much? First of all, Jared Leto's performance is incredible, he really manages to extricate himself in a myriad of different roles with great skill. The soundtrack and the non-original songs that accompanied the film are perfect (including Where is my Mind by Pixies, great!). The film is complex, opens up a tons of readings and generates many questions, to watch and to review and to comment on. And finally, from a technical point of view, thanks to a very creative montage that creates a nice rhythm and a sensational photography is a pleasure for the eyes. In short, for me it is highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An exercise in pointlessness,"Take several helpings of philosophical and physics theories and blend these together with some artsy cinematography and sci-fi backdrops to make it appear philosophical and ""highly intellectual"" as some reviews have described it. But if any of these were the goal of the makers of this movie, they failed miserably.The director and the writer use confusion, chaos and distraction to make this movie appear highly cerebral. However it is a set of dissonant scenes forcefully held together without an underlying unifying idea pretending to be philosophical but offering no ideas, answers or even questions. It is as if someone had the philosophy alphabet cereal for breakfast in the morning and then vomited on a movie script at Noon. The ideas are all over the place, half digested and full of bile. Some people may confuse this for intellectualism but it is nothing more than half-baked flashes of thought. It is the cacophony of ideas that makes the movie appear philosophical, but only in a way similar to how a carnival magician shows a coin and then makes it disappear, leaving you thinking about how he pulled it off and not about the coin itself.The unnecessarily stretched plot runs into over two hours without really needing to. One could easily cut out many of the scenes without losing much of the meaning of this movie, because there is not much meaning to lose. In fact, one could completely skip the movie and not miss much.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Shaken & Stirred .... the Explosive Cocktail of Life!,"Jaco's recipe for the perfect cinematic cocktail:1. (3 cl) of strong performances (make sure to bring characters to life);2. (4 cl) of great filming (perfectly capture the performances and scenery);3. (a couple slices) of timely classic soundtrack (to further enhance the visual experience);4. (3 teaspoons) of philosophical teasing (favourite flavours: Immortality, Death, Love, Choices, Consequences, Time  does it even matter?);5. (a few cubes) of story telling (best told by peculiar narrators);and as a tasty finishing touch,6. a (zest) of humour (preferably irony).van Dormael produces this wonderful cocktail with such dexterity that one is left both satisfied and wanting more!As with any good cocktail, this one should appeal to many and allow for repeated consumption (viewing) due to the wide range of qualities that can be appreciated, be they cinematical or simply philosophical.I might be missing one or two ingredients, but before I give away any more and spoil your drink, if you haven't seen Mr. Nobody yet, go see it with Anybody and make sure to talk about it with Everybody, or at least with Somebody.Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Gilliam universe,"Of course I understand if someone says/thinks this is pretentious. But if you're a fan of weird Science Fiction and/or Terry Gilliam, you should feel right at home. This really out there movie, gives you a lot to think about (if you're up for it). It's also kind of a twisted version of Lola Runs.It just takes that ""what would happen if"" concept to another level (or is it dimension?). Every decision you make has consequences. The bigger the decision the bigger the consequences obviously. Which doesn't mean that small things don't matter.

Cinematography is an art and this movie fully tells you why,"Every minute the plot changes to something new and unexpected; it feels as though you're watching several drama lines at the same time. During the first minutes of watching it seems even confusing but then you realize the plot isn't a plot - it's life in different variations which depend on one's choice; you shouldn't look for some particular logic, just observe and accept.Some, who search for action, may get bored watching this. For me it's a kind of movie which is curious for its details, physics, chemistry, references to culture and science in some aspects. Goosebumps or a simple drop of sweat, the wind stirring grass or just a look at usual things from unusual angles, or those moments when setting is being changed (a car placed with a huge hand or house crashed with the boot) - fantastic. Have you ever caught yourself thinking that you can smell the movie? I think I had such feeling for the first time.""Mr. Nobody"" is a moving 2-hours long picture.

It's a thinker...,"There are so many user reviews of this movie part of me doesn't even know where to begin. Firstly, I'd just like to say, I'm not going to sit and take this movie apart piece-by-piece, I have better things to do than that. I'm merely going to give it my own judgment and let you make your own.So this wasn't the greatest movie ever made, far from it, and the ending (don't worry, I'm giving nothing away) was for me, a little disappointing. However, what it IS, is original. You certainly haven't seen a movie like this before. Many other reviews claim this is copying other certain titles, this isn't the case. The way this movie is shot and the storyline unfolds is quite unique, if not somewhat difficult to keep up with at times.A lot of other reviewers claim this movie is 10/10 purely because it is difficult to understand. If being difficult to understand makes a movie a great movie, then I've gone seriously wrong somewhere in the years I've been enjoying films. This movie isn't ""great"". BUT, it is thoroughly entertaining and had me glued to the screen for about two and a half hours, which isn't something many movies can do (partly because few movies now are over an hour and a half, but that's beside the point).If you like something that actually makes you think (and may also leave you wanting to know more) then give this movie a watch. It makes for a very interesting two and a half hours and at the very least has a little bit of nipple.Who cares what other people think of a movie?

confused kitchen sink muddle,"Jaco Van Dormael has never met a cliché setup he wouldn't try to shoe horn into this movie. lots of setups we've seen before this time done exactly the same but choreographed to perfection, lit and shot beautifully like a car commercial, but still a cliché, and I kind of expect more from my cinema. Guy trapped in a sinking car, boy chasing a train with mother holding out hand, cryo life support pods, proms and dying wishes, every movie cliché there is all crow-bared into this film. All that money you can see on the screen, but it came across as something less than meaningful.I'm not sure who was responsible for the music choices in this movie but they were hardly enlightened either. Tracks we've heard in a hundred other movies here to make you wince at the obviousness of their presence.Jared Leto was also particularly bad. He wasn't once convincing. wearing a set of dark rimmed glasses doesn't make you older, he just looked like a youth with glasses and not a father of 3 with a career and wife. He's also under the miles of make up for the old guy but the thrill of that was truly killed by Brad Pitts similar exploits in Benjamin Button.There were good performances in this. The three wives were great as were the teen actors.I just feel disappointed after watching this. So much talent and money went into it yet it rang hollow. It did have some great ideas but they were watered down with the clichés, It had some wonderful technically brilliant camera and staging work but without the cohesive story and the average acting and cliché elements it was all weakened.This looks like a movie where director Jaco van Dormael pulled in every favor he had owning to him, his big break movie with a ton of cash thrown at it, and he dropped the ball.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Great concept, needed focus","Some fascinating concepts, but it felt to me like this one just got a little too ambitious for its own good. I loved the theme of all the possible lives we could have led, given our own choices and an infinite number of other things that might affect us, and also the concepts the film broaches about the nature of time, the universe, entropy, etc. The Tennessee Williams quote paraphrased in the film, that ""Anything might have been anything else and had as much meaning to it"" has that sense that the lives we are leading are both meaningful and meaningless at the same time, which is fantastic and intriguing.However, I think the film would have been better off tightened up, starting with just how much detail is put into the possible branches of Nemo Nobody's life and all of their melodrama, some of which was pretty eye-rolling over the 141 minute run time. To that it in then swirls in so many other wild things - the about-to-be-born babies choosing their parents and our hero being mistakenly skipped over by the Angels of Oblivion, so he's able to remember everything about his life; the guy living to 118 and being the last living mortal on the planet; being able to see the future at times and to be rewind the past or communicate with it; the fictionalized travel to Mars; the occasional interruptions to get some interesting commentary on physics and big unanswered questions about the universe. With the surreal nonlinear storytelling style, it's just a lot, and I'm not sure the payoff meant to bring it all together really does that.

Something to Think About,"This is one of those movies that you want to see at least a second time, because even though the first viewing is perfectly satisfying, you just know you'll pick up more the second, and third, time around. I lost track of how many parallel lives the main character was remembering, and as far as I could tell, it was never really explained how he could be aware of so many parallel universes, but those are minor points in a film that seeks to bring up ideas to be pondered. And it does just that. I think this would be a great first date movie, because the potential for it sparking a meaningful conversation/debate is tremendous. The main point, of course, is that every decision we make affects the path that the rest of our life takes, and there are many of these turning points in a lifetime. There are also ideas about the nature of reality, which I found intriguing. I don't think it will be long before I give this a second view. The only criticism I have is that, even though there were some fairly dramatic moments, and the acting was good, I didn't feel particularly connected to the characters. There was much more of a sense of detachment than I would have liked to have seen in a movie like this. But all in all... great film.

It was surprisingly good,"This one is definitely one of the top league movies. The protagonist is 118 year old and is the last mortal on earth. The movie shows the different version's of a man's life depending upon the decisions he make at different points of his life time. All these versions are mixed up in his 118 year old mind, and he is trying to recollect it. He often jumps from one version to another and also between different time-lines. One's life is a result of the decisions one take in his/her life. It will make you think about your own life.It surely deserves a rating of 10. Don't know why this movie isn't reviewed or rated much.

The importance of being too earnest,"This is a delightfully creative and original film which is much more immediately satisfying (that is, scene by scene) than it is satisfying as a whole. The end is likely to leave you feeling flat and unrewarded for the time you have invested in the film. Not to say that it is unpleasant at all, but the sheer seriousness of the piece demands it to be thought about, and if thinking about films is not your cup of tea, then do not watch this!Many films have a nice little innovative moment which is typically the bit you look forward to even though you may have watched it a hundred times. This film is composed almost entirely of those interesting innovative moments which perhaps do not work entirely as a whole, but they are still novel to watch.Mr Nobody suffers from a serious lack of humour. It's wistful and playful approach to the whole film-making process almost makes up for this, but I think not entirely. It's pure earnestness is admirable, brave and typical of much lower budget art-house movies, but it is a little wearing to watch the whole two and a half hours without any genuine light relief.There are breathtaking moments or artistry, lovely philosophical points and a joyful almost juvenile approach to the story which is fun and profound at the same time. But you do find yourself expecting a big pay-out at the end... a big 'reveal' or twist... but I would say it doesn't come. Others will surely think it does. That alone makes it worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Makes you think,"This is a French film in that nothing happens for 2.5 hours but it makes you think. It's filmed in English but the fact that it had a French director probably accounts for the style.The film is ultimately about happenstance, the choices we make and what they could lead too. There are elements in there about string theory, the beginning and end of the universe and therefore quantum mechanics. However rather than occurring at the particular level the events and interactions making up the film and possibilities take place between human beings. Rather than the few outcomes that could possibly occur from the entanglement of electrons or protons at the subatomic level this film deals with the truly infinite outcomes of what might be.There is some mention of life before birth and life after death but this is only touched upon and not explained in any fashion. There are also some scenes which appear to involve time travel, or something similar. I thought these elements didn't add much too the film yet didn't detract from them either. Their presence was mildly confusing or perhaps irritating but probably added just a little bit more of the unknown into the whirling mass of possibilities in life that 'Mr Nobody' attempts to present.I liked this film and will probably watch it again sometime. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Awesome movie,"Imaginative and thought-provoking sci-fi drama that explores the concept of parallel lives and the choices that shape our destinies.First and foremost, Jared Leto's performance as Nemo Nobody is a tour de force. He portrays the character with a captivating blend of vulnerability, curiosity, and existential contemplation. Leto's portrayal brings an emotional depth to the film's exploration of identity and the paths not taken.The film's non-linear narrative is a labyrinth of possibilities, delving into multiple timelines and potential outcomes of Nemo's life. Director Jaco Van Dormael's storytelling is masterful, seamlessly weaving together the different threads of Nemo's existence.The visuals in Mr. Nobody are breathtaking and visually arresting. The film's cinematography and special effects create a surreal and mesmerizing experience, reflecting the complex and interconnected nature of Nemo's life.The supporting cast, including Diane Kruger, Sarah Polley, and Linh Dan Pham, deliver strong performances that add to the film's emotional depth and complexity.The philosophical themes of choice, time, and the nature of reality are central to the film's narrative, challenging viewers to ponder the infinite possibilities that life presents.Mr. Nobody is a mind-bending and emotionally resonant journey that pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling. It invites contemplation and reflection on the paths we take and the impact of our decisions.In conclusion, Mr. Nobody is a cinematic gem that defies genre conventions and invites audiences to embark on an existential exploration. With Jared Leto's captivating performance, Jaco Van Dormael's visionary direction, and the film's philosophical depth, it's a thought-provoking and unique cinematic experience.If you're a fan of sci-fi films that challenge the mind and tug at the heart, Mr. Nobody is a must-watch.

"""Mr. Nobody"" is about nothing but encompasses everything","At the beginning of ""Mr. Nobody"" we meet Nemo Nobody in the future as an 118-year-old man and twice in the present as his 34-year-old self, but he doesn't know, and we don't know, which life is his. The rest of the film isn't so much about figuring out which life is actually real, but that all lives of right if you choose right.It's about life, death, birth, and everything before, after and in-between. For as weird as it sounds, it is just as weird, but it's also a beautifully realized film with elegant shots, outstanding performances, and thought-provoking dialogue. ""Mr. Nobody"" embodies questions of fate, lectures on physics, and space travel to Mars—there's a good reason the film is two and a half hours long. And what film wouldn't be complete without multiple loves and three wives?""Mr. Nobody"" is a remarkable film because it pretty much accomplishes all of the aforementioned concepts. It's also a really long exercise in existential philosophy with a complete time-line of one man's life in multiple dimensions.

A single snowflake can bend the leaf of the bamboo.,"According to string theory, the universe contains nine spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension. Three of the spatial dimensions: length, width, and depth, and the temporal dimension: time, were deployed within our universe while the rest remained wound up together. ""What if one of the other six was temporal?""Jaco Van Dormael's Mr. Nobody is a science-fiction drama that explores the concept of parallel universes existing for different possibilities for each branching point in our lives. The butterfly effect, so to speak, creates a divergence in universes. Will they ever converge once again? Just ask the second law of thermodynamics: As long as the universe continues to expand, entropy is always increasing (i.e. things can only spontaneously become more random or disordered). However, this never becomes a problem because no one is aware that alternate realities exist.Yet, one man is. Nemo Nobody.The entire film plays out almost like a dream. Recurrent images and sounds. Non-linearly spliced scenes. It displays the different ways one man could have lived his life based on the mere probability of a leaf falling one way or the other. The story can be both philosophically challenging and spoon-fed at times. Although it may come off as too pretentious, edgy, or complex, such cerebral stories should be executed in innovative ways and all ideas presented both complement the storyline and serve to enhance our understanding of the underlying philosophy. The film is also rich with subtleties. For example, I found the main character's name to be particularly odd and noticed it spells ""omen"" backwards. But it doesn't stop there. The film is just as emotional and poignant as it is thought-provoking. The viewer is tossed around the emotional spectrum as Nemo's back and forth transitions from being emotionally invested to a soulless bystander begin to make sense. Visually, it's incredibly imaginative and colorful. Perhaps even more enthralling is the music. The late Pierre Van Dormael (the director's brother) composed a sensational score from beginning to end. Not a scene goes by without at least some piano in the background.Mr. Nobody is a treat for the heart, the mind, and the senses. Van Dormael has constructed one hell of a complete package.

"A movie about choices in life, unfortunately it can't choose its own choices","It'd have been a great movies, if it didn't try to be so many things: a sci-fi, a drama, a romance or a surreal movie, it wanted to be all at once but never matured in any catalog. So after 2h35' this movies feel dragged out and unfinished at same time. First it strikes me as a surreal movie, then it backed itself up with many science facts trying to be a sci-fi. At the end it dropped a Dues-Ex machine bomb on me, not that i didn't expected but it's quite disappointed cause i've worked my brain hard throughout the movie and then BOOOMMM! During the movie there're many dramas, romances, even melodramas but with little character development cause too many characters, i mean versions of them.

The Butterfly Effect meets the Tree of Life.,"Very insightful movie with references to quantum physics theories of multiple universes, the universe's dimension of time with beautiful more or less disconnected scenes here and there. Sure Jared Leto may not be the best on his best performance or not be the best actor in Hollywood, but the movie is more about the human religious and philosophical implications of recent scientific discoveries and theories than about the actors.

"A movie without rhythm, one monotonous tone and a lot of copy paste","I thought this was going to be a good movie but it was not.The idea is great (120 year old last mortal looks back at his life and his choices), the scenes are beautiful in isolation, but the makers oversaw something vital.Effects like slow motion, flashbacks and scene hopping can be nice, when used sparingly, as needed. NOT when you do it throughout the whole film. A film, like anything else, needs rhythm: buildup, release, etc; this one was more like one monotonous tone (full of beautiful scenes that have no relation to one another). I suppose the director was totally focused on the scenes on itself, thinking WOW this looks great, but he forgot that a movie is not just about pasting nice scenes after one another.In Mr Nobody we jump from scene A to C to B to Z and every scene is full of effects and even more jumps in time. Add to that the somewhat strange settings and it leaves the viewer estranged, wondering about the storyline and totally unempathetic for whatever happens to the characters.Probably very postmodern but there is too much of everything.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Mind Numbingly Awful,"Recently I had the opportunity of viewing the extended version of Mr. Nobody, and reading some of the reviews of this well hidden science fiction epic, it really seemed like my cup of tea. After watching it in all of its two hour and thirty minute glory, I now feel an inane displeasure, akin to what I can only assume as having my frontal lobe stabbed with an ice pick.Before I review the things I disliked about this movie, let me tell you about the things it got right. First of all, the set design and cinematography were excellent. Visually, the movie was colorful, vivid and imaginative. Also, it has a wide variety of period music which I thought fitting in the scenes they including it in. The scene with the space elevator, ship and mars colonies were also visually a nice touch.That's about all the pleasure I took away from this movie. For the acting, writing and directing; I found it extremely tedious. The pacing of the movie was terrible. The alternate realities that Nemo experienced, while varied, did not justify the huge expenditure of time devoted them, nor did I feel like they moved the movie along in any significant way. The storytelling was so fragmented that I was unable to feel any connection between Nemo and his many loves and even less for his children which were so insignificant they just felt like filler and could have been left out of the movie completely. And for the ending, what I guess some people would consider a twist, I saw as just plain stupid if you think deeply into what it suggested. In summary, I found it boring and pretentious, and just not worth it. The movie aimed high trying to captivate the viewer in parallel realities, immortality, quantum mechanics and good old fashioned space exploration, but failed at the basics of storytelling and proper editing.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

easy listening for the eyes,"For large chunks of time the film feels much like a another take on the central idea of ""the butterfly effect"" (which would be alternating reality) while briefly toying with both fairytale like elements and sci-fi redemption fantasies. Which is kinda annoying in retrospective because the film would not lose much of its appeal had that stuff been left out. It would have however kept the playing time at bay. But hey, you get rewarded for your patience for in the movie's final scenes there are some nice shots of decompiling Virtual Reality. Eye candy for sure but I like to think of them as a bow to the ""tuning"" scenes of the quite awesome ""Dark City"".So in all due shortness what do you get for your money? Well, basically it's what the majority of explosion-free movies has to offer - but all in one. Of course the whole thing resolves around issues like relationships, destiny, contentment and what not. But since the structure of narration turns the film into a sequence of episodic scenes you won't find lingering shots of endless monologue. Instead prepare yourself for tiny appetizers for a marital drama, a teenage love story, a tale of an unfolding midlife crisis, etc. Somebody sure tried to eliminate every potential for boredom and it's hard to blame him/her for it, because it pretty much worked. Solid acting and reasonably tame humor are included.Should you watch it? Probably yes - even if you had trouble following ""Open your eyes/Vanilla Skies"" for the final conclusion does not offer a change of perspective of any sort. This is ambiguous for it means if you hope to be given an explanation or a surprising twist you end up feeling betrayed.

A Theoretical Education,"Although admittedly confusing at times, Mr. Nobody is an interesting take on the complexities of time and dimensional space. It gives our rather limited senses a chance to witness a concept that we will never truly understand. But somehow, at the same time, viewers can truly feel the emotional strife in each character according to their timelines. A beautiful rendition on a complex idea, that I really wish directors would explore into more depth.My only advice to any future viewers is to give the film time. It takes a while for the film to really identify itself and can be difficult to deal with at first. It's a heavy read, so don't expect to pick up all the details without full attention.A common blend of cinematographic art, relatable human interaction and theory of quantum physics that leaves you with more questions then you had at the start.

Life seen from another angle - the greatness we don't understand,"What have we done to deserve this? That's what this is about! It rises questions, without giving all the answers. This is not for the ones seeking action, Star Wars or those wanting light entertainment together with a six pack of beers. This is for the ones wanting something for the mind to chew on, and who is able to accept a story not following the Hollywood model storyline, maybe with a glass of fine wine. So then you're warned. I love all kinds of movies, but only at the right time. You gotta chose film after what you feel like watching.Mr. Nobody is fabulous filmmaking about choices and coincidences in life. The opportunity taken, the opportunity lost. To be able to be there when it counts, to be in time, and to reach the train before it leaves the platform. About seizing the moment. About what we decide we are, and do. About the choices we make, or don't make, all life through. About the choices we should have made, or the choices we don't get to make, or that others do for us. How small choices affect our life's, and natures way, like in the butterfly effect.It's also about what we remember, or are able to remember or forget. About time, about predictions and sentimentality, the longing for things like they were. Like we remembered them. About love and relationships, how we meet, and how we interact. It's also about different stages in life, aging and age-differences, and about feeling different and sometimes scared. About saying things are different than they really are. Why is it so difficult to know each other? Why do we fall in love? Why do we survive some accidents, and others not. About reality, and losing it, and maybe even regaining it... Too how big extent do we decide what we chose to remember. What did really happen? We're going in and out of life as a dream and a difficult situation.Nemo is different from the rest of us. He wasn't touched by the angel's finger on his lips before coming to Earth, and remembers what should be forgotten. He understands and remembers more than the rest of us, and is also going to be older. We meet him thinking back, being 118 years old. But on the other hand he is also more confused, and understands less than us. About the reality and the fantasy we're dependent on in life. About what we see, and what we don't. He can also see into the future. He is both a nerd, and a common youngster, growing up. He is incredible.This film ask questions. What do you see when you are looking at me? Are we what we look like? Why aren't we what we feel we are. Why do we have troubles accepting aging? Well, all this runs through my mind when watching this fabulous movie. It's all right up there where I want a philosophical film to be. A film about the greatness in life, which we don't understand.What Nemo does in this film, is showing us how life is never just the way you plan it, and that the troubles ahead in life, can have a reason, though maybe one you don't understand. I'll bear this film in mind when I see a tramp or a woman citing insane. It's most certainly not of their own choice, but it ended up this way, anyway...Belgian Jaco van Dormael has been working for 13 years on this film, and this is truly amazing on all levels. The soundtrack is out of your dreams. All the actors do a great job, and I've never seen Jared Leto better. A perfect cast for this film. His eyes are almost a necessity to this film. Nemo is a allegory for Jules Verne's captain Nemo, trying to find the mysteries of life under water. Nemo is afraid of water, but still under it a lot of time. Ne mo is originally taken from Latin - nobody. You could also perhaps see this backwards as an Omen?What have the filmmakers done to deserve that not so many more went to see this in the cinemas? Well, make it right. Set off time, without any interruptions. Turn your phone off, turn your life off for a couple of hours, and drift into the world of Mr. Nobody.The film is better for those who have lived for some years, as it is brutally honest. Still there's much life wisdom for youngsters to get here. But you better not be too young! It's a true gem! Absolutely amazing filmmaking! Thanks for making this!

Been wondering what the hype was about...,"As far as theatrical films are concerned, the director and writers took the time to ensure they created a masterpiece with this film. From an artistic point of view, it is very well designed, edited and enjoyable to watch. However, from a storyline point of view, the movie is very boring. It is easy to not understand if you don't watch the film intently but it is basically a flashback told of a dying man's memory of his life. There isn't a deeper meaning or philosophy behind the movie whatsoever and the ending will leave you disgusted as there is no closure. The main character is detached from the audience not allowing for us to ever relate to him as a person though the director and writers were doing their damnedest for us to be able to. No scenes stand out or will be remembered whatsoever and in writing this review, though it is a masterpiece, the story is lacking as is the acting from all of the actors so I must deduct a star.

The ending had me sad that it was over and it felt complete but also let the viewer question more about the story. I would love for the writer/director to do more films like this. I created this account just to make this review because I feel like more people need to watch this movie! I will be recommending it to everyone I know haha. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Way overrated on IMDb,"I see so many glowing reviews of this film cheerleading it on in some kind of effort to get a wider release I guess. It's a distortion of reality imho. It's a rather mediocre film that reeks of film subsidy abuse. Its got that bland look and feel of a film made in other countries as location substitution. To make it match, they suck the life out of everything.The sci-fi element just looks uninspired and cheap, even the cg is second-rate. For a TV film it would be pretty decent effects wise, but not for a Hollywood production.and of course the story, its a bunch of ""if only"" and ""if I had"" navel gazing nonsense. If your thing is watching leto go emo, then sure it might be for you, otherwise its just dull scene after dull scene, the narrative is an incoherent mess that makes you feel nothing at all. Another reviewer brought up the problem of clichés, and that's true, shots/ideas are ripped off from better films. It just all never comes together, and is never convincing as it jumps haphazardly from one version narrative to another, and so you don't care.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Wow, so deep","What a cool concept. Everyone can relate to looking back on their life and wondering about the one who got away or if they made a different choice in life and how things might be different. In this movie, the perspective isn't from someone looking back, but from someone looking forward to someone looking back who hasn't determined what the life they've lived has been like. Many of the scenes are dreamlike in quality and there is a lot of unique imagery. All of these things usually make for a great postmodern movie I'll enjoy, but actually I didn't find it resonated with me too strongly. Still a good movie for people that like to think, but it wasn't mind blowing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"""You have to make the right choice. As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.""","Mr Nobody is just so utterly unique and profoundly moving, that you feel you must do some soul-searching afterwards. The film is quite literally the best example of poetry put on film. It is so much more than a philosophical sci-fi film, it explores themes such as destiny, perception, dreams, and memories. It is like an onion, for every layer you peel back (in this case - repeat viewings), you receive more wisdom.Mr Nobody resembles something near a transcending reality vis-à-vis Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or The Butterfly Effect, but more existential akin to Gattaca. It's possesses a deep introspective and imaginative quality to see through people, situations, and words to find their hidden meanings, motives, and outcomes. Destiny in other words. I won't go too much into the tech aspects, but everything was marvellous as you would expect from a thought-provoking sci-fi. The cinematography is probably the most pleasing aspect, truly poetry in motion. Jared Leto's (Nemo Nobody) performance was particularly outstanding as with most of his performances are. The soundtrack is one of the best I can recall from any film. It includes ""Everyday"" by Buddy Holly, ""Sweet Dreams"" by Annie Lennox, Erik Satie's moody Gymnopédie & Gnossiennes, and of course the extremely catchy Mister Sandman soundtrack.A highly original, ultra intelligent, thought-provoking, poignant, and utterly engaging film. It's certainly not to everyone's taste, some may see it as pretentious artsy fartsy fluff, but I personally took a lot from it. What it thought me is to take the opportunities that are in front of me, and not allow them to be cursed missed opportunities.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Beautiful & Insightful Work of Art with Some Slow Moments,"This movie is a work of art, albeit it has some slow moments. It explores themes such as the butterfly effect, karma, nihilism, immortality, and life after death. Jared Leto does an amazing job acting, and really carries the movie. The soundtrack is really great as well, featuring the masterpiece by Johann Sebastian Bach: Prelude in C Major.The visual style of the movie is truly captivating, with stunning cinematography that brings the themes to life in a visually engaging manner. Many scenes are meticulously crafted, creating profoundly beautiful atmospheres that complement the narrative's deeply contemplative complexity.However, the pacing can be uneven at times, with some scenes dragging on and disrupting the overall flow of the narrative. While these slower moments may contribute to the film's contemplative nature, they can also test the viewer's patience.Despite these flaws, the film's ambitious exploration of profound philosophical concepts is commendable. The intricate storyline demands attention and reflection, inviting viewers to ponder the interconnectedness of life and the consequences of our actions.Mr. Nobody is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that excels in its thematic depth and artistic execution. Jared Leto's performance and the exceptional soundtrack elevate the experience, making it a memorable cinematic journey. While it may not be perfect, it is definitely worth a watch for those who appreciate movies that challenge the mind and the senses.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Every Path Is The Right Path,"This isn't the first film of its kind-put simply its an abstract look at the consequences of decisions and how this can affect you and take you along different paths. It constantly fires this theme at you throughout and never relents from switching back and forth in time and settings.Undeniablely stunning visually with every shot incredibly cinematic and meticulous. It's not just the extraordinary craft here that makes this film great-it is very well written with a huge amount of substance. The actors feel like puppets being strung along in meticulous fashion yet still manage to deliver the message.Despite having many elements that are not fully explained, unlike lesser films of this ilk it doesn't try to, and herein lies its greatest strength.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A film that can be hated for the very reason it is loved.,"Mr Nobody whilst scraping at a genius level caliber could have just as easily been created by a child. The movie is in non-linear fashion and often so disjointed from one scene to another that the viewer's perception of time and reality is challenged.Without ruining the movie; its premise is based around the idea that there are infinite possibilities in life so as long as the protagonist(Nemo) doesn't make a choice. Once a choice is made however, the viewer is given a snippet of the journey Nemo takes as a result of this one choice. Whilst not in chronological order the movie's pivotal point is when Nemo as a boy has to choose between a life with his Mother or Father who have chosen to separate.The varying paths shown in the movie as a result of the choice Nemo makes as a child are dramatically creative however it instills a desperation in the viewer to discover the conclusion to the story. I personally found the premise to this movie quite exceptional but was disappointed with how everything was tied up in the end. Since the nature of the movie is non-linear, arty and disjointed it may be inappropriate to desire a well-knit conclusion; however all in all I don't believe the message communicated in this movie should take 2 hours and 30 minutes.I think when evaluating a movie it is important not to make it more intelligent than it is. In summary the sheer duration of this movie disengaged my interest and I watched until the end purely because of the time I had already invested in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It's all random,"I usually like these kinds of movies. Imaginary ones, where everything isn't always as it seems. I loved 'Eternal sunshine for the spotless mind', for instance.However, this is pure trash. I actually sat through the whole movie because it seemed like something I would like, and by the end I was hoping it would have a twist or come to a conclusion.But it's all random. The whole movie is random. The women he's married to, what he is doing, how he grew up, where he grew up. I realise that that's the idea behind the film, but what is the point? There is no character development whatsoever. One of his wives (just those words seem silly) is severely depressed one minute and the next minute she's dead and has been so since the wedding day. Everything is interchangeable and you realise how easy this movie must have been to make. Just put dramatic scenes in there and you win the audience. Obviously, seeing how everyone seems to think this is ""brilliant"" and ""a masterpiece"" etc.I can tell you all, as a warning: it is not. It is one of the worst movies I have ever forced myself to watch. This is not a story, it's just random, interchangeable dramatic scenes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Brilliant, I recommend this to anyone and everyone above 15","I have to say, this was one of the best films I've ever seen in my entire life. Definitely THE most original, by a mile and a half. It's more than 2 and a half hours long and I loved every minute of it, didn't feel draggy OR superfluous at all. Any less and it just wouldn't work, I don't think, in fact, if anything, I think they could have spread out the ending a bit more. It felt just a little rushed for me, but definitely not a deal-breaker.The dialogue, acting, etc etc was excellent (Tony Regbo I think his name is, Juno Temple and the actress who played Elise were all fantastic), but the cinematography and just the whole concept of it is what makes this film a class above the rest.Overall, a gem.

"Fantastic, highly cerebral film, not for everyone","Visually striking, well-acted, Mr. Nobody will not be for everyone. This highly cerebral film asks the question what if I'd made this choice instead of that. The main character, Nemo, whose parents are divorcing, is forced to make an unbearable choice as a child at a train station, stay with his dad or go with his mom. The outcome of his life depends on what choice he makes. Later in the story there are three girls, again what would his life be depending on which girl he marries.Mr. Nobody speaks of The Butterfly Effect and quantum physics (literally). It's a fascinating story that makes you think about your life and how you ended up where you are. What if you'd made one different choice along the way? What if you'd made a dozen different choices along the way?Because of the nature of the story, this film will not appeal to everyone. The story jumps from time period to time period in a non-linear fashion with 5-15 or more story lines (depending on whom you ask). I never felt confused. Instead I sat mesmerized by the story, cinematography, and the wheels turning in my own head.If you like Cloud Atlas, you'll like Mr. Nobody.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Mr Nobody captured me for the first hour, it got me lost in thought, it had me wondering about life at some points, but when I started to get fidgety in my armchair, and noticed that it still had 1h30 to go, I started finding it somewhat unbearable. Overall, great concept, nice acting, thought provoking film, but really drags, man. The only reason why I continued watching it was because I wanted to finish what I had started.

Beautiful thing of art.,"it is not often I am impressed by a movie. I have seen it all, from the most thrilling of action films to the most complex of psychological thrillers. I have enjoyed, but I enjoyed, no more.That was until I decided to watch this film and was plunged head first into a story so deep, so complex that I was left feeling stumped and flat out amazed by the amount of excellent and fulfilling storytelling. The story is complex and will swing you around at will, and will leave you guessing what is real and what is not. Every storyline (4 if memory serves) drags you in and does not let you go. The storyline involving Nemo and Anna had the most effect on me and, at the end of the movie, left me wiping a few tears from my eyes. Every scene is just so well done, and where chaos seems to reign supreme at first, at the end you begin to understand that every scene, every move and every plot point was a thing of logic, a necessity to an action we did not yet understand.Another thing that caught my attention was the music, and how it complimented each scene. The soundtrack is not just full of artists you know and intended to tap your foot to, it really helps set the mood in every scene.

"Brilliant, Charming, Witty, Timeless; a Masterpiece of the Heart","Hand in hand with Fifi, my beautiful partner of more than two months, I waited in a very long line at the cinema for the chance to see this much anticipated and buzzed-about masterpiece.

Memorable,"""Mr. Nobody"" is a movie about the possibilities and the choices we make in our lives. The film is absolutely believable even though most of the plot turns out to be child's fantasy. Different stories are mixed very well. Even though one can predict the wanted effect was to confuse the audience it isn't in a naive way. The viewer feels something strange is going on but doesn't know what exactly until the end. The leading idea that I saw wasn't ""what happens to the characters"" but what would be different in my life if for example 20 years ago i didn't take the train but the bus. ""What if""... what if I woke up 2 hours earlier today, what if I decided to walk to work, would I meet the love of my life? Is that chance lost for good? Or maybe according to the choices we make different people are meant for us? Does our path change it's direction every time we make a choice? Or nevertheless what we decide it leads us to one destination in the end? Am I a person who takes decisions and is responsible for them? Or do my decisions form me as one? Am I somebody or nobody? ""Mr. Nobody"" is one of those movies that doesn't give you the answers, but the questions. It doesn't try to convince you in it's truths it just makes you wanna find yours. Even more it makes you wonder if there is any truth or false or does it all depend on what you choose.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Another hit from Jaco Van Dormael.,"Mr. Nobody isn't an easy movie to watch. For that the story is too weird, almost impossible to fully understand, it will make you think about it long time after you watched it. But weird doesn't mean bad, on the contrary, for a movie that is almost three hours long it's still entertaining. Visually it's sometimes stunning, the cinematography is just of really high quality. Jaco Van Dormael doesn't make a lot of movies but when he does they're just very good. After Toto Le Héros (1991) and Le Huitième Jour (1996), both excellent movies, he's coming with something completely different this time, but it's still an emotional movie like the other two were. The cast was this time not French or Belgian, besides a short appearance of Pascal Duquenne (the main autistic character from Le Huitième Jour), but they all did a good job in this movie. Jared Leto is a good actor and in Mr. Nobody he did a really good job. Mr. Nobody is one of those movies you have to watch more than once, to fully understand the story, or at least to try to understand the story.

After more than two hours of tedious storytelling with a lot of repetitions, and alternative solutions of the life-story told, I have no idea what that important message is. I was so bored by this movie that I nearly panicked, and I wanted to leave the cinema, and the only reason I stayed was that my friend I was seeing it with wanted to see it through (though she was pretty bored too but she still had the hope of something meaningful at the end).

Unfortunately, knowing cinema quite a bit I was actually shocked to see how much the director took from other epic films. Starting from basic idea about running after train with 3 different destiny paths and to see what if he got to train and what if not- this is idea taken shamelessly100% from ""Blind Fate"" by famous Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski (yavailable on Criterion Collection). Me myself having Polish roots and being a big fan of Kieslowskis epic work already felt totally disturbed from the beginning. Next idea is taken from ""Space Odyssey"" where you have motif of an old man and the apes in a cave also the starship moving to classic music.Stolen from another classic and epic film. Than funny suicide attempts in front of a mother ""Harold and Moude"". The machine typing - ""Naked Lunch"", other movies you can see there ""Truman Show"" ,""Magnolia"" and ""Fifth Element"". Watching this I had an impression the director had put 5 dvds with mentioned movies in front of him and decided to write a script based on them. It was annoying AF to watch this film seeing how someoenes ideas and work is just taken shamelessly. From this reason the director lost completely his credibility as an artist to me.

Gives us enough to chew on before we choke on it or spit it out,"Mr. Nobody concerns the complex principles of quantum mechanics of time, specifically the often-debated and discussed ""many-worlds theory,"" which basically boils down to the possibility of numerous, external universes existing operating upon the choices you've never made yourself. Consider myself choosing to hang out with a friend of mine today after finishing my classes rather than working on schoolwork or my writing. Had I went home directly after finishing my classes, perhaps I would've gotten more of my schoolwork done, which could've resulted in better grades, which would've made my GPA higher, which would've potentially gotten me better job opportunities, which could've even made my income a bit higher.Of course, you could ""what if?"" damn-near every circumstance of your life to the point where you can make yourself suicidal over what you could've done and what you wound up doing, but that's not healthy at all. The details of quantum mechanics have been softly examined in film for quite sometime (one film that immediately comes to mind is the opening monologue of Richard Linklater's Slacker delivered by Linklater himself from the back of a taxicab). However, rarely does a film muster up the ambition and conviction to tackle on the often headache-inducing ins and outs of such lofty ideas, which are nothing more than theories in scholarly articles that populate the internet.Writer/director Jaco Van Dormael apparently had enough confidence to concoct a lengthy screenplay and timeline around the idea and the result is Mr. Nobody, an admirably ambitious film that, like the very basic ideas of quantum mechanics, packs a great deal of ideas into a relatively small box and tries to make us chew on them long enough before we either choke or spit them out. We open in the year 2092, where humans are now immortal thanks to the endless renewal of cells; the last mortal on Earth is the 117-year-old Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto), who is edging ever-so-closely to death as society watches the last soul among them with the capability to die. A psychiatrist named Dr. Feldheim (Allan Corduner) manages to snag one final interview with Nemo before his imminent death, since Nemo also has a rare ability to account the past lives he could've lived had he made a different choice in a crucial situation as a young child.At the age of nine, Nemo had the choice of which parent he wanted to stay with after their separation. At first, we see him tardily hop aboard a train with his mother, where, in three separate story lines, he becomes smitten with a woman named Anna, in one world insulting her and her friends, at another point conversing with them, and another, marrying and raising children with her. Yet another alternate life shows the multitude of possibilities that could've happened had he stayed home and lived with his father, where Nemo meets an entirely new woman named Elise, who, in one story, is still in love with her boyfriend, but another, is bipolar and manic depressive, making Nemo's life a living hell.Mr. Nobody is anything but a linear experience; at two and a half hours in length, the film plays like a repetitive stageplay, exhausting every potential narrative possibility as it showcases every which way Nemo's life could've gone. We see situations repeat themselves, lines of dialog slightly altered to create a new scene, and through it all, Nemo Nobody, who has lived more lives to the fullest than we'll be lucky to live one. As narratively ambitious as this story is, shortcomings seem to plague or limit the film's greatness on a consistent basis. To begin with, Nemo isn't that engaging of a person, nor is Leto that expressive or interesting as a character actor to sustain a film as lofty or as long as this one. Nemo doesn't grab us in with his personality because, through many of his scenes, he's a passive presence; almost an accessory or a side-character to his own life. He doesn't seem too fazed by the multitude of things occurring in his life at any given moment, with limited facial and vocal expression, which makes it hard for us, the audience, to truly sympathize with him. With that, as stated, Leto doesn't bring a ton to the table as Nemo either; his presence is lacking the kind of engagement that protagonists usually possess, especially with such a liberal amount of runtime/screen time to work with, which results in a part of the film that sags dramatically.After some contemplation, that element seems to be Mr. Nobody's biggest issue. Other features - such as a narrative that repeats itself quite frequently, an almost inherently exhausting and maddening amount of existentialism to chew on, and a timeline that results in a viewer doing mental hopscotch to try to cogently understand it - are almost to be expected with a film dealing with quantum mechanics, so complaining about them, despite their presence, seems a bit foolish. In addition, overly emphasizing these attributes can greatly make one forget about the commendable ambition and scope Van Dormael possesses for his screenplay. He respects the screenplay enough to deeply consider the limitless possibilities of the many-worlds theory, to the point where I wished he would've focused on a more engaging presence instead of the flatter, less convincing protagonist we got with our titular character.Mr. Nobody has a whirlwind going for it in the conversational/post-credits discussion aspect, as most panels and debates about the many-worlds theory possess; it's getting to that point and enduring what we must endure that gets in the way of the ultimate reward, which is discussing and sharing our deepest, most personal thoughts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Amazing Journey through life,"I just saw this movie, and for you that might have not seen it yet i should tell and thus recommend you to fasten to your seat because the film will take you out there, on an amazing joyride of stories all mixed-up, building up a great plot about a man that has an odd and unique life experience ,and how this life might get completely changed by his own decisions ,in choosing what he wants to do with it. For what i think, this is the kind of movie you would like to see on a Sunday afternoon, so you have enough time to think about it once you finished it, because believe me when i say it will leave you a great message about what fate is ,and perhaps how the good or bad decisions might not even exist. Last but not least, Jared Leto's interpretation is achieved rather greatly, as well as done in Requiem For a Dream, leaving us no wonder why he might have gotten chosen for this eccentric role. my opinion, 9/10 .",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Choices We Make,"Mr. Nobody is a great idea which is poorly executed. Jared Leto is the title character, a 118 year old man and the last human on earth. Much like the story telling flashbacks of Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man, only this time it is a future world.The prologue explains that we are all born with complete memories of our lives before they happen and the angels of oblivion touch us to wipe out the knowledge. They miss Nemo and he must first choose his parents. They divorce and in one case he lives with his mother and her boyfriend and his daughter, Anna, who invites him for a swim at the beach. He refuses, and years later sees her with her two children. With a second choice, he tells her that he cannot swim and she stays with him on the beach and they become lovers.With a different choice, he lives with his paralyzed father and must be his caretaker. At a school dance, he meets Elise, but when he sees her with a boyfriend, he rides a motorcycle in anger and crashes and is crippled.In another scenario, Elise dumps the boyfriend, they marry and have three children, but Elise is severely depressed, and she leaves him.The last story of Nemo's love life has Elise rejecting him and Nemo telling his father that he will marry the first girl who dances with him. Jean is the lucky gal, and he marries her and they have two kids, a big house with a pool, but in spite of all the material success, Nemo is still unhappy.Mr. Nobody never really connects on any level. Visually, it reminded me of Tree of Life, which also didn't work for me; both are emotionally distant.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"There is no right way, just a way.","From the get go you will realize that Mr.Nobody won't be just like the other movies you've come across. It emphatically poses deep questions about the concepts of time, space, choice (or illusion there of), destiny and consequence. In a way, Mr.Nobody attempts to give order and meaning to things which throughout the movie it continually shows to have no order and meaning at all. It attempts to show you that time moves in sequence even if you aren't ready to move along with it, it attempts to show you that your choices make a difference when in the end they make no difference at all.Does it really matter if you stop to tie your laces at the lights or once you cross them? Nemo Nobody is a figure outside of space and time, he is neither here nor there, in this time or the next. The visual beauty that Van Dormael presents on the screen emphasizes the beauty which can be enjoyed in our lives, each choice we make will lead us down a path, one that has its own beauties which can be enjoyed in their own ways. Nemo is one character shown across three different life paths, but we can see throughout that he is one in the same. It is not the person who changes with the decisions they make, it is only elements of their character which are forced into submission in some ways more than others.Although it may sound complex, three different lives in one, the film flows beautifully from scene to scene with metaphorical scene compositions and transitions. Van Dormael has managed to create a modern masterpiece by drawing on the ageless human contentions, do the decisions we make today really impact upon our final fate? Nemo Nobody is an empty shell in which the mind, the soul and the choices of each one of us can be inserted. Each one of has an Elise, an Anna, a Jean in our lives. Each one of us has an A, B or C moment that has lingered at our forethought's for years.Ultimately, Mr. Nobody questions whether living life has purpose at all. Much like the ultimate importance of the decisions we make, this question isn't answered, but merely felt through the eyes of the one hundred eighteen year old man, sitting and staring at the life which to him at least, never was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Imagination at its best,"(edit) Stunningly beautiful, wonderfully executed, confusing as hell to some extent but oh so worth the watch. It seems long but the longer you watch the harder it is to stop staring at this masterpiece. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it, and it's a shame that there aren't more films like this. Funny thing is, I never even heard of it before I gave it a chance. I think the only reason this film didn't make a bigger buzz was because of completely absent marketing. Here's to hoping that more people will give it a chance and come to love it, or at least appreciate the scope of imagination it lends to the sad state of modern cinema.As far as the lead actors go- all were exceptional. Jared Leto was very very good in his role and transformations, Sarah Polley broke my heart (she depicted manic depression and deep depression with such honesty that catharsis was inevitable), and this director- Jaco Van Dormael, now has my complete and utter respect for sheer daring.

"Not A Masterpiece, But Certainly A Brave and Ambitious Exploration of Various Intriguing Themes.","An interesting watch, a delight to the eyes. I'm not naive to call it a masterpiece or anything, but it's a brave and innovative attempt; the splendid intersection of life's decisions, butterfly effect, string theory, parallel universes, true love and imagination is quite spectacular.Jaco Van Dormael's ambitious attempt to explore these themes in a non-linear and haphazard fashion is sometimes flawed but mostly fascinating. Maybe it's supposed to be a satire on Life itself; sometimes seemingly good decisions have bad endings (death, unhappiness), and sometimes accidental or bad decisions end up having good futures. The thing is, no matter what decision we take,we can never predict what would eventually happen. (In the movie, by not choosing, he is letting everything happen, side-by-side.) The movie's ambiguous nature maybe a satirical take on decision-making and nature of life, or it maybe a plan gone wrong. It ultimately depends on what you got out of the whole ordeal.(If anyone is left boggled by the movie's ending, you can read my explanation here: akashsebastian.wordpress.com/2013/09/23 /possible-explanations-for-mr-nobody-movie )The acting is commendable, especially by Jared Leto, Toby Regbo and Rhys Ifans.

"Mr. Nobody, a film about memories, origins and relationships.","Mr. Nobody, a film about memories, origins and relationships. Mr Nobody arises from slumber in a hospital with a tattooed doctor enquiring about the life of the last surviving mortal on Earth. Little is explained about this future civilisation except that a medical breakthrough has emerged to give humans everlasting life.Mr Nobody is held in the hospital and it is planned that his death is to be broadcast to the world; after all he is a mortal in an immortal world. It's a big deal. The majority of the film is dedicated to looking back at this mysterious gentleman's past. We meet him before he was born where unborn children are touched by angels. These unborn children choose their own parents, an interesting concept on creation.The young protagonist has an unusual gift; he can see parts of the future. Those around him pass this off as déjà vu but he knows otherwise, predicting a car crash and various other events. The cinematography is artistically done, with a human approach, using close ups of faces whenever possible. The world is wonderfully colourful with eccentric characters and intense personal connections.Mr Nobody is remarkably philosophical, bringing up questions of existence, consequence, time, love and choices to name a few. This is what I got from the Jaco Van Dormael drama, a sense that we should question everything while accepting what comes as fate. A lot of the choices Jared Leto's Mr Nobody makes are cinematographically depicted in colours; the film progresses seeing three loves in his life, all childhood acquaintances which are assigned a different colour almost without fail throughout.Anybody that has read my other reviews knows I love a good soundtrack. Mr Nobody has an excellent score, and any film with ""Where Is My Mind"" and ""Everyday"" gets the thumbs up.I advise everybody to watch Mr Nobody at some point in their life, there is a lot to take in but this is special. It is laugh out loud funny at times, philosophical without getting bogged down in metaphysics and is masterfully written. Don't miss out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A true masterpiece,"Audiovisually, the movie reminded me of Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"", Tarsem Singh's ""The Fall"", Sean Ellis's ""Cashback"", Vincenzo Natali's ""Cypher"" and even Alex Proyas's ""Dark City"". The use of colors, music, camera angles and other audiovisual aspects are amazing, innovative and harmonious to say the least.Emotionally, I can't think of a movie to have touched me since Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" and Craig Brewer's ""Black Snake Moan""... yet it remains fairly lighthearted most of the time.Storywise, this movie takes elements from those same movies and mixes it with the parallel storytelling of Peter Howitt's ""Sliding Doors"". The themes are diverse, compelling, deep and imaginative.All these elements combined leads to a wonderfully confusing surreal movie that feels warm and touching, inspiring and nostalgic. The only problem I have with the movie is that it's a bit too confusing in some areas and that it tries to take on so many different themes it seems a bit too much for a single movie... but I can't deduct more than a single point from a maximum rating because IMO everything else about this movie is simply perfect....This movie should have gotten numerous awards.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Highly Addictive Perfection,"Before I review this movie, there is one thing I must explain in order for you to understand what I am about to say about the movie.I collect movies and have watched a number which is beyond counting. You could almost call me a ""professional movie watcher"". All these movies I watched were good and bad. Therefore, I thought it was impossible for me to have ONE FAVORITE MOVIE.Well, ladies and gentlemen, after watching Mr. Nobody - I realized I found the best movie I have ever watched so far. THIS MOVIE goes beyond the adjective ""perfect"". Saying that this movie is perfect would be an serious offense!The story is amazing. From the moment you turn on the movie, to the moment you turn off the movie, you will be glued to the screen - literally. You won't even be able to blink while you watch it. This story is the ideal food for your brain. It will set your brain cells on fire and it will torment you for days and days. Then, you won't be able to stand the torment anymore and you will have to watch the movie again and again. I watched it 17 times and I am still in longing for it.Jared Leto's acting is wonderful. He really ""nailed it"". The other actors are absolutely great and deserve my compliments too.The soundtrack is beyond perfection. The selection of the tracks is sophisticated: every song is perfectly incorporated into the movie.The camera is unbelievable. I was unable to believe that a movie could have such a brilliant style of filming. I am flabbergasted.The entire movie is a masterpiece and everything fits perfectly together. It's highly addictive and deals with two very vague and humanly obsessive subjects: time and choice.I am going to stop here, because I want to force you to watch this movie. However, the movie might not be suitable for people who don't want movies to force them to think for days about the story or who don't want movies to influence their opinions and general life ideas. Also, if you are tired: do not watch this movie. This is a motion picture that requires your complete concentration because everything is important here.Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

An Ambitious Film That Succeeds?,"One of the many reasons I attend the movie theater so frequently is to experience what I haven't before and to live through incredibly fresh and memorable journeys as to excitedly recall them in future discussions on cinema. Personally, the greatest cinematic events are remembered due to their remarkably daring approach in one way or another, reluctant to pursue the same old subject matter that appeals to critics and the Academy year in and year out. In that regard, Mr. Nobody is a risk if there ever was any and its ambition, for being such a small independent production, is vastly impressive! In fact, Mr. Nobody holds several similarities with last year's Cloud Atlas in that they explore the concept of decision-making in a massive universe that never calls attention to a being as miniscule as you and I. This film embarks on a study of extremely thought-provoking metaphysics and humanity's very existence in a wholly random and gigantic system of events.Nemo Nobody is an adolescent who is forced to choose between his father and mother, following their unfortunate separation, one leaving on a train to a distant land and the other watching the memory fade in dismay; Nemo is in the center and whomever he chooses will substantially affect his future- the people he will end up meeting, the locations he will end up visiting, and the condition in which he will find himself as time speedily advances. From that moment on, this extraordinarily peculiar narrative will cast us into these infinite possibilities to which Nemo may one day expose himself, based on the decision he will ultimately make on that fateful day. Vastly differential lives will be led and various love interests will follow under separate destinies- its tagline: ""If you never make a choice, anything is possible."" This feature is essentially an exemplar of the truly bizarre adventures one might take on a trip to the cinema as you are left completely befuddled on the path to the movie's conclusion while numerous situations transpire and the familiar meet their ends.The editing and visual style exemplified in this picture is simply amazing and is definitely what drives the foundations of such a creative film. You will find yourself astonished by the dozens of clever techniques employed by the cinematography. Again, returning to my initial point, Mr. Nobody is one of those movies you absolutely can't judge in a definitive manner until you reach the credits as the thematic material and substance, overall, decently materializes by its endpoint, testing the moviegoer's patience on its gradual climb to satisfying explanation. Once you've hit the final mark, the confusion that once bothered you somewhat clears and you finally feel like this story was worth your 2+ hours of attention. Drawing parallels to Cloud Atlas, it, too, audaciously attempts to convey a challenging, extensive tale that tours the fascinating nature in which our lives unravel and how one small decision leaves us with an utterly disparate environment. As with Cloud Atlas, what undoubtedly keeps us in our seats instead of barging out of the showing in frustration, are the stunning visuals and the colossal scope partaken. In addition, Mr. Nobody carries a fun soundtrack throughout with the likes of ""Mister Sandman"" and ""Where is my Mind"" that effectively assists the pacing and entertainment factor within a particular scene. Though one can overwhelmingly praise this marvel, another can gripe over how pretentious it seemed; it certainly isn't for everyone. I can appreciate its confidence, but it might not resonate with as many people as it had hoped considering its bloated content, executed in rather vague fashion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Mr. Nobody,"I always find Jared Leto very easy to look at, but rarely does his acting ever amount to very much. Not so, here. This is quite a quirky and innovative drama that sees his life as ""Nemo"" depend on one simple decision he must make. Ought he to stay with his separating mother or father? This choice will, naturally, impact on how his life and the life of many others will pan out as we soon discover that scientific advances have ensured that he has survived to become the last ""mortal"" centenarian left on Earth. These permutations that ensue vary from the pedestrian to the surreal, and the characterisations offer us a little more depth to the scenarios as we all experience the consequences of his actions, and those invite a bit of thought, even philosophising, as the ramifications affect not just him, but ""Elise"" (a strong contribution from Sarah Polley) and ""Anna"" (Diane Kruger). Toby Regbo bears quite a striking resemblance to Leto which helps his engaging representation of the fifteen year old ""Nemo"" and, indeed, all of the children who take on the junior years of the key roles deliver well, here. It is not a straightforward story, some of it made sense to me, some of it suggested that auteur Jaco Van Dormael had been sitting too close to the glue pot, but there is an effective intensity to the performance from Leto (and his wonderfully expressive eyes) as we embark on this roller-coaster ride. I did not love the conclusion - but don't know that I could have improved upon it either - you ought to give it a try and see what you think. It is long, and maybe that will deter some people as the pace isn't always consistent, but I'd say this is the best I've seen from this star.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I just thought the movie was completely unoriginal and pretentious; there have been many movies before - The Fountain to name one - that have explored the same themes and executed to greater effect. After many (convoluted and schmaltzy) story lines about what might have happened in Nemo's (even the name is pretentious) life if he had made different decisions, in the end you'll find that the whole thing was absolutely pointless; the story takes you on this long long twisty journey only to lead you back to where you were.

"one of the best cinematic experience I ever had, everyone should watch it with an Active mind only.","MR.NOBODY – CATCH IT ( A- ) Mr. Nobody is like a dream, a fantasy which came into life. Its one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen still it's not as confusing as Memento was. Mr. Nobody is really confusing and starts off with a 118yrs old man on the Mars looking back at his possible 3 lives. Confusing? Once you get the idea that it's about an old man who remembering his 3 possible lives with 3 women based upon his decision to live with his Mom or Daddy after their separation, and then the audiences will understand the whole concept. The editing of the movie is really confusing because we are shuffling between different parts of Nemo's life from Age 9, Age 15 to Age 34. Once we know what life belong to which female lead then its all clear, the audiences have to be active to understand and joint the puzzles back. The cinematography and color scheme of the movie is out of this world, it's simple yet very dreamy and imaginative. Jared Leto plays Mr. Nemo Nobody in Age 34. In all 3lives and in Age 118, he did a pretty fantastic job but I did feel like that Jared Leto is a Pretty man and looks gorgeous on screen with his blue eyes but if the director would have chosen some seasoned actor that movie could have gotten great recognition, actually more then its receiving. The budget of the movies is around $58 Million, which is a great investment on non-bankable actor like Jared Leto. Thomas Byrne (Nemo Age 9), the kid did a fine job with his big blue eyes. Laura Brumagne (Anna Age 9), Léa Thonus (Elise Age9) & Anaïs Van Belle (Jean Age9) looks really cute in the movie. However the Nemo who stole the show was Toby Regbo (Nemo Age 15), he was truly astonishing. His big blue eyes and his incredible acting chops in both three possible lives with Anna, Elise and Jean can be visibly seen. I think if he gets right roles he will be next Big Star in the making. Juno Temple (Anna Age15), she is one of the talented British actresses around who made her name with supporting roles till now. The chemistry between Toby Regbo and Juno Temple is the soul of the movie; all the scenes between them are beautifully shot and are brilliantly acted by them. Diane Kruger (Anna Age 34) looks pretty and acted well. Sara Polly (Age 34) was fantastic as neurotic wife of Nemo. Clare Stone (Elise Age 15) did a decent job and gave a nice characterization to Elise's character. Linh-Dan Pham (Jean Age 34) & Audrey Giacomini (Age 15) didn't have lengthy roles but they did a good job. Natasha Little as Nemo's mother looks really pretty and she acted really well. The only criticism I had was the ambiguous ending, though too me it seemed like Anna's life was Nemo's real life because the shot between Nemo and Anna in Age 34 re-uniting Again is shown in the end. Anyways still its one of the best cinematic experience I ever had, everyone should watch it with an Active mind only. You will love it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A great story about ""what-ifs"" and the incredible aspect of time..","Jaco van Dormael surprised me with this non-linear story about the meanings behind the time as an adjuster of life... There is no explanation for the end but more of a question about it: the what if segment of life. What if the end is no near what we think it is? What if the end is reversible and any action we performed in life we could reperform after the so-called end. The point of this movie was, without a doubt, to make yourself think about the different possibilities of this deep question about everything we know. By the look of that, I agree that this director is a big fan of Kubrick's Odyssey since this movie kind of challenges the same system of beliefs. It's a powerful film, emotional I could say since it delivers a lot of messages about love, hate, insanity, about what is sanity, about loneliness and progress. It's a beautiful work and I had to give this movie credit for being not that original but much more interesting and well executed than ninety percent of the movies released in the last years.The cast was my big problem. I couldn't actually like anyone besides Jared Leto. They all seem dull with their characters and had a flat approach for them. The characters though were developed good and you could always connect pieces from each different story without having a hard time. The best part of this movie I tend to say it was the editing which was simply great, lots of beautiful shots arranged in the proper order... That's what kept me interested in the movie besides the story: what should I expect from this scene? where will the movie head after this scene? and so on... By the way, the soundtrack fitted the movie almost perfectly.I recommend this movie to any person who enjoys smart story lines and interesting characters.

A Brilliantly Confusing Film,"Mr. Nobody was a movie which, on the surface, seemed very confusing. It featured many different plots with a multitude of characters, yet managed to connect them all magnificently without overwhelming the viewer. Mr. Nobody is a movie that really makes you think; think about life, think about love, and think about possibilities. It has been a while since I actually took something extremely constructive from a film, but I can walk away from this masterpiece feeling wholeheartedly enlightened. Jared Leto's acting was also superb in this title, although I longed to re- witness his 'Requiem for a Dream' demeanour. Oh well, still an amazing movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Engaging, but lacking in substance","From the very beginning, this movie sets out to engage the audience and confront people with philosophical questions about time, and life. While I do like this approach, I cannot praise it too much because it sacrifices the story's coherence for a lot of drama that slows the film down. It is necessary to the story though, but I think the problem lies in the way the script is build up.Of course, this is still a matter of opinion, but to me whenever the movie got into the whole ""multiple decisions in life"" I thought it was very refreshing and interesting. But when the movie gets into the multiple lovers and marriages it slows down and the movie gets downright boring in some parts. Let me just clarify that I don't have anything against 'slow-paced' movies, or movies that don't focus as much on action, as long as it stays interesting or (in this case) thought-provoking. I told my friend who was watching it with me that it feels like it was directed by multiple people.As I said, I do like the concept this movie was going for. I just hope that in the future, a movie gets to marry interesting theoretical possibility's with a coherent script a little better. Because of the somewhat fragmented result, the movie seems a bit too pretentious and overall too pleased with itself.I'm somewhat hesitant to recommend Mr Nobody. Even though its definitely engaging, I don't think this movie will obviously appeal to everybody. Especially not to people who aren't into pseudo-scientific speculation. But if you're open to these sort of things and similar artistic efforts, you will praise this as much as anybody else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Wasted 2.5 hours on this mess pretending to be ""mind bending""","This was a long, tedious, boring mess which I guess can be called a movie. Heard so much about it and people even compared it to Inception. I can't believe I wasted 2.5 hours on this.

Love is all we've got.,"I travel a lot, and have ""Mr Nobody"" always with me on my laptop. I watch it at every opportunity I get. I like to pad time with this film. I have lost count of how many times I've seen it.In hotel rooms after strolling around in strange cities.In endless train rides, next to people reading their newspaper.And in airplanes while flying over the continents.I sometimes watch just the swimming pool scene.Or the ""I wish time would stop now"" scene.Other times I just listen to the theme song on repeat.Our precious love will destroy the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A near masterpiece,"My friends randomly told me to watch this movie, and I was expecting something decent. What I saw quite nearly blew me away. I'm probably going to view it again. Very few times have I finished a movie, and have still been thinking about it hours later. Cloud atlas is the only other one that comes to mind. I thought cloud atlas was a masterpiece though, while this goes down as simply amazing. My only real gripes are a few minor continuity errors, mainly the fact that people's accents seemed to change for no reason sometimes, and there were a few ways that I think the story could have been told in a slightly more coherent fashion. And furthermore, one of the realities didn't really make sense to me. I'm sure some of my complaints were intentionally put there because I think the viewer is supposed to be lost throughout this whole movie to some degree. Aside from this though, it was perfect. This movie had some amazing directing and was visually stunning to say the least. One thing I can't understand though is why this movie wasn't known to me until a few days ago.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
My first review. Loved the movie!,"I googled ""movies that make you think"". I didn't even read the review, just decided to watch it. I have actually stopped the movie during the first 20 minutes, simply because I couldn't understand a f*cking thing. But believe me, it is so worth it! Makes your mind stop for a second, and think. I am glad I haven't read any reviews or summaries before the movie. I was getting it as it progressed.Sadly enough there are not many movies like this one.

Boyhood on Crack; Mr. Nobody,"This film is Boyhood on Crack and with an enormous helping of quantum physics and algorithms thrown in just for good measure. It is either one of the greatest films of all time, or (if you judge the box office which is lower than any film in history except Heaven's Gate), one of the worst films of all time. The likely truth is that it is somewhere in the middle, so I gave it a 6 (one extra star for originality). The visuals are quite stunning and reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The emotional content is similar to Boyhood, and the sensual aspect of the perfect brother and sister twins is not related to any film I know of. This film is different, if nothing else. I guarantee you that you have seen nothing like it before. I can see why it didn't make any money. Most people are too ignorant to understand what the film is about; don't understand quantum physics and algorithms, and have difficulty in making a leap in imagination.

One Of My Favorite Films of All Time,"Everything about this film amounts to perfection; this is where film making and art start to blend together. The amount of artistic value in this movie is staggering. Special and visual effects are gorgeous, making excellent use of their simplicity. The cinematography... Where do I even start? It's absolutely phenomenal in every sense of the word. Some of the shots are so inventive and smart my jaw was (unknowingly) hanging open at times.Set design is excellent as is the sound design. Editing is a work of wonder. The film is so perfectly paced that it never gets boring and constantly keeps your attention. This is of course possible due not only to the editing but also the direction and use of a nonlinear plot. Direction is masterful. Jaco Van Dormael uses every resource at his disposal to the maximum and has an eye for the smallest of smallest of details, right down to the colors certain characters wear (he does this in a very specific manner).Pierre Van Dormael composed one of the best soundtracks of all time for Mr. Nobody. His use of simple string instruments bring an emotional touch but it allows the film to breathe. There's also a wide selection of different songs used throughout the movie and it's all perfectly used. I don't normally like when unoriginal music is used in movies but when it's done with the precision and care that it was here it works out extremely well.Every character is cast perfectly and each give incredible performances. Jared Leto, Juno Temple, and Toby Regbo are the standouts here. Each of their performances were breathtaking. Again, I don't usually enjoy having child actors in movies because they normally can't hold up to their adult co-starts but, once again, in Mr. Nobody it's different. I really hope Toby Regbo finds more work; he deserves it.Lastly, the story. I already mentioned how the nonlinear plot is used excellently and keeps the film moving. The only time nonlinear films have worked so well were in Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"".The story is written by Van Dormael with such care and attention it's astonishing. I first saw the film a few months before this review and as of this writing I still think about it nearly everyday. The amount of times I was able to relate to the main characters was something special. This is a very human film with a very human core. Sure, it asks questions about reality and time and space but really it's about the people and how they progress as the story moves on.The film deals with a lot of heavy topics, some even controversial to certain religions (Christian among many others). This movie makes you think. It asks you questions and you, in turn, naturally start to debate them in your head as you watch. The film does an excellent job of keeping its viewers engaged in the story.This isn't a film for everyone (hence the 7.9 rating with only 92000 votes). This is a very intellectual, philosophical, and emotional story. I think some could relate it to ""Inception"" because it deals with some similar themes that question reality and just the fact that it can be so incredibly confusing!The way I perceived myself and reality changed after I watched this movie. Give this film a chance (it's even on Netflix). It amazes me how few people have actually seen this film. Even the late Roger Ebert never posted a review.This is one of those hidden movie gems. It isn't any one genre for it spans all the way from science fiction to modern day drama to romance. It's impossible to describe to someone for a reason. Overall, it's a very refreshing take on film in this age of Transformers sequels and Avengers mash-ups. It's probably one of the most original and unique movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Exceptional movie from and exceptional director,"How could I have missed this?Jaco Van Dormeal is an artist!You really need to see his 2 previous films, but this is a review of ""Mr.Nobody"".This is a remarkable film. It is Science Fiction (And the special effects are VERY good). It is a romance. It's hard to label it any one thing.Put down your ipad, put away your phone and WATCH this movie. If you don't you will miss something. There are few wasted shots, few unnecessary lines. And yes, it's VERY hard to follow. There are three major story lines, but each has their own branches.Jato Leto is fabulous. This was done just before he was nominated for an Oscar in ""Dallas Buyer's Club"", and you can see why he took a break between these two films. He is so many characters and yet remains the same.The movie I saw was the standard release on Netflix. I understand the Director's cut is the only one you should watch, so go get the blu-ray so you can get a better understanding of the story Mr. Dormeal intended to tell.One other note. The music is very nice, appropriate, and memorable. This is the last movie in which the director's brother, Pierre, contributed before his untimely death. As in the two previous efforts, it helps set the stage.This one is worth the effort. I can not recommend it enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Big-budget existentialist fantasy,"Not sure how the brilliant, quirky Belgium director Jaco Van Dormael wound up making a big-budget American movie, but it's great he did. The film follows the title character through multiple life choices, although whether these are what has happened or what could have happened is not made clear until (sort of) at the end. I really didn't expect any decent explanation, but I kind of like what they did, even though I can't say it's that persuasive if you think about it.The movie is absolutely fascinating, full of vivid and extraordinary moments. The cast is excellent and the twisty story is well paced and thoroughly engrossing.Note that while Mr. Nobody's lives are strikingly different (perhaps more so than they should be, if we look at twin studies that suggest people with the same DNA make weirdly similar choices), they all involved his hooking up with super hot women. Whatever choices you make in your life, if you look like Jared Leto you'll have some commonalities.Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A surreal tread through nonlinearity,"The story just don't get enough justice to be called a story, due to it serving multiple possibilities of Mr. Nobody's life. Those who get comfortable with this kind of surrealism are those who also get comfy with Darren Aronofsky's story telling and visualizations. Yet the movie offered something different from Aronofsky by presenting somewhat rather patchy editing and transitions, which actually turn out to be great due to them helping set the movie's pace to be really fast and tight at all times. Then again, I must say that this kind of movie can only be fully enjoyed by those who are experienced in understanding and thus enjoying complicated movies such as Nolans', or those who simply let go of any assumptions and expectations and then just absorbs all to then deconstruct it after watching. The acting feels very nice, especially in Jared Leto's work, being total and encompassing a wide breadth of character variations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Nemo, the protagonist who, during certain stages of his life, refuses to choose when choices are necessary, and to the result that his life is fragmented into many universes, many parallel possibilities, the one where he left his girlfriend and the one where he didn't, the one where he lived with his mum and the one where he lived with his dad.

Film 101 . You guys didn't even go to college. don't write movies. There is no discernible (keyword) plot until the very end, except for the multiple universes thing; yeah, we got that. that was the introduction. Jared Leto doesn't take charge of his(well.. non-existent)character until the last few scenes, and considering that the average scene in this film lasts under 60 seconds, you'll have a lot of head scratching to do if you want to walk out the theatre and pretend you understood any of it.Of course the audio is perfect, the scenery, costumes, photography, everything is top notch.

"Mind boggling, but senseless","I won't spoil it for you, I'll just say that it is good to be a decisive person, however, you are faced with a world where there is too much to choose from. Things are really meant to be simpler, and we are actually family oriented by nature. You cannot compare a human being to a caveman, because we have evolved far from that. If people started growing up in the wild today, they wouldn't behave anything like cavemen, although I can promise you, that we would go back to our family oriented and community style traits. Those who couldn't comply with it would see their ends one way or another, but all in all, you are more like an Amish person than you realize. Even more so than the Amish. Time itself and the universe are not set to a path of destruction, they were set that way when we started to fight who we are. If man wants to continue to evolve, he needs to get his heart in order first. That feeling you get in the spring time when wondering free in a field of wild flowers isn't to be taken for granted.

Pretentious,"There are basically two types of art fans. There are those who love art because of the way it makes them feel. It can be a painting of a beautiful landscape, or a series of random colors on a canvas, but they love the feeling they get - the memories or dreams that are envoked - when they look at it. The art can be disturbing, but the emotion it envokes might still be a good one, such as overcoming a personal fear.The second type of art fan loves art for art's sake. A piece of art that does not evoke emotion is not quality art. It doesn't matter if that emotion is anger, resentment, fear, love, compassion, devotion, etc. As long as the art moves the viewer in some way, it is art. It doesn't matter if the art is ugly and repulsive.Those that gave the movie a good rating are art lovers of the second type. I am an art lover of the first type.This script makes no sense. Even for a sci-fi/fantasy movie, it makes no sense. It is not deep. It does not make you think. It's stupid.Oh, the people who love movies will say, ""You just don't 'get' it. It's over your head.

An undervalued gem,"I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, so no disrespect intended. But if this movie had his name as the director, instead of the relatively unknown Van Dormael, it would have certainly gathered a few Oscars.

However, by the end of the movie, it would be nice to find out what really happened in the hero's life.

Arduous and Intelligent At The Same Time,"I sat down to Mr. Nobody with the preconceived idea that it would a monotonous, philosophical narrative without much thought or purpose. I was half correct.While the images and artistic techniques displayed in Mr. Nobody are entrancing, they don't quite justify the length of the film. The first and last 15 minutes of the film are arguably the most intelligent portions of the movie, during which the viewer is asked philosophical questions that truly challenge everyday thinking. Sadly, however, the the greater part of the film is dominated by the unnecessary reiteration of these ideas.Indeed, I've never felt both compelled as a viewer yet at the same time utterly bored as I did with Mr. Nobody. At times I was entranced by the imagery and introspective thoughts put forward, but at others I found myself checking my watch and wondering to myself if the movie would ever end.The fundamental problem with this movie is not with its ideas but in its execution.

Tired of Hollywood junk, I was looking on IMDb for a more complex film and this one seemed for some reason good. Good is shrimps and lobster, this is just excellent. This is not entertainment like Hollywood blockbusters, this is a complex and mind blowing picture that may be at times hard to catch up, but extremely well directed, a fantastic script and good performances by the actors.

About choice,"I haven't viewed this film yet, but it intrigued me enough to purchase it, arriving in the next two weeks. From those reviewing it, one important story element is our ability to choose, and the consequences of our choices.From my experience, part of the human process is first desire, second fear, third control, and they become mixed up. Before seeing this film, reviews do not speak of existentialism, perhaps the philosophy most relevant to this story. So I give you the following regarding choice and existentialism, with a grain of salt, so to speak, for it is about philosophy, which is only a mirror and not perhaps to your personal taste.""Perhaps the most prominent theme in existentialist writing is that of choice. Humanity's primary distinction, in the view of most existentialists, is the freedom to choose. Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads. --Encarta Encyclopedia"" Why am I writing about a film before I've seen it?

we create our own reality......,"The film Mr.Nobody was very confusing in the beginning, skipping from one frame to another, one possibility of reality to another and you don't really see what's happening. However it is all done very beautifully and elegant. It focuses on this boy torn between his parents and has to make an important decision, go with his mother, or stay with his father.There was no set storyline as it is kind of the point, but a very powerful message that the film on a whole does manage to send is the repercussions of any decision. As you watch this film you sort of watch all of his decisions play out and what different versions of life he could have as a result of his decision at any given moment at any given time in his life. However I feel that this side is only just scratching the surface off what the true meaning is behind this film and there is in fact more depth to it than the importance of making decisions.However behind just the importance of decision making there is an idea presented by the film that these alterations and versions of his life is all as real as the other. It isn't necessarily how decision making can be very problematic but more of how all of the alternations already exist. When we see Nemo as an old man looking back at his life he remembers all of the different alterations and not just one set path, he even had the ability to talk to his younger self and alter his course of life. Nemo could affect what happens and will things to happen and that is a very important thing to think about.So what exactly does that mean, well I think it tears down what we see as time and space completely. Time is not a constant forward moving motion and what has happened can be reverted.There is not one moment but instead infinite moments in time which are happening at the same time with infinite possibilities. What is even more interesting is that we control that, we can decide for what we want and we don't live by the will of destiny or something. Not at all, but instead we will those things and happenings into existence, whether it's the fortunate moments or the misfortunes. Just as Nemo had the ability to change the course of his life, we too could create our own reality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
His So-Called Lives,"Do you look at all the possible choices before you, and figure they all have some appeal, but ultimately fatal flaws? Me too, and so I often cannot pass on streaming a video from Netflix and look for a book instead. There's something about the physical DVD's just showing up and then you have a commitment to spend your short life together (well, its short life aka running time.) When you stream you can so easily jump to another entirely different feature.So it was I chose to stream this movie. And I mostly stuck with it, for its visual lure. There's enough art direction to keep one's eyes fixed, and the story itself shuffles between alternate stream/dream/universes in the main character Nemo's life.But less is spent on any sci-fi angle, rather it allows triple the romance. Even more so, as some streams have their own branched rivulets in them.Thinking too much about the film deflates it I feel. Is Nemo == omen backwards or does it tie to a recurring death-by-water tarot card of sorts that pops up in the alterna-universes.Leto is good again, and helps carry the soul of the film. He's prettier than his three leading ladies. The too easily dismissed model minority model, the wounded bird that wounds others and then the love of his life, who pushes a modern taboo for blended families with benefits.Eminently watchable but ultimately ephemeral. Like our own lives? Well the voodoo Maori-esque hypnotist might have snuck into my subconscious. Nice work by Allan Corduner.I did find myself wondering if the writer/director wanted to set up something more contrasting immortality versus mortality, where the decisions to lead one to one's demise, but they do nonetheless lead one. He's named Mr. Nobody, but a world full of everlasting nobodies tunes in for this life story.Anyways, not as rewardingly twisted as ""Donnie Darko"" was for alienated adolescents of all ages, but time better spent than looking for old flames on Facebook, surely.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Loved It,"I finally had the opportunity to watch this incredible film where Jared Leto, once again, amazed me with his great acting abilities. Though I'm not usually one for the sci-fi genre, this movie was different in that it was exciting, sad, romantic, and REAL. The word ""real"" is very relative, but I feel it's appropriate here: Every individual character had a purpose, no matter how much they actually showed up in the movie. Leto's character development was absolutely beautiful and, as usual, his emotional connection was spot-on. The artistic aspect—both in the script and scene editing—is phenomenal as well. I would suggest this to people who like strange and inspirational plot lines with many unexpected twists and turns. To sum it up, it was great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Like an advert for  life assurance,"The style of photography, the close shots, the angles and the contrast are an early sign that the sensibility here is very close to advertising. At first the hyper real proximity of the image is interesting; as if, in Umberto Eco's view the perception of reality may reveal something beneath; but as the movie moves on and the rupture in the narrative becomes more glaring it is obvious that this is very bad writing and has no real sense of narrative logic or how to combine it with characterization.This film is all surface: the light, the glow and contrast of images and how lovely they look, like a fetishistic advertising campaign.The simpleness of the construction and the poverty of its ideas are present within the first act and therefore what ensues is not much more than the lame resolution of the basic premise. It has the smug contented appearance of an adverting campaign, as if all the focus group research confirmed that that what was shown has been preapproved.Play this movie at double speed on a DVD player and it is still perfectly comprehensible because there is absolutely no depth to the writing - it is all superficially obvious from the pictures.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

How to Rewrite a Previous Plot.,"Mr. Nobody is nothing special though Jared Keto does an excellent imitation of acting. Moreso the director, name also unimportant, does an excellent job of pretending to be a Director. Why?First off this movie immediately reminded me of one of the best movies ever and on my top list for Western fiction based on real history. That is Little Big Man starring Dustin Hoffman. Looking at Jared's old man is exactly the same as looking at Dustin's old man. All the liver spots, wrinkles, etc are the same. I'm pretty sure Mr. Nobody's director said, Make Jared look like Dustin. So no real imagination or work done there.More importantly while I like some of the concepts of dimensions and personally have espoused them for forty years now, I'm beginning to see them emerge into the debates and Ted Talk forums as interesting talking points. Unfortunately they are presented in this movie with all the elegance of a dancing pig. They are unconvincing ideas in Mr. Nobody because as a Hollywood movie they are mixed with all the entertainment trends that sell silly movies to the peons and uneducated masses. It's like throwing mud into a fine Swiss watch as Churchill said once. A real blended mess of confusion and ruining what could have been a more engrossing film built on these ideas from a more original and logical story line. From Forgotten Planet to Star trek to 2001: A Space Odyssey no stone was left unabused in this mess.If you wonder why I gave it six stars unlike the average reviews it's because if you're young and really don't know science fiction then you think this is good stuff. That is ignorance. If your up on scifi history, physics, philosophy and cultures of the past then you know I'm being overly generous with my rating of six.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Jared leto has a knack of picking offbeat scripts and he s bang on the money in choosing this one. What can I say...I think you should give this film a choice but beware that it is a bit heavy handed and clocking in at 2 and a half hours quite long to boot. However, for those who enjoy an offbeat tale this is a great 2 and a half hours of escapism into a fantasy land.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

This movie can not be explained but must be watched entirely.,The movie has a slow start and will confuse you like a Quentin Tarantino movie.

Does he go with his mother or his father? The boy has the ability to remember the future. He sees what his life would be like if he chooses his father and he sees what his life would be like if he chooses his mother. He sees many varying futures in both paths.

While gems like this, which is masterpiece by all means is rated at an ordinary 7.8.This film is all about exploring posibilities. And does it succesfully. It touches so many subjects without being preachy, it's almost unbelievable. First one hour may feel a little slow and unmoving, after that it's so enjoyable to watch. It's not about if the ending makes sense or not as the purpose is served before that. There are some questions unanswered, but it actually doesn't matter.There are films like The man from earth made with similar intentions.

A Philosophical Journey Through Life: The Deep and Inspiring Reflection of 'Mr. Nobody' and Schopenhauer's philosophy,"The film ""Mr. Nobody"" (2009) is a masterpiece of cinema that addresses the philosophy of existence in a profound and inspiring way. Directed by Jaco Van Dormael, the feature tells the story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who lives in a dystopian future and is the last mortal in a world where immortality is common.The film brings elements that directly refer to Schopenhauer's philosophy, especially with regard to the questioning of life and death, the transience of existence, and the illusion of individuality. The plot, which unfolds in different timelines, offers a unique perspective on life and its choices, and how they affect the trajectory of each individual.Just like Schopenhauer, who claimed that life is a constant search for satisfaction and that pain is inevitable, ""Mr. Nobody"" also exposes pain and suffering as an inevitable part of the human condition. However, the film also presents the beauty of life and the importance of living fully, even in the face of the unknown and the inevitable.Watching this film is a unique and transformative experience, which will certainly awaken your curiosity for Schopenhauer's philosophy and reflection on life and death. ""Mr. Nobody"" is an invitation to rethink our choices and values, and to appreciate every moment of life, even the most painful ones. I strongly recommend this film to everyone who wants a deep and inspiring reflection on human existence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Choices and consequences,"Every choice has a consequence and No consequence has a redo,but this movie dwells on what if?

I would strongly recommend this to audience who are looking for something different that provokes deep thought.Though this did not achieve much on gross domestically, as it was from a french director, i can certainly say this will be one of those movies that will remain in your thoughts for a while.Not just movies like Inception, Interstellar which are highly commercialized during the release but there are movies like this, The man from earth, wild things etc.. that really deserves huge attention and are worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Ambitious but Overly Convoluted: A Missed Opportunity for Depth,"While Mr. Nobody is often praised for its ambitious narrative and philosophical depth, I believe its 7.7 IMDb rating is somewhat inflated. In my opinion, the film aligns more with a 6.7 rating at best.The references to quantum physics and the exploration of alternate realities are intriguing in theory, but the execution feels overly detached from any relatable sense of realism. Some plot elements stretch beyond suspension of disbelief, venturing into territory that feels unnecessarily convoluted rather than thought-provoking.Midway through, the film loses its grip on coherence, making it difficult to stay engaged. The non-linear structure, while intended to be intellectually stimulating, instead comes off as disjointed and chaotic. Even by the end, piecing everything together feels more like a chore than a rewarding cinematic experience.While I appreciate the film's ambition, the complexity seems forced, sacrificing emotional connection for the sake of being enigmatic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Thought provoking,"""Every path is the right path. Everything could've been anything else.

Some were more joyous than others, some more depressing, some more heartfelt etc. While it is impossible to show all the possibilities, the movie did it best to show as much as possible in the time frame it had without getting too crammed up or rushed.Jared Leto plays the lead and gives a great performance, not surprisingly. And the accompanying cast also gives an almost universal good performance.The movie does have this 'Inception confusion' effect where different stuff happening at different times could confuse the viewer and in addition to that, the movie has this thick layer of coat containing philosophical questions, science theories etc that one could delve deep into searching for more meaning or whatever, but in the end, the core of the movie is rather simple.This movie really gripped me from the start and it didn't felt nearly as long as its 2 and half hour run-time.

What a ride!,"Wow, this movie kept me at the edge of the seat the entire 141 minutes. It's been a while since I wrote a review here, but this movie really deserves it.First I have to admit that I'm a fan of original movies which explores philosophical and psychological dilemmas/issues (Cube, Donnie Darko, Memento, Matrix to name a few). This movie really takes it a notch further with it's constant switching between numerous alternative chain of events so that you never know what to expect next. But the cutting is always done with finesse so somehow the scenes always fits together in a logical (or emotional) way (which may not be apparent until after wards). The cinematography is beautiful and really helps strengthen the story telling. The acting is top notch, especially Jared is great.I won't spoil to much of the story, but I recommend that you see this movie with an open mind, and don't try to make sense of everything that happens.

Beautiful but boring,"The past. Not an entity where variation tends to exist. What's done is done, right?

Nemo's details his past as a series of fragments. He recount them as if he were in fact choosing his past the way we choice our future.

As the laws of entropy take the universe further and further into a state of disarray what will happen when we hit maximum entropy? When total chaos bestills nothingness? Mr. Nobody is not exactly hot off the reels. It's a 2009 film that was on my must watch list. Despite so many awesome elements, the cinematic culmination of Mr. Nobody was rather disappointing. Mostly, the scenes tended to drag on. This was 100 minutes worth of great material stretched over the course of 155 minutes. Van Dormael should have taken a cue from his own philosophy and realize that if the Arrow moves only forward, and if I'm going to spend 155 minutes of my Arrow watching your film, I'd better be good.More film reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Listen. Nemo Nobody had become unstuck in time.,"I've seen the title of this film on so many ""Best of . . ."" lists I had to give it watch as soon as I ran across it.

It was King's English throughout. I've never seen so many beautiful big-eyed human beings together in one place. The story was good, the filming was intriguing, dare I say surrealistic? No, I won't because the point of the film is that all choices in life are the correct ones. No matter what reality we experience, if reality it is, it is the correct reality and we, every nan jack of us, are playing our part in the right way at the right time. Even so, it doesn't mean our time on stage will be fun. there is love and the heartbreak caused by same; the is life; there is disappointment; there is tragedy and madness and death. The film contained contained the themes that make life worth living unless the life is TOO good; then it's just a bore. I want my. last words to be, ""Today is the happiest day of my life!"" I hope I remember it at the right time and don't take too long to say it AND that there is some there to hear it. Is an uttered wisdom wise if there is no one to hear it?
I recommend Mr. Nobody even though I gave it a C+, six stars, because after two or three hours into the film I was ready for it to wrap things up but realized it was only half done.
This film is Billy Pilgrim meets Forrest Gump but that's not a bad thing as long as the director kept showing me interesting things and messing with my head. He got out of the groove an hour or so into the film but I was rooting for him to find it again and he did.
Nemo Nobody had a far better adolescence than I did. Good for him. The girls liked him and his terror of them was manageable, barely an inconvenience. I recommend Mr. Nobody to anyone with a bright mind willing to endure a bit of confusion to answer the question: What will happen next and is it really happening?",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
In a nutshell,"This movie is about life's choices. Or maybe it is about a senile old man who can't remember his life. No wait, it's about dropping LSD and having a bad trip that you just want to end!

Flawed near-masterpiece box office dud,"Beautifully directed, photographed, edited, and, mostly acted, ""Mr. Nobody"" is testimony to how even the best films prospects can be destroyed by horrendous marketing. While ""Mr. Nobody"" may be an accurate title, it is a horrible title for a movie of such scope and accomplishment. Perhaps the horrid title is why only a few US theaters played this movie, returning only a few thousand dollars on a film which cost $47M. Fortunately, streaming video makes it possible to see this flawed near-masterpiece. In fact, I saw the theatrical version as part of the Netflix streaming package; and the director's cut, which addresses all but one of what I consider ""flaws"" is available on Amazon streaming. My only criticism of both versions is the casting of Diane Kruger as the adult ""Anna"". Juno Temple, an adult actress who plays juvenile roles, is, again, world class, with the intensity needed for the pivotal ""Anna"". On the other hand, Diane Kruger, lacks both Ms. Temple's intensity and disproportionately large breasts, which makes it pretty hard to believe she is the same character. Better that Temple be aged with makeup or digitally. Nonetheless, ""Mr. Nobody"" emerges as one my Top 20 all-time favorite films. I give ""Mr. Nobody"" a ""9"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Exquisite,"You need to watch this film with the right mindset. It's themes are kind of similar to Inception, but they've been delivered in a much better way and the film has a lot more to it. you wouldn't watch inception after a long day at work though.That being said it's hands down the best film I've seen in years - It feels a little bit like everything inception could have been (in terms of the philosophical questions raised and general screwing with your mind a bit), but wasn't as Inception was designed for a much wider audience. In a similar way, because of the strong philosophical themes it has been left intentionally open to interpretation to an extent. Personally, I find this is part of the charm of the film. If you're expecting an absolute ending that's tied up with a little bow you will be disappointed.It looks at the way choices can affect your life and follows Nemos thought process at different points of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Imaginative and Engaging,"Mr. Nobody is the type of movie that sticks with you for a bit after watching it, and a number of factors go into that. Jared Leto's stellar performance, the unique (and at times confusing) premise, and the stories told throughout are just some of the highlights.The film opens in the year 2092, as 118 year old Nemo Nobody is the last living mortal on earth. As he nears death, he is asked to recall his life, and what follows is a jumbled recollection of seemingly contradicting accounts of what may or may not have happened in his life, focusing largely on Nemo at ages 9, 15, and 34. At first, the contradictions can be extremely confusing to the viewers (as well as those interviewing 118 year old Nemo), but before long you learn to accept it as a part of the movie's commentary on the impact the choices we make can have on our lives, and by the end of the movie, one can make sense of the contradictions.Ultimately, Mr. Nobody is anchored by outstanding performances by Jared Leto, Toby Regbo, and Juno Temple, while the rest of the cast contributes performances that range from good to great. Clocking in at a little under two and a half hours, this film demands your attention with multiple gripping story lines involving drama, romance, coming of age themes, and some subtle science fiction. I would not recommend this movie to those who need to understand exactly what is going on at every point in a movie, but I would highly recommend it to everybody else (keeping the R rating in mind), especially those who enjoy a good mind bender.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Sci-fi effects,"Hard to believe that even in 2092 everybody in the world would have become immortal, even those living in isolated or indigenous communities, those existing as technophobes, or those that just didn't agree; far-fetched. It's kind of an all or nothing philosophy. Must say, too, it felt that some ideas were taken from 2001: A Space Odyssey or from The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.The movie was in the genre of a relatively early sci-fi/fantasy able to work extensively with imagery and changes in scenery, kind of like a 60's-70's film with 2000's cinematography. It feels like its creation worked for the effect rather than for the story. Mr. Nobody had effect, some of it rather grand, but still just spinning mind notes, and not the greatest story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
highly recommended,Mr. Nobody is an amazing and varied movie.It's not like all the other movies I've seen before where you can already guess how it's going to end.It's unpredictable and totally worth watching.In the first 20 minutes I thought about switching it off but then it got better and better.I really like Jared Leto as an actor and I think he did a great job in playing Nemo.The soundtrack is nice too.

A Wonderful Experience,"A filmmaker once said ""we don't go to the movies to think we go there to feel"", i gotta say that's so true only in this film it makes you both feel and think at the same time. I won't be going to say anything about the plot because if i start to talk about it i'll never finish, but this film can really make you think about a lot of things through it's themes like Love, death, destiny...in fact it makes you think of life itself. technically the film is a visual masterpiece, it's a near perfect film from writing to editing (oscar snub), to acting except for Dane Kruger's heavy German accent but she's hot so who cares ending up with directing which shows us how a project done with so much passion can be. if you think the movie is confusing, which it really is in the first 30 minutes or so, you're wrong there's an answer to everything in the end. overall a very good movie, it's emotional and visually stunning.My Rating: 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Another great masterpiece from Dormael,"Again Dormael tells another life-long story about destiny, love and the choices we make trying for happiness and that clearly tear us apart from that very happiness.As in all Dormael's movies there is a moment in childhood where the loss of innocence dictates your vision of life, your way of seeing things and therefore the choices you make. And every choice leads you further and further away form that golden age of childhood innocence.In Dormael's movies the soundtrack clearly illustrates that notion. Cheerful music for the childhood scenes.He also implies that the use of fiction as a way of escaping reality and even trying to change it. all of this is, obviously, unfruitful.Most of the reviews for this movie that are not good come from people that either looked at the big argument of the movie or followed the small episodes, not understanding that both are vital and should be understood as a whole.For those that like this movie: check out Dormael's great Toto, Le Heros - the story of a guy who lives his whole live with the certainty that he was swapped as a child and he should be living someone else's life instead.

Billed as a sci-fi but existentialist to the core,"After watching ""Mr Nobody"", I was in a bit of a daze. The story is complex to say the least but the characters and the ideas (of which there are many) kept me intrigued. I found myself thinking on the various subjects that the film touches on as the movie played out. By the end I was left with compelling and contradictory ideas that left me perplexed but I can honestly say it was worth every minute and for this simple reason ..at its core ""Mr Nobody"" is about love and the almost impossible choices that we have to make. It is existentialist to its core and touches on string theory, quantum theory, (but in an easy to understand way) and the consequences of the choices we make. And yet after thinking on the movie as a whole, it is about intense pain ..being torn between two loves and having to choose. As a movie, the directing is very very good, the acting very good and the cinematography is excellent. I'd highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best films ever!,"Recently I have watched the movie Mr. Nobody, and probably never had so many feelings and emotions after watching films. If you are bored of watching all these similar and easy predictable movies then this one is for you. From the beginning you understand that the movie is original and unusual. Nemo Nobody wakes up in 2092 as an old man, who became a participant of a TV-Show ""Last Mortal"" that is watched by immortal and already unfeeling people of the future. In his interview he tells the story of his life, well three its variants. On the question which of them was the right one he says ""Every path is the right path"". The film made me think about many things, especially how strong a little thing can change the entire life, and how often we have to make choices. But ""As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible"". The movie might seem to be unclear and strange, but this makes the film so great. However, when you are watching the end, everything becomes more understandable and you start thinking about everything you have just seen. I recommend to spend two hours of your time and watch this great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Excellent film, great mix of apt filmmaking, artistic vision and metaphysics","This is a n excellent film. As we first started watching it, I must admit, I was somewhat skeptical given the title. I thought this would be another ""artsy"" mambo-jumbo where a self-indulgent indie director who just happened to finish a book by Hugo has taken upon him/herself to educate the masses on their pathetic, meaningless everyday lives (preferably set in suburbia). Boy, was I wrong! And so glad I was. 20 minutes into it, having watched the early life sequence, I was fully submerged. It wasn't just the story - the set, colors, music, camera, scene pacing - all came together beautifully to convey the deep philosophical and artistic vision of the director. This is undoubtedly the ""director's film"". It is one of those films, which is hard, if not impossible to retell, and once watched, makes the viewer to watch it again, and again, enjoying every single scene. This is a director's film and of a capable one. Bravo!The only downside (and given the nature of the story a minor one) is weak acting by Leto. I've never been a big fan of this actor, and maybe unjustly so, but his youthful innocence sprayed all over the screen really doesn't fit the story well. This is a minor bump though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Philosophy and science fiction poorly examined!,"A very incoherent and unusual experience. Unfortunately interesting visuals and cinematography doesn't make up for a movie which doesn't hold our interest as this was one of the most boring experiences I ever had. I tried my best to focus on the weird events and connect with the characters but this just doesn't happen. There are multiple time lines and life possibilities for the main character which are individually not that interesting. As soon as you somehow get track of what's happening in one time line the director just throws you in another meaningless direction which follows the main character until his death. At the end the message I got was ""Our life is the sum of the choices we make"". There is no problem with the message but the way we got there is totally unappealing. It may also discuss philosophical ideas such as ""What would you make if you knew the outcome of a certain action?"" but in the end it's just not worth the journey. The big bang and crunch were for me the most interesting aspects of the movie but they didn't seem to correlate to the main character in any way other than that he knew when the big crunch was going to happen. Strangely enough ""It will bring order in our messed up ever-expanding life!"". I would rather have these theories examined from a religious point of view. As a consequence of our choices and actions we will be then judged and either rewarded or punished without relating to any religion in particular. In conclusion, the movie had a lot of potential in its basic premise, visuals and cinematography but wasted it all mainly on a boring unfocused love story and mixing elements which does not correlate to each other in any meaningful way.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Incredible Script, Brilliant Direction","Everything happened and yet nothing happened. And what exactly happened is what I wonder!!!The whole story, as it went on, was just marvelous. First of all, I must give credit to Jaco Van Dormael for not only writing this great compilation of stories for the movie but also Directing it so brilliantly. It was just, Wow!With so much of inter linkages between so many stories with the same characters, it was sometime just beyond imagination as to figure out what's actually going on. The movie has a character from future and his way past youth life, a triangular love story between lead character Nemo and 'Anna, Elise and Jean', not to mention it also portraits the possibility of human life at Mars after so many years.One of the fascinating futuristic, funny, unbelievable line from the 118 years older Nemo was ""Before sex became obsolete?"". Now, you can immerse yourself in imaginations of human future with no s**.Well, I hated one character from the movie - Elise, crazy character, what a bore! One more thing to mention from the movie is - it shows a lot of teenage love and adultery too.Above all, you'll have to keep your eyes fixed on the movie, coz it's very interesting, I truly enjoyed the movie, and I'm sure you will too.A must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Mr Nobody is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am an avid Jared Leto fan and have seen almost every movie he's been in from Basil to Lord of War and I have to say Mr. Nobody is probably my favorite. The movie shows that one decision can change your entire life and that no matter what you do there will be a consequence. Jared was the perfect fit for Nemo Nobody and I can't wait to see it in theaters on September 26th! It all begins with the divorce of Nemo's parents. Soon it escalates to the woman he will marry. Will it be Jeanne, Elise, or Anna? Then it becomes how he will live his life and how it will end. The results may kill him or help him find out who he really was. The story is difficult to understand because it is told by Nemo when he is 118 years old and the last human alive. He has a hard time remembering what happened when he was younger. But the moral of the story is thought provoking and may just make you think harder about your life along with how you're living it.

There was no explanations why the characters did what they did or what all the symbolic things meant. It felt like watching some kind of non ending dream sequins that had no tie to reality at all. Don't watch this, even if you are a fan of Sci-Fi/Futuristic films. This is just so far beyond ""arty"" its not even funny.

Definitely worth watching,"This movie might not be perfect, but it is intellectually stimulating, visually stunning, moving and incredibly rich.In fact, that might be its main problem: there are enough ideas in this movie to make two or three. But if you enjoy complexity, this is a movie you should watch.It is difficult to summarize it. To start with, it is a movie on chance (the famous ""butterfly effect""), on the impact of decisions on our lives (the old ""what if?"" idea, say, à la Sliding doors, but taken to an entirely different level of complexity), on the fascinating idea that there might be persons, events, which are bound to form part of our lives whichever choices we make, and on the tension between the fear, and the beauty, of not knowing what's coming next. Linked to all this is the fear of making decisions, any decision, since they rule out certain possibilities forever. Is it preferable not to chose (and ultimately, not live) or are all possible lives equally ""right""?It is an extremely complex work. The sub-plots multiply and there comes an intriguing challenge – is there one logical explanation for all, or are there elements of deliberate irrationality? I am inclined towards for the first option but I might need to watch it a third time (at least) to come to a conclusion.The images are beautiful. The colors are rich, there is plenty of symbolism and small details which might escape the first time one watches it. The camera dives into the protagonists' eyes with a quasi-hypnotic effect, the depth and emotions that they convey are rarely seen in movies.I should mention the cast, overall very convincing. The actors who portray the characters at different ages have been exquisitely chosen. Again, it's the eyes – you can really recognize the young Anna in the older one. And the same goes for Nemo. My highest praise goes to Toby Regbo and Juno Temple, and the way the director has shot their teenagers' love scene. I had never seen a movie depicting in such a vivid and loving way the marvel of love at that age. I am still in awe. Sarah Polley was also excellent in portraying the character of a depressive woman (or most probably she's affected by bipolar disorder). She was so convincing that at times she made me shiver.This is a movie that will make you think for a while. It might all sound very ""heavy"" but you will leave the cinema with a smile on your face.

"""What have we done to deserve any of this?""","To answer a few of the questions that are out there.1.Is this movie just a collection of random things?No.2.Does this movie have a proper story with a beginning and an end?Yes, most definitely.3.Is it actually trying to say something?Yes, but you might not want to listen, because it's kind of depressing. People usually don't like sad things.4.Is it just like those quote-unquote actually good movies that play with realities and use unreliable narrators in surreal scenarios like ESOTSM, ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Waking life"" and others? (I also like these three)Yes, just like ""The illusionist"" and ""Prestige"" are basically the same.Just because they're similar conceptually (very broadly speaking) doesn't mean they're the same. It's still a completely different story.The movie is neither a really deep philosophical one nor is it meant to be a hardcore scifi in the generic sense. It wasn't meant to be a study into the problem of choice in a deterministic reality and even if it was supposed to be something like that, i don't think that's the reason why you should watch it.I think what it is about is the regret of living a single life. We are bound in these decaying bodies for a brief period of consciousness and nothing that we experience we can completely trust to be real, whatever that means, but we just seem to go with it because why not!""Life for all it's anguish is ours, Miss Ives""(Penny Dreadful Season 3)If there is free will and our actions truly determine the course of our lives the question that the movie asks is which choice is the right choice? It's asking the question which life is the right one. The answer it gets eventually is way too simple. In a way it's not even an answer at all, which is painfully annoying. But i think i can understand because it is the sort of question that has no right answer. It's something that you can't really do much about except find a way to live with and that it helps us do.So basically for the majority audience, you are about to be introduced to a sorrow that wasn't there before but they'll also give you a way to live with it so i guess it's all fine in the end.To watch this movie is a choice just like any other. Whether you willingly make that choice, whether that choice is made for you by a God or the invisible forces of nature, or whether it is a random outcome out of the infinitely many possibilities that could have happened or did happen, the choice is still there. Even if it has already been made for you, it had to be made.The story is intriguing, the visuals are captivating, the characters are complex and nothing is there just because.

Unforgettable Journey: 10 Stars Theatrical Experience,"In the realm of cinematic artistry, there are certain films that can only be described as masterpieces, and ""Mr Nobody"" undoubtedly falls into this category. This Franco-American film, directed by Jaco Van Dormael, exhibits a plethora of outstanding elements, including the quality of the photography, the exquisite production by Pathé!, the impeccable acting skills of Jared Leto and the co-stars, the brilliant screenplay, and the director's unique vision which incorporates elements of Luis Buñuel and concepts borrowed from Henry Schwarz in the field of astrophysics.First and foremost, the cinematography in ""Mr Nobody"" is nothing short of breathtaking. The visual aesthetics of each frame are meticulously crafted, showcasing a harmonious blend of artistic composition and technical expertise. The skilled camera work and use of lighting create a mesmerizing visual tapestry that enhances the storytelling and immerses the audience in the narrative. From the ethereal beauty of the film's dream sequences to the gritty realism of its dystopian future, every shot is a visual feast for the eyes.Furthermore, the production of ""Mr Nobody"" is a testament to the excellence of Pathé! The attention to detail in every aspect of the film's design is outstanding. From the elaborate costumes to the meticulously designed sets, every element contributes to the overall ambiance and authenticity of the story. The production team's ability to seamlessly transport the audience to different time periods and alternate realities is truly remarkable.One cannot discuss ""Mr Nobody"" without acknowledging the extraordinary acting performances. Jared Leto, known for his transformative roles, delivers yet another tour de force performance as the eponymous character. Leto effortlessly portrays the complexities and nuances of Nemo Nobody's multiple realities, ranging from a vulnerable young boy to an aged man reflecting on a life filled with regret. The co-stars also deserve praise for their captivating performances, which add depth and emotional resonance to the narrative.The screenplay of ""Mr Nobody"" is a masterpiece in itself. The intricately woven story explores profound philosophical questions about the nature of choice and the impact of decisions in one's life. Jaco Van Dormael's writing is thought-provoking and poetic, often blurring the boundaries between realities to create a mesmerizing and profound narrative experience. The non-linear structure of the film, which traverses multiple timelines and alternate realities, challenges the viewer's perception of time and adds an extra layer of depth and complexity to the story.Moreover, Van Dormael's direction in ""Mr Nobody"" is nothing short of brilliant. Inspired by the works of the surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel, he seamlessly blends fantasy and reality to create a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating film. The director's bold choices and unconventional storytelling techniques elevate the film to new heights, pushing the boundaries of traditional filmmaking.In addition to the influences of Buñuel, ""Mr Nobody"" incorporates concepts borrowed from Henry Schwarz in the field of astrophysics. The film explores the idea of the multiverse, where every decision creates a separate reality, branching off into infinite possibilities. This scientific concept intertwines with the existential themes explored throughout the film, further deepening the thought-provoking nature of the narrative.In conclusion, ""Mr Nobody"" is a true masterpiece of Franco-American cinema. It excels in every aspect, from the exceptional photography and production design to the stellar acting performances and the profound screenplay.

Last Year at Marienbad meets Little Big Man,"This is an incredible film in that it portrays different timelines in a coherent fashion.

Both are love stories that don't require analysis.On another level it is like ""Little Big Man"" with an ancient man telling of things that maybe happened or perhaps occurred in an imagination.

Feels different every time I watch,"When I first saw this it was great experience and well felt but I failed to understand a lot of what was being shown.

I just watched it a fourth time and I found things I had still completely missed. Unbelievable movie. I feel like I'm lucky and cursed to have seen it. I'm interested with a lot of the topics that this film highlights. Maybe that's why it hits so hard every time I watch. This movie isn't for everyone but if you like this sort of thing you will love it. It's a bit of a puzzle, it's not easy to understand completely and so it takes focus to feel the whole thing. It felt like Cloud Atlas with a taste of Wes Anderson's Moon Rise Kingdom's visuals. All that mixed with that hard burn and crush feeling of Gattaca. But, The Gattca emotional crush is not just the end but sprinkled throughout the whole movie. The ending seals it all up. Normally i dislike dream sequence's. This movie feels like it does and doesn't contain dream sequences and it's so well blended my mind skips over any prejudice to them if they are there. If you only watch this once and are not ready for it or distracted, you won't get it. It's a trip not a movie. It's not flash bang and spoon fed. It doesn't make you pay attention, you have to pay attention to it. If you don't go all in and allow your mind to just experience it all, you will miss out.

"""As long as you do not choose, everything remains possible. ""","Mr. Nobody is a movie "" sci-fi"" which I think is not intended to be a sci-fi movie. Well , the film is directed by Jaco van Dormael , a Belgian director who is actually (just like Richard Kelly, director Donnie Darko), in my opinion, can always release a "" one-hit wonder"". In addition, the film is also filled by a unique cast-full of variations and as if random; starting from the 30 Seconds to Mars vocalist Jared Leto, who desperately deserve the main role as Nemo Nobody, and Diane Kruger as Anna, her true love Nemo,. Judging from the cast- it is somewhat random, but apparently there is a purpose behind it all.Nemo narrates a voyage through several permutations of his life, following alternate paths. He chooses to grow up with each of his divorcing parents (Natasha Little and Rhys Ifans); has three separate and mutually canceling lifelong romances (Juno Temple grows into Diane Kruger; Clare Stone becomes Sarah Polley; Audrey Giacomini becomes Linh Dam Pham); and experiences various brushes with death. As if the Cloud Atlas-level juggling act weren't enough, Belgian writer-director Jaco Van Dormael throws in a hypnosis conceit and, courtesy of Nemo's sometime work as a writer, fiction within the fiction. In one iteration, Nemo appears as a TV scientist who lectures on string theory and entropy. The character's name alludes to both Jules Verne and The Odyssey, but Mr. Nobody's expansive literary ambitions turn out to have a powerful ordering principle: sentimentality.Well, in outline, Mr. Nobody actually tells about probability and parallel timeline . Wait! The outline was withdrawn by ignoring the final conclusion of the film. The plot in this movie actually does not start at the beginning of the movie, but after entering the teenage. It is said that Nemo Nobody's life was filled with choices, even since he was still not born. Because of "" Butterfly Effect"" , Nemo was finally born in all choices and probabilities. Nemo himself said, "" It's hard to choose, "" but eventually he came to his own conclusion, ""As long as you do not choose, everything remains possible.

"Plot less, pointless mess","The only thing that's even remotely interesting in this film is the premise, and the synopsis you might read on the back cover. Everything else it throws at you fails miserably. There is no coherent plot to speak of throughout the whole 2something hours of artsy advertising editing and camera focus tricks. After the first half hour, you might be fooled that there is some deeper meaning to the whole thing but you'll get some pop science theories thrown in just for the sake of it. The dialog is completely useless. There is not a single even semi-important bit of information that is carried by dialog here. You'd think the director would then rely on strong images but no. All the storytelling is left to annoying editing and even more annoying musical selection. Sorry, but you're not Basil Poledouris and your cues and tunes cannot carry a poorly thought out film. The underlying idea that this mess is trying to convey is the ramification of choice -- which is really just an excuse to cram in a multitude of superficial main and supporting characters instead of fewer meaningful ones. Contrary to what some might believe, not having a plot and/or solid characterization does not make a film more alternative or intelligent. It just makes it barely watchable. The only thing worth seeing here is the actresses, who are all excellent.

Overlooked gem!,"Without doubt, one of my most favourite movies of all time.I love a good movie that screws with your mind (The Game, Primer, Cube, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Mulholland Drive, Identity etc.) where the movie you think you're seeing becomes something else entirely. Mr. Nobody is one of those films.Part sci-fi, part romance, part thriller, part comedy, the film ruminates on the old multiverse theory, that a single decision by an individual, creates multiple parallel universes where the alternative outcomes are selected. Of course, this idea from quantum physics, has been used before in many other sci-fi movies, but not like this.Describing the plot is a bit of a challenge, as there are so many threads to this movie, right off the bat. Mr. Nobody is a man who is conscious of the other universes where certain key decisions of his life are all played out, and he seems to jump between them. The main one, however, is set in a future utopia, where he is the oldest human & will be the last human to ever die. - Actually, that description is pretty weak.How about comparing it with other movies? Well, I guess this would be a bit like a mash-up of Cloud Atlas, the Fifth Element and The Butterfly Effect, but co-directed by Darren Aaronofsky and Michel Gondry with Terry Gilliam and Wes Anderson on hand......but even that does not do the movie justice.The movie will be polarising. It has a lot of great ideas, and is cerebral one minute, goofy the next minute, and tragic the next. - If you enjoy or appreciate any of the movies I've mentioned in this review, you should enjoy Mr. Nobody...and if you still don't think you understand what the movie is about after reading these reviews, I would highly recommend just watching it anyway!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

What would have my life been like if I hadn't have said something inappropriate?

Indescribable ambition,"Ever see a film that you actually can't really, properly describe to someone? You often hear ""it's hard to describe"", but you know those ones where you really do find yourself short of a five second cocktail party summary, left with nothing to compare it to and no way to impart the contents in quick, succinct jargon? Jaco Van Dormael's Mr. Nobody is exactly that type of film, an experience so dense, disorienting and thought provoking that one needs at least a few months after the initial viewing alone to ruminate, mull it over and meditate on what was seen before even a word of analysis is offered. On surface level it's about a man named Nemo Nobody, played by Jared Leto in a jaw dropping, multifaceted encore of a performance. Nemo is over a hundred years old, the last mortal on an earth of now immortal humans, and he recounts his life, or many lives, rather, to a journalist. That's the diving board that vaults into an intricate narrative full of love, grief, joy, tragedy and the peculiarities of being human. We see Nemo at hundreds of junctures of his life, penultimate crossroads where he could make either choice, but if he makes neither of them, can then see both outcomes, how they carry forward his trajectory into the future towards more crossroads, more lives, more decisions, like the infinitely branching tributaries of an ever flowing river. How would one make a film like this work onscreen, you ask? Well, not easily. The thing runs almost three hours and often gets a little caught up in itself, especially in the midsection, but it's sheer ambition and uniquely structured storytelling carry it on wings of light, spanning through a hundred years and countless events that Nemo sees passing. He has three loves, or at least three the film focuses on: luminous Ana, played by an excellent Juno Temple and then Diane Kruger as she gets older, mentally unstable Elise (Sarah Polley) and Jean (Linh Dan Pham), all of whom help shape him or have key parts to play along the branches of his tree of life. There's a lynchpin event from his youth upon which it all hinges though; faced with the decision to move away with his mother (Natasha Little) as her train leaves, or stay behind with his father (Rhys Ifans), the boy begins to run, but also looks back. This nano-moment is the key to eternity here, the introspective Big Bang that gives way to our story. At times the film lags, and the slack could have been pulled tighter during the development of the three relationships, but the first and third acts that bookend the whole thing move along like the forces unseen around us, using cinematic tools to compose a symphony of motion, music, scientific pondering and emotional resonance. No other film is like this one, and my attempts to describe it above still just don't even scratch the surface of the dreams found within its runtime. There's only a few other ones out there that have aspirations as cosmic as this one, and most, including this, have made it into my personal canon of favourites. Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain, The Wachowski's Cloud Atlas and Terence Malick's Tree Of Life are such films, and Mr. Nobody now sits at their table.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Incredible movie about life choices,"A wonderful film that talks about various life decisions and where it can all take us. We follow the life, or rather the lives, of a gentleman with the striking name Nemo Nobody. Every decision in life creates a new reality because when we make a decision then it's over, we can't go back. The reason lies in our fourth dimension which we don't really understand to the end, and that is time. A dimension that flows linearly without stopping. We can imagine it as driving a car and when we get to one intersection we have to choose where to turn however when we choose then it is definite, we cannot go back and choose again but live with our decision. Unlike time, the film does not follow a linear action, but constantly jumps back and forth, and all the realities we see in the film are also intertwined. The plot of the film actually begins at the very end as the said Mr. Nemo is over a hundred years old and is very close to his death. A very unusual film because of the theme and the way the story is told, however, I was thrilled by both. Attention is sought precisely because of the frequent change of reality caused by a decision, but it was not too difficult for me to follow. Also the film contains a certain percentage of art style which I don't normally like to watch in the film because then I don't know what the director wanted to say or I get the impression that style is more important than the content. This time I had no problem with it because it was within normal limits for my taste. A small complaint goes towards the number of realities, I got the impression that we may have too many of them in the film so I can't get all of the importance.
Why is it so hard to decide? Well precisely because we have to live with our choice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Making you think about incarnation, nature of time and immortality and the end of the universe","Great movie to see if you like to ponder or speculate about why we came here and what we are doing here in our physical bodies. Even the Extended Director's Cut is quite long, it is never boring, and you always want to know what is coming next. Several aspects of this story suggest that time is not just linear, but actually fluid. The happenings usually going forwards can in this story told by an old man run simultaneously and even go backwards. The incarnation to our planet is portrayed the way known to many metaphysical and spiritual travelers. We are coming here with erased memories of our origin or our previous incarnation (you choose which one). The erasing in the movie is executed in a wonderful scene by ""angels of oblivion."" Choosing of our parents when incarnating is portrayed beautifully as well. I liked dying being portrayed with rather chaotic scenes in parallel understanding of time, when everything happens on the same time in a dying physical brain. Filmmakers usually portray it as a sequence of chosen memories, what is rather wishful thinking. The movie very courageously touches possibility of reversing global time and ensuing start of what is known as the Big Crunch (opposite of the Big Bang). That might happen when evil overcomes good. The shrinking of everything and reversal of time portrayed in the impressive scene of melting city buildings can happen slowly like current accelerating expansion of our universe, but also quickly as the Big Bang happened. Then pondering about immortality will lose any meaning. Anyway, would you really want to be physically immortal? I don't.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

It's one of those films that makes me ponder the choices I've made in life and what my life could have been taking different paths at different stages. I was impressed with Leto in this one. He needed a lot of range to pull off as many different alternate realities and I thought he did a great job.

"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this deserves one...","""Mr. Nobody"" - well, the title is admittedly a little strange, but this movie will appeal to the more open-minded moviegoer, in the first place. This is by far the best film (yes, a piece like this is definitely more than just a movie) I've seen in a long while. It might not be officially classified as an epic, but I personally would disagree. ""Mr. Nobody"" has all the hallmarks of a wonderful film wrapped in a unique package, and yet, it's extremely hard to explain basic plot lines in this story. Therefore, I will go big picture, and just say this: ""Mr. Nobody"" is about life, and time, and all the choices we make, or don't make. Broad? You bet. But it's the only way to properly discuss this film (which also features a great and eclectic soundtrack).In short, I would say that this is a bit of a mashup between ""Okja"", and the early work of Tim Burton (circa Edward Scissorhands, 1990), but the ideas and concepts it explores are all its own. The colors are vivid, the cinematography is well done, and the character development (though there are many characters and plotlines, included in a mostly non-linear fashion) is absolutely spot-on. Honestly, I don't know if I've ever watched a more original film. I do recommend, however, the following tips when watching:*This is a film that truly deserves your attention. Keep the distractions to a minimum for the best experience (even though you'll want to watch it over again once you finish)*Watch this with at least one person, if possible.This is literally the best movie I've watched so far this year.

#1 Mindbending film,"If anyone ask me about Mindbending film, I would prefer Mr Nobody more than inception. First of all this movie is so underrated. It has really unique concept. I believe there are two possible way to reach our destination, first by luck and second is by choice. And this movie explore every possible way if our life is about by choice. This movie explores every choices of our main lead by parallel worlds. Some people told this movie is most complex, but actually this movie is not that much. In terms of complex, I would prefer Cloud Atlas movie, that movie is most complex for me. Come back to this movie, I believe in a way, maybe our universe works like this way, maybe parallel worlds are possible, maybe every decision we made, it creates a possible parallel world. So this movie is unique and so cool. In the end, it also gives a hint of big bang. And for me this movie is the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Complex but very moving,"To prefice this review I will say this is a very psychological movie. It makes you think and has a complex meaning behind it. If you don't like these types of movies you will ultimately hate it. However I really loved it and heres why.The cast and characters are really great! Some are very bizzare, sweet, and 100% interesting. Jared leto is perfect for playing nemo (interesting fact nemo means nobody in Latin!) You get very intrigued and involved in Nemo and ultimately wanting him to succeed in this somewhat tragic story.The cinematography in this is the best I've ever seen. They have multiple scenes that blow my mind as to how they accomplished it! One scene the camera follows him to the mirror and you can't see the camera than it zooms in a becomes the mirror than follows him out! How the heck they did this i will never know! Another scene they follow a single rain droplet from the clouds all the way to a street and to Nemo. Absolutely amazing.This is not a popcorn movie by any means and you really have to pay attention but once you do you are totally emersed in the characters and plot. The ideology behind this film is really great, without spoiling its about finding your way and the anxiety/consequences of your actions. This plot is really interesting but also very unique and different which may be distasteful to some people. It doesn't have one major plot but more like a major idea and several different sub plots. There is different romances but one that really tugs your heartstrings. I did however get slightly confused by the end and had to watch a explanation video. But ultimately I really fell in love with the story and with the relationship he has with Anna! I literally cried twice during this movie.Summary:
This is a very unique and bizzare movie but done extremely well imo. If you like thinking and romance movies than you should love this!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Mr. Nobody had the material, and cinematography to be one of the best films in history. The story is rich with flavor, the acting is staggering, however, there were many confusing unnecessary scenes.

I watched Mr. Nobody.,"A sci-fi movie which is a quasi comedy and partially serious mind bendy movie. It's about a world where everybody has ""quasi-immortality due to their stem cell-compatible pigs and telomerization"" and there's this one guy named Nemo who is the last person to not to be ""telomerized"" at the same time as being denial of his actual age and conflicted about who he is and what is real.
So a lot of media attention is on him. Through a lot of the movie, he is being interviewed by a phycologist who wants to help him to live and understand who he really is since has got so many paradoxes of the same memories.

Nemo Nobody, a special kid, is faced with a difficult choice that can influence his future in a number of ways.This idea however wouldn't have been properly developed without an emotional script and amazing directing skills, those of Jaco van Dormael. There is also a number of brilliant performances from the likes of Jared Leto, Diane Kruger, Rhys Ifans and Sarah Polley (who was outstanding, in my opinion).I recommend this movie to anyone who is tired of all the box office hits there are these days.

"""Mr. Nobody"" is a movie like no other","Undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time, ""Mr. Nobody"" is a movie like no other.

Why did I like this movie so much? The film is shot incredibly beautifully, the performance of the actors is a special pleasure, especially Jared Leto, who plays the hero Nemo at the age of 35 and 118 years old. The soundtrack and non-original songs that accompanied the movie are perfect. And finally, from a technical point of view, thanks to a very creative editing, we can see a picture that is very pleasing to one's eye.The film is complex, opens up a lot of readings and gives rise to many questions that need to be watched, reviewed and commented on.If you're a movie buff looking for a fresh human story, you should definitely watch this film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

A Transcendental experience,"With the director's cut clocking at around 150 minutes, this film never felt long. Mr. Nobody is a puzzle, a moving puzzle with dreamlike imagery and astonishing visuals. This film is certainly not one for the those who demand mindless entertainment as its a profoundly moving journey.Ever feel like how different your life would have taken a different choice? This film moves along alternate timelines, every timeline is a result of a different choice. Each choice is difficult and life changing. A boy has to choose between his mother and father. We get a glimpse of how his life would have been for every tough choice he makes. A glimpse of how tough life is, we learn no choice is a bad choice.

But which are the 3 primary colours?,"Did anyone feel like they were getting sucked into Aronofsky's 'The Fountain' (which I HATED) but for an incomparably better experience??I think that I am not un/consciously doing: Aronofsky : 'Requim . . .' : Jared Leto : Mr. Nobody.It felt like the pace, texture, colour, aural aesthetic and maybe a 9th other dimension was being engaged, to correct the wrongs of 'The Fountain'. I had waited as much for any film ever for 'The Fountain', after 'PI' and 'Requiem . . .', and it was also the biggest disappointment ever. Clichéd drivel, horribly boring and sentimental but . . . for what. HOWEVER, this felt like the extremely well made, seemingly obscure but not so much, exquisitely beautiful to look at exploration of love and loss that 'The Fountain' wanted to be.What are the 3 primary colours?A great, pretty little trick, putting the 3 girls in those colours :) BUT WHICH 3? Thanks to this film I went to learn that there are an ""additive"" and ""subtractive"" 3! Primary colours particularly for video!It was such a great film in its attention to detail. I don't get off if a Director is showing off. Even ""similar"" films I like seem to be a LITTLE pretentious, ('Synecdoche' for example). But here the Director seemed to want to give us LOTS of little and playful pieces, witty and even WOW transitions, it was SO playful. And in THAT sense I agree with a review that it was like nothing else. (I have already made reference, and otherwise, it felt a LOT like a few other films). For my money, Jeunet/ Caro, 'Amelie' (would be the most famous) was pretty good & I liked it, but it seemed a little obsessed with ""faking the childish wonder"" in things, drivel in many ways, and again, more contrived than Mr. Nobody. (BUT, NO comparisons to 'Delicatessen', no no). Mr. Nobody is the only one of these that didn't need to cut 10 or so minutes, (except, again, how long was 'The Fountain'? :) Time wise, Mr. Nobody comes after all those comparisons, so of course the Director has that in his favour . . . ENOUGH!Does anyone agree or care that the Asian girl (wife?) was as good as non existent to him? Would that be a parallel to the way Asians have (are) objectified by Europe and the USA as though not even humans? Which I believe is different to the racism with Blacks - IE. unconsciously, anti-black racism comes from inferiority complex/es, including if not particularly, physical ideas of perfection, penis size, etc. Write that off if you will, but you are wrong - once people are not starving, predominantly, sexual impulses will reign supreme in one way or another. Dave's example - what is the most marginalised sexuality? : Bi? Lesbian? Trans? . . . NO! Asexuality, fools.

Mr Nobody vs. The Butterfly Effect: A philosophical journey vs. mere entertainment.,"The philosophical aspect of this film is to me by far the biggest difference with e.g. The Butterfly Effect (a film that this is compared to a lot). These two movies indeed share a lot of thematic similarities, as they are both about determinism, but TBE is pretty shallow and not designed to be much more than (for some) an enjoyable flick which uses determinism to reach those goals. Mr. Nobody on the other hand is a (not so shallow) philosophical study on determinism which rather seems to be made with the idea to get people to think about this rather than to simply entertain them with it.Besides the philosophical aspects, this film also has some truly beautiful cinematography, good acting, a pretty nice and fitting soundtrack and even some (arguably) dystopian elements, which makes it even better. Needless to say that one cannot compare Jared Leto to Ashton Kutcher, without trying to discredit Ashton Kutcher of course.Up to yesterday I had no idea that this film even existed, but it's needless to say that it has been a very pleasant surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"utmost boring piece of mess, yawn......","One of the worse movies you will ever see, story's a complete mess, jumping here and there, repetitive and drag. It tries to tell a story of parallel universe, alternatives, choices and consequences but bitterly failed. Perhaps a child would found it interesting, but as a mature person with better knowledge would know a lot of stuffs are actually untrue pseudo science theories that doesnt even exist, like the butterfly effect with a blend of buddism. It seems to be interesting to think there are multiverse generated when one makes a different decision, but when you seriously consider it you would know thats clearly a fictional theory that isnt real, because that would generate an infinite amount of universe, where does all the duplicates suddenly comes from? How do they split themselves? Where do the splits go? Its just incredibly stupid to think that even exist. PARALLEL MULTIVERSE IS ONLY SOME UNREAL FALSE THEORY, which is like greek mythology where people without much knowledge and ability to think would believe thats true in ancient times. Also evidence has shown the universe will not collapse back into a point, but rather expand itself more and more, in the end everything would cease to exist even all the stars and black holes, leaving behind a giant sea of protons without interactions. This is a fair comment after seeing a ton of movies, ignore all the fake pretentious childish idiotic ratings, this is nowhere near 9 or 10, this movie deserves only 1 star as it is painfully boring to watch from start to finish, and trying to convince people of the false theories and alternate realities in a giant boring mess.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"What ""The Butterfly Effect"" should have been.",This Movie achieves what The Butterfly Effect was trying to accomplish with the concept of the butterfly effect and does it better them what it could have done. Even though it does share its concept with The Butterfly Effect it manages to be a truly original movie due in part to its amazing cinematography and music creating a completely different tone to any movie that had been made up to that point. The Movie shows how Nemo's future is able to change so much based on small choices made just by a nine year old that create a different life for him to experience. But even though the movie is extremely intelligent it will not appeal to everyone that most people and they would be better watching something like transformers.,8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Poetic Reality Rift,"A poetic embrace of ideas that have percolated in my own consciousness produce a vivid time-traveling adventure for Nemo. I'm sure this character was inspired by the childhood movie, Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland , a favorite of many. If this was the impetus, it sparked a creative entry into modern film-making of self-aware destination. The machinations makes this film entertaining and thought-provoking. The emotional ties to the characters generate enough empathy. Nemo is a likable character that goes through changes because of self-inflicted choices, his emotional struggles split between multiple realities.Toby Regbo is the best incarnation of Nemo according to his performance, Jared Leto forgettable as always. I'm not sure what compels people to cast Leto, who has a vapidity about him that is amounts to a constant blank stare. Juno Temple gives an palpable emotional performance as younger Anna. This period of time and relationship is probably the strongest throughout the film. Elise is obviously bipolar by the first appearance by Clare Stone, who gives Sarah Polley a great lead in before she even gives the character a go. Give all the credit to Stone for this character. Polley is actually the perfect casting choice for the bi-polar, older Elise. Krueger really can't hide her accent at all and really as the same problem with Leto, which is, pretty faces don't make up for the lack of acting chops.Stylistically and melodically, the poetry of visual style and musical accompaniment resonate. Mental stimulation is at the top of the Jaco Van Dormael's list. Factoids litter the piece without too much distraction from the story.The only issue I see with this film is the runtime, which is 2hrs and 18 mins. It starts to lose its emotional power as it delves deeper into the confusion.""We only exist in the imagination of a child with an impossible choice.""

Choices,"Firstly, to see this film you must be in an open mindset.

Presenting such a story in a nonlinear narrative does make it difficult to understand however it highlights one common factor in all our lives, i.e. choices. These choices all lead to different paths and the possible causative factors which influence these choices (discussing various theories).After the credits rolled I had to think for a minute to explain the ending. Discussing with a friend I watched it with lead us to somewhat understand it all. However ultimately we need to do some research online to read the opinions and explanations of others.

First I thought that it was the acting that was bad, but thinking about it, it's more likely that it's the awful dialog and lack of acting space limited by the director. It surely doesn't help the case that the guy shouldered both scriptwriter and director and he does this in a project he's been working on for something like 13 years (read that somewhere). I'm just saying that it's probably not that easy to ""kill your darlings"" at this point and it's pretty clear that this guys likes to micro mange. This is not a good combination. If an actor clearly can't say a line naturally, let him/her try it their way. This is basic stuff.The biggest reason this movie fails to me is because it's all stolen. Every good filmmaker is allowed to borrow, but this guy steals without shame, everything is just pure rip-offs. For this reason almost every scene looks like it tries to mimic good story telling, as seen in other movies, rather than actually creating something original. Instead he's basically cutting and pasting from other movies to build around his own idea and the amount of different movies you could reference felt almost endless to the point of becoming ridiculous. To make matters worse there are literally hundreds of clichés and naturally this makes it even more stiff and unnatural.Here's some examples of clichés in no particular order: the future vision, the 70's vision and the presentation of households, the cry-and- scream running after the departing train, the extremely cheesy slow motion name shouting, the tattooed future-man (but with a slight lisp, original but surely coincidental), the classic over-the-top TV host with a pet pig (come on - really?). The sad montage with holding and scrubbing in the shower, the usual ""chasing-each-other-around-because- we're-so-in-love"" crap and I thinks he probably used all possible love scenes that is out there and crammed them all into this one. The classic ""under-the-blanket""-""love-you-forever-dialog"" is of course not left out. Stay with me here, I'm just scraping the surface: ...The train station time lapse, the overly dramatic voice over accompanied by a type writer. Last but surely not least the oh so totally predictable soundtrack consisting of everything from opera to Pixies, probably a dozen of pop songs(this is cheating and everybody knows it) and on top of that various oldies for that retro feeling that always works. I'm not saying it horrible, the music is awesome, it's just that it's used in a way that's without finesse.The end result is sadly a poorly cut drama that is sprawling everywhere without any constancy - both visually and dramaturgical. I'm not even focusing on the really bad stuff like the old mans make up, his fake laugh, the fake tears, the mediocre greenscreen scenes and special effects. There is also a lot of little details that someone really should've looked at, like the guy with Downs disease who growled and attacked. Wtf.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Movies like this are what hollywood is missing nowadays!,"I find it difficult to review this movie, there is so much to be said. Its amazing they were able to cram all the information being processed here into 2h 20mins, its pretty remarkable. Its not how to explain the movie that I find hard but answering what its about. Its honestly about alot of things, its deep and then goes even deeper. Its one of those films that certainly demand multiple viewings. Its multi-layered and complex as complex gets. But the central part of its story revolves around a fascinating question; What if you had two different choices to make in life, if you were not to pick any of them would that affect the outcomes in both decisions? This movie unfolds to examine that very rhetoric.In the end alot of it has to deal with existentialism and love, two of its major themes. Its well played out by Jared Leto and the entire cast. Its highly original, I haven't watched anything like this in a long time. Its not for everyone that's for sure but its worth checking out.

No right answer,"One of the differences between cinema and literature is that the latter can be a complicated form, thus able to discuss the complexity of life and mind. The movie Mr. Nobody is trying to challenge the idea that cinema is a simplified medium. The hero of the film is a man on his deathbed, with a look of bewilderment trying to remember his past life. What he remembered is not one life, but multiplied lives with multiple timelines. At every big moment of his life, time diverges into different separated timelines (branches), every timeline (branch) continues on his own. Psychologically, we can call that his consciousness fragments (but this is another level of analysis).The first big moment is when he is standing on a station platform as a train is about to level, and he has to choose between staying with his father or with his mother, which is something against his biology, a question without an answer. At this point, to him, life has been forced to abandon its subjectivity into an infinite search for the objective right answer. Helpless as he is, life has lost its subjective true self, and will never find the objective right. Now, what life has become for him is just the abyss of infinity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Much like a French movie,"The beginning has a line that goes something like 'it exists but says nothing, much like a French movie.' Though that is a humorous line, it also tells you what to expect from this (partly) French movie. Heed its warning. If you're not ok with those types of movies, skip this long one. That said:This film has beautiful moments and is certainly beautifully shot, but its length gets in its own way. The length is reasonable in that it really is a few different films rolled into one, but some of that is fat that could be trimmed without losing anything from the film. It's worth a home watch where you can pause it and go for a bathroom or snack break, take the dog for a walk, etc. And come back to it. Probably torturous in theater.Also, the romantic scenes with the 15 year olds feel a little pedophilic sometimes, could do with a bit less of that.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

It has some great companions: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Interstellar and, without wishing to use a cliché, The Matrix.To the nay-sayers: you obviously enjoy being told how to be you.

Extremely fun movie if you know what you are watching,"This is a good movie cinematographically, the colors, the camera angles, the lens, the way the story is told... The acting is strong, the characters are likable, the soundtrack is awesome too.However, this movie can be extremely fun to watch if you do a bit of research before you watch it. I am quite amazed that this was shot in 2009 when it so eloquently illustrates a relatively recent and hotly debated topic in quantum physics called the Block Universe Theory. Without getting into too much boring details, the Block Universe Theory proposes that the universe is a giant block that contains all the things that can possibly happen in the past, present and future. Everything is already there and what we perceive as ""Now"" is just a mental construct...

Unique idea but it kinda gets lost in its own narrative,"The movie does explore an intersting idea that in theory could have been very good so I would say it had good potential, but I think it went so far that the narrative ended up as just a big mess. I think they were just too ambitious and sort of over-did it. Had they kept it with good taste maybe we would have been left wanting more, but they split the narrative so much that about halfway through the movie it already starts to get frustrating as it's just scattered all over. I get the message they tried to deliver here so it gets the point across at least, but at the end of the day the movie was really hard to enjoy or relate to because it was too messy, and the ending was just as unclear as everything else, so I feel like they fell into a ""can't see the forest for the trees"" situation. It was also kind of exhausting, due to being so long while not having a clear storyline that will get you invested enough to enjoy that long time.I would recommend watching The Butterfly Effect as something that explores a similar concept but without over doing it.

"Most amazing film since 2001, A Space Odyssey","The story revolves around the World's oldest man (Jared Leto) at 118 years of age. The World at this time, 2092, has figured out how to arrest ageing, but it is too late for the protagonist. So, in careful respect of his privacy, they have decided to broadcast his last days to the world. A nosy reporter sneaks into his hospital room to get one last interview, which he obliges, although he is confused thinking he is only 34. His recollections go thru three separate versions of his life with three separate females. There is a constant stream of flashbacks and flashforwards, leaving the viewer wondering what just happened. Scenes from each of the three different versions of his life are interwoven, heightening the bewilderment. If this weren't enough, he fulfills a childhood promise to spread one of his wives' ashes on Mars (yes, Mars!).Warning: like 2001 you may be left scratching your head about what you had just seen.The acting is top-notch, especially Leto's.

magnificently flawed,"Saw the directors cut, the version where the director finally gets to share his true vision. And that was the problem. In this film creator Jaco Van Dormael presents a feast of sight and sound which I have seldom seem imitated or duplicated in my many reviews here. He is also one of the few living directors who learned from Leone the powerful impact of closeups, which are used extensively here. On the downside, in the 2 and 1/2 hour version we see a creator who has fully lost control of his creation and its pacing. The title of the film, the idea of a Mr. Nobody who is not immortal, is completely overwhelmed by the overlong story. And there is considerable irony in the fact that the film marks a high point for both Director and star, two individuals for whom Hollywood was never as welcoming as they had hoped.

Pseudo-scientific Pabulum,"There is a concept in food where something if something that is supposed to be sweet is made too sweet, it becomes ""cloyingly sweet"" and is ruined.

I found it a bit nauseating to watch the overly sappy romances, with overly sappy love music overlaid, and overly stylistic camera angles applied... as I said, ""cloying."" The jump-cut style of the editing is also quite annoying and the jumping around in time grows tiresome extremely quickly. The logic holes in the plot quickly become apparent but the film slaps on more sap to cover them up.Part of the problem is that I came to this film as a recommended ""science-fiction,"" but I can assure the reader that there is nothing scientific in the slightest about it.

Reason fails in the unreality of the presentation, it's all so surreal..An Art-House film mainly screened at film festivals, which by end May 2010 had only grossed 5% of its production cost, it's not hard to understand why Mr. Nobody wasn't promoted as a blockbuster..Sumptuous visuals, I loved the Mars arrival and departure, but such eye-candy is meaningless in the absence of a correspondingly strong storyline.Just as Mr. Nobody departs the earth, the point of the film's penchant for running backwards comes into play: Time flows backward and he reverts out of death.

Glossy Nothingness,"When they say 'makes you think' or 'thought provoking', as many do, what they are really saying is that they are confused by the lack of a plot and/or overwhelmed by their own narcissism looking them right in the face, but saying either of these things would be embarrassing, so just go with ""it's so deep and I am smart enough to recognize this"".It's not and they are not.

"I Want To Love This Film, But I Can't","Ever since seeing Jaco Van Dormael's Le Huitième Jour (The Eighth Day) I had been highly looking forward to his latest work....MR NOBODY. Last night I caught an early screening of it in Liege, Belgium with special guest, director Jaco Van Dormael in attendance.I tried so hard to get into Mr Van Dormael's brilliant, yet fatally flawed vision of love, life and the choices we make. My first problem of the film is its structure (flashforwards, flashbacks..). The film rarely gave me the opportunity to sit back and immerse myself in its world without constantly jolting, and distracting with its fractured structure. I understand this was to show how every choice has its consequence, every choice leads down a different life path. It often reminded me of the more mainstream and simple chick-flick SLIDING DOORS, which my wife adored. I loved the film for its ideas and questions it posed on who and what we are. MR NOBODY certainly can't be criticized for being empty or shallow. If anything, the problem with the film is that there is too much to consider. It's overblown and bloated which ended up numbing me to the point of not even caring.Van Dormael clearly loves the use of color in his films. In THE EIGHTH DAY his use of color was beautiful and poignant in the way it illuminated its troubled young hero's fantastic world, in contrast to the gray realities of the true world around him. That is another one of my major problems with MR NOBODY. This film had so much to say about who and what we are. It dealt with such real issues of abandonment, loss and loneliness, but his Tim Burtonesque use of colors and over-the-top jests didn't slightly resemble anything real or believable. If only he had given the film some sense of the real world from time to time, like with The Eighth Day it would have strengthened the film tremendously. Something has to look and feel real in order to feel any emotion or anything at all.I just wish Jaco Van Dormael had simplified things a bit. I don't mean dumb down his vision, but give it some space to breath and room to move the viewer. As I said before, I really wanted to love this film, but now I can say I really didn't like it. MR NOBODY was a bold effort with a lot of good in it, including the fine cast, but in the end unfortunately it falls rather flat.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Promising but disappointing,"The ideia of this movie and it's premisse is pretty good but all of the potential was lost in the way they did it.

"Every Life Deserves To Be Lived... Oh, Really!!??","At about the one-hour point in the telling of this decidedly tangled, muddled and completely convoluted Sci-Fi, soap opera tale, Nemo Nobody suddenly hollered out ""I'm fugging bored!"" And, let me tell ya - When it came to my general feelings about this particular study of cinematic schizophrenia, I couldn't have agreed more with Mr. Nobody on that one.Isn't it funny (even ironic) sometimes how just one, simple line of dialogue (like ""I'm fugging bored!""), flippantly uttered by a character, can pretty much sum up the general feelings of the viewer for a movie in a literal nutshell?I find it quite amusing that the American Film Institute (AFI) actually lists Mr. Nobody as being one of the best European movies of 2010.To me, that really isn't saying too much. My guess as to why the AFI ranked it in such a lofty position has to do with the fact that Mr. Nobody seems to go well out of its way to emulate many American films included in the same genre.Though Mr. Nobody did feature some very impressive visuals, I found that it tried, with too much determination, to squeeze the likes of deja vu, alternate realities, and the notorious butterfly effect into its gruelling 155-minute storyline.And as a final result of this, very little concern seemed to be paid to all of the many, many loose ends that this business was inevitably creating.If nothing else, this film did introduce me to the word ""zugzwang"". Though generally useless in everyday conversation, this term means being in a position where you need to make a move (like in the game of Chess), but you don't want to because of the obvious disadvantage it will put you in.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

It's not only that it's all cliche, but it's badly edited and represents all in all, one big pickets diorama display of other's people randomly stolen ideas, but not really comprehensively orchestrated. This movie is a mess in appalling attempt to showcase or signal virtue, or art but in effect reaches no further from the confused adolescent's mind due to plagiarism and ignorance of its subjects.The same can be said for those who have generously given this kitsch of a work more than 4 rate.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Enjoyable so long as you don't try to make sense of it.,"Jaco Van Dormael's ""Mr. Nobody"" is a terrific looking film with image after image appearing in front of us as if in a dream for this is a sci-fi film that isn't really meant to make too much sense. The 'plot', for want of a better word, is simply the story of one man called Nemo, the 'Mr Nobody' of the title but it's not like any 'life story' you might have seen since Mr Nobody doesn't really exist, except perhaps in the imagination of Mr Van Dormael and this is the kind of film that could easily be re-edited without losing its sense or lack of it. You might indeed call it self-indulgent, particularly since it goes on for over two and a half hours and since there are no real 'characters', actors like the talented Jared Leto as Nemo are unable to leave their mark. This is the kind of film that almost wilfully sets out to alienate an audience. It's certainly imaginative and, as I say, it looks fantastic but don't waste your time trying to make too much sense of it; take it as you find it and you might even enjoy it, particularly if you live in Europe

Are the writers afraid that if they produce a film that has a story the coherent, chronological and makes sense that they won't be able to cut it.This genre has become a gimmick rather than an art form.

Several cliché plots with an almost interesting frame narrative,"Despite an interesting frame narrative for this series of parallel possible lives and some beautiful cinematography, this film ultimately falls flat. The basic idea is great: the only man in the future who hasn't been genetically altered to live forever is telling his story, but he appears to have had a quasi-quantum physics experience in which he was able to relive his life several different ways, so the story of his life moves in multiple directions. Unfortunately, the lives he lived were, at best, pedestrian love stories, and the film makers spent far too much time drawing out the schmaltzy love scenes of each one, so that eventually, you'll find yourself fast forwarding past the countless ""I'll love you forever"" scenes to find out that, once again, things will end tragically.

The end of the movie is NOT nigh,"I watched this movie, because a friend said he watched it and liked it. I watched the trailer and was very skeptical, but still decided to give it a chance. After the movie started, my concerns were deepened when I realized this is a European movie and also a co-production. At that point I knew I had stepped on the doodoo train, but the door had already closed. I endured the whole 2 hours and 35 minutes heroically, but I admit I was checking the clock every five minutes and was making calculations when the torture will end. The only good thing about this movie was Diane Kruger and that's because I find her attractive and want to have sex with her. This also seemed to be the main hero's motivation to live for half the movie. The other half he spent his time with some other women, who seemed too boring. Honestly speaking, this movie is a pretentious mess of half-digested metaphysical concepts, substandard sci-fi elements, horny teenage problems and producers with too much money. The irony of this movie is that at one point the main character says: ""most of the time nothing happened, like a french movie"". The same applies here. People move around, talk something and yet nothing really happens. Complete nonsense. The movie is utterly devoid and sterilized of any message.

"They get points for trying something different, but it's a mixed bag overall... sometimes it makes completely no sense at all","This was a strange film. I got to give the director and cast credit for trying something kinda different. This is a sort attempt at cubist film making. I say that as cubism was originally inspired by the theory of relativity. The non linear quality of the film is broken up into pieces. There are some nice themes of quantum physics in this. I will give the creators of this film credit for trying to bend the rules a bit. Some of the acting is genuinely good (hard to go wrong with Diane Kruger). However, Jared Leto is kind of a tool. He mostly has the same exact expression the entire movie. If he was not in this film, I think I would enjoy it about a thousand times more than I did. The actors who play the younger version of the main character and the parents are pretty good. The parts at the end kind of loose me. Around the 3/4th mark of the film, the story goes from a fractured non linear time piece to a surrealist piece. Thats where the film kind of falls apart and starts to not make much sense. Again I applaud them for trying something different, but the fact that the film really looses structure bothers me.There are times when it seems like a clear concept and metaphor are being formed, and then the whole thing meanders into left field. ultimately I feel the film does not succeed at telling much of a story at that point.

"Too artsy-fartsy for my liking. Visually stunning, but mind-bogglingly difficult to comprehend. Avoid this one!","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !I gotta confess that the idea of starting this blog came across to me while watching this flick or piece of hogwash, as I would call it. I felt that there was a need for some medium to distinguish between flicks that claim to be masterpieces (but are actually artsy-farsty trash), and the genuine works of art. Of course we also need to put in some fun (hic) element into the movies as well; hence the name of the blog .Anyways moving on to the movie (Mr. Nobobody); it came across initially as genuine art-house fare (because of its stunning visual elements), but later rambled on to be a boring waste of time, and almost totally incomprehensible to the human mind. This was actually one of the movies that I stopped watching mid-way, even though I had some time to waste that evening. Now don't blame me if the second half of the movie turned out to dramatically good, or somehow explained all the loss of brain cells that I endured while watching the movie during the first half.Now don't take me to be a person who hates movies that need you to exercise your intellect. I have enjoyed my share of intellectual or film noir kind of movies (like Mulholland Drive, Memento, Vanilla Sky etc.). However, there is a big line between those movies that are the genuine stuff and those that are the pretentious types, and Mr. Nobody appears to be qualifying in the latter segment.In a nutshell, avoid this one, unless you are the artsy-fartsy type who likes pretentious fare.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I Like to think i think i understood well,"i would say the flick is monstrous, why?, well, it offers an holistic world view where the naturalistic way of though is the main one, thus leaving the burden to chance to be the explanation of the origin of life, then again this is not the main point of the movie, but it moves forward with that statement as ground conception of the fantastic possibilities inherent in the phenomenon we relate as consciousness, and so on... its a good production, and i am not trying to hurt the movie with the critic, i am just saying that reality seems to me to be far more complex, but then again there are ways to explain it in a simple manner; the complexity of it, you don't go just lay it all out and call it art, yo create art by connecting with reality, onto-logically speaking, but using the film as a way of expressing it, the image, it should make me feel other emotions than the burden of another fiction.By the way, i am not against the naturalistic way, neither the creation, nor other possibilities, if you follow the syntactic line of theories, humankind has develop a serious place for the mystic, understanding it as a science yet to be known: the metaphysical realm, and there is much to be accomplished, all though reason has limits, the dead mans toil has shared the legacy time and again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
