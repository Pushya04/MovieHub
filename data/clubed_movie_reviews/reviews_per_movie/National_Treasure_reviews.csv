"Take ""National Treasure"" for what it is.","This is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it. The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow. Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure. To put it simply, ""National Treasure"" will remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy (minus the snakes) and ""Ocean's 11"" (minus the drinking and profanity). You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it. No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark, either. It's a fun, fantasy, what-if, kind of movie. Enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Witty Fast-Paced Fun Adventure-Thriller For All Ages,"Jon Turtletaub's best film must endure the critics propensity to penalize highly popular commercially successful family-friendly Disney films... ""What does the common folk know about filmmaking?"" It's much better than most of those reviews indicate.Yes, this film works hard to be likable and appealing to a mass audience - perhaps it's just too preposterous a story, and has too much witty repertoire to be taken seriously by some critics. Witty repertoire CAN wear thin and become precocious in movies, but in 'National Treasure', it's the film's most endearing and appealing factor, carried off successfully by some of the most experienced actors in the business - They keep the film fun and pull off their quips with deft skill - Bravo!A well casted, directed and edited film that doesn't pretend to be more than it is, and delivers what audiences came to see.Enjoy this snappy-paced treasure hunt Disney ride without guilt - it's OK to have escapism fun watching movies, and this one does it as well as any, so grab a bowl of popcorn and indulge yourself.üëçüëç",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasant Surprise!,"National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular Cage fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as Ben Gates - slightly serious yet very witty! together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.with no explicit language and scenes, National Treasure is well-suited for family entertainment! its a light-hearted film good for an evening of chilling out! the subtle love story also adds credit to the film.well done!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Security risks,"""National Treasure"" is a thriller that was obviously targeted for young audiences. John Turtletaub, its director, has created a film that will resonate with those audiences because of the great ride and the adventure it depicts. On the other hand, heaven help us, should anyone feel inspired to emulate the hero of the film and attempts to do something similar, which in a way, doesn't say much about the security in guarding the real ""natural treasures"" of the country.If we can believe Ben Gates can pull the caper, then there's no problem in enjoying this film, which offers an action packed couple of hours that could have been trimmed a little bit to make it even better.Not being a Nicolas Cage fan, one was prepared for the worst, but this is one of the films in which Mr. Cage is at his mellowest intensity and it's easy to tolerate his antics. Diane Kreuger is a beautiful addition to the film that pays well. Justin Bartha does what he can being a computer nerd and pulling fantastic stuff to help his friend. Sean Bean, Christopher Plummer and Jon Voight, are seen in supporting roles.This is a film that will play well with young minds and with adults that will allow for the silliness of the situation at hand.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
fun adventure,"This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code. The plot is just like it except instead of involving religious history, the clues center around American history, and namely the founding fathers.So Nick Cage, plays Ben Gates, the treasure hunter whose family has been looking for the treasure of the knights templer for years. One of his relatives possessed the last remaining clue from a dying Mason. So, the movie starts with Cage finally solving that clue, and the film goes from there. Of course, we have the evil billionaire guy who wants the treasure for himself and the funny sidekick. But, I think the sidekick failed because he wasn't all that funny. The movie could have used some more humor. And of course, Gates hooks up with a beautiful woman along the way to help him solve the clues, which sounds just like Da Vinci.It is unbelievable that someone could just come up with the answer to these difficult clues after thinking about them for 2 minutes, but we don't have time to let the characters ponder them for a few months. It is meant to be fun, so forget about the plot holes. The whole set beneath the church looked very neat, but I would have to think all those wooden stairs would have been rotten by then and no one could walk on them. But who cares, it's fun.And the theft of the Declaration of Independence was reminiscent of Ocean's 11. Funny how anyone can steal anything in a film, forget locked down security.FINAL VERDICT: If you like adventure films, I recommend it. It is not like Tomb Raider, which some have compared it to. Tomb Raider was horrible. This is more like Indiana Jones.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fairly entertaining,"I am NOT, repeat, NOT, a Nicolas Cage fan, mainly because he relies too much on action to carry his films (instead of his acting), but this is a pretty decent flick. There is enough action and suspense to keep the viewer's interest and also to maintain the pace of the film. There's actually not very much actual violence (strange for a Cage film!), but the story is so well-written that even Cage can pull it off without any gore. The basic story has been reviewed several times, but it's the continuation of a 200 year old treasure hunt. Cage must solve riddle after riddle to find the ultimate clue to the treasure's whereabouts. The clue is finally determined to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. How Cage figures the clue that leads him there is pretty far-fetched but its the key to the story. If you buy into that, the rest of the riddles are acceptable. There's also a double cross plot headed by the great Sean Bean that provides a lot of the action. The lovely Diane Kruger portrays the poor lady who gets caught up in the middle of all this intrigue. Overall, except for the figuring out of the clue found in the ship (the viewer just has to assume that he's that far above the rest of us in intelligence), a pretty exciting film with a little something for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Surprisingly Stunning Gem.,"A descendant (Nicolas Cage) of a family of fortune hunters looks for a treasure chest that was hidden by the Founding Fathers of the new United States after the Revolutionary War. After being double-crossed by European Sean Bean and his men while obtaining another clue in the Arctic, Cage and sidekick Justin Bertha (who nearly steals the show with his quick-witted one-liners) travel to D.C. to obtain the Declaration of Independence. It is believed that there is an invisible map on the back of that historic document. A daring cat and mouse game continues between Cage and Bean as the ultra-hot Diane Kruger (who made almost no impression in the disappointing ""Troy"") gets involved as well. Jon Voight (Cage's skeptical father) also gets thrown in the mix as the movie progresses and he does some of the best work of his career in an endearing and quietly comical role. A brilliant scavenger hunt for clues along the major cities of the East Coast will leave you on the edge of your seat. ""National Treasure"" is a fun trip to the movies. The setup (told by Cage's grandfather, Christopher Plummer) is a bit uneven and I was worried that this was going to be a disaster, but I am glad it was not. The characters are all smart and intelligent and the pace is fast and furious. Wonderful entertainment for the entire family. Surprisingly one of the finer pictures of 2004. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Enjoyable but fairly simple adventure,"Legend has it that the founding fathers of the United States of America were in possession of an enormous treasure. This treasure has been passed down through the centuries from great civilization to great civilization by conquest and all sorts of other means, but... it is true or just myth? Ben Gates is one person who believes it to be true and pursues the clues where his father before him has given up.This story is very similar to a Dan Brown novel in its real time development and an interesting mix of historical information into an entertaining plot. While it isn't quite as rich as a book can be, it is still a good clever little adventure. Well paced with some good action scenes that will keep you hooked all the way through.There are some glaring errors in logic and moments of sappiness that bring down what good have been a good thriller, but seeing that this is a family oriented movie it is forgivable. Also the film is pretty much geared for an American audience, but should be a good evening of light entertainment for most movie watchers. 7/10Rated PG for mild violence and action",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Did The Illuminati Fund This Movie To Further Mask Their Nefarious Schemes?,"NATIONAL TREASURE (3 outta 5 stars) After hearing some of the initial reviews I was expecting something of a train wreck here. Actually, the movie is not bad at all... in a cheesy kind of Saturday afternoon time-killing way. Some of the actions of the characters strain credibility at times... but if you just sit back and let the plot play out it's all quite entertaining. A pair of eccentric treasure hunters pick up a female ally along the way as they try to beat a rich bad man at finding the greatest cache of treasure of all time. Nicolas Cage gives an effortlessly engaging lead performance. His male and female sidekicks (Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) play off him quite well. The main villain (Sean Bean) is a more low-key bad guy than we tend to see in movies these days... he doesn't go on and on ranting and raving and screaming to prove how bad he is... he just proves it quite matter-of-factly through his actions. Jon Voigt and Harvey Keitel do alright in a couple of minor roles that don't do much for their acting cred but probably gave their bank accounts a boost. It didn't even strike me until the very end that this was indeed a Disney MOVIE... one very much like the adventure movies they used to put out in the 50s. I was also pleasantly surprised that there were less dumb action stunts than I expected. The two major stunt scenes in the film (a car chase and a stairway cave-in) were pretty un-inspired... the movie wisely concentrates more on plot and dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Popcorn Movie,"Completely unbelievable but fun romp around the world looking for treasure...it won't win any awards but its a good two hours at the movies.The plot to trying to find a lost treasure a clue to which is on the back of the Declaration of Independence is so beyond belief that its best to simply begin by throwing up your hands and accepting it for what it is. Certainly the cast has thrown reality to the wind and appears to be having a grand time.My only complaint, and its what keeps me from saying you you should see this in a theater instead of renting it, is that the pacing is off. It needs a zipper pace to get us from A to B. Certainly it moves well, but there were times when I just wanted to to move a bit faster. Its a minor fault, but one that prevented me from really loving this.7 out of 10.

CLASSIC Cage,Here we have a classical Nicholas Cage film that will carry into the future. It is the peak of 'follow the clues' type of adventure film. The premise is just obscene enough to create this funny air over the movie and has enough twists and turns that keep the audience engaged. The villain is a very standard villain but it is nice that they nearly mirror our heroes in treasure hunting prowess. It is simple and not necessarily the most impressive but overall I would have to consider it one of the quintessential Nick Cage films.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The American Movie For Just The Right Audience,"20 November 2004. National Treasure is the all-American movie about good vs. evil which is just what the American audience needs at this time in the face of America's war in Iraq. With a great dose of Lara Croft's lofty beginning theme along with Raiders of the Lost Ark sort of comedy and action adventure, throw in some nice high-tech, Enemy of the State themes and this movie is a gang-buster of a movie for the American public. It starts out with such action that it has difficulty keeping up the pace and the editing become a problem through its length and slower pace that it seems too long until the exciting climax that avoids the unbelievable ending of most movies. The romance and the nice contrast of bad guy-blow'em approach vs. the more subtle good guy approach makes this movie enjoyable. This is a great movie of the moment, for its time and audience, though not a classic by any means, it's great entertainment of the moment. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure is not an Oscar quality film but it could make for a fun night at the cinema,"National Treasure is a fun movie to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously. The story is that hundreds of years ago, the country's Founding Fathers hid the world's greatest treasure somewhere in the world. Centuries later, a treasure hunter named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) tries to put together the clues in order to find and protect the treasure from his adversary (Sean Bean) while staying ahead of the FBI. Just getting the map, printed on the back of the Declaration of Independence, might prove to be his biggest challenge. The plot sounds ridiculous but once you learn who's behind it then it makes sense. Nicholas Cage stars as Ben and he is pretty good. Diane Kruger is very beautiful and she does a very good job in this film. Jerry Bruckheimer, for the most part, always makes entertaining films and this one is pretty good. The action is solid and the direction is pretty good. The dialogue has some lame lines but that has to be expected in this type of film. The film is 131 minutes long so there some boring scenes and the film is pretty predictable as there's nothing new. It has a PG rating so its a fun movie for the entire family. Rating 7/10 a pretty entertaining action flick that's worth watching if you can get past its high improbable plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure,"This is a great and entertaining adventure movie, despite the NY Times critic and others. I think critics write to amuse themselves, not to critique a movie on its main importance ""entertainment"".This movie has been called preposterous and unlikely. Hmmm? I don't suppose the critics liked ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""The Bourne Identity"" or ""Independence Day"" or ""The Sum of All Fears"" or for that matter, ""Titanic "" ! This treasure hunter story, backed up by allusion to national history is fun to watch and fun to think about. The acting is just enough off edge and the dialog and commentary is just right so that it appeals to both adults and children. Disney got it right again.GO SEE IT ! Or rent or buy the DVD, its a keeper for when you can't find something decent to watch. Put it alongside ""Pirates of the Caribbean""........also preposterous but great fun !

fun film,"This was a fun movie. Nicolas Cage plays a man who has been searching for a treasure his entire life and is totally obsessed with finding it. He believes the clues lie in U.S. currency. Along the way, he drags his father, a colleague, and a lady into the fracas. He steals (borrows?) the Declaration of Independence, which provides further clues. He does indeed find clues in dollar bills, while also getting them from letters written by Ben Franklin which his father has donated to a museum and various landmarks located in Philadelphia. Along the way, there is the requisite bad guys who want the treasure too and will stop at nothing to get it for themselves. I loved this movie and you will too.

"Nearly impossible to swallow, but very entertaining.","National Treasure is an underrated, implausible, yet very entertaining action/adventure flick that really relies on the plot and intrigue rather than explosion filled action sequences.Nicolas Cage stars as Ben Gates, a historian enthusiast in search for a mythical treasure dating back to the Crusades which has alleged switch locations overtime leaving several extensive clues to follow. The movie starts you off in the middle of Gate's quest in the Artic Circle, where he is double-crossed by one of his companions, Ian Howe (predictably played by Sean Bean who usually plays these shady, back-stabbing characters in ""Goldeneye"", ""Troy"", ""Ronin"" and ""Don't Say a Word""), which ensues a race across America looking for the treasure and preserving history.This movie has been deemed another ""Indiana Jones"" without the whip, leather hat and stereotypical Nazis. Instead, the movie really focuses on the implausible, puzzling clues that were left by our forefathers to guide future hunters to a hidden treasure map. The map itself is only half of the problems, as if/when it's discovered still needs to be deciphered. As implausible and unrealistic as the story, plot and Da Vince Code-like clues are, they are still pretty interesting and creative and keep the story going, leaving very few dry spots. As mentioned before it's more of a ""Goonie"" race between Gates and Bean, in which Gates is really trying to protect the certain historical landmarks, but both are actually gunning for the treasure with Bean using more ""aggressive"" tactics.Cage, who usually get a little excited when he muddles through his cue cards, actually toned it downed a little bit making the film much more enjoyable. The writing is also pretty good that scarcely emits one-liners, but still adds a few comedic moments without distracting from the plot. The ending is also chewable that should alleviate any possible sequels and wraps everything up nicely.Yes, this movie is practically inaccurate historically and contains more outrageous clues then ""Tomb Raider"" and ""The Mummy"" series combined, but take that with a grain of salt and just sit back an enjoy the film for it's creativity and overall satisfaction.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Pretty Good PG movie for the whole family,"It's hard to make a PG rated movie that the entire family can enjoy.

Not your typical Nicholas Cage role, here we see Nicholas the serious and not the ""over the top"" performance that we have seen him, like in Con-Air and the Rock.

It is no masterpiece in any shape or form, due to the daft plot as the director tries to piece together a detective story, a conspiracy thriller and an action adventure, sometimes corny dialogue and uneven pacing. But what makes it fun is the beautiful cinematography and settings, great special effects, terrific music score, colourful action(especially the sequence of the theft of the Declaration of Independence) and the spirited performances of Nicolas Cage, Sean Bean(he has been better, but hey he was fun), Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight.

Implausibly silly but lots of fun,"As Jerry Bruckheimer films go, this is not going to have the wide mass appeal of 'Pirates of the Caribbean', but it's not offensive like 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor', and quite entertaining.Nicholas Cage comes off as quite sympathetic as Benjamin Franklin Gates, the seventh in a line of archivists, treasure hunters and history buffs stretching back to a confidant of President Andrew Jackson. As a child, Ben was imbued by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer) with not only a love of American history, but a love of stories of knight quests, secreted treasures, maps, and clues hidden deep within the grooves of American History trivia.Ben's father (Jon Voight) does not approve of his father encouraging such nonsense in his son, and his dialogue strangely reads like a non-Bruckheimer fan in the audience voicing his skepticism of the absurd plot to follow, but Ben nonetheless comes to believe his grandpa's story about how the treasure discovered by the Knights Templar within the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt during the Crusades was hidden in America to keep it out of the hands of Britain.30 years later, Ben and his partner Ian Howe ('The Lord of the Rings's Sean Bean) and comedic foil Riley (Justin Bartha) come to conclude that there may be an invisible map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence leading to the treasure, and when Ben refuses to go along with Ian's plan to steal it, and the authorities refuse to listen to him, Ben is forced to foil Ian's crime, and ends up with the stolen document himself, with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger from 'Troy'), the beautiful archivist in charge of the National Archives (because naturally, archivists working at the National Archives tend to be such lookers) dragged into the chase against her will. With FBI agent Harvey Keitel on their trail, Ben and his partner Riley (Justin Bartha), along with Abigail, race to find the treasure before Ian.What follows is a series of chase scenes as the treasure hunters find and search for clues leading them from one historic place to another across three different states, clues that are steeped in the minutiae of American history lore (I have no idea of any of these points is based in historical fact, but in a movie like this, it hardly matters), with Jon Voight again providing the sole voice of reason as he questions whether these clues are just an endless series of arrows pointing to other clues rather than to any real destination.The action isn't too implausible, the characters are likable, and the movie is just plain fun. The planning and machinations that the film supposes on the part of the Founding Fathers seems wildly implausible, but it doesn't matter. This is a Jerry Bruckheimer film, and one of the better ones. It's take on history may be fluff, but at least it endeavors an interest in it as a prerequisite for the plot, and a medium through which the audience may think to themselves, 'Ooh, I didn't know that about Benjamin Franklin.' If you're an expert in history bothered by the mistakes or flaws about Liberty Bell, or the Masons, or the hidden secrets on our currency, or who just plain doesn't buy the technological sophistication required for some of the artifacts uncovered by the characters, then perhaps you're watching it for the wrong reasons. If you don't know one way or the other, then it doesn't really matter. This is a popcorn film, and if you know anything about Jerry Bruckheimer, you should know going in what you're getting.Bruckheimer was in attendance last night, and gave the brief speech before the movie began (which not usually the case outside of premieres-this was just a press screening), and right before leaving when the closing credits started, I complimented him, saying it was very entertaining.If you like to sit back and have fun, I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent Entertainment,"First thing's first... the main reason I went to see this movie was because of Sean Bean... he's one of my all time favourite actors. I just made it a point that whether or not this movie was actually good, I would force myself to like it because he was in it. I actually genuinely enjoyed the movie. :) I though it was great. I walked out of there quite entertained. I wasn't really concerned with it's similarities to The DaVinci Code or whether or not some of the historical information was accurate... I just had a good time watching the story unravel on screen. The performances were pretty decent. Nicolas Cage, as usual, does a pretty good job with the lead role, Diane Kruger looks great and Justin Bartha was very likable... the guy has perfect comic timing. Sean Bean, of course, in my humble opinion, was brilliant as the greedy, deceitful villain. A great thing about him is that he never overplays his characters.

And of course, unlike Dan Brown's novel, it does not really claim to be based on solid historical facts. It is a clear fiction, and a well delivered one at that. Too simplistic at times, perhaps, but I wasn't looking for an intellectual thriller. And you shouldn't either.But within its own genre, it delivers quite a package. You have history unraveled to reveal an elaborate scheme of hiding a treasure. A treasure so vast that it cannot be shown in all its glory. You have codes; clues leading to clues leading to an inviting adventure, to a promise of unimaginable richness that seem to elude the hero every time. Almost like leading a donkey by dangling a carrot in front of it. You have a villain hell bent on reaching the carrot before Ben does. You have car chases, a high profile theft, explosions, and riddles to solve. Everything the doctor recommended. But don't bother trying out the riddles. They don't really make much sense, and in any case, the hero will solve them before you can fully read it.Another objection is that the plot moves a TAD bit too easily, in my opinion. Just a little bit, but on the whole, the movie fares pretty well.Irrespective of whether the codes made sense or not, the codes were interesting. And as far as the hero's ridiculously uncanny ability to solve riddles are concerned, you may argue along the same lines about the Da Vinci Code as well. If you're really interested in codes, try and read just every EIGHTH word of this review and you'll find out what I really think about the movie.......Just kidding. But that would have been cool, what?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Really not half bad!  A very entertaining action, adventure, romance","My expectations were a little bit low for this. I was pleasantly surprised. At first blush, it seemed like the Studio Bigwigs were trying to piggy back on the success of DaVinci Code. That made me skeptical. Although I still believe that was the intent, they actually pulled it off! While the ancient Secret Society, buried treasure, and Intellectual treasure hunt theme was preserved, it was executed with surprising freshness and watch-ability. Nick Cage has been hit an miss in many of his movies, but I think he did a very good job in this one, pulling off the Partly Nerdish, yet secretly Swashbuckling adventurer to a tee. I would watch this one again. I would even look forward to some sort of equally well done sequel, but based on the outcome of this one, don't really see how they could script that without making it seem really forced.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
If only I had taken Harvey Birdman instead of Harley Quinn...,"Ah, we all know Mr. Cage too well. Afer all, who else would be better in bringing down a bunch of hardened criminals on a plane or finding buried treasure? Certainly not Tom Hanks, although maybe Johnny Depp.Cage is the son of several generations of treasure hunters. And he wants to capture all the world's best items, including things hidden by the Founding Fathers of the USA. So he, with a couple of dimwitted guys and a nice 30-something woman, they steal the Declaration of Independence.Yes, the idea in reality is a little crazy. But for this movie, it does work. The Masons, like all treasure theories, are involved in hiding such a treasure. And Cage has to fend off a former partner to get his hands on the gold.I certainly know the movie is fake in the regard of history conspiracy theories. But was entertaining, unlike 300.So overall, not bad. ""B""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I strongly recommend all doubters to give the film a fair chance.,"Well, what can I say. I'm amazed. This isn't my type of film at all and I had serious doubts about even going along with my friends and watch the film. I'm glad I did. Nicholas Cage earns all credit he can get and the director must have known that it would turn out to a success after talking him into doing the movie. They jump into action already in the first minute. There are some sequences when it's challenging not to get goose bumps. The fact that the second clue is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is hair rising. Aside of all spectacular happenings, they manage to squeeze in a love story. The cooperation of Cage and his friend is also brilliantly done. In conclusion, the audio sounds real good and there are also many natural sceneries.

"Despite it's clunky plot, this is an enjoyably underrated mystery/action/adventure","I think I've heard of this underrated flick from the Jerry Bruckheimer company (who made later films including The Prince of Persia and The Sorcerer's Apprentice) and I think I actually liked it. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it's a lot of fun when it comes to mystery/action/adventure films.Yes, the story's predictable despite it's great mixture of mystery, thriller, action, and adventure, the dialog can sometimes be corny and the pacing is uneven and sluggish for itself.With that said, it has some nice cinematography along with some beautiful imagery I've ever seen and the history throughout the story got me very interested to wanna know what seems to be going on. The music from Trevor Rabin is pretty darn good and the action is very enjoyable to watch, but the strongest aspect goes to the cast. Nicolas Cage shines in his role and Diane Kruger did great as the love interest for Nicolas, but I think Sean Bean steals the show for portraying the villain very perfectly.Overall, Nation Treasure isn't a masterpiece and would've had a much better story, but with a great cast, some nice visuals and great music, this is an underrated film in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Poor Man's 'Da Vinci Code'!,"Here is ""The Da Vinci Code"" simplified and ready to entertain the entire family! The story draws upon the legendary lost treasure of the medieval Knights Templar filtered through the Freemasons, the Founding Fathers, and three generations of the fictional Gates family, as played by Christopher Plummer, Jon Voigt, and Nicholas Cage. The film follows Cage's Ben Gates in a lifetime quest for the Templar treasure.Ben's search takes him to Washington, D.C. where he finds himself in the predicament of stealing the Declaration of Independence in order to learn precious clues and prevent the priceless document from falling into the hands of the film's villains.In an interview following the film's premiere on cable television, Nicholas Cage called the plot ""an absurd concept."" Yet for the most part, the film delivered two hours of solid action entertainment. While the script could have been more sophisticated, ""National Treasure"" nonetheless succeeded with the likable Cage backed up with a fine supporting cast. The location filming provided memorable shots of our nation's capital, Philadelphia, and New York City.For the lively action, a bit of romance, the suspense, and the scenery, this film would have an appeal to film viewers of all ages, especially the younger crowd.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Loot Of Our Founding Fathers,"National Treasure is one fanciful tale of Sean Bean and Nicholas Cage each seeking what is the treasure of the Knights Templar which got handed down to our Founding Fathers and hidden away for over 200 years. Of course Bean is quite a bit less scrupulous than Cage, but guess who triumphs in the end?Our story takes us from the Arctic, to the Smithsonian in Washington, to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and finally to New York City near the site of George Washington's Inaugural. Once the action gets going it doesn't pause for too many minutes. National Treasure borrows a great deal in plot and pace from the Indiana Jones films.Of course this plot has enough bullet holes in it that one with a reasonable knowledge of American history can find, but it's still a rather enjoyable film. Harvey Keitel is fine as the FBI agent pursuing Cage who's looking for the treasure and pursuing and avoiding Bean at the same time. Why is the FBI after Cage? Well he stole something rather irreplaceable.Of course the part that I find a bit preposterous is the fact of where the location was. I can't believe that with the amount of excavation for construction done around there, the treasure wasn't located a hundred years ago.Best in the film is Justin Bartha as Cage's sidekick. He has a really great deadpan delivery of the best lines in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Indiana Jones minus the gore,"This one gets my vote for the most enjoyable flick of 2004 (together with The Indredibles).

The cheesy bits are mellowed with a dash of wry humor, and those that aren't: well, just take them, don't cringe and, again, have fun!I came out of this movie smiling, as did my wife and elder daughter (that would make all of us into definite 'adults').

Indiana Cage,"It's not Nic Cages or the filmmakers fault, but Indiana Jones did set a standard for adventure movies. And if it involves artifacts or anything of value (as in this case) than the first thing that springs to mind is Mr. Jones.Of course there are differences and this movie can stand on it's own two feet! Especially with a comedic sidekick like the one on display here. He's worth the ticket/renting price alone. Maybe you think his jokes are so good, that you have to buy the DVD. Whatever the case is, this movie is just plain good ol' fun. And while the female lead does not entirely convince here (maybe playing the most beautiful girl in the world - Troy - was already her peak? The question comes to mind, because how could you possibly top that role, right?), the movie has a feel good vibe to it. While Mr. Harvey Keitel is more a bystander, he does add to the flavor of the movie.

Benjamin Gates and the Raiders of the Lost Treasure,"""National Treasure"" isn't a great film - nor is it a terrible one.The film's opening set-up is nice. Always good to see Christopher Plummer.Right after the films' initial set-up, it jumps right into the slightly monotonous clue after clue storyline that it follows for the duration. Most of the scenario's are extremely far-fetched, but the production values, music, and cast help numb-us to the fact that this story is beyond implausible.The film is never boring or dull, but it also isn't as funny as it thinks it is. Riley and Ben take jabs back-and-forth throughout the movie, and almost none of them work comically.The journey here is one that can be enjoyed for the visual sight-gags(for lack of a better term), and the historical contexts used throughout the film.I for one felt like I was rooting them-on as they went from one clue to the next, and the film, while not necessarily deep or well-written, is bolstered by a cast that makes the most of an average script. Bean, Kruger, Keitel and Voigt really add some substance to this otherwise childish affair.This is definitely a guilty pleasure for me. I realize how ridiculous this whole thing is, but the pacing and 'intrigue-around-every-corner' make this infinitely watchable despite all it's short-comings.This is surely an audience divider, but if you like 'popcorn-fare' you should enjoy it. If you prefer historically accurate, dramatic films, then I'd pass on this one.63/100 I gave the sequel similar marks.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"National Treasure cryptically explores Freemasonry, occasionally striking treasured gold.","Adventurous mysteries. From 'Indiana Jones' to 'The Da Vinci Code'. Archaeologists, symbologists, cryptologists and all-round treasure hunters. Journeying with these characters through flawed history never ceases to enthral me. Succumbing to the comfort of my sofa as our protagonists uncover the next clue on their prolonged quest. National Treasure is no different, which sees an amateur cryptologist search for a hidden stockpile of artefacts accumulated by American Freemasons. ""How?"" You must be wondering. Well, by stealing the Declaration of Independence which is concealing an invisible coded map leading to the forgotten treasure. But he is not alone in his quest. A rival also seeks ""the secret"" that ""lies with Charlotte"". And so begins the race against time, with two opponents attempting to outwit each other by solving each clue before the other.The iridescent beauty of adventurous mysteries is the sheer velocity to which the narrative pace flows, an aspect Turteltaub clearly succeeded in implementing. The repetitious nature of its structure, which sees characters search for clues until their destination is reached, instantly maintains a light buoyancy throughout. Gates and his two prot√©g√©s never spend more than twenty minutes on each clue, before either being interrupted or rapidly solving it. This therefore results in no stagnation, crucial for family-friendly flicks that Disney infamously produce. Whilst the overall theme of the plot is underdeveloped (Freemasonry is an absurdly heavy subject to tackle), it does not require prior knowledge to fully comprehend each clue. The screenplay explains each cryptic puzzle with humour, thanks to the character of Riley, and an urgent sense of mystery (especially the Ottendorf cipher). It organically captivates.Cage, Kruger and Bartha worked well together and provided natural chemistry, even if the romance was somewhat forced and embryonic. Two adjectives I cannot utilise to describe the production design however, which was absolutely incredible. Showcasing US history through the locales of the National Archives, Independence Hall and Trinity Church's catacombs.Unfortunately though, suspension of disbelief is required to fully enjoy National Treasure. The sheer amount of implausibilities within its plot does plague the legitimacy of the mystery. The Declaration of Independence surely has to be one of the most guarded artefacts in America, right? Cage comes along and steals it within twenty minutes. The likelihood of a tall building being erected in between the Sun and Independence Hall? High. Meaning Gates would not have found that brick. Then there are the plot conveniences, such as a bus providing insight for Riley to finish his riddle just before the antagonistic Sean Bean finds him, that induce several eye-rolling moments. Speaking of beans, Sean's luscious locks in this were distracting. Really distracting. And Voight's as well!Alas, National Treasure knows what it is. A straightforward yet fun family adventure, with hints of historic mystery to fascinate audiences. Highly improbable? Absolutely. Does it hinder the overall enjoyment? Well, that's for you to decide. Personally, it's a hidden gem that the Freemasons forgot to bury.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Overly long, often ludicrous, but still reasonably fun","Please don't take this movie seriously. If you do so it will prove impossible to enjoy it. The whole thing is implausible, impossible, utterly ridiculous. But having said that, it's not all that bad actually. No, you cannot steal the Declaration of Independence. And if you somehow do, you certainly can't constantly be rolling and unrolling it like some old Farrah Fawcett poster you used to have on your wall as you take it out of its handy carrying tube. Squirting lemon juice on it and blowing on it with a hair dryer would probably not be good ideas either. But try not to think about these things. Thinking is not recommended as you watch this movie. Just turn off your brain, enjoy it as best you can, and when it's over you can look back and say, ""well that was all rather silly wasn't it?""Anyhow our rather silly yet reasonably engrossing plot follows treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates, as played by Nicolas Cage. Gates comes to believe that clues to the location of a treasure of unimaginable wealth are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Well that makes perfect sense now doesn't it? Gates decides he must steal the Declaration before the bad guys get to it. Oy, there's always gotta be bad guys. Anyhow, with the help of National Archivist (and requisite love interest because we must have a love interest...its a rule or something) Abigail Chase, played by Diane Kruger, Gates stays one step ahead of the requisite bad guys and deciphers clue after clue which inevitably lead to...more clues. The movie starts to drag and you get the sense a good half hour or so could have been cut out and nobody would have missed it.In the two lead roles Cage and Kruger do pretty well with the material they have to work with. So much of the movie is impossibly silly but they more or less make it work. Playing the role of the requisite comic sidekick Justin Bartha unfortunately fails to be the least bit funny. In fact you'll find that when the movie tries to be funny it is desperately unfunny but in what are meant to be serious moments you may find yourself trying to stifle a giggle. That's not good. Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight float in and out but don't make much of an impression. But I'm sure they collected nice paychecks.The whole thing is so formulaic...you have seen this movie before and you have seen it done a lot better. Indiana Jones anyone? But it is what it is and it's not all bad. You'll probably wish it was shorter. You'll probably wish it was funnier. You'll probably wish it was at least remotely plausible.

"Formalaic, though entertaining.","Of course this movie is a simple version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" but at least it's more entertaining to watch. It has just as many vague and unlikely clues at some unlikely historical places and on historical items, that lead to even more clues about the location of a large treasure.The whole concept of treasure hunting is of course one that really speaks to the imagination and this movie greatly takes advantage of this, by putting in the movie every formulaic element you would expect from a movie like this one.It's not that the movie is bad but it just isn't anything fresh or renewing either. It's an Indiana Jones and ""The Da Vinci Code"" wannabe that doesn't add enough on its own to the genre. Nothing wrong with a little bit 'borrowing' from other movies, as long as it works good for the movie and its story. ""National Treasure"" is a movie that entertains but that's basically all there really can be said about the movie.The story is fun and adventurous and the movie features some good actors that are being played by some surprising big names. The movie has some good moments and action sequences, that aren't too big (the movie most certainly does not look like an $100,000,000 movie) but are entertaining nevertheless.The movie is good looking with a good visual style and a nice suiting action score from specialist Trevor Rabin.It's a bit of a shame that the movie is just so formulaic. Nothing in the movie comes as a surprise and it features all of the typical elements you would expect from a movie like this one. At times the movie could had really used some more originality to make it more entertaining-, or at least less predictable to watch. Like I said before, the movie is still good and fun enough to watch but it could had really been so much better with a tiny bit more of originality of its own.The characters are also quite formulaic, though it fits the genre well I guess; a friend turns villain, a love interest and a comical sidekick. Why do movies always think they should have comical sidekicks? It's starting to get really annoying, especially if the characters aren't even funny, like in this movie is the case. It sort of helps though that all of the characters are being played by some well known names. I like Nicolas Cage and he shows that he can also play a convincing main 'heroic' character. Sean Bean plays the villain and like expected he does this in a great way, like only he can play a villain. The movie further more also features Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Plummer in some smaller roles.All good fun, as long as you don't expect something original- or to be blown away by it all.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Yeah,"I've always been into the kind of movies that play on things that are there, I guess it's because that's what I've always done while waiting in line or anything at that. This movie reminds me of what the kid from The Goonies became after a few years it kind of fits in with the whole, ""there is treasure everywhere you just have to find it,"" feel that left a smile on my face as I left. With good comic releef and good acting I think that it was decent at the least.

Not bad but not very good either,Cage does a good acting job with what he has to work with and Kruger is OK too but doesn't do a whole lot either. Bean is fine as well but nothing stands out here that is worth mentioning. I was disappointed to tell you the truth I figured it would be better than it was. The plot was fairly well conceived but didn't pay off like it should have I guess it reeked of too much Disney. Bruckheimer films don't impress me that much either as Jerry seems to go for mindless explosions and action with not a lot of substance. Too bad too because it could have been more than just decent. One comment on the boards said this movie was made to make the Da Vinci Code look good. True? It wouldn't surprise me. Not worth watching twice.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fun film,"A Hollywood action film that feels incredibly packaged and cheesy at times, but it's good fun nonetheless, and rather nostalgic for me.

Heretofore unknown blond beauty Diane Kruger as the Treasury Agent who tries to stop Cage before developing a fascination with his quest is solid and enticing. Justin Bartha is delightful as Cage's drool right hand man, Riley.

"Modern ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in America","If you can imagine a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type story taking place in modern America, you'd have a fairly good idea of what ""National Treasure"" is like. Nicolas Cage plays the Indiana Jones-type treasure hunter, Benjamin Franklin Gates, accompanied by his partner (Justin Bartha) and romantic interest (Diane Kruger), the latter a historical document scholar who gets dragged into the wild proceedings.THE PLOT: Gates feels he has no choice but to audaciously steal the Declaration of Independence to save it from his nemesis (Sean Bean). The document has an invisible clue on its flip side, which supposedly leads to a vast, coveted 'national treasure.' Can Gates successfully swipe the document, elude the Feds, and ultimately find the ancient fortune before his murderous, greedy rival? And can he simultaneously ""get the babe"" as well?""National Treasure"" put a big grin on my face throughout its entire runtime. Like 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" you're not supposed to dwell too deeply on the events because, if you do, the implausibilities will start to mount up. Nevertheless, even though this was made to be a fun, eminently entertaining ride, it still somehow stimulates ruminations and interest in American history. Not a bad byproduct, no?A handful of miscellaneous items:Diane Kruger, who played 'the face that launched a thousand ships' in 2004's ""Troy,"" is sharp and all-around pleasant on the eyes.The score is modern with thrilling orchestrations intermingled with HEAVY progressive guitar riffs. It was composed by, believe it or not, Yes' guitarist/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Like ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" this is a soundtrack worth owning; it's that superlative.The protagonists are all likable; heck, even the head Fed, played by Harvey Keitel, is likable.The chases are thrilling.The film was shot on location in Washington D. C., Philadelphia and New York City.Jon Voight plays Gate's father.Like ""Raiders"" this is a family-friendly experience -- upbeat with no needless cussing, sex or gore. The movie leaves you with a good feeling.CLOSING THOUGHT: Despite the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it 'thumbs down' -- Roeper even calling it 'Howling, howling BAD' -- ""National Treasure"" was a huge hit with audiences in 2004. This shows that critics like Roeper see WAY too many movies. They can't even lighten-up enough to enjoy a fun, thrilling, historically-stimulating popcorn flick. Implausible? Yes (at times, anyway). Bad? No.Make no mistake, ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining quasi-believable adventure film. It's got the mojo.The movie runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.GRADE: B+/A-",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrible cookie cutter waste of time,"The cookie cutter script itself has become so clich√©d that you'd think most studios would avoid it. But alas, it supposedly will sell tickets.

This movie was so amazingly unbelievable (so many things conveniently occur or are allowed to happen) and poorly written (the forefathers somehow were able to create images on the back of the Constitution with material that was probably only available in the last 20 years), I'm saddened that it made money.

Too much Da Vinci Code,"This movie, though very entertaining (hence my 7 out of 10) looks as if it a pre-release of ""The Da Vinci Code"". So many elements have been taken from Dan Brown's bestseller, that most of the plot felt familiar to me, having read (as we all have) the Dan Brown book. The main difference is that not ancient documents from biblical times are the basis for all the action, but the a more recent document. Furthermore there are so many parallels (the running from one clue to another, the Freemasons, the vaults beneath churches etc.) that it looks as if Disney wanted to pick some of the credit of Dan Brown, while he still could, before the movie of the Da Vinci Code is among us.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""The clues are right in front of your eyes""","A treasure hunter is in hot pursuit of a mythical treasure that has been passed down for centuries, while his employer turned enemy is onto the same path that he's on.Plagued by bad reviews, hated by the critics, but looked totally awesome? I've now experienced this, with National Treasure. I love those treasure hunting movies, where they are going from clue to clue to get somewhere. National Treasure, I believe, perfects this and modernizes what could've been a bad experience... The acting in this film is probably it's lowest point. We all know how Nicholas Cage is going to do, but everybody else seemed like they weren't into it. Disney isn't the best at this isle anyways, so I didn't worry about it that much. The plot was pretty cool. People criticize the movie because of the clues and how ""stupid"" they were. Well, maybe you didn't know this, but this movie was made by Disney. They aren't the best at creating intellectual plots, but they can do it enough to entertain you. I was actually enjoying how the characters lead their selves up to the final clue, it was an enjoyable experience. I also liked the soundtrack. I thought, for once, Disney invested some of their time to create a fun soundtrack that fits the film. Times, the movie was an modern action-adventure, but at others, the movie resembled Indiana Jones; and that's always great. Also, in a while polluted by violent films, the parents would find this a nice surprise. It's good for the whole entire family, but occasionally Disney slips in a few subtle nods as always. So if you want a film that's mixed with Indiana Jones (adventure, clue-solving) and then even a little mixture of heist films; this is for you! Ignore Disney's way of doing things and take it for what it is. I give it an 7/10 for being something I thoroughly enjoyed. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slow start to the fast passed story,"A treasure has been passed from hand to hand and growing for centuries. The freemasons, last to hold the treasure hid the treasure, presumably in the U. S.

Now they are at odds as to how to go about finding a string of clues. We get to guess along with them and if we are knowledgeable, we can stay ahead of them.This is a formula story with standard action mixing such things as ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Indiana Jones"".

Joyous boys own yarn full of the serial silliness of movies past and present.,"Hee, for a family adventure film that made a profit of over $247 million at the worldwide box office, you would think there would be more people standing up for the film and its subsequent sequel. Yet admitting to enjoying National Treasure is frowned upon, like it was some fluke of a hit and anyone bold enough to stick up for it clearly has taken leave of their respective senses.National Treasure is what it is in simplistic terms, a rollicking good adventure yarn, one that is ripe with outlandish writing and implausibilities a go go, in other words fun fun FUN! Detractors can call it an Indiana Jones rip off all they like, but really what is wrong with that formula being followed anyway? Is it not allowed to be copied? Bizarre given that the Indy films owe their very being to a handful of action adventure films of old. While comparisons to The Da Vinci Code are fair if out of context given the target audience for the Tom Hanks starrer.Plot basically finds Nick Cage as Benjamin Gates, a historian and cryptologist who is searching for some lost treasure once protected by the Knights Templar. Hired by Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Gates finds an important clue but is betrayed by Howe and his cronies and has to continue his search with Howe hot on his tail. Along for the ride with Gates are National Archives expert Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and computer whizz kid Riley Poole (Justin Bartha). Story lurches from one clue to another, with much crash banging and escapades aplenty, while Harvey Keitel's cop enters the fray when the film's MacGuffin is stolen.National Treasure is streamlined for the family audience, yes some of the cryptic wafflings will go over youngsters heads, and for sure it helps to have a modicum of American history knowledge, yet this is still a picture the whole family can enjoy whilst sitting in the same room together. It obviously lacks an end of the world peril, or the breakdown of religious society, but the action does flow and drama is not in short supply (the Declaration of Independence scenes are expertly constructed). The cast, with the exception of the bland Kruger, attack the material with the requisite tongue in cheek gusto, particularly Cage who make geeks cool and Bartha with astute comic ability, and viewing it in High Definition reveals some beautiful colour photography by Caleb Deschanael.Credulity is stretched, it goes over the top and malarkey often reigns supreme, but the makers aren't making a cerebral thriller. They achieve exactly what they set out to do, to make a fun action mystery adventure film that doffs its cap to films of previous years. Roll on to the sequel, I hope it's equally as fun and outlandish... 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

very good summer time movie.,"National Treasure is one of those films that you really have to check out for your-self and make your mind up . This movie for me makes a change from the normal type of films that I check out in the sense that it was not that heavy at all . The good thing about it was that it moved at a good pace and really did not fire of into in sub-plot or and twists that were too complicated , the humour was funny and sharp but another good thing about this film was that the action was quick sharp , not really gory at all which was surprisingly good to be really honest but the good thing about National Treasure was that unlike a Schwartznegger action flick where the action is over flowing all over the place this one was in quick short bursts leaving you wanting more . I also learnt a bit about the American history so it is educational to some extend to those who don't know that much about American history . The acting was great , especially the father son relationship between Cage and Voight and lets not forget about Sean Bean after all he was 006 !!!. The only let down would be that this would be one of those movies that appeal to fans of Nicolas Cage and people who enjoyed the Tomb Raider flicks and to those fans who also enjoyed movies like Ocean's 11 as it did try and incorporate these high-tech heist scenes which were enjoyable having said that .

Suspense-filled action film great for the whole family,"This movie is kind of sort of a combination of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Amazing Race"". You may find yourself asking, ""Who has the Declaration now?"" or ""Where's the next clue?"" The whole family can enjoy it--kudos to Disney for mild and limited profanity and no nudity, which proves you don't need those things to have a great movie.Granted, parts of it are very unrealistic, especially stealing the Declaration of Independence, but let's remember that this is a movie, and a little entertainment is what it's all about. Cage and Kruger are both attractive and work very well together. Ian (Sean Bean) is probably the most interesting character. Clearly he's the main antagonist, but he impresses me as more clever than anything else, and only wants to ""borrow"" the Declaration rather than steal it. And Riley's (Barta) dry humor is enjoyed throughout.Highly entertaining, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seats.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The clue is NOT in the title,"Once upon a time, back when Nicolas Cage could actually 'sell' a big budget movie, some clever producer at Disney came up with a script for 'Indiana Jones' mixed with 'Ocean's Eleven.' Then someone else added a dash of 'True Lies' and then wrapped it up in 'The Da Vinci Code,' before the man in charge of the money mentioned that whatever this Frankenstein's monster of a film had to be fit for all the family... and promptly gave it a PG rating. What once might have been a good idea with a major star somehow became something that was less than the multitude of all its inspirations. And that's a shame, because I think - once upon a time - there was a good film in here trying to get out.It opens with a young boy (later we discover is Nicolas Cage) being told by his grandfather about an artefact in US history that has been long forgotten and only accessible via certain clues left by their forefathers. And tell the boy he does. This opening scene goes on for about ten minutes (it felt like more) and is basically one long exposition dump setting up what the characters will later be looking for. When it finally ends, we join Cage and his team in the arctic (or a studio in California that has a freezer in it). They all find something and spend the next ten minutes adding more exposition as to how they will eventually use this new information to track it down.I get the feeling that at this stage the producers realised that what they were making was a little 'talk heavy' and figured they better blow something up in order to wake the audience up (hopefully not literally). Cue an action scene and a reminder to all American adventurers never to include a Brit among your party as Sean Bean decides it's time to pull off an early double-cross and - guess what - the film's villain is revealed to us all.National Treasure' is not a short film. It's close to two hours of more of the same. The characters are never really given any time to develop. Diane Kruger is the (tragically so) generic 'love interest' for Cage. There's a younger guy who I never got his on screen name and can't be bothered to look up the actor's name - he's the comic relief. As I mentioned, Sean Bean is the villain because... er, he's British. That appears to be his only real motivation for wanting to get ancient relics before Cage (or Indiana Jones, I guess). Expect more generic action, more generic characters and a hell of a lot more generic exposition.Cage does his best with the script that he's given and, although he's never afforded the luxury of going 'the full Cage' (fans of his will know what that means), he does his best with what he's given. But he's not given much. There's no real chemistry between him and anyone else. And that's not their fault either. No matter how good any of the actors are, they just look bored - Sean Bean especially!I know a film doesn't have to be completely be original to be good. In fact, pretty much everything's been done now in terms of story-telling, so we're used to things being repackaged and churned out, just in a slightly different way that now makes them - at least appear - watchable. However, 'National Treasure's' biggest problem is that it just doesn't know what it wants to be. The obvious genre would be 'adventure' (ala 'Indiana Jones'), but then it veers off to some sort of comic spy movie like 'True Lies,' before quickly trying to pull off a heist like 'Ocean's Eleven.' I know many good films that have combined genres and worked; in fact... most do! However, this is an example of a film exceeding its reach and trying to be too many things at once and not having a - true - target audience in mind and ending up appealing to very few.I wonder how well it did in America, compared to the rest of the world. To quote (the far superior) 'Team America: World Police' it is pretty 'America! F*%k yeah!' all the way through. Perhaps this is a 'national treasure' to the good citizens of the US of A, whereas out here in that small part of the world known as 'everywhere else,' it all feels a little overblown and self-indulgent to be the classic it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie is just as big a treasure as the national treasure itself!,"""National Treasure"" (2004), when I first watched this film, I went into the theater with low expectations. Sometimes that's a good thing, and sometimes that's a bad thing. But in the case of ""National Treasure"", I'm ecstatic I did. I went in there to see it, and I loved every second of it! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations, and a perfect soundtrack. At first glance, the story sounds like your every day treasure hunt. But, this movie takes that concept and turns it up to 11! This is one of those movie storylines where I was invested, excited, and there were a few occasional laughs along the way. It hit all the right notes, and it was one of the fastest two hours of my life! That's when you know you have a great movie, when it goes by fast. The cast is fantastic! Nicolas Cage, Sean Bean, Justin Bartha, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, and more. They all perform their roles flawlessly. Of course, Nicolas Cage steals the show! Now overall, Nicolas Cage is one of those hit or miss actors. He has had both good and bad roles throughout his movie career. However, his role in ""National Treasure"" as Benjamin Gates is perfect for him. Had some other actor played the role, it may not have worked. This, in my opinion, is Nicolas Cage's best role and performance! As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they all perform their roles perfectly and all of the actors have great chemistry. Sean Bean is a brilliant as Ian, the villain. One thing to point out, Sean Bean's character doesn't die in this film, that's a first! Isn't it? Justin Bartha is hilarious as Riley, Diane Kruger is great as Abigail, Jon Voight is funny as Patrick (Ben's father), Harvey Keitel as Agent Sadusky is stellar, etc. The special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. All of the sets/locations are perfect and really set the tone for the movie. Finally, the film soundtrack, composed by Trevor Rabin, is fantastic! It also helps set the tone, and really helps bring the movie to life. ""National Treasure"" is a great movie watching experience. Sometimes, you can actually forget that it's a Disney film! Director Jon Turteltaub, you definitely did an outstanding job with this movie! I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I obviously give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""National Treasure"", what are you waiting for? Go watch it today!

"Cheesy, silly but enjoyable 'Raiders' knock-off.","My Take: As over-the-top as it may be, this summer movie is enjoyable and actually not as idiotic as it might have been.There's no doubt the plot of NATIONAL TREASURE is ludicrous and just plain silly, but who said it can't be fun? Although it's incredibly silly and the plot is mostly lifted from Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE, it's still quite fun, and it really doesn't take itself way too seriously, so why should you? NATIONAL TREASURE probably knows it's dumb, if not, why shouldn't it? This is not the material that one should apply logic to. It is what it is, a silly dumb summer blockbuster. Check your brains at the door, grab a tub of popcorn and have a ball.Nicolas Cage probably wanted to take a rest from the Oscars and plays a pedestrian role as obsessed explorer Ben Gates, who has spent much of his life in search of a treasure long been searched by his family legacy, as we were told by his grandfather (Christopher Plummer, in a cameo) at flashback during the beginning of the movie. For his whole life, Gates has not thought about anything else but to look for this treasure. Uh... hasn't anyone recommended this guy to get a job? Anyway, Gates search leads him to a series of mind-bending clues which, due to his expertise (or shall I say obsession) on history, he gets by them really quickly. His configurations are impressively clever, but when it comes to his solutions at the start, but the gets pretty overblown as it goes.In fact, NATIONAL TREASURE isn't just full of these overblown plot twists, it's also filled with clich√©s and plot holes that almost built around the entire film. Whether it's clich√©s from recent action films, or clich√©s that date back to the old times where they eventually came from in the first place. This is, actually, an outmoded piece of old-fashioned escapism. But who said it can't be fun being that way? This is a mildly engaging, silly adventure film. It's old-fashioned to the extremes, and it doesn't have the same touches of greatness that fills the nostalgia of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film which this one obviously wanted to be, but it has it's neat touches and it is quite an efficient little action thriller. Silly, but silly fun just the same.Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are we there yet? I'm hungry. This car smells weird.,"National Treasure was a failure as a film. While the monetary figures will not support this comment, I will say that upon viewing this film, it is nothing but accurate. From the clich√©d story, to the cheap acting, to even the simplistic ""clues"" National Treasure proved that if you have a big named actor in the lead, some pre-high school history, and a powerhouse producer (and the big Pirates of the Caribbean passion) that you could literally sell a screen door on a submarine. What was the excitement behind this film? Why is there still a waiting list at my video store for this title? There was nothing of value from the beginning to end of this film that would ever cause the hysteria that I have seen so far. Nicolas Cage proves to the world that he is the male version of Marisa Tomei (questioning his choices after his deserved Oscar win), and that he has the ability to run, jump, and reason with the greatest of speed. Acting wasn't necessarily needed, just the ability to look smarter than one truly is.With my questions posed as to how the success of this film became a part of American cinema, I thought back to this film. The acting was atrocious. Nic Cage looked and acted just like a mannequin throughout this entire film. There was no range of emotion or excitement in anyway. His romantic involvement with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) was like watching two complete strangers try to build a passionate relationship in ten minutes. It was awkward, cheesy, and embarrassing for all those involved. Even the acting from the ""comic relief"" of the film, Cage's sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) seemed forced. His jokes didn't make me laugh once, but instead made me feel uneasy and cheated out of some hard earned cash plopped down for this film. To have a successful ""action-adventure"" film, you must have it firmly stapled with some decent acting. If big stars are only going to water down your film (as in the case of National Treasure), then you must find smaller stars and build upon the story. These are simple rules, which nobody in this production followed.With no acting in place, I was forced to watch the story unfold before my eyes. Actually, the story felt like a crumpled piece of paper thrown at me. There was no direction, no points for me to follow, but instead haphazard movement by our actors and director to keep the flow of the film in motion instead of becoming stale. Sadly, they were unable to do this. From the opening ""clue"" to the final one, there was little to no explanation as to why nobody else had found this treasure, or how local historians had never found the hidden artifacts scattered around hugely populated areas. I would understand if we were searching cornfields, but we were in metropolises and nobody discovered these clues until today. It was just rather unbelievable to me. I felt like this story was yelling at me. Violently forcing me to follow each clue without explanation, but out of sheer hope that something bigger would happen. I work better when there is some moment of ""why"" thrown into the mix. A moment that allows the viewers to think for themselves instead of being treated like children. After viewing this film, that was how I felt. I felt like I couldn't make my own decisions, but instead the power of Bruckheimer was forcing me to think in one way, and one way only. It hurt this film and upset me until the final credits arrived.Finally, I would like to say (because I am sure that most are upset with my dislike of this film) that another point that hurt this film was the lack of action. This movie is labeled as the next Indiana Jones, but if you grew up with the stories of Lucas and Spielberg, you will remember that they were action based. There were moments of realization, but there was much more action involved. I think more action incorporated into the National Treasure story would have helped it survive a bit longer than what it did. I wanted to see some traps set forth by our founding fathers, some ancient guards, or anything that would have lifted the lifeless plot that surrounded this film. My mother said that it just needed better bad guys, and I couldn't agree more. There wasn't that fire in Bean's eyes that you were accustomed to seeing in the Indy films. Nobody was tied up, nobody had a whip, and nobody was trying. Bruckheimer, you literally need to stop.Overall, I wasn't impressed with this Hollywood ""hit"". While most will argue that they thought it was the most impressive film they have seen in a long time (words that I have heard time and time again), I just thought that it never went to the next level. The clich√© acting hurt this film dearly, while the story just never reached up and grabbed me. I never felt like Turtletaub (ummmmmm....Turtletaub) quite knew what he was getting himself into. He needed a stronger balance between action and adventure, and needed to allow us to make our own decisions instead of forcing his thoughts into our face. This film was a complete disrespect to our history, and I denounce it forever!Grade: * out of *****",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Massive suspension of disbelief required,"To view this movie, you better suspend your disbelief at the door. Better yet, bury it. Otherwise, the premise involving intricate codes sprinkled everywhere to reveal an immense treasure will look downright ridiculous and comical.Everybody from the ancient Egyptians, to the Romans, to the Knights of Templar to the Free Masons to Ben Franklin to George Washington are behind this scheme. Half of the people who ever lived were apparently involved in some conspiracy to gather gold stuff and then hide it somewhere. With clues everywhere to find it. And more clues. I'm surprised DaVinci and his ""codes"" weren't mentioned as being involved. Or the second shooter from the grassy knoll. Or O.J. Simpson. Or Oliver Stone. Or the Aflac Duck.Nicholas Cage finds cleverly hidden artifacts with clues, and then solves them faster than Batman and Robin unravelling the Riddler's rhymes on the old TV show. Some girl who works for the government and whose acting looks like a schoolgirl in Drama 101 helps him. Some guy tries to croak him in every scene but always goofs it up. Although Jon Voight's work in the film is good, his character is written inconsistently. Like the whole script.My favorite, however, is the depiction of the systems ""protecting"" the Declaration of Independence. In this movie, one of those bozos on ""World's Dumbest Criminals"" could heist this priceless document, and nobody would be the wiser. Then a bunch of Keystone Cop FBI guys run around accomplishing nothing except more comedy.Far beyond the limits of plausible if you take it at face value. But if you give the flick about of ton of poetic license, it can be good for a laugh or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great for a Friday Night Family Movie,"Although the historical accuracy of this movie is questionable, as is some of the action and plot points (such as the break-in at the National Archives), it is a thoroughly enjoyable yarn that kids and parents alike will most likely find enjoyable. Nicholas Cage does a mediocre job as Ben Gates, the latest descendant in a line of ""treasure protectors,"" as does Diane Kruger as his love interest. Sean Bean is, of course, wonderful as always as Ian, the ""bad guy""; he is truly unappreciated as an actor. The real show-stealer, however, is Justin Bartha, whose one-liners and comic timing make this movie much more enjoyable. I hope we will be seeing more of him in the future.

Exciting!!,"Ooooh, I love treasure hunt movies! I prefer them not set in present time, but 'National Treasure' did not disappoint. There's greed, back stabbing, double crossing, mystery - everything you expect from a treasure hunt!Nicolas Cage stars as Benjamin Gates, whose family has been treasure hunters for some time - as well as being made fun of in the process. Benjamin's friend, Riley (Justin Bartha) serves as the film's comic relief, and he was funny and likable, and thankfully never slapstick. Diane Kruger is Abigail Chase, who reluctantly becomes part of the treasure hunt. Sean Bean is the antagonist, Ian.There were some credibility issues, but heck, this film was so exciting, they can be overlooked. Clues to the treasure points to an invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, so they come up with a plan to steal (erm, make that borrow) one of the most guarded documents in America. However, things doesn't go as planned and we find our heroes running for their lives on a few occasions.I loved the adventure element, as well as mystery and interesting reveals. The climax features an excellent Production Design. This movie offers everything I want to be entertained. This was exciting and I loved it!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Absolutely ridiculous, I can't deny it. But who cares?","If someone tells you the story of National Treasure, I'm sure you'll experience an amount of difficulty controlling your laugh. That's because the story √≠s ridiculous. The whole movie is ridiculous, actually. Nicolas Cage manages to immediately understand the most difficult signs in his search for this enormous treasure. And that's a good point, because this way the audience doesn't have to do the thinking. Not that anyone successfully could do this thinking...Anyway, this movie is absurd, it's ridiculous and the story doesn't make any sense at all. Some scenes, like the one in the beginning on one of the poles where Cage and co easily locate a ship that's been lost for thousands of years, make you laugh by it's stupidness. But this is the one movie I like more and more every time I think about it. It's fantastic, just because of this ridiculous story. See for yourself: you'll love it!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Softer Side of Bruckheimer,"When you think of a Jerry Bruckheimer action film you think of hard core stuff like ""Con Air"", ""The Rock"" or the ""Bad Boy"" pictures. ""National Treasure"" is a watered down version of those films and more in the realm of say ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".Nicolas Cage plays a treasure hunter with a deep historical background, and he travels all over the country in search for historical treasures, much like Indiana Jones. When his crew comes across some clues, he believes that there is an invisible treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. It's suddenly a race to retrieve the document before the competition does. The competition, of course is a former member of Cage's team and a bad guy. Cage hooks up with a beautiful historian (Diane Kruger) and with his faithful sidekicks' help, the three of them try and solve the mystery.The movie is contrived and silly. It's loaded with clich√©d characters and much of this has been done before. But I liked it. It's a fun film that uses a little bit of humor, some history, has some action, and really is pretty harmless. The film doesn't have any profanity, and I don't the kill counter is at a bare minimum. You can take the whole family to see this and not worry too much. Just have fun. (***)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure ¬ñ A Splendid Adventure,"National Treasure is a splendid adventure that hearkens back to an old age where treasure hunters, pirates, kings and exotic locales were part of everyday life and lore. The movie limited itself in scope, being a Disney film, it had to be clean and kosher for the even the six year old suburban girl.Unlike many so-called 'historical fiction' type films, the history was accurate, as far as places and people are concerned. The film is a fast paced ride, where Cage and his colleagues move from one clue and area to another, slowly piecing the puzzle together as Dr. Jones did in Raiders of the Lost Ark.Unlike the classic Indiana Jones films, viewers are thrown into a much more modern and realistic environment, where everything from the US dollar bill to the Liberty Bell is used to try and find the treasure.This film is an entertaining one for anyone; its lack of special effects make is all the more refreshing.""Can there really be a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence?""

Good Movie to Watch,"This past weeks we haven't been blessed with too many good movies. This one is a different sort of movie. Good movies are usually defined by good actors and impressive acting. National Treasure is a different one. Some argue that the acting was not impressive and sometimes Nicholas Cage was acting like he was so bored. You would hardly notice this. The movie keeps you in constant awareness. You don't feel the time flying, you are trapped in a beautiful plot, conspiracy and good American humour. You would watch Nicholas cage act, appreciate Diane Kruger, but you would love Justin Bartha. This guy, is good. He is so good, that I would argue that he really is the man of the movie.

Terrific popcorn movie with fun performances...,"History buff Nicolas Cage, who as a young child was enraptured by his grandfather's story of hidden treasure left behind by a secret sect of our founding fathers, defies generations of failed attempts and hopes to locate the fortune which would be worth about ten billion dollars. Treasure map movies are usually a lot of fun if the clues are tasty enough and the characters engaging, and here (rather surprisingly) both are. Cage doesn't have much of a character to play (we get very little exposition about the man behind the obsession), yet his hangdog determination and dry delivery serves this frantic scenario well. The story isn't worked out fluidly, with holes and gaps of logic (and a point mid-way through involving an FBI helicopter where the plot almost capsizes). Still, Jon Turteltaub's direction is focused and exciting, helped immeasurably by fast editing and a handsome production, all of which pick up the slack--to the point where even the script holes are just about irrelevant. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good, interesting","It is a great film. Thw rhythm of this film is very compact. It made me feel excited.

They both mentioned the ""The Priory of Sion"", the Knights Templars, so I think the idea is from that book. If i was the adventurer, I will not own the whole treasure but I will leave a small part for myself. The large amount I will give to the government for social services. I think it was not safe for me if I am so rich. Before I go to get the treasure, I will also think more about the danger I will meet and it's worth to go or not?",,Anonymous,Mystery
Just too much to handle,"This is a big splashy movie, full of chases and escapes. It takes a page from books like ""The DaVinci Code."" Our national treasures are clues to more profound things. Those Freemasons are at it again. The theft of the Declaration of Independence should be easy; like breaking into Fort Knox. I just wish that more effort was made to explain how a bunch of buffoons are guarding this national treasure, where a guy with a phony copy can exchange it. I don't dislike the movie; I just want the writers to make it more complex. Cage, whom I really like as an actor, and his cohorts dance around, trying to find this deep dark secret. Where did they get so much expertise? I know about the original document that leads to their efforts, but there are things like secret compartments, anti theft devices, armed guards who know what they are doing. Then there are the bad guys. Why are they there? How did they just happen to show up? It's because you need someone other than the federal government to be the adversary. Someone with motives like yours, trying to get at the stash, before you.I did enjoy the theater experience because I was in the mood for a big adventure movie.

"Mission: Impossible by way of Indiana Jones, National Treasure is preposterous and often hokey, but Nicolas Cage's eccentricities elevate the material","Historian Benjamin ""Ben"" Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) grew up hearing legends of a legendary treasure that survived the fall of the Roman Empire, wound up in the care of the Knights Templar, before eventually coming into the stewardship of the Freemasons many of whom were founding fathers of the United States of America and devised a series of clues to its whereabouts with the first such clue entrusted to Gates' ancestor during Charles Carroll's death. While the legends surrounding Gates family and the legend of the treasure have made the Gates family name one of mockery and derision, Ben remained steadfast in his determination to find the treasure. Bankrolled by Entrepreneur Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Ben and his partner Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) find the first clue about a sunken ship in the Arctic that says the next clue is on the back of the Declaration of Independence. While Ian Howe is all too eager to steal the document in pursuit of the treasure, Ben is more hesitant which leads to Ian double crossing Ben. After failing to get the proper authorities interested in the potential heist of the Declaration, Ben decides the only way to protect the document is to steal it himself which brings them into reluctant alliance with skeptical archivist Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger).The script for national treasure was developed in 1997 with the initial idea coming from Oren Aviv and Charles Segars and scripted by Jim Kouf. The film was acquired by Disney for their Touchstone label and was to be directed by director Jon Turteltaub with Disney intent on having the film released in time for the Summer 2000 movie season, but due to script issues the film would fall into development hell while Turtletaub instead directed The Kid for Disney while issues with the script were ironed out. The film eventually regained traction in 2003 with the casting of Nicolas Cage after an additional nine additional writers had taken various stabs at the material with the final draft credited to Jim Kouf as well as Cormac and Marianne Wiberley. Upon release the film was a sizable hit for Disney making $347 million worldwide against a $100 million budget with $170 million coming from the United States. Critical reception tended to be on the mixed side with critics pointing out the hokeyness of the dialogue and preposterous nature of the conspiracy theories and treasure hunt on display but audiences certainly ate up the film with a sequel and expanded media franchise spawning from the film's success. For me National Treasure is very middle of the road adventure fare on its own, but it is elevated thanks to possessing a unique set of parts.Much like the 2003 Dan Brown novel The Da Vinci Code, National Treasure is a refresh of the adventure/treasure seeking format where in place of iconography associated with Amazon tribes or Ancient Egypt, the adventure is based around iconography and lore from western civilizations in this case the Knights Templar, and Freemason secret society conspiracy theories involving the founding fathers of the United States. This is all perfectly well and good material for a silly over the top adventure yarn but at 2 hours and 10 minutes and with a very overly solemn and reverent attitude complete with hokey dialogue about ""knowing in your heart"" that even the characters in the movie call attention to by saying ""no one talks like that"" it makes National Treasure's material slightly more leaden than you want with a movie like this, and I'd say its roughly on par with the TNT TV movie The Librarian: Quest for the Spear that aired on TV a few months after this film's release that while ridiculous at least had the buffer of being a made for TV production so it was afforded a bit more leeway.What does elevate this movie is in the casting of Nicolas Cage as Ben Gates and while the character isn't all that layered or interesting Cage's eccentric acting style does give Ben more identity and awkward charm than was probably present in the script which leads to him giving a memorable performance as the lead. Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger are also rather fun as Ben's companions (even if Diane Kruger's place as a love interest seems underdeveloped and borderline obligatory) and Sean Bean is having fun as Ben's rival Ian. The action sequences are only just ""okay"" as they're mostly very standard foot and car chases that don't have much lasting impact thanks to the PG rating and the only action beat that was legitimately thriller was a rotting spiral staircase that collapses leading to some impressive and thrilling moments.National Treasure does an A+ job with C- material and makes itself worth a viewing thanks mostly to the performances and commitment by the cast. The movie's a bit too long and has an overly solemn and sentimental attitude to its material that I feel was a mistake and if want to see a movie like this from around the same time I'd probably be more inclined to watch the Brenden Fraser Mummy movies or Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft: Tomb Raider because they were aware of how over the top and ridiculous they were and had fun with it (more successfully in The Mummy's case). For what it is, National Treasure is passable time filler.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ignore the History, Love the Suspense","National Treasure is the story of a cynical treasure-hunter named Jon Voight who has given up on the dream of finding his family's lost treasure.

Then the feathers hit the fan, as Voight searches for the treasure again and refuses to fail no matter how many nasty British thugs want him dead. This film soars high with action, suspense, a healthy dose of history (though sometimes inaccurate) and Harvey Keital.

National Treasure: 7/10,"Dontcha just hate Jerry Bruckheimer? I mean, Pearl Harbor sucked (and I miss you), and all of his movies are basically the same. It's a bunch of explosions, some stock characters, and a cheesy romance thrown in. National Treasure is no different. Then what sets this apart from all of Bruckheimer's other movies? The movie knows its absurd, knows its implausible and ultimately stupid, meaning that it can throw any reason out the window and alloy for some silly fun to overrule the movie. I can't regard anyone who calls this movie great as someone serious, but I also can't really see how someone could wave off this movie as being too light-hearted and can't enjoy the film for being the silly stupidity that it is.Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) descends from a long line of treasure hunters, looking for a treasure supposedly buried by the founding fathers. Generations before him have also looked, but to no avail. However, Ben, along with his wisecracking sidekicks/computer nerd Riley (Justin Bartha), find clues, while competing treasure hunter Ian (Sean Bean) follows close behind. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger of Troy and Wicker Park fame), as some sort of historical government official, comes along for the ride.As this is a Bruckheimer movie, I was expecting many forays into deep, dark tunnels with magical effects that almost (but don't) kill the main characters. Thankfully, that's only at the end; the majority of the movie's about stealing a priceless historical document. What could be cooler, really? If you think about it, it's completely against what we're supposed to be feeling, yet this all-American person decides to steal what's the backbone of our society for his own personal good. I mean, that's cool. The movie introduces many things that have no explanation (Benjamin Franklin's glasses, perchance?), have no reason why they could work, much like many other action/adventure movies. But, really, why care? The movie's entertaining. The action's there, the suspension of disbelief is there, and the fun's there.I'm not a huge Nicolas Cage fan (but I don't really detest him like some do), but he's fine here. I mean, he's not a tremendous actor, but you could do worse. Bean and Kruger (both, actually, were in Troy-you could do six degrees of Troy easily) were as expected. Bean usually plays the ""conniving evil British dude"" in movies like these, and Kruger is at least making a mainstream name for herself. Bartha could quite possibly be the next guy who, when you see him in a movie, say ""I KNOW that guy, I just don't know what else I saw him in."" But, the acting's not important, what's important is that National Treasure is a fun movie. It has the stamp of Bruckheimer all over it, but don't let that fool you.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for action violence and some scary images.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Too many clues, too few realistic outcomes","I have the perfect idea for a film. Underneath my bed mattress, there is a stain that if you squint just right, it kinda looks like an arrow pointing to the bathroom the other side of the hall. In the bathroom there is a can of Gillette shaving cream that if you read the label, it is noted that their office is located in Boston. Go to Boston and you will quickly be reminded by everyone you bump into that the Red Sox won the World Series for the first time in almost a hundred years. They beat the St. Louis Cardinals, so our adventure would take us to the famous Gateway Arch in Missouri. Now if you consider that the Red Sox beat the Cardinals winning four straight games, it would suggest that if you stand at the Arch when the clock strikes four, then the shadow it casts will lead you to a buried treasure. Except, don't expect to find the treasure right away. While digging through underground power lines and water pipes, you will then find a chamber that hasn't been opened for hundreds of years. When you enter the chamber, you will use the Gillette shaving can and a World Series ticket to make a key that opens to another room that has a ladder that leads back to my bedroom. The final chapter will contain all the excitement as I find a five dollar bill under my bed that I obviously have no idea how it ever got there or how long it has lay in its darkened quarters.Preposterous? Yeah. Insidious? Without question. But when compared to the new Nicolas Cage film, National Treasure, it isn't that far of a stretch. In fact, pull in an A-list star, and Disney might even give you a sizable blank check and find you a director to film this confusing enigma of a film.Granted, I am well aware of the liberties I am taking but I wondered if the masterminds behind National Treasure thought the same. Their film follows the adventures of Ben Gates (Cage) whose family has been entrusted with solving an ancient riddle whose clues lead to a treasure trove of riches and artifacts. But these aren't your ordinary right-in-front-of-your-face type of clues. These are ingenious riddles that are so complicated only an incredibly intelligent history buff with remarkable problem solving and innovative skills could ever figure. Or Ben Gates. So complicated in fact, you wonder if those that had hidden the treasure had ever wanted it to be found again. Clues like the clocks time on the back of a one hundred dollar bill, a hidden pipe buried in a ships' frozen tomb and the shadow that a tower casts at an exact time on another building. Of course, as the trailers so nicely spell out for us common folk, the biggest clue remains at the back of the Declaration of Independence where an invisible map is located¬Önaturally.The obtaining of the map is Ben's biggest obstacle. How can you steal the Declaration of Independence? Well, thanks to his incredible ingenuity and a computer geek sidekick named Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben undertakes an elaborate plan to secure the Declaration for the purpose of his family quest. The plan will consist of going to the National Library to look at blueprints of both the building and the security devices surrounding the document, fake ID's, tapping into the security monitoring cameras, tricking the heat sensors to thinking there is a temperature variance and working on getting the document extracted during a rather convenient gala going on in the building the same evening.Of course, they could have saved themselves all the brain cramps in thinking of such complex plan and taken the approach of the other team in search of the same treasure and just taken an underground vent to the location and using a stun gun, demobilize the security and take the Declaration. But where is the fun in that?Along the way, Ben Gates is able to retain the reluctant services of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) who is in charge of keeping the Declaration safe and tags along for the wild ride to ensure the document does not in any way get damaged (except of course when she uses lemon juice to reveal the map hidden on its underside). Luckily for the crew, she is only a part time desk jockey and spends the rest of her days as some kind of stunt woman that can hang on to speeding truck doors with one hand or swing from a collapsed staircase to a safe landing platform while trying to escape from the evil Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who is also in search of the treasure if only for its monetary value. If this all sounds like it is more than the average mouthful, you are not alone. This is a movie that never tries to be smarter than it needs to be (it is Disney after all), but does throw a lot of things at you (I ducked once just having the kitchen sink miss my noggin'). It is definitely one of those movies that if you step out for more popcorn, you may not be able to piece together what has happened since you departure.Giving credit where it is due, the movie does move at a nice clip towards an ending that may be ridiculous, but at least it is no less plausible than any of the events that lead to its climax. The acting is ample with Cage giving his usual steady performance in a paycheck role and Kruger who is proving that she can hold her own amongst the big boys. Harvey Keitel pops up in a wasted role as the police agent trying to track down the missing Declaration and although it was nice to see him in something mainstream, I wish he would have passed on this particular project.National Treasure will probably open big and will no doubt be talked about for a sequel if the audiences show it any attention after its initial weekend. I was surprised that the trailer (which was one of the worst in recent memory) heralded the director Jon Turteltaub who's track record consists of just a handful of projects, but I can say that he did better with this script than say, Stephen Sommers did with any of The Mummy entries.It's just that National Treasure tries to be too much. If it shortened the amount of clues that brought them around the country and focused more on the adventure, maybe they could have an Indiana Jones for the new millennium type of series. Instead, I left the theatre feeling as I had traveled with them from clue to clue and having jet lag is no way to leave a theatre.www.gregsrants.com",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overall good movie,"Going into this movie, I didn't think too much of it since I'm not really a Nicolas Cage fan. The plot also sounded a bit far-fetched-an invisible treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence-but it turned out that that is what made it a good plot. The irony was also clever-to protect the Declaration of Independence from being stolen by his teammates turned rivals, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) had to steal it himself. I also enjoyed how the focus did not shift to the romance between Ben Gates and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). There was enough to make the movie interesting, but not so much as to steal the focus away from the plot. There were also interesting twists and a little comedy that kept me interested through the end of the movie. The cleanness of the language and action makes this movie enjoyable for all ranges of audiences.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Raiders of the Lost National Treasure,"I'm not sure why the critics gave ""National Treasure"" such a bad time. It's not a very original movie, but it is very well made and it's not a sequel.For me, the best thing was the script, which is well thought out and does not carry any excess baggage. The film follows a typical formula. There's the scruffy hero, the goofy sidekick, the pretty blonde, and the despicable bad guy. The visual style is similar to the TV show, CSI. It looks slick, and the pace never drags.I typically don't care for Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger is not a very good actress. The filmmakers felt they had to explain her character's accent, which makes it stand out all that much more. Also, she wears more makeup than most 28 year olds. I guess there's a shortage of young, pretty blondes in Hollywood right now. The supporting cast is top-notch.This is a silly, brainless movie, but it is a lot of fun. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good one to watch with the family,"A historian follows a trail of clues from the American declaration of Independence.This is an entertaining movie if you can get past certain aspects.The story is a mcguffin adventure inspired by the likes of Indiana Jones and the Da Vinci code that also takes elements from various heist and sting operation movies. The plot unfolds in an enjoyable way that makes you want to see it through to the end.I like that characters resolve most problems using their intelligence rather than violence. There is a distinct contrast between the goodies and baddies regarding the use of force. This makes it a good movie to watch as a family with younger children and it is the biggest positive for me.I struggle with the amount of similarities to the stories and movies I mentioned above, but it does help that there is a very lighthearted tone to everything.This is just personal taste, but I find the frequent splashes of patriotism to be quite eye rolling. It's probably because I've never been much of a flag-waver. The stock British villain is annoyingly written, but well played by Sean Bean.You do have to like Nicholas Cage as a hero for it to work. He does a good job, but I prefer him in more eccentric roles that call for his various personality quirks.It is strongly filmed and edited with plenty of great visual storytelling. The art design is also very good, particularly the set design during certain scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super fun movie for everyone,"Another in a long line of films that is way better than the ratings. This is Nick Cage at his best. This is a fast paced mystery thriller, funny and fun. You can watch and rewatch and it's still entertaining. If you're looking for super gritty, guns and blood, this isn't your film. With all the shooting, and action, there is no blood; one person does fall into darkness (killed), but the 'the hit' is not seen on screen.

"Mindnumbing Entertainment, but it's still entertaining","This movie is in the vein of unbelievable, campy, hokey, adventure films, along the lines of the Indiana Jones films. Except not as good (well, admittedly better than many parts of the second Indiana Jones film). Acting, story and dialogue are all decidedly mediocre.But it's not a waste, really, because it doesn't aspire to be more than what it is: A mildly entertaining pair of hours. The set pieces, the action direction, and the general production value leave the film with the ability to be swallowed without too much disgust. Although part of me felt like this film would've been better as a B-grade television series (one clue to the next, lots of room for moments of suspense--very good fodder for the next series executively produced by Sam Raimi and possibly starring Bruce Campbell or another excellently campy B-grade actor), it passes as a film okay.Would I recommend it? No. It doesn't add any value to anyone's life, nor is it really a film you have to see in any way. But, if you're tired of dealing with commercials while you turn your brain off, you can catch this film instead. All the mind-numbing mild entertainment of television and none of the commercials. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty Decent Movie,"I just saw this movie on cable the other night and I actually liked it. I know it received bad reviews when it was released. It reminded me of Dan Brown's books 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' which I loved. If you like those books you will probably like this movie. As far as being historically correct, well I think you just have to put that aside when watching this kind of movie. I think people get too hung up on historical accuracy and whether this or that is plausible. If I want to watch something historically accurate I'll watch a documentary. Personally, I'm not a huge Nicholas Cage fan but he did OK in this. And the character of Riley was great. He had some great dry humor and one-liners. Really cracked me up. I also liked John Voight as Cage's father. They way he was peeking around the corner and giving them tips was really cute. He tries to have an adult sensibility that this quest is silly but he also has a boyish nature that wants to believe that buried treasure really can exist.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Indiana Jones for kids,"...with a big wholesome PG staple right on its forehead. While none of this sound promising, National Treasure is still a fun ride and well-made considering the audience it was directed at. I am always delighted to find a family adventure film so devoid of bad one-liners, cheap jokes and pratfalls that I am ready to give National Treasure a great deal of unmerited praise. It is not cheesy; its plot is not altogether unbelievable and the acting performances are surprisingly low-key and enjoyable and decidedly unDisney-like.We follow Nicholas Cage as Ben Gates, a treasure hunter on a mission to unlock the secret location of a great, ancient treasure that the founding fathers of America once buried. On his way, he accidentally teams up with a curator of the National Archives--Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). We also see supporting roles starring Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight and Sean Bean. Nicholas Cage is rather charmless in his part, and this is where he severely lacks an Indiana Jones edge and humour that could have brought so much to an adventure film like this. Sure, he acts with conviction - but with very safe and mild conviction. In the end, National Treasure is very standard and very safe in all aspects. It lacks edge, but it satisfies.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fantastic, underrated movie.","I decided to go to IMDb and check out some of the reviews people have written here. On the first page most people seemed to like it, so I decided to check number two. And beside from a few smart people who understands the movie, all I found was reviews telling me what crap this is. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. I thought National Treasure was a great movie. It was smart, exciting, and funny. Nicholas Cage played his role great, and so did Justin Bartha. It wasn't the greatest movie of all time, but I still loved it. And yes, maybe this movie was meant for a little younger audience, but what is the harm in that? Did someone tell everyone that it was going to be for adults only? I don't know how it was in other countries, but in Sweden it was rated 7+. If that's not a pretty safe clue that it ain't meant only for adults, but for family and kids, then I don't know what the hell is. I thought it was a smart movie. Granted, I'm not the type of person who usually sits through mystery movies, or other stuff that requires some thinking, but I think a lot of people would enjoy this movie, even if they don't all think exactly like me. Still, I mean, if you didn't like the movie, you must have your reasons. Maybe I'm just some weird dude who likes bad films. I loved 2012, even though it had a lot of bad reviews. Still, this movie was very entertaining. It's probably not meant for some 30-year-old single guy sitting in his apartment with a bear, expecting some kind of awesome action movie, but for younger audiences and family movie nights, this is totally awesome, and deserves so much more good reviews than it's got.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good and Dumb, Mindless Fun","Sometimes it doesn't matter how much history, thought and plot clich√©s you add to a film, it can come out to be just a dumb movie great for watching just for fun. National Treasure is one of these. It really doesn't accomplish too much as far as a thinking thriller movie, but now that I have the bad stuff out of the way...Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates (LOL!), a treasure hunter out to find loads of goodies hidden by our very own founding fathers. Turns out the clues are held in the back of the Declaration of Independence, but not before the bad guy (the always mean-looking Sean Bean) can get there first. Now add some 007 action to this Raiders of the Lost Ark feel, perhaps a touch of The Goonies, blend in a little romance with lovely Diane Kruger, and *Poof*! You've got instant action/thriller comedy.What surprises me the most of NT is that it's kid safe. No cursing, no graphic violence, no sex or nudity references, and yet, it FEELS like it should be that type of movie. Being a Disney film and all, it still had to get a PG rating, but they did a bang up job for a holiday film. Just don't go in expecting out of this world thriller and you'll be fine. And bring the kids. The movie just oozes a new ride at Disney. (I hope that doesn't happen :)6.5 out of 10, but we don't do halves here at IMDb, now, do we? A 7, then.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sure, the paranoid fantasies and pseudo-mystical gibberish gets to be a bit much at times, but overall it's a relatively fast-paced film that keeps things moving and keeps enough things blowing up that the audience isn't bored.This isn't a film to take seriously whether you believe in conspiracy theories and secret societies or not.

A Blend of History and High-Stakes Adventure,"National Treasure, released in 2004, is a film that successfully combines historical intrigue with edge-of-your-seat adventure, meriting a 7/10. This movie is particularly captivating for those who enjoy a good treasure hunt story, blended with a bit of American history.The plot of National Treasure is engaging and keeps the suspense high throughout. It's the kind of film that keeps you guessing and holds your attention from start to finish. The historical elements add an interesting layer, making the treasure hunt feel more significant and rooted in a larger context.However, it's worth noting that some aspects of the movie are a bit over the top.

Indiana Jones for the modern kid and family,"""National Treasure"" is actually quite a good movie. It's Indiana Jones for the modern family with kids - minus the epic and the totally blow you away male lead. ""National Treasure"" is about a guy named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicholas Cage) who has spent his entire life looking for the greatest treasure ever known, the treasure of the Knight's Templar. Of course, everyone calls him and his family crazy for believing that it's real, but they go right on searching. A clue leads Ben and his friend Riley to believe that there is a map to the treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence so of course, they decide to steal it. Naturally there are the bad guys who want the treasure for themselves; resulting in a few nice chase scenes and several ingenious clues that end with a scene that screams a soon to be Disneyland ride.I was totally surprised when I found out that Nicholas Cage was going to be in a kids movie. I mean, its Nicholas Cage! But he actually does quite well. He has nothing on Harrison Ford in ""Indiana Jones"" but he doesn't really try to be like him. Well, at least he doesn't try to hard. The bad guy is Sean Bean from ""Lord of the Rings"", who has a distinct Aussie accent but is pretty low-key. Of course you have the girl (Diane Kruger) who actually does quite well in an okay role. My personal favorite character is Justin Bartha, a new comer, who plays Riley Poole. He gets the punchlines that are designed to bring comic relief and he delivers them with a perfect dose of sarcasm.The most promising thing about this movie is the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") produced the movie which gives it a pretty good life span. Also, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (writers for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") are connected to the script which can almost ensure that there is good dialogue.Go ahead and see this movie if you really aren't looking for something that is super deep or is saturated in love.

Fails towards the end!!!,"I must admit this is one of the most intelligent fast paced action thriller I have seen in recent years. It surely is underrated. The action and suspense was spellbinding and original except the last quarter. The movie suddenly loses pace, and ends almost in an anti-climax.Though its hard to imagine an alternate ending....but hey I'm the one who pays for the creativity.The movie begins quiet suddenly with not much of a background,though it does settle down quickly to a fast yet controlled pace.The main problem I thought was with the casting of Sean Bean as the villain, he didn't fit the role from any angle in my view,he is a good actor don't get me wrong,but was too weak and lacked the cruelty required to balance the goodness of Cage.The plus points of the movie are definitely Nichlas Cage's controlled acting, quick camera work, and cinematography,and of course Washington DC shown with a poetic charm.

Nicolas Cage's best solid bad ass action adventure flick!,"National Treasure (2004) is Nicolas Cage's best solid performance for an outstanding role of his character Benjamin Franklin Gates! This movie become very popular in 2004 and it got a sequel. I am still waiting for third sequel but I doubt there will National Treasure 3. This is also the best one of the two films in the franchise. The adventure and action in this movie is perfect executed. This film is about a treasure hunt that whole life Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) was hunting, now a team of mercenary's who betrayed Gates are trying to steal Declaration of Independence from museum which is the lead and final clue to a treasure hidden somewhere in the country. I love how Benjamin (Nicolas Cage) is trying to convince and warning the authorities about Ian's plans but they don't listen to him. So Benjamin and his only loyal friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) has to steal the Declaration of Independence so they can protect it from Ian (Sean Bean). What I love about this film is the plot, the acting, the cast, well decent character development and a good fun action. This is my third favorite Nicolas Cage film and I love it to death!Plot: Benjamin Franklin Gates descends from a family of treasure-seekers who've all hunted for the same thing: a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. Ben's close to discovering its whereabouts, as is his competition, but the FBI is also hip to the hunt.That is the basic plot, it also does involves FBI chasing Benjamin and Riley beside Ian. Beautiful gorgeous sexy German actress Diane Kruger who was playing Dr. Abigail Chase did a perfect job playing her character, I haven't even noticed that she has an accent in this film. I love the music theme from Trevor Rabin for this film. This movie is awesome, It's the most thrilling treasure movie I ever seen. It keeps you excited there's humor and action. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie with a few laughs and adventure around it. It isn't Indiana Jones - Raiders of the Lost Ark, but a great movie along those lines none the less. I love all 4 Indiana Jones movies with Harrison Ford but I still think National Treasure is original and it is not violent or scary movie. You also have a likable cast with humor and surrounded with history around you.Jon Voight as Ben's estrange father also did a good job portraying his character Patrick Gates. Harvey Keitel was great as FBI Agent Peter Sadusky chasing Gates on his trip. The last actor I really had fun watching him was Sean Bean as the bad guy in his role as Ian Howe. I love Nicolas Cage and some of his films, but my favorite films are Con Air, The Rock and this one and National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007). I really did enjoy this film Nicolas Cage does a wonderful acting job, it is his decent acting performance. Today Nicolas Cage wastes his talent on junk movies, just like Steven Seagal and Eddie Murphy and they don't care about there fans. I love this movie and for my self I like history, this is one movie I really did enjoy watching because this movie is about history. The facts: I don't think there is really a map on the Declaration of Independence, I think they just made that up for the entertainment. But still this is intense film, still I love that you can see a lot of history museums in this movie. I reminds me when I was last year in high school I went on class tour 2007 to visit Museums in Munich, Germany (Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum), it was an awesome class trip and It was the same year National Treasure 2 come out. I really miss those times.Overall: Special effects are great and thoroughly entertaining movie. This is a bad ass action adventure flick with great original story, interesting intense plot with lots of action that are all well done! This was a blind buy on Blu-ray for me and I have watched the film three times already! It is a decent solid Nicolas Cage flick MILES way better than Face/Off (1997) and other trash movies Cage is doing today!

It's not as memorable as Indiana Jones or the Mummy films, but it's good as an adventure yarn. I liked this better than the second one, which, apart from the Mount Rushmore part, was forgettable.

"I didn't like this movie, but I can understand why it was so popular","This film is hard to sum up with a single rating. I really wish I could give it three scores: One for how much I personally liked it, how good the film is historically and how entertaining the film is.For me, the film was a 3 or 4--mostly because I just don't like this type of film. Action films often bore me because I like characters with depth and the characters in NATIONAL TREASURE are cartoon-like and one-dimensional with little to make me connect with them. Now this isn't to say that I dislike all action films, but this one just seemed like a long string of plot devices and gimmicks strung together. The logical leaps they used to solve each riddle were just silly. And, again and again, I found myself guessing correctly what was coming next--the script was amazingly predictable and poor given that so much money was spent on special effects and high-priced actors.As far as the historical value, I'm going to need to bite my tongue a bit. I am an American History teacher and need to keep reminding myself that I must suspend disbelief--after all, Disney did not intend this as a real history lesson. Sadly, however, when I talked to my students about the film, it was amazing how many thought the film DID have an actual historical basis!! Well, I can't blame Disney for the fact that kids don't know their history (well, I guess I could launch into an attack on the historical errors in POCAHONTAS but I need to keep on topic). At least the film gets people thinking about history, so that's something, so I'll give it a 5--though all the mumbo-jumbo about the Masons, secret codes, etc. was all a lot of hooey.As far as entertainment for the masses go, the film is fun, slick and well-crafted (aside from the writing, that is). The film looks great and has a bigger than life feel that is at times reminiscent of INDIANA JONES and other action films. For an undemanding audience, it's going to keep their attention. In this regard, it deserves a 7 or 8. It looks pretty and is nice escapism.So overall, I'd say the film deserves a 5. While I hated much of the film and would rather eat glass than see it again because of the style of film and clich√©d writing, I also realize I am a very picky person and there's nothing wrong with some mindless entertainment now and again. For kids and anyone who tends to not look for plot problems, this could be a very entertaining film. For smug guys like me, you would probably do better with an independent or foreign film, documentary or silent film--you know, the kinds of film NORMAL people don't like.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good adventure/action flick.,"National Treasure tells the story of a man who has grown up believing he has descended from the Knights Templar, and he must find and protect an ancient treasure. When a member of his team goes bad and sets out to steal the treasure, the man must steal the map, which happens to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence, follow the clues, and find the treasure. This is a very fun popcorn movie with great action and a very interesting premise.I love movies where there is some sort of mystery that needs to be solved. I loved the plot to this movie, where it is explained that clues as to where the treasure is buried are hidden in things we see every day, such as the one dollar bill. Every time a character discovers a clue, a smile is brought to my face because of how clever the plot is. The characters are interesting and watchable, mix that with the plot and there you have a fun movie. The Da Vinci Code has a similar premise (a man finds clues in something we see all the time), but don't kid yourself...This movie is far more entertaining than The Da Vinci Code. This isn't a perfect film, but it doesn't advertise itself to be. You know as soon as it starts that it's just going to be a fun action flick.The acting is really good. I'm usually not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, but he's good in this movie. The other actors that pop up are what make this really exciting, such as Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, and Christopher Plummer, and they all do great jobs.Overall, this is a fun action movie for a night in, and it's better than The Da Vinci Code.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, old fashioned adventure","Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) in the next in line in a family who have been searching for a mythical treasure map for generations. When he eventually uncovers evidence that the fabled map was hidden in no other place than the back of the Declaration of Independence, he decides that there is clearly no alternative than to steal the Declaration. (it's in the name of science, after all...)The thing to keep in mind most before watching National Treasure is that it's all in good fun. It isn't meant to be particularly realistic or probable - just suspenseful, exciting and, above all, entertaining. And National Treasure succeeds in being entertaining, if nothing else. Think of it as a modern Indiana Jones, albeit one which blatantly rips off Dan Brown's novel 'The Da Vinci Code' with the main plot line involving cryptic clues found on pieces of ancient architecture. However, another thing to keep in mind is that the entire story takes place in the good old United States of America, so get ready for some not so subtle patriotic messages (which may lead up to some potential propaganda interpretations) and a particularly cheesy ending, which seems to anticipate us letting out a loud sigh of patriotic pride... but is more likely to produce a pained groan.Nicholas Cage returns to the thriller genre, but doesn't give anything spectacular here in terms of performance, which is fine, since the script doesn't really call for much character development on his part - the highlight remains the adventure. Justin Bartha plays Gate's annoying sidekick Riley, meant to serve as the comic relief, but in the end, only raises the occasional laugh. Diane Kruger plays a cardboard cutout 'token female' character, who is given absolutely nothing in terms of development or necessity to appear in the story at all, except to finally (and highly predictably) fall in love with Gates. Sean Bean steals the movie as the cold-blooded ex-colleague of Gate's who is racing against him to claim the treasure first. And finally, while it's nice to see classy actors such as John Voight (playing Gate's father, who seems to act as the voice of the audience, expressing doubt that it would be physically possible to continue finding the outlandish trail of clues) Harvey Keitel (as a burnt out federal agent searching for the robbers of the Declaration of Independence) and Christopher Plummer (as Gate's grandfather, who instilled his thirst for knowledge and adventure) taking supporting roles, none of them are given much to do due to their extremely thin characterizations, and seem uncomfortable lurking in the sidelines while Nick, Diane and Justin track down the treasure.So there isn't much accomplished in terms of script or character development, acting is decent at best and the plot remains outlandish throughout, National Treasure remains a good, old fashioned, fun for the whole family movie (rated PG with no profanity or sex, and violence is virtually nonexistent) much in the mold of Indiana Jones. It's not very believable, but who needs it to be? Just sit back, and cherish the adventure.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hammy thespians Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel are on hand to lend Cage a hand as, respectively, Cage's unbelieving father and an FBI agent with a hidden agenda. The movie is wildly improbable, but then so was INDIANA JONES. And at least Cage doesn't wear a hat. NT is no better or worse than LARA CROFT or THE LIBRARIAN. If you manage to make it through to the end, there is a cute punchline.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I  Really Tried To Not Like It...,"...But darn it, I did! Generally, if I see Jerry Bruckheimker or Nick Cage's name on a film, I know I won't like it because I have never been much of a fan of either men's work, but this was a really fun film. The tag line of ""the Indiana Jones of the new millennium"" might be a bit strong, though. Nick Cage is hardly Harrison Ford, but this was a great action/adventure/whodunit/heist/treasure hunt film. The only thing I had a bit of a problem with was some irritating camera work from time to time in the first 20 or so minutes of the film. Trevor Rabin (ex from The Buggles and Yes) did a great job on the film's music. An added positive element was the shooting on real historical locations in Washington DC, New York and Philly. For once, the CGI used in the film didn't LOOK like CGI and that in itself was very refreshing! All in all, I would recommend this film to just about anyone who enjoyed the Raiders series-but don't expect to see another Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is definitely a film with a feel and personality of its own. When my wife and kids come home this afternoon, I'm going to watch it again with them!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A smart, fun film that may try a bit too hard at times to be something it surely isn't","Have you ever been to one of those giant Chinese buffets where there's row after row of fried, mouthwatering foods that you know you could never cook up for yourself? When you walk into one of these restaurants, you can't help but feel a bit gluttonous as you try to stack as many different goodies as you can onto your plate. You take some fried shrimp, a bit of white rice, a dumpling or two; then you happily stuff it into your mouth without as much as one thought. However, when you finally get up to leave, you're always a bit overly full. This is exactly how John Turtletaub's National Treasure will make you feel as it borrows heavily from such cinematic superiors as Raiders of the Lost Arc, and Ocean's 11, all without offering much originality, or plausibility. The meal itself is tasty while it lasts, but afterwords, it just leaves you with a sour stomach.The film begins as a clich√©, continues as a clich√©, and ends as a clich√©, all to go by the basic cinematic formula, never even slightly treating its audience as intellectuals. It actually starts this right off the bat as the film feels the need to open in the 1970's only to introduce the movie's hero as a child, and set down the main layout of the promising, yet essentially absurd plot.What is the plot, you may ask? Well, if you've read Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, it should seem very familiar. The movie follows the character of Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) as he struggles to uncover the secrets behind the treasure of the Knights Templar, which seemingly disappeared after the first Crusade. Like his past relatives, Ben believes that the treasure was brought to the United States by traveling Freemasons during the time of the revolutionary war. Ben also thinks that once in America, our forefathers, who believed that one man should not hold so much wealth, supposedly hid the treasure, leaving nothing but a string of riddles and clues to its whereabouts.Now, in the present time, Ben's job is to (Gee, can you guess?) find these clues, solve the riddles of the Freemasons, and hunt down the treasure before it falls into the wrong hands. And just to ensure that there is a set of wrong hands for that treasure to fall into, one of Ben's teammates turns on him in the first act after they discover that the next clue leading to the treasure's whereabouts lies (Ok, here's where the plot becomes a bit more preposterous) on the back side of the declaration of independence¬Öwritten in invisible ink, of course.From here on out, the film becomes an implausible, yet exciting romp through the mysteries of the masonry history, overstuffed with clich√©s and literally riddled with plot holes as Ben sets out to ""protect"" the declaration by stealing it, and finding the treasure before his backstabbing teammate. Joining him on his quest is Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben's quirky, show stealing sidekick, and Abigail (Diane Kruger), the beautiful token love interest.As you'll eventually notice, the movie falls in between the two categories of absurdity and excitement. One moment you could be scratching your head at the movie's stupidity, and the next you could be cheering on Ben during a fun, yet still clich√©, car chase. The two feelings don't usually mix well, but since the film doesn't take itself too seriously, plausibility and intelligence will begin to take a back seat to what is actually happening on screen.One scene that serves as a perfect example to this would be when Ben steals the declaration of independence, which, sitting in a ""cleaning"" room, is only being guarded by a handful of security guards, and two cameras. While this situation (like many others in the movie) may seem completely asinine, it's played out in such a way that you'll be too immersed in Ben's actions to realize it. The director, John Turtletaub, should be patted on the back, if only for keeping the audience interested with such a great pace, and style for the 2+-hour adventure.Another thing that truly benefits the film is the acting. The three main characters (Ben, Riley, and Abigail) have such wonderful chemistry together, that you'll soon forget how underdeveloped their characters actually are. At times, Justin Bartha's hilarious performance as Riley will even steal the show, just because of how he acts off of Cage and Kruger. Speaking of Cage and Kruger, their ""relationship"" in the film seems a bit too forced and unbelievable at times, but, again, you'll be too busy trying to keep up with the film to notice that.It should also be noted that while the plot may be a bit ludicrous at times, the film still manages to give unsuspecting moviegoers a pretty good history lesson on both the Freemasons, and our forefathers; so don't be surprised if you learn a thing or two.All in all, National Treasure is a fast paced, exciting, well-acted adventure, if not a bit too daffy in its plot and clich√©d formula. If you happen to be in the mood for a fun, ""should have been summer"" movie, then see this in theaters; however, if you're in the mood to actually think a lot during the film, then wait for the DVD, or pass on the entire experience.Rating: 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Weaving intricate fictions,"With conspiracy theory being as widespread as it is in the real world, you'd expect there to be a film like National Treasure long before now. While this isn't the first film to utilize the ideas of our culture's members prone to constructing and propagating elaborate paranoid-delusional fantasies--Conspiracy Theory (1997) is an obvious past example, and another was the Skulls (2000) series--this is the first film to build conspiracy theory into this kind of tasty adventure/mystery/action/thriller mix that's part Indiana Jones, part Douglas Adams' marvelous Dirk Gently books (yes, it's _that_ literate), and part heist films like The Score (2001).Benjamin ""Ben"" Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is the latest member in a family long concerned with what others would call conspiracy theory, especially the portion of it about Freemasons (although in the real world, one portion tends to be so elaborately connected to other portions that it would be difficult to siphon just a section of it off). Because of something that Gates' great, great, great . . . . grandfather was told, it had been passed down through Gates' family lore that the Freemasons were responsible for sheltering some remarkable treasure--the only hard piece of ""evidence"" that the first Gates possessed was that the treasure had something to do with ""Charlotte"". Eventually, the Gates family, because of their interest in conspiracy theories, earned a reputation among scholars for being kooks.National Treasure begins with a brief bit of historical/background exposition about the relevant bits of conspiracy theory (which of course are so enmeshed with almost mundane historical facts that it becomes difficult to separate the two--that's part of why conspiracy theory is so easily propagated), then moves to Gates as a boy, when he first learns the family legend. We then move to Gates as a 30-something year old explorer and fringe scholar, who of course is now deeply ensconced in a far-reaching search for clues leading to the treasure, despite the protests of his father, Patrick Henry Gates (Jon Voight). Ben has both majored in history and undergone specialized military training to give him a better background for his quest. We join Ben in the Arctic, searching for a long lost ship beneath the ice. He ends up with an enemy who is pursuing the same goals, and the film becomes a race for Gates to find clues and solve puzzles leading to the treasure--which just might turn out to be a myth, after all--before his enemy can, all while avoiding law enforcement for the various crimes he must commit to reach his goal.On a script/story level, National Treasure succeeds as well as it does because of two reasons. One, the story and characters are intelligent. There is a wonderful parallel between National Treasure as a fiction and conspiracy theory in the real world. They both weave clever although sometimes verging-on-the-ridiculous fantasies that are well rooted in facts--often relatively obscure and arcane facts. Two, as a series of increasingly intricate clues and puzzles, all built upon previous clues and solutions to puzzles, the film is very intellectually stimulating in its resemblance to interactive fiction/role playing computer games. Just as a gamer can get easily wrapped up in those games as they vicariously become some fantastical, fictional character, a viewer can become enmeshed in National Treasure.But on top of that, director John Turtletaub and his team of scriptwriters have layered well-executed action and thriller material as well as an Indiana Jones-ish location-hopping adventure story. National Treasure is frequently suspenseful, with the nail-biting threats coming from three angles--villains, authority figures, and the environment. Of course, there's also a bit of a romance subplot in the film, as well as some well-placed comic relief. National Treasure isn't about breaking new ground or bucking trends as much as excelling at proved ground and trends.On that end, the technical aspects are superb, even if they're not groundbreaking. Superb technical elements--such as cinematography, lighting, editing, production design, score, and of course directing--are to be expected at this budgetary level ($100 million plus) of film-making. While I wouldn't give significant extra points at this level for just doing the job right, I certainly won't subtract any just for not doing something unprecedented, either. As if National Treasure needed bonus points, anyway.The cast is also excellent, although if you hate Nicolas Cage, you may still dislike him here. He does his typical ""schtick"", which means, among other things, that he's a bit wry and occasionally spastic. I like his typical schtick a lot. Diane Kruger, in addition to playing her role well, is beautiful, of course, which doesn't hurt the visual attraction of the film. The big stars who take smaller parts--Voight, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Plummer--are well utilized. They're skilled enough to quickly establish depth for their characters, but Turtletaub doesn't put them in the film so much that it becomes unfocused.A lot of people have said that National Treasure is a ""popcorn"" or ""leave your brain at the door"" film. That's not really true, but neither is it true that you have to be a conspiracy theorist or historian to enjoy the film. National Treasure is both intellectually and emotionally stimulating as well as suspenseful and vicariously fantastical for the better part of two hours. You can't ask much more of a film than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Da Vinci Code in a minor key...more humor, more fun...","If your head is still spinning from all the murky codes being deciphered in THE DA VINCI CODE, you can sit back and relax with all the clues NICHOLAS CAGE has to unravel in order to go on his treasure hunt in NATIONAL TREASURE. He has lots of help from his dad (JON VOIGT), a very savvy female assistant (DIANE KRUGER), his mentor (CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER), and his goofy but handsome side-kick (JUSTIN BARTHA). The heist scenes involving a stolen Declaration of Indpendence are a highlight of the film, all filmed on actual locales in and around Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, handsomely photographed.Cage gets some stiff resistance from HARVEY KEITEL as a no-nonsense FBI man, and some villainous competition from greedy SEAN BEAN and his henchmen, who want the treasure for monetary purposes only and will stop at nothing, even murder, to lay their greedy hands on it.It's all Saturday matin√©e stuff, the plot strictly a mixture of Indiana Jones and other cliffhanger stories where the hero has to pursue his quest while all sorts of obstacles are thrust in his way--and then the final, climactic shoot-out and wild chase before he can walk off with the girl at the end of the movie.All the standard clich√©s are firmly in place, but it's still a lot of fun to watch NICHOLAS CAGE interact with a fun loving cast. SEAN BEAN lends some British dignity to his role as the charming villain, not quite as dark a villain as is usual in these sort of capers.There's a light touch throughout all the heist sequences and chases and explorations of the underground caverns holding the treasure, as well as some well staged moments of suspense with collapsing stairways and termite-ridden wooden structures making the search perilous. JUSTIN BARTHA contributes a lot of the lighter jibes as a computer wiz who is clearly having a good time and knows the whole thing is a lark as he works on his computer graphics.Nothing too original here, but it's purely an escapist adventure yarn.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Film,"After watching this movie, it is decent enough for the entire family. Its well worth sitting through the entire movie as new plots unfolds. This movie is packed with entertainment, and the choice of the cast is excellent. There are a few problems with the storyline, but it's best to just sit back and enjoy the movie as the mystery unfolds. You will want to cringe as soon as the Declaration of Independence goes under fire, and share the laughs with the cast. Although it may be complicated to understand for some of your kids, I would recommend bringing the entire family to see this one. This movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters, even if it is expensive to view.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good action, illogical plot","National Treasure won't surprise you, but thanks to a rather appealing performance by Nicholas Cage and some choice location shooting, you forget that the plot is nonsensical and illogical, and all is well with the world.The appropriately named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) comes from a long line of wacky theorists who believe that the Founding Fathers of the United States buried a ton of treasure somewhere, and that a clue to its whereabouts is on the back of the fabled Declaration of Independence. So, with his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) and a reluctant expert, Abigail (Diane Kruger), he sets out to steal the treasured document and discover the cache of loot for which he and his own forefathers have been searching for decades.Cage makes like Indiana Jones here, and while he's no Harrison Ford (even a younger Harrison Ford), he's a spot better than you might expect. He's never quite believable as an action hero in this movie, but he seems authentic as a man of letters, a clever conniver, a sly sleuth. Good thing, because he's pretty much the entire show here, save for the awesome footage of Genuine American Historical Monuments. Anytime you can sneak in recognizable landmarks, your film will stand apart from the others in the genre; it'll be more memorable. Check out a minor Hitchcock film, Saboteur, and you'll see excellent use of the Statue of Liberty.The movie is apparently based quite loosely on the Dan Brown novel The DaVinci Code. I haven't read the book yet, mostly because I'm too cheap to go buy it and it's always, always out on loan from my library. But I've heard from very reputable sources that National Treasure is basically a ripoff of the DaVinci Code story, albeit supercharged as an action thriller extravaganza. I bet the book didn't things blowing up all the time, but that's what you have to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer film. I'd advise you to read the book instead, for I hear it's clever and entertaining; the movie gets it only half right.,Although the logical train Gates follows from clue to clue seems somewhat implausible at times, don't let that distract you from a fun time. Don't let the clich√©s of a hot-but-smart female sidekick; a smooth, superrich Eurotrash villain; and a wisecracking computer-whiz male sidekick deter you, either. But wait, don't shut your brain off entirely. You want to see how many of the clues you'll understand before Gates does. In fact, make a drinking game of it. Every time he says, ""I'm working on it!"" or looks exasperated, do a shot. I guarantee you'll be snockered in no time.One other minor debit is that there really isn't much chemistry between Cage and Kruger. I mean, every hero has to have The Girl, and they just don't seem to click. Maybe they didn't like each other. Maybe Cage tried to put the moves on Kruger and she slapped him silly. Whatever the reason, they just don't seem too into each other, as they're supposed to be.In all, it's not too bad, and probably best seen on a big screen, the better to see Stuff Get Blown Up.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You can watch this movie again and again and again..........,"This movie was a nice surprise. The story is very entertaining, things are explained well and it might even leave you wanting to do a little research on your own. Cage was his dry humorous self and the cast of characters around him was well matched. It has humor and suspense and just a bit of danger. It would be hard to get tired of this movie. All of the places they visit are real and they make it sound so plausible. It is nice to see a good, clean adventure flick. I can say that I have seen this movie at least 5 time or more. I always stop to watch it even when I have it on just for background noise while I am hanging out around the house. I would recommend this movie to anyone, unless you hate US history or hate Nicholas Cage. Other than that I think you would really enjoy National Treasure.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unbelievable but a fun ride,"This is a movie with lots of action, suspense, great acting, historical info but short on believability. With all that said, I really liked the movie. Much along the lines of the ""Indiana Jones"" films of the 80's, this film captures the excitement of the old serial Saturday afternoon specials. I did find myself laughing out loud regarding several plot pieces (can you still roll up the Declaration of Independence?) and the founding fathers' ability to leave cryptic clues all over the Northeast. It is easy to put most of it aside because the film is that much fun with great pace and fine acting. Great casting on Cage's sidekick (forgot the name) to find someone for timely comic relief.

Fun and games,"The Masons have long held sway as a mystical bunch of secret plotters who conspired to guard deep dark and arcane esoteric information. At least a dozen books have been inspired by this fraternity and the recent success of the Da Vinci Code has played on this long standing tradition. Tales of treasure and untold fortune, wealth and secrets of the universe thrill our imaginations and appeal to our sense of the fantastic. The fact too that our own western history lends itself to grail quests, ancient truths and hidden clues adds to the boiling pot. So, why not have a big Masonic plot to hide a vast treasure right under the noses of the population and have the clues hidden on the back of our most famous document. The fact that Washington, Franklin, Jefferson and several members of the 2nd continental congress were Freemasons ups the ante even more. So, what follows is good fantasy, good fun and nothing too serious to get ourselves wrapped up in. Cage is cool and Bean is sinister. The chase is on.

"What ""The Da Vinci Code"" tried to be:","Very similar in its subject to ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006), ""National Treasure"" solved all the clues and did it with humor, great pace, and style.

I liked it from the beginning but when Harvey Keitel showed up in the middle of the movie and stayed, I knew it would be even better. Comparing to DVC, NT did not try hard not to offend anyone and got away with the ridiculous holes in the plot and a bit overlong final part. It is funny, thrilling, and does exactly what is supposed to - entertains. I only hope that they will not make any sequels to it - sequels don't work as a rule.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasant Surprise,"I have to be honest and confess that I went to see this movie because I had already seen everything else I was interested in. There was nothing in the trailers that really made me want to see it. My reaction to them was ""rip-off of the Indiana Jones Series, it might stink"". I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Well, semi wrong. It was in the Indy Jones genre of action-mystery swathed in a liberal dose of historic background. I think filmmakers hit a chord with audiences when they use a historical base because it makes it easier for the moviegoer to buy into the film's concept because they can relate to it from outside the world of Hollywood. In this case, the film is liberally sprinkled with historic factoids, some of which are even true (Well, it's still Hollywood after all.). All-in-all this is a movie made just for fun with the same sort of 1940's-50's Saturday afternoon moviehouse serial kind of thrills to it. So I guess Jon Turteltaub gets a big thank you from me for giving me this fun and entertaining film to pass away a snowy Sunday afternoon. But my highest praise goes to some possibly accidental additions, the actual presentation of an education as a good and desirable thing and for making the subject of history something other than the dry, boring exercise so many school kids think it is. For those, bless you guys one and all.Let's continue with the cast. I have to say I haven't enjoyed Nicholas Cage as much in a movie since Moonstruck. He fit the part here for me. I don't think I could buy him as a serious academic, but as this screw up version of one he seems perfect.... sorry Mr. Cage. His nemesis here is his former partner played by Sean Bean, who made an excellent bad guy with just the right emphasis and not too much. I hate over-the-top characters usually (The one possible exception being Alan Rickman in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). The striking and enjoyable Diane Kruger played the late entry love-interest for Cage. I liked her even if her character is entirely too beautiful for the dull administrator part. I hope to see more of her in films too. Hollywood again. But the real pleasant treasure in this film for me was the performance of Justin Bartha. I think this is the first thing I've seen him in and he made the overall cast far more enjoyable to me for the counterpoint he made with just the right touch of wit. He was so good I will now look for his name in film credits again hoping to see more of the very good things he seems to be very capable of. Bravo to casting for his selection here. The rest of the supporting cast was quite excellent too and doubtless responsible for the consistently overall excellence of the film. Jon Voight as Cage's Dad, Harvey Keitel as the G-Man and Christopher Plummer as the elder Gates were all very enjoyable to watch here.The rest of the film was up to the standards set for it with the ambitious and excellent script. Costumes, music, art direction, sets, second unit work, everything was great and blended seamlessly into great, old-fashioned entertainment. I'd recommend this for the whole family.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure,"Fasten your seat belt, the film National Treasure, is a real ride through time and history! Produced and directed by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub, this film takes many twists and turns in trying to unravel the mystery of the a hidden secret kept through a family that dates back to the Knights of Templar. Partially ripped off from the best selling book, The Davinci Code, this movie takes an ordinary man, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage), who finds out that his family has an extraordinary secret. Being the only one in his family besides his grandfather to believe in the fact that there is a secret to be revealed, Gates pursues the answer for most of his adult life. It was believed that the Knights of Templar were hiding a vast treasure which was passed on to be hidden by the Masons or in this case, the founding fathers of America. Benjamin is first introduced to this secret, when his grandfather, Patrick Henry Gates (Christopher Plummer), handed down to him a piece of the puzzle which is believed to be a clue in finding the treasure. This piece was handed down through the Gates family from Charles Carroll who was the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. The first clue states that the ""secret lies with Charlotte"". This greatly puzzles Gates, but he remembers through history an event of an expedition with a ship named Charlotte. After many years of searching, he discovers the Charlotte, and clues aboard the ship lead him to believe that clues are written in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence. After thought, Gates decides to steal the Declaration of Independence in order to continue his quest for the treasure. While stealing the document, he meets a National Archivist (Diane Kruger) who insists they team up to keep it away from the villain figure (Sean Bean), and so she can insure the safety of the document. They become close through out the film creating a romantic side story. Many chases and close calls occur throughout the film, but somehow, Gates always manages to get away and find a new clue that all have to do with something historically within United States History. Being close to discovering the secret his father who did not believe is now convinced to join in. Eventually, they find themselves in a mine shaft beneath a church tomb and the clues do lead to a treasure, but there are still some questions unanswered. The heroes in this film are put through many tests. All of the elements to a great film are in this movie plot: action, adventure, speculation and a love story, but I it is not played out as well as I would have hoped. Having seen The Davinci Code, it is too much alike and not as believable. The search for the Holy Grail is one thing that is more realistic than finding invisible writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence that was stolen and then discovering a massive treasure. Overall the movie is well thought out and all of the elements help to create flow to the plot line. The actors/actresses were adequate and, I thought, well cast for the roles. Nicolas Cage, I would not have pictured in this film, but he did a great job fulfilling the role. This film is one that I would recommend for younger children and young adults who like the mystery sort of film. There is a sequel that will be coming out in December of this year and hopefully it will be just as good, but a little bit more believable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie for the most part.,"I thought this was a pretty descent movie, not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean but still descent in it's own way. I didn't even notice that it was slightly long, I guess cause I was into the movie. I'm not gonna sit here and say it was great, but it's worth a look. Nick Cage was kind of his same old self but Justin Bartha brought some good comic relief to the movie every time it got a little to serious for it's own good.

Surprising,"When I first saw the trailer for National Treasure, I thought ""wow, that looks awesome."" Then later on, my brother was watching Nickelodeon and it was advertised on there, and then I discovered it was made by Disney. I used to have no problem with Disney, but their past efforts have been rather lame. When it was first released, people in my school were saying how good it was. I decided to go see it. When I saw it, I was amazed at how good it was. In some ways it's like The Da Vinci Code. There are plenty of historical messages on everyday items that we use. The cast is excellent. The stars include Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, and Jon Voit. The cast really helps the movie move along. For all of you teens out there who think this will be lame because it's only rated PG and is made by Disney, it isn't that way at all. It is family friendly, but there is enough action to make it seem like a PG-13 movie. This is also similar to Indiana Jones with the narrow escapes and car chases. Jerry Bruckheimer proves that even after some bad movies he has done, he can still do good movies like he once did.

"A fetish for combining archaeology, action, and history is served.","National Treasure was great. I rated this so highly because it touched on several of my own personal movie fetishes: archaeology, action, history. My thoughts were turned to a childlike admiration for our founding fathers like I hadn't felt since watching ""Johnny Tremain"" in grade school. The ""tomb raiding"" qualities were far better than in the ""Tomb Raider"" movies, which hinge the survival of all humanity on ancient artifacts (though they didn't seem very effective at their task in past, why has humanity lasted this long beyond the invention of such terrible devices?)To criticize NT, the movie is not going to win an Oscar in any category. and Bruckheiemer's addiction to Nicholas Cage made the main character (Benjamin Franklin Gates) seem like a reincarnation of the guy who saved San Francisco in the ROCK! In all, go see this movie if you like it's themes, please don't look for substance and suspend your disbelief when the good guys and bad guys easily navigate miles of historic Philadelphia at a pace that would put the significant sites on either end of the same block (or would qualify them for the Olympics.)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nicolas Cage fully commits to his role, and his character's backstory was surprisingly well-developed, and made the ending a lot more satisfying. Sean Bean is also entertaining as the villain, and the dynamic between the two characters really works. The premise is obviously ridiculous, but it leads to a lot of fun sequences. Unfortunately the story just became waaaay too convoluted by the end, and the amount of twists that happen towards the end of the film is just stupid, and it made me lose interest quite a bit towards the end. The film was still entertaining, but there was just too much going on in the second half for me to enjoy it as much as the first half. Overall though, this is still an entertaining time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"'Jack Of All Trades, Master Of None'","Last week I went to see National Treasure with 2 things on my mind. First, I was a Cage fanatic, I love his movies packed with unbelievable action and second, this movie was given thumbs down by practically all critics. After seeing the movie I can understand why the critics disliked the film.All the incidents happens at such a tremendous pace that it is hard to believe that just 2 mere guys happen to steal the Declaration Of Independence which must surely be the most protected document existing on the face of this earth. Although the entire concept of the movie is excellent and it has a lot of historical references, (I dunno if they are incorrect, since I'm not a history prof). The plot of the movie is somewhat similar to 'The DaVinci Code'.But the entire movie would be highly underestimated if you are judging by the fast pace of the movie. At the beginning young Gates finds out that his family holds a secret, a secret that leads to a treasure, a treasure so big and so huge that it is not for one person to handle. Then he gets the first clue to the treasure, and the next scene he is at some polar ice caps searching for a ship. I mean where do we know the clue is a ship.........Also, the entire affair, if indeed there was an affair, between Cage and Kruger is extremely patchy, to say the least. Jon Voight is marvelous as Cage's father, he plays an unforgettable role. Also, Riley Cage's assistant adds comic relief to the movie. I must say that the director tried to create a classic but extremely patchy screenplay, plays down his attempt to create a 'Jack of all trades'. He wanted a mixture of all recent Cage movies in one. We can clearly see a touch of 'Gone In 60 Seconds', 'Con Air' and 'Windtalkers'.Apart from these minute omissions of detailing, mainly to reduce the length of the movie, it is thoroughly enjoyable. If you are a Nicholas Cage fanatic, I'm sure you'd love this movie. As for others go and have a glimpse of it. Don't listen to the critics, it ain't that bad. And if you love watching movies about high priority steals, then also there is a scope of liking to your plate.I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nice,"It's my first post here and i'm doing it only because i've just finished watching this movie (remember i'm in Portugal so it has just arrived) In my opinion it's a fine movie, really easy to see but i believe you could also see it in your sofa and it would be almost the same! It made me remember the good old ""indiana"" but along with the new ""da vinci code"" so in a scale from 0 to 20 i give him a 16! The riddles where too damn easy to solve and the background scenarios where too obvious! I really liked Nicholas cage performance and the soundtrack was terrific! Take care and please show your opinion i'll do the same at the next movie i'll watch",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Yawn... Yet another Brit Bashing Movie!,"Considering that the US is supposed to be an ally of Britain and the UK it never ceases to amaze me how often American movies resort to anti British Propaganda as though Britain was an enemy.This movie is no exception, its whole basis is on the shaky foundation of the pretext of keeping some enormous hoard of treasure out of the hands of Britain.The only word of truth throughout the whole Brit Bashing Fest was that the signatories of the declaration of independence were in fact ""Traitors"" and had committed ""Treason"" against their sovereign nation.If you can get past the blatant Anti British Propaganda you are left with an average fantasy adventure movie that has been done so many times before that this particular offering pales in comparison to earlier and much better films of the genre.Many people will say ""Its only a movie"" I say ""so were all the movies made by 'Leni Riefenstahl' and see what they lead to!"" I say if America wants to declare war on the UK then they should have the decency and the courage to just do it with all the international condemnation that will entail instead of cowardly attacking the reputation of Britain with yellow bellied propaganda like ""National Treasure"".",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable hour and a half.,"OK, when the main character's name is Benjamin Franklin Gates, you know this is not a movie to be taken too seriously. And yes, this one has obviously gotten a LOT of inspiration from ""The Davinci Code"" (as well as just about every treasure hunt/heist movie ever made), but it still is fun and enjoyable on its own. In fact, I thought this was a great movie--it's interesting, exciting, and suspenseful from start to finish. It also had some pretty funny lines, and to top it off, Diane Kruger is one amazingly beautiful woman!Just a few things bugged me. For instance, I can't imagine the Declaration of Independence can be tossed around like that. When Nick Cage started rolling it up like a cheap poster, I wanted to shout at the screen, ""CAREFUL, you idiot!"" I really don't know how durable the thing is, but still. Plus, the grease and oil from all those people touching it with their bare hands can't be too good.Also, how come, right when they need to drop lemon juice on it to read the invisible map, Jon Voight's character just happens to have about a dozen lemons on hand? This REALLY bugged me. No sane person would have that many lemons in their house. Barring some kind of lemon fetish, I would guess the average person goes through about two a year.Small details aside though, this is a very enjoyable flick that is worth seeing in theaters. You won't be disappointed.8/10 stars.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty good movie.,"I give this 6 out of 10 stars.It was good movie. I have to admit, I thought the premise was stupid but I was wrong.The story is about the Founding Fathers of America and their ties with a secretive society called Freemasons which is somehow tied with the Knights of Templar of Medieval Europe. It seems that riches beyond belief was hoarded by these people throughout the ages and one of the keys to this treasure lies with the document, Declaration of Independence.I am not a fan of Cage but he did a good job in this movie. He plays the smart but obsessed person named Mr. Gates, who is on a mission to find the mother-of-all treasures. In his way is a dangerous man who once funded the endeavors of Mr. Gates, but are now rivals in this dangerous pursuit.I like the whole conspiracy and the tie in with the Knights of Templars. Again, a good movie. I could see why this movie did well in the box office.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Fun Action Adventure Popcorn Flick,"""National Treasure"" was a film that I never got around to see when it was first released in theaters back on November 19, 2004 however it actually hung around for quite a long time and I was actually still able to see it tonight January 24, 2005 at the local multiplex. This is one of those movies like ""Saw"", which I watched last night for the first time that I could really kick myself for not running out and seeing. So continue reading to find out more about my opinion of ""National Treasure"".""National Treasure"" is a movie about a man named Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) who comes from a family of treasure seekers that have been hunting for most of their lives to find this hidden treasure. Ben finds leads to the treasure that no one else has or can figure out but this is when the trouble starts because the group of treasure seekers he's with try to kill him. It then turns to a battle of who's smarter and who can find their way to the treasure first, Ben, Riley (Justin Bartha), and Abigail (Diane Kruger) or the other team who backstabbed Ben. Lots of action and interesting questions ensue¬Ö ""National Treasure"" stars Nicolas Cage. Nicolas Cage has two types of roles in his career award winning roles like ""Adaptation"" and ""Matchstick Men"" or action style roles like in ""The Rock"", ""Con-Air"", ""Face-off"", and this film ""National Treasure"", both of which he is terrific at. His performance in this film was fun, energetic, and smart. Nicolas Cage played the role very nicely. Also in the film is Cage's co-star Diana Kruger (Abigail) who was pretty much the only female in the entire movie and was the perfect match for Cage's character Ben as the smart and knowledgeable love interest (which I say very lightly because this story did not feature a love story. Thank God!). Also Justin Bartha (Riley) was the perfect sidekick who brought some chuckles into the story. Sean Bean played the bad guy Ian Howe and was very good at playing the bad guy role because I didn't like him from the moment he first came on the screen. Harvey Keitel was also involved as Police Detective Sadusky who was on the case and he played the cop role just fine but normally that's all we ever see Harvey in so I guess it's good he sticks to a role that he can play well. And finally Jon Voight also stars as Patrick Gates, Ben's father. He plays the concerning father role very well and I enjoyed seeing Mr. Voight in the film.Four writers wrote this film, which normally scares me because most films that have more then two writers usually suck but I guess this one proves me wrong. Without going into details about their less than average careers so far, writers Oren Aviv, Charles Segars, Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberley, and Jim Kouf all had writing credits for this film. What I liked about the movie most was its script. I liked how the movie was rated PG and was still good for both adults and children a like. This movie has been compared to ""Indiana Jones"" in the sense of the story. I would have to agree to some extent. It was nice to know someone could throw together a screenplay, which was pretty intelligent but still managed to have lots of action and a few laughs. It was a breath of fresh air seeing a family film, which wasn't animated that we could all enjoy. All meaning adults and children a like. It was like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Back to the Future"" in that sense. A film that didn't contain any sexual content, cursing, or any disturbing violence but still managed to make the audience stay glued to their seats and munch on their big bag of popcorn. I would also like to point out that the love story between Ben and Abigail was never developed which I really must say was a terrific move because it was like you knew they liked each other from the moment they first met each other but they didn't elaborate on it which was very nice to see.""National Treasure"" was directed by Jon Turtletaub who like the writers on this film has a less than average directing career, with movies on his resume including ""The Kid"", ""While You Were Sleeping"", and ""3 Ninjas"" which to me were all very lame. However he really out did himself with ""National Treasure"" because I must admit I was impressed with his directing on this film and his choice of locations and sets. It had a very ""Indiana Jones"" feel to it. Some shots where excellently shot like the scene underneath the church. I know the critics gave ""National Treasure"" average reviews Mr. Turtletaub but the American audience loved it. Keep the classic 80's adventure films alive and make more films like ""National Treasure"" So In Conclusion, I can't say anything really bad about ""National Treasure."" It was the perfect Popcorn movie, which was both good for adults and children. It had a good story and good characters. The film's acting or story doesn't feature anything that the Academy will be looking for that's why we have movies like ""Sideways"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". We have movies like ""National Treasure"" so we can sit back, relax, and have a good time. My advice is to just buy the biggest popcorn at the theater and sit back and enjoy the ride that's all I can say about this one. Enjoy it! MovieManMenzel's rating for ""National Treasure"" is an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable,"I honestly thought this movie was going to be terrible and luckily enough I came out pleasantly surprised. To start off I must state the plot was incredibly flawed in not just the concept alone. But the fact that Nick Cage can put together these impossible riddles out of the blue was ridiculous. Or that Sean Bean could figure them out as well even when he didn't have the clues was even more so. Add some crappy dialog and you end up with an unappetizing combo. However despite all these negative remarks I still thought it accomplished more good than bad. It did this through the sense of amazing adventure sequences and well thought out action scenes that weren't overdone. While it's not as good as ""Raider of the Lost Ark"" I did think it was one of the closest attempts since then with the exception of maybe the two ""Mummy"" movies...but they were a whole different ball game themselves. Diane Kruger didn't look as good in this as she did in ""Troy"" but her acting was slightly better even though she's still not that great at it. There's a model for you. I felt it was worth my money and enjoyed the exploration of it all!Final Quest:Movies: Was actually worth it believe it or not.DVD Purchase: No, only because I wouldn't watch it more than once a decade.Rental: If you don't catch it in theaters then do so on the small screen!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Adds Pride to knowing history,"Cage is a renaissance actor, he can play just about anything which is something to be said in the modern world of film. Sean Bean is one of the most underrated actors of the present day, he is wicked as the supporting role in this movie, as is Keitel and Voight. The movie is fast paced all the way through. There are plenty of twists and turns that keep the viewer interested through the films 2 hour running time. I'll admit I am a bit bias, seeing as how i major in history. This movie also a bit bias to the American view of history, but by living in Canada, I am used to it.The movie borrows elements from Raiders of the Lost Ark, however it is more human oriented, and their is no diabolical plot, which is all too common in treasure movies of the last twenty years. The cast and crew was very well suited for the jobs they were assigned. I applaud the director and production team for their effort to display just how important history is. Aside from the academics, there is allot of Hollywood technique within the plot and action sequences which are unrealistic, but who goes to the movies to watch the real world anyways? great appetizer for history and great entertainment for those who wanna view it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Relaxing.,"I didn't expect much from a movie that finds loads of treasure hidden in the heart of NYC. I knew it would be foolish to try to find witty script with believable and logical storyline. The film is for pure family entertainment, a target which it reached quite fruitfully. This is a film to watch in a relaxed mood, not to be bothered by the lack of silly detailing and realism.The theme, a secret code running in a family/cult to protect a treasure, is now a very popular one. The story finds its way through the formula of 'clue leading to another clue'. And for the mixture of these two elements, the viewer never loses his interest. The clues are not too complicated, well-carried out and most of all, fun. I was beginning to suspect there's actually no treasure, but that was only my complicated paranoia.Nicolas Cage is always fun to watch. And this role of a treasure-hunter suits fine to him. Diane Kruger looks nice as Abigail Chase. Justin Bartha is quite good as Cage's sidekick. The film also has Jon Voight and Sean Bean.To tell the truth, it is one of the few decent treasure movies I've seen lately... more realistic than 'Tomb Raider' and with a touch of Indiana Jones, all in New York. I liked that.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Clearly meant for the kids.,"I watched this movie last night on one of the pay-per-view channels, and while watching it I quickly wondered why I bothered. In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of 'Conspiracy Theory'. Why? Maybe because of the casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not to mention Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer. Now I'm wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a l√† 'The Goonies', which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise. Perhaps it's because 'The Goonies' was clearly targeted toward the pre-teen and teen audiences. Whereas 'National Treasure', judging from the previews, was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience.Suspension of disbelief is one thing. It's how one can enjoy sci-fi and horror. But I found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracy-laden tripe being shoved at the audience. Oh, the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment. ""Wow! The Masons. The Knights Templars. You know, this could really be true!"" I think the writer really lost me when Gates said the Founding Fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the British! And just were did the Knights Templar come from? New Jersey? Oh, I forget. From France! Which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in Philadelphia during the Revolution. It was brought there by agents of Napoleon! Anyway, you see what I'm getting at. The premise of the movie is interesting. And I really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama. But it just comes off as another kid flick in grown-up clothing. In the end I think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree.I've just finished watching several items by Werner Herzog and Istvan Szabo. It's a shock to switch from fine dining to Hollywood Big Mac and fries.Okay, okay. If you pant over chases, explosions, and 'gee-whiz' gimmickry you'll enjoy 'National Treasure'. But it's the sort of movie, well, have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out? And all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like, ""Wow! Did you see how that thing blew up? That was so cool!"" 'National Treasure' is that kind of movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dan Brown?,"First, I'd like to say that it is a very entertaining movie. Watch it! Like I read on one of the comments, I felt it was just like Dan Brown stuff. Too much like 'Da Vinci Code'. Instead of PS, you have Masons here. Instead of Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Newton, you have Sir Washington, Benjamin Franklin here. Initially (for first two minutes) I actually thought it was the movie based on Da Vinci code.Nicolas Cage is cool in the movie. No antics like Face Off here. Just normal cool dude. The character Riley was funny and endearing. Diane Kruger was also good looking in the movie.One way to describe the story is - Trasure Hunt. I could never guess where they got all the money for the hunt.The ending was fine. Seen lot of movies where there are no treasures in the end or Treasure is destroyed in the end (McKenna's Gold, Congo and many more). A red Ferrari is always a good ending. (Just a digression: did any one read 'The Monk who sold his Ferrari'?) Nice movie, but you'll never buy its DVD :-)SVIyer",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not much of a treasure of a film,"There have been many movies about treasure hunters and there is not much that you can work on in terms of the story. This movie certainly fits this description. Even though they added some elements to enhance it, I found the story mediocre. Once the premise was set at the start it's pretty much downhill from there. The ending also was too cheesy and was rather disappointing.What I found quite laughable were the names of the leading characters. Names like Benjamin Franklin Gates and the supposedly German name Abigail Chase. Surely they could have thought of better and more original names than these.In terms of the acting I think most of the cast did a good enough job. There were times that Kruger's acting was poor. Perhaps her relative inexperience is to blame. Also her accent was evident on some of the scenes which I thought didn't fit her character even thought the filmmakers tried to mask that with a thin excuse.Didn't really think too much of them adding some humor in the form of Riley. There were times that his one liners were very amusing and at times a little annoying.Not one of the best movies by a long shot but a good enough film if you want something light and perhaps something to relax you after a long week.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Rollicking Good ""Boy's Own"" Adventure.","Disney hit the right spot with this live-action adventure yarn. This film has everything. An imaginative and well-structured story. Fully fleshed-out characters that are both believable and relatable. Great direction, which takes you on an enthralling and entertaining rollercoaster ride of thrills, action, and history. In fact, there is very little wrong with this picture.Okay, so history isn't the most exciting of subjects when you're at school... and to be honest a lot of it still bores me. So when I heard the concept of the story I did groan a little. However, great news for me, and the rest of the audience, is that the team of writers keep this story very far away from Driesville. So thanks to Jim Kouf, Oren Aviv, Charles Segars, and Cormac & Marianne Wibberley for giving us such a great story and cast of characters. Down to this story and film alone, I prefer Benjamin Franklin Gates over Indiana Jones and Robert Langdon. Not only does Gates have something to prove it's personal. This gives him an added depth the others don't possess.But a movie is a visual beast. Thank God that Jon Turtletaub had a good and firm grip on the directorial reins. For one thing, he has a great eye. There wasn't a single instance where my eyes strayed from the screen. He has great composition and detail manipulation. Without this, the revelation of the ""treasure"" clues would have lost a lot of their power, which would be a shame. Here he makes them a substantial part of the story. Though it's the action sequences that pack a considerable punch. I especially liked the chase scene after the declaration theft. This is fast, frantic, and furious fun. Turtletaub also directs his cast perfectly.This is practically the perfect cast. Granted the writers created a great ensemble but without the right actors and actresses to give them voice and emotions the film could have sunk. However, all the players portray their characters perfectly. Even the interactions between them are excellent. I particularly like the banter and connection that Gates and Ian Howe, Sean Bean, have. Once, partners in treasure hunting they are forced to become competitors. Though it gets deadly between them they keep the chatter light and friendly. It's also nice that in the frenetic storyline we are allowed to see the budding romance between Gates and Abigail Chase, Diane Kruger.So if you are looking for a lighthearted, treasure-hunting, action-adventure film then this should be one of the first films you look to. You won't be disappointed.Come on over and check out my The Game Is Afoot and Holding Out For A Hero and Guilty Pleasures lists to see where I've charted this film.

Good pace for a PG-rated action flick,"I thought this movie moved along at a good clip. I was wondering how they'd squeeze two hours out of a PG-rated action flick. It was a refreshing break from blood, gore and gratuitous violence. I felt like the movie was a nice blend of Indiana Jones and The DaVinci Code, both of which I enjoyed.Diane Kruger, the actress who plays Gates' (Nicholas Cage) love interest, Dr. Chase, is very attractive. I found it interesting that she is one of two actors who were also in Troy. She starred as Helen. Ian Howe (played by Sean Bean) was the other. He played Odysseus in Troy.All-in-all, it was worth the money, even for a film with Nicholas Cage, whom I often feel is over-acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
brainwashing+moneymaker+stupid,"I am not one of those snobby critics that automatically badmouth all things commercial. I think naivet√© and simplicity can be entertaining sometimes. But National Treasure managed to wake up the subjectivity and snobbery in me, because it is THAT bad.1. The Freemasons and the Templars are presented as some kind of saviors of history, some mysterious philanthropists. In fact, they presumably were/are responsible for some of the most terrible crimes in history, right there with Stalin and Hitler. The crusades were unjustified attacks on the East, just like Vietnam and Iraq today (yes, I agree with those IMDb commentators that wrote about this parallel).2. ""The Declaration of Independence is not a bargaining tool. Not for me"", or something like that. Not only that it is propaganda, but it is active and brutal propaganda. That ""not for me"" is like an accusing finger pointed at the audience. Maybe I am being a bit paranoid here, but it is propaganda nevertheless.3. The actors did a surprisingly good job, but they should have skipped this one for the moral implications.4. I live in a ex-Comunist country and every time I see American nationalism and patriotism, it surprises me how similar it is to the Comunist one. Believe me, it is. I am not saying that America is not be praised for its obvious qualities, but believe me, extremism is the same, regardless of political beliefs.5. Museums that were not shown in the movie: ""How we stole the land from the Indians Museum"" ""How we promoted slavery Museum"" ""How we kill our Presidents if they become undesirable Museum"" Don't get me wrong, I appreciate America for its qualities, but it does have the tendency to be pretty defensive about the negative aspects.6.

"Well done, great fun: a mystery laced with history.","GOOGLE will be seeing LOTS of hits from this one, from ""Freemasons"" and 'Knights Templar' to ""Pass and Stow."" And it's wicked clever how Benjamin Franklin plays such a central role in this film, from Nic Cage's character's name (Benjamin Franklin ""Ben"" Gates) to inventions, code, letters under pen names, daylight savings time, and more. It is all done so cleverly that many people will wonder how much is fact and how much is fiction, before it reaches its full Indiana Jones level of frantic.Our obsessed protagonist, Ben, has spent his entire life pursuing a Holy Grail of American Colonial mythology that is complete with Knights Templar instead of the Knights of the Round Table. His Grandfather so anointed him as a child, and this boy's been taking it seriously for decades. His father, portrayed by Jon Voight, is the disillusioned realist Ben is determined he will never become. Ben follows clues as a bloodhound follows scent, oblivious to anything that would take him off task, and with the funding of the ever-creepy Sean Bean as unscrupulous treasure hunter Ian Howe, he digs up the pivotal piece of proof that his quest is more than a myth. The hunt then moves into fast forward, with clues tumbling like dominoes. A presumption that there is an 'invisible' treasure map on the back of the original Declaration of Independence is just the FIRST step to the ensuing mayhem.The audience loved this movie, and my only objections were slight: why are so many doors unlocked, allowing our heroes such easy access to everything from fiber optic cables and conduits to historical landmarks?Beyond that, I had a rollicking good time at this flick, enjoying Nicolas Cage at his oddly quirky best, admiring Jon Voight's robust willingness to be a lumpy and crotchety old character actor, finding the buddy-sidekick role of Riley Poole played by Justin Bartha a delight that's just right in tone and texture, all the while being caught up in the how-will-they-get-out-of-this-mess excitement of each moment.The casting of Diane Kruger as female foil Abigail Chase seemed a bit too young for her character's power position in the historical archives, but she pulled it off with spunk and spine, which got me past her peculiar accent. There's a very clever bit with a gift from Ben to Abigail. In fact there are many, many clever bits and pieces that stay with you long after the movie is over. It was wise, too, for Ben to address Abigail's dialect, which defused some of its distraction. I have to assume Ms. Kruger talks like this in real life, as it was too extraneous to have been added as a layer of her character.What I actually loved about this movie were the definitively American locations -- from the Lincoln Memorial to Independence Hall, from the overviews of Washington D.C. to great long shots of the Washington Monument.The Liberty Bell, the Declaration of Independence, the historical trivia peppered throughout -- it was all just delicious in the sumptuous buffet of this movie. How refreshing to see a few true USA locations NOT being faked in Canada, Mexico or elsewhere!Getting back to the Indiana Jones comparison, down to Indie's prickly relationship with his father, this is a Red-White-and-Blue version set in modern day Mom-and-apple-pie-America. And it all works, ably woven together under Jon Turtletaub's slick direction, and branded with the Jerry Bruckheimer sizzle of humor, romance, irreverence laced with underlying respect, and pace, pace, pace. What fun! And best of all, you can take the kids, take the folks, take the sweetheart, and -- although hearts will race and nails will be bitten -- no one will be embarrassed or scandalized or assaulted by gratuitous anything.

"Fun, But Not Entirely Realistic","Whenever I see this movie, it takes me back to the time this movie came out in late 2004. I seriously can't believe that was 11-years ago. This movie still works to watch today, and won't seem so old. They already came up with a National Treasure 2 and it sounds like a National Treasure 3 is in the works. Nicholas Cage doesn't seem like that big or favored of an actor anymore, and this movie seems like one of the most popular and memorable films he was in.This movie might seem like a cool idea, as it's an action movie but it's an action movie in a different direction, dealing with history and the Founding Fathers. While watching it, we might ask ourselves if there really is a hidden National Treasure, and if there really are clues like depicted in the movie? The movie will make the treasure and clues come to life, even though there probably isn't anything like it in either the first or second movie, and it just is a plot for entertaining purposes.Though while this movie might be a fun one to watch, complaints I see from this movie are its predictability and improbability. Watching this movie, while a lot of movies don't seem like they'd happen in real life, but might still seem realistic, for some reason this movie doesn't seem realistic. The action in the movie which makes this movie an entertaining action movie seems like action we've already seen before which I noticed while watching this the first time. You might be able to predict the plot. The enemies in these movies also don't seem realistic. We can wonder if this movie really is an educational movie, or if it's mostly giving fictional story lines from the Founding Fathers and taking us to various interesting landmarks.Another complaint I'd have about the movie which you might have too, is the characters. I mean if there's a National Treasure movie, we'd want these same characters to be in it. But, I feel like we don't get to know the characters well outside of their interest in history and the Founding Fathers, alongside with their main objective finding the treasure. It also goes that way with the love interest with the couples in this movie. I mean the movie didn't really show chemistry between those two, only added it because they were characters in the plot.Some years later, Nicholas Cage would be in another movie with a plot somewhat similar, but not about the Finding Fathers called Knowing. His interest in that movie is determinism, and he also has we can say a piece of paper from that movie that also leads to cracking out codes with big meanings. I feel like Knowing seems like a more realistic film than National Treasure and has a deeper mood. I actually prefer Knowing over National Treasure.The technology and gadgets in this movie are also cool. It reminds me of the technology from my favorite movie an Independent Canadian Film called Junior High Spy. While Junior High Spy had bad acting, I feel like that movie seems more realistic, and it has a more sneaky mood. My favorite movie scene, is a scene from that movie which is a simple scene where Ricky Lazio wanders around the mansion property with that sneaky music playing. It just adds a real mood to it, which I feel like we don't see in National Treasure.The clues in this movie remind me of recent movies like Earth To Echo, and Paper Towns. Two movies I consider underrated. I feel like those movies seem more realistic.So, in all this movie is an entertainer and fun movie to watch.

A TREASURE WORTH THE HUNT!,"Let me start of this review by saying that before I attended the screening of National Treasure I really had no expectations or any real wanting to see this film. Nicholas Cage isn't one of my favorite actors, Jon Tutletaub is not one of my favorite directors, This Adventure treasure hunting genre isn't on the top of my list and the trailer just made it seem a little boring.Diane Krueger of the wonderfully underrated Wicker park and Mediocre but entertaining Troy was the only exception. However, I'm ready to eat my words. Everyone associated with the film seems to do more than an admirable job of making the film highly entertaining and laced with thinking man's clues. Nicholas Cage stars as the descendant of of the Gates family notorious to the historical community for pursuing a make believe treasure that doesn't exist. He finds a clue leading himt o the declaration of independence which he steals so that he can read an invisible treasure map on the back. The film tours many other historical locations. Setting up countless, breathtaking and exciting action sequences. Now don't get me wrong the stunts aren't so incredible but their all underplayed so that they hit home and seem more respectable. I must say it's not the best film out there but it's a pretty darn entertaining movie. The story and the clues to unwrap the plot are very interesting and the film is populated by many likable performances making it one of Bruckheimer's more likable efforts. Cage also make s a welcome come back to the action genre. So people if your thinking about going to see it. Do it this Treasure is actually worth the hunt! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than I expected it to be...,"I have to admit, I found ""National Treasure"" was a very pleasant surprise given how lousy I thought it was going to be. The trailers looked somewhat promising, but so far I hadn't been all that impressed with most Nicholas Cage movies with ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"" being the only two exceptions. Add ""National Treasure"" to that list.The subject matter is one that I've always been interested in, and I thought it was handled fairly well. I was disappointed they didn't go into some of the ""darker"" rumors about the Templar Knights and the Freemasons (ala some of Dan Brown's works like Di Vinici Code and Angels & Demons), and I kept waiting for an ""Illuminati"" reference or two to pop up somewhere but it never happened. Still, delving into the masonic background of the ""founding fathers"" of the United States was quite enjoyable and really a switch from most Hollywood efforts.Cage handled the role of Ben Gates very well... enough of the ""Stanley Goodspeed"" (""The Rock"") style without going overboard, and just the right subtle touch of a little ""Indiana Jones"" (any more would have made the movie unbearable). This is one of the few movies that I think his role meshed better with the other roles in the movie (particuarly the characters of Riley Poole and Abigail Chase).Justin Bartha as Riley Poole was absolutely perfect, and while I wish they went more into the background of how he and Gates got together, Riley was the perfect comic foil/side-kick. Somehow, while watching him, I could easily see Bartha playing one either Merry or Pippin in LOTR. In fact, a movie based on Riley as the main character would have some great potential, providing Bartha remained in the role.Diane Kruger is very lovely and a fine actress, and did quite well as Abigail Chase, but it wasn't until the end when I really thought her character finally stood enough on it's own.Overall, quite enjoyable and one that I have already added to my DVD collection...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Adds Pride to knowing history,"Cage is a renaissance actor, he can play just about anything which is something to be said in the modern world of film. Sean Bean is one of the most underrated actors of the present day, he is wicked as the supporting role in this movie, as is Keitel and Voight. The movie is fast paced all the way through. There are plenty of twists and turns that keep the view interested through the films 2 hour running time. I'll admit I am a bit bias, seeing as how i major in history. This movie also a bit bias to the American view of history, but by living in Canada, I am used to it.The movie borrows elements from Raiders of the Lost Ark, however it is more human oriented, and their is no diabolical plot, which is all too common in treasure movies of the last twenty years. The cast and crew was very well suited for the jobs they were assigned. I applaud the director and production team for their effort to display just how important history is. Aside from the academics, there is allot of Hollywood technique within the plot and action sequences which are unrealistic, but who goes to the movies to watch the real world anyways? great appetizer for history and great entertainment for those who wanna view it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fun blend of American History, Masonic mystery, and imagination.","The movie reminds me of the feel I had after seeing the first Indiana Jones movie (Raiders of the Lost Ark) - it was simply fun, clean, entertaining, clever, somewhat humorous at times, and especially suspenseful much of the time, with plenty of twists and turns along the way. I think Disney should make a new ride based on the movie.Like most movies, there are plot points and logic points that, if you think about long enough, are so impossible that ""purists"" might be offended. But hey - this movie is clean, pretty non-violent (the bad guys stun rather than kill along the way), and, well, just plain pleasurable to watch.Sort of a fun blend of American history, Masonic mystery and imagination.

National Education,"Now let's see....get a great cast of actors together, throw them into a treasure hunt scenario and you'd think you were on to a winner.But somehow NT fails to deliver. There are some good acting moments, great effects and sets. But the story gets bogged down with excessive and pointless exposition of American history. Likewise, after the first half hour the ""hunt"" drags on from one clue to another interminably. I actually struggled to stay awake during this section of the movie and had to be prodded to stop me from snoring on more than one occasion.The film would seem better suited to getting kids interested in history than in being an action movie. Not that it is bad. Just that it doesn't really grab you and make you sit up and watch.It's a shame really. Would have been nice to see a successor to the Indiana Jones movies emerge.

Didn't Want To See It... Glad I Did!,"When I started seeing previews for this movie, they it didn't really float my boat. But then my dad talked me into going and I'll never regret saying no. In fact I'm mad at myself for not wanting to go! This movie was awesome! It was because of the action, the mystery and the comedic asspect. Nicholas Cage was very good at delivering his lines with charm (and not being a big Cage fan that says a lot!). Another great thing about this movie is Justin Bartha... thank the lord for Justin Bartha. The funny geek! Everyone's favorite sidekick. One thing I really enjoyed was the historical part of it all, and how the entire adventure was kept inside one country alone. One thing that bugged me was my lack of knowledge towards the movie. I never took American history in high school, and being Canadian, I'm not familiar with a lot that went on. I understand the basics because a lot of Canadians are americanized... (i probably couldn't even pick out new prime minister out of a group of people!) But overall this movie ranks up there with my small list of action films... I only like ones that have comedy in them.

An enjoyable living history,"National Treasure was a movie my 10 year old son wanted to see so I was glad to take him. It was an enjoyable tour of many US cities which I enjoyed because I've actually visited almost all of the locations they used. While I'm sure the writers stretched some of the facts, I found it almost as enjoyable as the Indiana Jones films. Just like the Indiana Jones movies, you had the good guys, the bad guys, the artifacts, the chase, etc. Who knows? Perhaps the producers may make a trilogy out of it.I thought the movie spent too much time in one section while I had hoped they'd jump to a few more locations and reveal a bit more US history. It is one of those movies I'd watch if it came on cable, though I don't think I'd value owning it when it comes out on DVD. I would definitely recommend it as a movie worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Where are the Aliens in the story???,"There are two ways to see this movie. You can see this as a true or possible story (and I'm sure that many people do) and believe everything that is said in this movie. There are people who believe in UFO's as well, so why not believing that there is an unsee-able treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, leading to a hidden treasure that was gathered by the Romans and the order of the Templers and that has been taken to America by the Free Macons and the founding fathers of the USA.The other option is to see it as an adventure movie like Indiana Jones. Than this movie isn't all that bad, even quite entertaining.However, from time to time it annoyed me enormously that Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) always seemed to be able to solve the most difficult riddles without too much problems (It was like if he was some computer who just needed to scan all the information and than could give the outcome without too much hesitation), that he always seemed to be able to survive the most life threatening situations without too much problems,... that he was some kind of superman. Too often I thought: YEAH RIGHT, what's next: aliens have written it all down and it isn't just a treasure map, but also a star map which may be helpful to find their planet???Yes it is true, perhaps I'm a bit too critical. I'm sure many people will have a great time watching it and I'm not saying that I didn't have a good time either. It just was a bit too far-fetched to be really good.

Reminds me of Indiana Jones (sort of),"This movie has the flavor of Indiana Jones without the ""edge of your seat"" writing style. Nicholas Cage gives an awesome performance. Some cheesy sections in the movie, especially the brick from the clock tower. If the brick was found at a certain time of day how did they know the time of year. A shadow will be cast differently at the same time of day based on the time of year. This was a weakness of the script. Another problem I have is with the Archive Woman. I have meet several people in the archive business and not one would allow anything to touch the Declaration of Independence. Overall I was able to overlook these problems and enjoy the movie. Mainly because the acting was excellent and the puzzle solving was pretty cool.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredibly silly movie,"It would be best suited for children if not for the murders, accidental deaths by falling, and un-necessary car chases. I watched this and want my 2 hours back. I'm no fan of Nick Cage and this movie reminds me of why I'm no fan of Nick Cage. If you want to see the declaration of independence get folded, spindled, mutilated, rolled up like a Van Halen poster, doused with lemons, and hit with a hairdryer then this is the movie for you. I cringed as bad as when Mr. Bean ruined the painting of Whistler's Mother. Did I mention it was an incredibly silly movie? And the chemistry between Cage and the blonde chick was about zero. He just grabbed her and kissed her out of the blue, the man has no timing. This is nothing but masonic propaganda. Propaganda films never work their subject well. Look at other examples as ""The Postman"" (USPS), or ""The Omega Code"" (Christian Fundies). The only real actor in this flick is Sean Bean, who plays the generic evil dude with guns who chases Nicholas Cage throughout the flick.My only question is this: If the masons hid all this stuff, why didn't they give it all back later if its destined for humanity? Lots of that stuff didn't belong to them and I'm sure lots of foreign nations would be angry that the founding fathers hoarded it.

Great show for the parents and kids together,"Coleridge once said that anyone going to the theater must engage in the suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy a performance. National Treasure is an excellent family movie for all to see as it is suspenseful, beautifully shot, and with a plot similar to the DaVinci Code. Indeed, certain weak plot elements do call for the suspension of disbelief, but while this film may not rise to the level set by the Indiana Jones trilogy ,it is nice to take children to a movie which is not gratuitously laced with video- game violence or prurient -interest sex. Nicolas Cage, as well as the others in the cast, comport themselves very well and as said earlier this movie was beautifully filmed. The early promotions for this movie, especially the trailers done months before the release date, made me want to see this movie desperately and I was not disappointed and neither were my sons. Again, while there may be flaws, the fact that it is number #1 at the box office this week may be an indication that Americans love to see movies that are entertaining, well-acted, and capable of allowing all in the family to tag along with mom and dad.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Brave Failure.,"Jerry Bruckheimer. The undisputed king of the lavish Hollywood explosion. Chances are, if you find yourself sitting in a darkened room with a stupid smile on your face, having spent the last two hours watching things being blown up, your'e watching a Bruckheimer film ( or in jail. ) With National Treasure, I got the distinct feeling there was a concerted effort to mess with the formula. There are still explosive action scenes, pulsating chase sequences, and there is still a British bad guy, but there is also a semblance of a plot, and of due care taken in validating the historical aspects of the story. It is of course, mainly fantastical hokum, but crucially it never becomes farcical. This is down due to the actors investing a good deal of conviction into screenplay that lesser performers would have exposed as the creaky, unfocused m√™l√©e of slapped together genre staples and clich√© it is. Nicolas Cage for example, has proved himself as both a highly talented actor and a capable action hero, and is therefore well suited for this Indiana Jones meets Adam Hart-Davies role. While it seems that both the girl ( Diane Kruger ) and the techno-geek sidekick ( ? ) are both conjured directly from the stereotype store, there is guilty glee to be had in watching Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel slumming it so magnificently. Sean Bean is given far too little to do, and is in danger of reverting to the stock British villain that he spent his career playing until Boromir saved him. Ultimately, it's a formula action picture that tries bravely to restructure the formula and inject a little intelligence into the vein of mainstream cinema. The fact that it ultimately fails due to a weak script and a poor climax is a shame, and hopefully will not deter film-makers from attempting the same in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Slightly dull and disappointing, but sort of nice Disney movie","Good actors bored by a script transformed into sugar to be produced by Disney. Nothing bad; nothing REALLY interesting, except perhaps the original idea. Need I say more? According to IMDb, yes. So I will. The whole venture makes one naturally think to an Indiana Jones adventure, albeit a slightly and strangely weird one, because:1. It is mainly formatted for children,2. Except for the first few minutes, all the action is taking place on the East coast of North America,3. The plot is more predictable than the one of a Bond movie you are seeing for the 4th time!Since I must still add more lines to my comment for IMDb to accept it, I will briefly review the R1 DVD. The picture and sound are OK, but did not seem fantastic to me. There is an alternate (original) ending, with optional director's commentary, which has some interest. But nothing to really wake you up after the nearly two-hour movie. To end on a positive note: The movie uses historical American Landmarks locations rather nicely.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
reminds us that our history is our treasure,"sure, it's a weak history lesson, but it's a boy's patriotic view of history. it's a boy scout's view, and a dying view in today's amoral America. National Treasure is basically a boy's treasure hunt movie, The Goonies with adults solving clues to claim an impossible prize. It never stoops to cheap laughs and only slaps on one car chase and one overblown explosion. It's a love story and an adventure and anyone who longs to feel the vicarious passion of an adventurer can do much worse than this. Nicolas Cage might not be the best actor to convey this passion, his boyish charm fading years ago, but he's sincere in his love for his country's rich history. The real stars here are the locations with Cage following ancient clues that lead him to Independence Hall and the Library of Congress. Americans have their own national treasure in their history and in the stories of the founding fathers, and National Treasure is the only movie in recent years that attempts to remind us of this.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Entertaining family movie,"National Treasure really is a cute family movie. The action isn't too rough and the violence isn't bloody at all, so it's suitable. The movie is all about these two men who are searching down in an old abandoned ship under a big frozen lake, while they're searching they find these clues to a big treasure, and one of them is to steal the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage and his friend Riley try to convince Sean Bean's character to not do it but of course he and his men decide to anyways. And that begins the endless chase and race that drives the film. I liked all the actors. Cage is good here, and so is Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, and Jon Voight (Cage's father in the movie). The script is pretty average for a film like this. It's not to a great level, but it's not bad, really it gives you enough you need and then that's it, it doesn't try to dazzle you or anything, but it also won't let you down. The ending is well done, I enjoyed it very much. And the visuals are nicely done.

A gem of a guilty pleasure,"Ever since he was a little boy, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) has had one major life goal: to find the 'treasure beyond imagining' that his grandfather told him about 30 years ago. Many of his ancestors have also sought it; all of them came up empty-handed. It's easy to see why, since the cryptic messages that might reveal its location turn out to be hidden in the Arctic Circle, on the wall of Philadelphia's Independence Hall and even on the back of the Declaration of Independence.Just try convincing the staff at the National Archives to let you examine that item up close.How Gates unravels the tangled web of clues ¬ñ while dodging a band of thieves who are also on the trail of the treasure ¬ñ makes for an enjoyable adventure in 'National Treasure,' a lightweight caper comedy-thriller that benefits enormously from a strong cast and the breezy touch of director Jon Turteltaub ('While You Were Sleeping,' 'Phenomenon'). The 'North by Northwest' of a new generation it is not, but 'Treasure' provides two hours of easy escapism, several good laughs and a few 'how are they going to get out of this one?' thrills.After a patch of overwrought performances in some fairly awful films ¬ñ such as '8mm' and 'Snake Eyes' ¬ñ it's a pleasure to see Cage unwinding a bit and giving his audience a chance to smile instead of cringe. He's obviously having a high old time as Ben, who frequently seems like Indiana Jones without the whip, and his carefree attitude proves to be infectious.Cage is delightfully teamed with Justin Bartha, who all but steals the show as Riley Poole, a tech geek who's coerced into helping Ben on his mission. While Ben is patient and unflappable, Riley tends to be anxious and easily irritated. Faced with yet another in a lengthy chain of mini-mysteries, Riley becomes crabby: 'Why can't they just say, 'Go to this place and here's the treasure. Spend it wisely'?'Later, when someone asks how a secret hideout could possibly have been constructed, they're told it was built in the same way as the pyramids and the Great Wall of China. 'Yeah, the aliens helped them,' Riley adds.Also at Ben's side is curator Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), who waffles between guarding the priceless artifacts in the National Archives and helping Ben and Riley outwit their ex-partner Ian (Sean Bean), who is now racing them to the hiding place of the long-lost cache of riches.As he's in the process of stealing the Declaration of Independence to keep it out of Ian's reach, Ben reminds Abigail he's merely following in the defiant footsteps of the founding fathers who signed their names on that precious document. 'Had we lost the war, they would have been hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered and ¬ñ my personal favorite ¬ñ had their entrails cut out and burned,' Ben notes. He's not so much a fortune seeker as he is a 'treasure protector.'Jon Voight adds a note of gravity as Ben's disapproving dad and Harvey Keitel turns up late in the game as a cop who keeps insisting 'somebody's gotta go to jail' as a result of all this. The screenplay also includes an irreverent little poke at the real-life problems within the government's intelligence agencies in a scene in which agents are forced to admit that they had received a tip that the Declaration was going to be stolen, but they didn't act on it ¬ñ because they didn't consider the information credible.'National Treasure' isn't particularly credible either, but its bubbly mix of action, humor and suspense makes it a gem of a guilty pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So much fun that I forgot how bad it was supposed to be.,"""National Treasure"" is as bad as all the negative reviews say--stoopid story full of preposterous situations and events, with dumb dialog.I enjoyed every minute of it.For me, it was an excellent guilty pleasure. It was fast-paced, so I never had time to dwell on such silliness as Nicholas Cage digging for 30 seconds into the snow near the north pole and finding--not just the lost ship he was hunting, but the ship's name plate so he didn't have to wonder for one second what he'd found! But I didn't care! And every explosion and other disaster was telegraphed ahead, BUT I DIDN'T CARE! All the torches left in the secret cave for 150 years burned upon being lit as tho they had been soaked in kerosene yesterday! BUT I DIDN'T CARE! I found it smoothly edited and so event-filled that I just got carried along. Diane Kruger (Helen in ""Troy"") once more is an ice queen who can't act, but every time she was on screen there was a closeup of her gorgeous model's face, so I DIDN'T CARE! Sean Bean, playing the villain, who was the only actor present, performed in proper evil fashion, and I liked Cage's sorta comic-relief sidekick. Never mind the plot: it's irrelevant.The bottom line is that while I was watching the dang flick, I was recognizing everything that was wrong with it and simultaneously realizing that I was enjoying the experience.

Good old fun,"'National Treasure' is too long, silly and very entertaining. It is no 'Indiana Jones' but it has as much fun with its adventures and characters; that makes it more than worth watching.It stars Nicolas Cage as a treasure hunter named Ben Gates who believes a secret map on the back of the Declaration of Independence will lead him to the greatest treasure possible. Together with Riley (Justin Bartha) he will have to steal the thing to protect it from Ian Howe (Sean Bean), his former partner who is after the treasure as well, at any cost.While stealing they encounter the National Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) and of has to come along to provide Gates with a love interest. She does not believe them at first, but of course she slowly changes her mind. After stealing the Declaration not only Ian is after the three, also Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) and the rest of the FBI. In the second part Gates' father (Jon Voight) pops up as well, becoming pretty important in this silly story.Indeed the story is silly and could be even stupid, but Nicolas Cage is the kind of actor who can make things like this sort of believable. Together with fine actors like Keitel and Voight, a Kruger who is much better here than in 'Troy' and Bartha who is very funny, they create an entertaining and at times very funny adventure instead of just another film. That it is too long is hardly noticeable.Do not take it the least serious, just try to enjoy. There is a very good chance you will.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

8/10 [with explanation],"First off, I'll give you my rating: 8/10Why?National Treasure, in brief, is about Ben Gates' [Nicholas Cage] quest to find a legendary treasure that has been protected for generations by the Freemasons. He, along with his comical techy sidekick Riley [Justin Bartha] and government worker Abigail Chase [Diane Kruger], follows clues [often found in historic locations] hoping to find the treasure. Gates' rival is Ian Howe [Sean Bean], who is also attempting to locate the treasure.Well, for what National Treasure, it seems, desired to be, it did very well.National Treasure is a pure entertaining film. It's got action, humor, history [actually made enjoyable!], and about a ¬º teaspoon of romance. Several one-liners, mostly from Riley, made me laugh out loud. There's action in car chase scenes, running scenes, and some Indiana Jones-reminiscent sequences towards the end.All in all, this is not a high-intellectual film, nor is it compelling drama or mystery. It's fun and enjoyable and takes you along for the ride. If you like Pirates of the Caribbean, well, the experience reminded me somewhat of that.Enjoy!--",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nicolas Cage is...a national treasure,"Bordering along the lines of Indiana Jones and Disney's blockbuster Pirates franchise- National Treasure never really has a chance to provide much originality- but does prove to be a rather entertaining endeavor. There's no doubt that the plot of this film is interesting, looking for a secret map to treasure on the back of the declaration of independence. It can feel very reminiscent of Indiana Jones with its wisecracking archaeologist hero at the seems, but I did find it a lot more enjoyable than those films to be completely honest. The dialogue does feel very dumbed down at times, an effort to please younger audiences im sure- and the sidekick comic relief character played by Justin Bartha feels way too forced to be genuine and ultimately proves to be rather annoying. It can be predictable at times, but a lot of the chases and action throughout are rather exciting and entertaining to watch. Nicolas Cage is a fun and charming lead, and it's clear that this film would be nowhere were it not for him. Its villains are generic, and many of its side characters are as well- but I can't say I didn't have fun watching it and exploring the fantasy world behind so many things I learned in history class 8 years ago. In the end, National Treasure isn't anything grand- but is a mildly enjoyable little adventure flick that I certainly wouldn't mind catching pieces of again.My Rating: 6.3/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable Family-Friendly Caper,"I heard big things about this movie from the get-go, and I must say that most of those things are right. When Jerry Brickheimer started producing films for Disney, I began to wonder why. But in the end, it looks like a good marriage. To date, the Bruckheimer/Disney team seems to fare pretty well, and ""National Treasure"" is a testament to that union.Nicolas Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Gates, with Jon Voight playing his father, Patrick Henry Gates. And Christopher Plummer makes a brief appearance as Ben's grandfather, John Adams Gates (do you see a pattern here?). Okay, enough about the Gates family. I thought it was an interesting way to present the Gates family and their ties to American history.The whole movie centers around the Declaration of Independence, on the back of which lays the final clue for the secret location of the legendary Treasure of the Knights Templar. Early in the film, Gates leads a party to a clue that points to the Declaration, and some of that party, lead by the ""questionably legal"" Ian Howe (Sean Bean), split off. From this moment, the chase is on.Gates and his assistant, the eager Rigley Poole (Justin Bartha) try to warn authorities, but all of them, including archivist Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), laugh them off. At this point, any further plot points may be considered spoilers for those who haven't seen this movie yet, so I will stop here.For the most part, the performances were pretty good, though I did have a hard time believing Jon Voight as 30 years younger in the opening scene, which takes place in 1974. The wig and make-up he wore didn't help much, either (It's almost as bad as that awful get-up he wore as Howard Cosell in ""Ali"").I did enjoy the action scenes for the most part. There were a couple of chase-scene clich√©s thrown in, but they still worked. And for those of you who wonder if your child can watch this movie, it's okay, trust me. The creepiness factor is at most moderate (a few brief glimpses of long-dead bodies), there is some gun-play (but only from the bad guys, and no one gets hurt), only one person dies (off-camera), and I can recall maybe one or two (very) mild profanities. Besides, it's a PG-rated Disney film.One thing I can say about this movie is that it is somewhat reminiscent of action films of the late-1940s and early-1950s. This is an enjoyable family-friendly movie, and it will entertain you and make you think (but not too much).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just crap!,"Hi, I'm sorry tot tell you this, but if you actually think this is a good movie, you're retarded.

Captivating & Epitomizing our Day,"Over Thanksgiving weekend our group of 7 adults ranging from 21 to 55 chose National Treasure at the movies. Not one of us left the theater disappointed.The gripping plot, the historical value and context, the romantic vibes, the action and adventure, and the cerebral-twisiting elements created a remarkably unique film in our time. It was clean to where parents didn't worry about an inappropriate scene for their kids; educational in that every ten minutes young and old gleaned a new tidbit about American history; and poignant for our day with the stark contrast between good and evil. The protagonist epitomized integrity and honesty - pertinent values for our time - and didn't succumb to pressure from the villains or his Father for that matter. He lived by what he knew was right at the core - he was intense, principled and believable. His sidekick, Riley, was hilarious and provided the comic relief. The girl, a new actress from Germany, added chemistry and poise to her part. And the villain played his role without a hitch in sophisticated slime, as Sean Bean always does. :O)All in all, a fabulous film symbolizing more of the conviction, awareness, and principles we need in our time.....equally enjoyable for young and old!",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Decent film, bad lead actor","I liked this film well enough. Sure, it's no masterpiece, but I doubt that's what the film makers wanted anyway. I have heard some people call it a Da Vinci code rip-off, but I disagree. It's more like an Indiana Jones film, but sadly enough without the sense of humour. Which brings us to the choice of lead actor. Yes, I know that Harrison Ford has gotten older, but 20 years ago he would have been the perfect choice for this film. I have nothing against Nicholas Cage, but in this particular role he's just not right. Back to the sense of humour, or lack thereof. I feel that a lighter approach to the subject would have been beneficial for this film. (Once again, think Indiana Jones...) There are some funny moments though, especially where the character Riley is involved. I had never heard of Justin Bartha before, but he, as opposed to Cage, is perfect for his role. I think this film works well enough as a couple of hours of entertainment, but it could have been even better. It's a good story, but it isn't perfectly told. I give it a 7/10. One last thing however - maybe it's because I'm not American, but I think there was waaaaaay too much patriotic blah blah.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very entertaining two hours,"Although not very realistic, this is a very entertaining movie - a cross between Indiana Jones and Jewel of the Nile. Violence in this movie was kept to a minimum as far as blood and guts were concerned, and the language was certainly acceptable. There were numerous points that were very amusing. And although not believable, there were some interesting historical facts that were delivered in the script that were enough to prompt curiosity and interest in the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin, U.S. Currency, and a few other basic historical concepts.

It's Meant To Be A Popcorn Movie,"This is supposed to be a more modern ""The DaVinci Code"", and it makes no pretense otherwise. The major difference being that it is more family-oriented, namely no graphic violence or profanity or sexuality. Yet it still entertains.How does it pull everything off? Nicolas Cage is a treasure hunter with British companion Ian who find a long-lost ship in the tundra. They find an old, engraved pipe which is the key to finding a much bigger treasure, buried under Manhattan, hidden by the Masons, and more clues are found in places like the original copy of the Declaration of Independence. Nicolas wants the treasure to be found for patriotic reasons, while Ian wants to gain a lot of profit, and they fall out and compete to find the treasure, which involves all sort of chases and skullduggery.Far from being sensationalist (other than its premise), the movie is muted, both in its characters and its action. Ian is simply a greedy man rather than a snarling mustache-twirler, and the only big explosion is from the old ship they find at the outset. More akin to Pirates of the Caribbean than Indiana Jones, it's mean for fun entertainment with no deep meaning intended. Not for everybody, simply for entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Don't Bother,"Nicolas ""Horse-face"" Cage plays the know-it-all treasure hunter (beg your pardon: Treasure PROTECTOR) who must explain EVERYTHING to EVERYONE because the audience probably isn't smart enough to know anything for themselves. He is also the one who finds EVERY clue because the hero must be the one who solves everything.Sean Bean plays the head of a British gang of thugs who want the declaration of independence to find the treasure and will (According to Cage's character) destroy it once they're done because they're all British and we Brits are all liberty-hating, anti-American scum. Well, at least none of them had a ""Cor Blimey"" accent.Justin Bartha plays the only character whose name I remember: Riley, a computer nerd, who has to explain to Cage how the Declaration of Independence is impossible to steal in full technical detail...gee, if only you mentioned that at the time Sean Bean was pointing a gun you! You could have avoided making Cage look like a hypocrite!Diane Kruger plays a woman who (we are told) has a slightly non-American accent because she was born in Germany, but we're almost immediately assured that she IS American so therefore she qualifies as a goodie.This film is so smug in it's pathetic attempts at being witty or smart and profoundly racist in the sense that anyone who isn't American (especially, if they're British) is probably evil. If you're one of those people who likes films that involve treasure hunting through ancient ruins, stick to Indiana Jones, which is more exciting, more witty, less phoney and above all less racist. Keep your hard-earned money away from this crap, it would be better spent on purchasing pornography.Some people have tried to defend this film by saying that it's aimed at kids and therefore shouldn't be taken seriously. So therefore, it's alright for films to basically say to children it's okay to steal stuff, think of the British as evil and, above all, tolerate people making crap like this.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I wonder whether the Dan Brown's Mickey Mouse Watch Trademark was related to this Disney's movie, some kind of nice trade between them.

It's All About the Benjamins Baby,"Typically I try to avoid anything that has to do with Jerry Bruckheimer (how does his last name pass spell check?) at all cost considering I'm not a big fan of watching things blow up surrounded by a lousy plot. Black Hawk Down is one of the few movies I've seen that he was attached to that didn't suck massively. Seriously, how can you possibly mess up a movie about Pearl Harbor? Well by poorly ripping off Titanic I guess. So I broke down this weekend and picked up National Treasure and hoped Bruckheimer actually devised a plot for the movie.National Treasure follows a family in search of a long lost treasure that was supposedly hidden by our founding founders. Nick Cage plays the son who is still searching for it while Jon Voight is the skeptical dad whose life was ruined by unsuccessfully looking. With the son being the treasure hunter (or as Cage's Ben Gates says, ""Treasure protectors"") and dad being skeptical, parallels are easily drawn with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. They even throw in a hot German chick just for fun. But the German chick in this movie has been nationalized and has access to the Declaration of Independence. That, of course, comes in handy when Gates needs to steal it.Gates need to steal the Declaration of Independence because his former partner, evil English dude, plans to steal it to use it to find the treasure for his own personal collection. Rounding out the cast is Gates' sidekick, Riley (think Short Round from Temple of Doom but older and less Asian), and Harvey Keitel in a rare good guy turn as the FBI agent who is looking for Gates.The plot is surprisingly decent. They is a good balance between historically accuracy and aspects that were made up to go with the storyline. You can really tell that some did their homework to make sure what could be accurate is and what is made up could be plausible. As for the action, Bruckheimer kept the big explosions to only one, which has to be a record low for him. The biggest disappointment I had with the action was, if you remember back to the trailer (which is missing from the DVD release, I hate when that happens), Gates is holding on to the hot German chick and asks her; ""Do you trust me?"" And she say, ""yes"" than Gates drops her. Everybody and their mothers were like ""Whoa"" when they first saw it but when you see it in the context of the film, it is obvious that she really isn't in any danger.As for the extras on the DVD, I mentioned earlier that it lack the theatrical trailer yet it had the Verizon commercial that when along with the film for some reason. It also had a nice documentary about present day treasure hunters and another one about the making of the movie. It also had the prerequisite deleted scenes, neither of which were that interesting. It also had an alternate ending, and to honest they went with the better ending in the movie. The cool thing about the extras is they give you clues that will help you unlock some more extra materials.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Of course it's not a realistic movie, but really it should have taken them at least a few months to find the treasure, even a few years.

In this film we are seeing Nic in top form, the all-around star we knew he always was.

It is a joy to watch this film, not only on the basis of it being an incredibly intelligent and entertaining film, but from the feeling of watching an actor assume the role he was always meant to play, to become the person who was just a few layers deep; the hero.If for some reason you live on this planet and haven't seen this movie, correct this mistake as soon as possible.

"""You're treasure hunters, aren't you?""","I have often said there are some movies where you turn the brain off and just sit back and enjoy the movie. And by the slimmest of margins, National Treasure fits into this category. It was close, but National Treasure is full of enough entertainment value to recommend seeing it. Nicholas Cage is Benjamin Franklin Gates, one in a long line of family members who believe that the founding members of the United States, with help from the masons, hid a vast treasure somewhere, and left just enough clues for someone, someday, to find it. The clues take a lot of interpretation (this is where you turn your brain ""off"") and neatly take our heroes to the next clue, and so on and so on. Gates is helped by his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha), who's job is to assist Gates in formulating the interpretation of the clues and to supply the needed joke at the perfect time. He does his job well. Gates also get the reluctant help from Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) who works at the National Archives and knows everything there we need to know to keep the plot moving forward. There is competition from a rival group of explorers looking for the treasure, led by Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who keeps the energy of the moving going. The one person who actually keeps his feet on the ground throughout the movie is Gates' father, played by Jon Voight, who is the one person in the Gates family who does not think the treasure exists. For Voight, this is a rare character who is not a nut-job, and he plays it very well. National Treasure is entertaining, there are some good chase sequences and the movie looks good too. And for once, not a single scene was filmed in Vancouver or Toronto. When we see Philadelphia, we see Philadelphia. Likewise with Washington and New York. If for nothing else, you will learn one or two things about American History (NOT about the pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill however, that was made up) and you will be entertained, and there is nothing in this movie any family to object to.

Cleverly Entertaining,"National Treasure (2004) starring Nicolas Cage, is one of his biggest films to date. Released back in November 2004, the film was considered a surprise hit, which eventually lead its way to a sequel. The enjoyment of this film isn't in its suspense, there's surprisingly little of it. The clues come too easily but are made cleverly for audiences to grasp at. The two lead actors don't seem much interested in each other, and the writers don't seem much interested in them. Though what engages in the film is the clever script that does work and is entertaining. National Treasure has received mixed reviews, all some are justified but for a film such as this (aimed towards a younger audience) many critics can be as harsh.Within what we see, including the prized document, the fascinating tours of the historical halls and passageways and ventilation shafts and catacombs we get as the good guys try to outrun the bad, gives the movie a sometimes irresistible ambiance.

Lots of explosions but no sparks,"The problem with this movie is not that it is completely implausible, though it certainly is that; my willing suspension of disbelief dropped out completely after the first five minutes. No, the problem with this movie is Nicholas Cage, who has all the charisma, sex appeal, and sly wit of a stuffed eagle. Even so it might have worked, except that the other problem is the detailed, repetitive plot exposition, which is laborious at best and tedious at worst. It's fun watching the characters work their way up the East Coast from one famous landmark to the next, but after a very few minutes it starts to feel like a children's scavenger hunt. It doesn't help that instead of emotional sparks between the characters we get lots of explosions and some really awful dialogue.

Then there is just the typical ending. Nicholas Cage at one time random grabs his upcoming girlfriend and kiss her in a tunnel, that all the love making you see. It a PG Disney movie what do you expect, but it not a very good Disney action movie.P.S. My friend fell asleep. People who are at 18 to 30 yrs old should not go to this",,Anonymous,Mystery

Dumb but fun,"I can't quite understand why critics insisted on trashing this bit of mind candy, other than perhaps because they were expecting more. I, on the other hand, went in looking for a bit of dumb fun, and I got it.Okay, Nicholas Cage's character always figures out the answers to riddles in less time than it would take him to tie his shoes. Okay, we clearly see bright shiny modern nails in 200+ year-old wooden structures. There are plenty of anachronisms and plot holes to keep you occupied should you get bored. But the point of the film is supposed to be that it's fun.No, it's not Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's more like The Mummy without the ""Ick!"" factor.

It really IS Fun for the whole family...,"I saw National Treasure with my kids (9 yrs. & 12 yrs.) and we had a GREAT time. There are few movies that I can make that statement about about with confidence, apart from most PIXAR offerings. Maybe I am old fashioned, but I take movie ratings seriously. I don't take my kids to PG-13 movies, yet, which seriously limits one's options. I found National Treasure to be a fun ride, with likable characters, plenty of suspense, good effects and well-placed humor.I will grant you that this is not Raider's of the Lost Ark, but the cool thing about it is that it used a great deal of actual historical information in the story-building process (unlike most adventure films that rely on fictional myths and legends). My kids (and yes, I too) were more interested in all of the objects and places we saw in the movie AFTER it was over. Does it make you contemplate the meaning of life? No. But does it make you want to go to the National Archives? Absolutely - and I think that is a pretty worthy legacy.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Super Underrated,"Many people wonder if there are secrets that the figures of history left us to twist our brains into thinking what was true, really isn't. National Treasure gave us that idea if we truly search, we could find out what really happened a long long time ago. This movie is about a group of people fighting to protect the Declaration of Independence and following a map that leads to the ""National Treasure."" Although the plot isn't all that believable, this movie provides us an interesting look at history which makes us forget the impossibility. The visuals are completely astounding and believable. There are always these moments where I thought the good guys were actually going to lose. The only problems that I had with the movie is that some of the characters are quite forgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exactly what I expected,"There apparently isn't much room for coming up with adventure stories that don't, in some form or another, resemble good old Indiana Jones's series. Apparently the bar was set so high one might actually argue it actually reached the peak of adventure movies, and that's almost 25 years ago. ""National Treasure"" isn't a bad movie at all, in fact it's pretty funny and at times even a tad unpredictable, but it lacks inovativity, something as I've mentioned before, hasn't been achieved in almost a quarter of a century-damn, it sounds even longer when I say it like this. How can this be, has Indie done absolutely every possible crazy stunt, been to the craziest places and discovered the most amazing things or is Hollywood just in some deadly serious hibernation state. Or have we just seen one too many similar movies and are just fed up.Well this one is luckily one of the better ones, due to a funny script and good acting by the three main protagonists, Nicholas Cage-with more hair than usual I think, Justin Bartha-a very funny actor whom I know nothing about, and a sexy Diane Kruger. Somehow Jon Voight winds up in every second movie about hidden treasures so he's quite the familiar face-nowadays you can't get a motion picture like this started if he's not in it. Harvey Keitel seems rather misplaced-not really much reason to place such a strong actor in a small role that doesn't add any crucial meaning to the whole plot. Sean Bean plays his villain the way he's played him(self) in ooh, just about every movie so far so it's pretty much a standard routine here-I'd be so bold as to say the most standard routine from a known actor. He does add some new looks and smiles here and there for a change, he actually has a different hairstyle which I think helped get him into the character of ""Sean Bean playing anyone-take 18sth"", but if the saying that the movie is only as good as it's villain is true, then Sean Bean is one of the biggest mistakes in movies in the last 10 years. The more I think about it, the more I want to bash the guy right now-he genuinely sucks. ""Goldeneye"", ""The Island"", ""Equilibrium"", even the ""Fellowship Of The Ring""-he just can't not act the same way he usually does-ergo he doesn't act at all, he just thinks he is. Apparently, so do some people in Hollywood. Me, I just know exactly what to expect and what not to-the latter being diversity.Everything else is pretty much standard here, the score is rather unnoticeable, which is always a shame in these types of movies-you should hear some familiar theme to cheer for the good guy. I think I should write a manual for adventure movies, don't you-meaning, I'm going to stop with the bickering and just end this comment.6/10-lacks inovativity and has Sean Bean and Jon Voight castRecommendations: kids, anyone who hasn't been ""spoiled"" by the Indiana Jones trilogy yet, fans of Sean Bean...man, they're never disappointed are they;)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Neither hero nor villain had very much characterization.....,"This film works. It's a fun action adventure/thriller/mystery with a dash of fascinating American history.I loved the movie yet agree that neither hero nor villain had very much characterization. The real ""characters"" were Jon Voight as Cage's dad and Riley as the sidekick.Both of them worked very well to provide emotional balance. As did one of the villain's sidekicks who exclaimed, after watching Cage kiss the babe while in dire danger : ""Why doesn't that ever happen to me?"" Made the evil guys seem more real too.Also, both Cage and Sean Bean are so good to watch that we somehow believed they had character even tho the script didn't include much. I felt Ben was never in any real danger. There was no real or else factor or any type of consequence if he Didn't find the treasure. Sure he would've proved his father right, been a miserable disappointment, but thats not really strong enough of a consequence, and going to prison was just silly.I compare this to Goonies because that film is also a treasure hunt and has a better emotional consequence I think. The kids set out to find the pirate ship treasure, if they fail the consequence is that their parents will loose their houses to some corporate monster, thus shattering the kids childhoods.I really enjoyed this movie and while I enjoyed it, I felt easy : They plan and execute a robbery that should be difficult, but they pull it off in two days? Not enough conflict or risk in the heist (understandable, they didn't have scads of time, but... eh...) The ticking clock was there, but the stakes didn't seem very high, even when they were - I never believed the danger. I couldn't get wrapped up in it (part of it, I'm sure, was two teenage idiots behind me talking through the whole thing, just begging for someone to say something so they could blow up on that person).Finally, with all the dust and spider webs down there, when the flame raced through the channels, I expected an explosion and a mess of melted gold, or at least charred documents from Alexander's library.....7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Propaganda?  Rip off of Indiana Jones?  Naw...just a movie.,"There was a point in this film where I laughed and said, ""Oh yea, this is just a movie"". It's really easy to get caught up in a few things if you aren't' careful. I don't think there was underground funding from the New world order, nor did the writers have Indiana Jones in the back of their heads when writing this. Interesting comments from my friends regarding this movie.It might be helpful to take a history class as well. I was actually impressed with the ability to weave in some history and pop culture into a nice piece of entertainment I could take my family to. It wasn't until after I saw the show that I realized this thing was only a PG. Wow. Way to go!I'm curious to know who went and got a $100 bill, only to realize one of the 'facts' of the movie was wrong. See, it's stuff like that I expect. It can help separate fantasy from reality. (I wonder how many people are digging up church basements right now!)

Just good fun,"The whole family went to see ""National Treasure"" last night -- mom and dad in early 40s, 14-year-old son, 10-year-old son. Everyone enjoyed it thoroughly -- even the younger one, who may well have missed some of the significant clues, and Dad, who thought he was just being nice to the kids. Muddled up history, improbable plot twists, cartoonish good guys and bad guys -- and still good, fast-moving fun that inspired lots of discussion in the car on the way home. It isn't great art and it is never going to be a classic, but it's much more fun than the critics gave it credit for. We might even buy the DVD for the boys when that comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent high concept movie,"Jerry Bruckheimer and his 'high concept' movies never push any cinematic boundaries and don't exactly give your brain a workout, but they can be respected in their own right as they often provide two hours of entertainment, and that's what you get for your money with this film; National Treasure. The film stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who goes on the trail of some rumoured treasure that has been hidden in the United States of America for centuries. To find the treasure, he must decipher a series of clues, each one leading to another clue, which in turn leads to another. This theory of the buried treasure has been in Cage's family for decades and our hero hopes to be the one to finally find it! As you might expect, the movie isn't entirely serious but, to my surprise at least, it does attempt some form of intelligence. The film plays out like something of a history lesson, and the central theme of both the British and the Americans hunting for the treasure echoes the war of independence. That, coupled with a tour of the USA's landmarks, makes this one very pro-American movie!The way that the plot plays out is very silly, and the backbone of this silliness comes from the idea of the characters stealing the declaration of independence. The idea of this is stupid, but the way that it transpires is even more so. However, it would appear that the film knows that it's ridiculous, and so it just has fun with itself. Unlike many films of this type, the jokes entwined in the plot are actually funny, and certain moments in the movie will no doubt make you laugh out loud. The action is generally well staged, with a car chase taking the central stage where that is concerned. Nicholas Cage has proved his ability to lead a film on numerous occasions, and he shows us why he's a good choice again in this film. While his performance in the movie isn't great, you've got to remember that he hasn't been given great material to work with; and he does make the best of what he's got. The rest of the cast is rather forgettable, with the exception of a nice little turn from Harvey Kietel. On the whole, National Treasure won't be making cinema history; but as no brains, big budget action movies go - this isn't a bad one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Fun,"This was an enjoyable film that I will add to my library. The Masons, Knights Templar, and the like, as guardians of secret treasures, has been in the literature for centuries, so it's a good foundation for a story.Young Benjamin wanting to become a knight was a nice touch, but apparently Grandpa didn't really explain much about knights when he ""knighted"" the boy. A little more of that would have been nice.Possible spoilers: One thing about Benjamin was his unerring ability to figure out complex problems in seconds. He knows that his former ""partner"" is going to steal the Declaration of Independence, so he figures out the only way to prevent that would be for him to steal it himself! Nothing wrong with that, but he hatches out the idea rapidly. He's portrayed as bright, but this ability is astonishing.No matter; everything is neatly packaged. A nice view.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Urban Indy,"National Treasure is kind of an urban Indiana Jones (an ordinary guy playing the hero, some action, some comedy)but John Turteltaub is not Spielberg. Nicholas Cage's character is obsessed with some old treasure, the biggest ever (his father looked for it too, and his grandpa), and he'll get through any kind of troubles in order to find it.In the beginning of the movie Turteltaub uses lots of ""slow-motion"" and other digital effects, but after a while he (wisely) puts all that stuff aside and films the story in a more serious way. The cast is just nice, but the characters are so stereotyped and the dialogs are rather poor and hackneyed.It is OK if you just want to kill time (maybe it is a little too lengthy).*My rate: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gates believes that there is a conspiracy to steal the original declaration of independence from Washington D.C. by thieves who seek the treasure. He decides to take it before they do. They are hot on his trail and he takes a female love interest and antique document restorer along for the ride with a trusty male sidekick. They uncover one clue which leads to another.

A nice little ride,"""National Treasure"" was a very nice time, and I recommend it to anyone wondering if it's worth the money. It's not really a roller-coaster ride, nor is it a psychological or suspenseful thriller. Instead, I think it is a nice combination of ingredients.There is enough action in the form of chase scenes and some occasional gunfire to satisfy the action-obsessed, but also presents enough of a puzzle to keep others interested, and vice versa. There is a the usual blooming relationship thing going on, as one would expect, but it never gets in the way of the movie's thread.I know that some of the conspiracy-minded will think that the treatment to subjects like the Freemasons and Knights Templar is superficial and simplistic, but who really cares, other than the nutbars who set their clocks by ""The Da Vinci Code""? It never attempts to spin an incredibly tangled web and claim it is actual fact. It touches on some historical truths and weaves them into the story without taking them or anything else too seriously.I would also say this is the perfect example of a movie where suspension of disbelief is required. Obviously, it is a little difficult to believe that, assuming you could steal the Declaration of Independence, that you could store and treat it in the manner they did and expect it to stay in one piece. Again, who cares? That doesn't really have anything to do with the story.There is also enough comedy an light-hearted moments typical of Nicolas Cage action films, but I believe they are a bit better in this film.In summary, I think that while this isn't exactly the greatest action film ever made, it's a nice combination of action, adventure, puzzle and comedy that will satisfy most people who watch it, and it's definitely a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Treasure Indeed,"With critics hanging crepe weeks before, I didn't expect much from the opening weekend for NATIONAL TREASURE.

In fact, while I'd heard the script had been re-sculpted many times, my only conclusion is ""who cares."" The action, the innuendo, the fantastical story line were all in keeping with the action-adventure genre and a jolly good time was had by all.

Simple and strangely lacking flaws,"Rating based on closeness to perfection, strangely enough it's quite close. I know that probably sounds strange, but given what this movie seeks to accomplish, it comes shockingly close. It delivers nearly perfectly in all aspects of how a movie should in this genre: thrilling, gripping story, excellent pacing, character development- although somewhat flat at times- and quite unique. I'd say the only aspect that's flawed is character development, as I mentioned before. Characters are somewhat flat, the only development really being a development of a romance and some goofy moments from Riley as comedic relief. I find that the development of the romance was somewhat poorly contrived, lacking real motivation or spark, the only real interest being the thrill of the treasure hunt. I digress, the movie delivers in every other aspect except for some minor gripes, none which I can specifically remember at the moment. Overall fantastic movie, thrilling.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid (if unremarkable) adventure movie.,"""Why can't they just say, 'go to this place, and here is the treasure; spend it wisely'?""Let's start with the most important thing: that Riley character was extremely annoying. He's officially in my annoying character hall of fame. I don't know if be was supposed to be funny, or what, but the parts of the movie where he kept his mouth closed were my very favorites. Just had to put that out there.As for the actual review, it's hardly a secret that I'm not much of a Nicholas Cage fan. His method of acting seems to be just playing the same character in nearly every movie of his that I've seen, from Gone in 60 Seconds to Ghost Rider. Needless to say, I didn't see National Treasure because of him. I did want to see more of Diane Kruger's movies, however, and the trailer made it seem like a more fun version of The Da Vinci Code, so I thought I'd give it a try. And that's basically what it turned out to be. It didn't change my opinion of Mr. Cage's acting skills, but I liked it.National Treasure is a combination of a heist film, an adventure film, and a historical mystery, wrapped in a friendly, summer blockbuster wrapper. It moves along quite quickly, and stays fairly interesting (as well as slightly predictable) from beginning to end. Lots of conspiracy threads about the nation's founders and the Freemasons are drawn together in a way that would make Dan Brown proud, but it never suffers from the forced grasps at importance that the two Robert Langdon movies have unfortunately buckled under. If you're looking for a family-friendly adventure movie that gives history a fantastical spin, you could do a lot worse than National Treasure.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Delightful Avant-Premiere of ""The Da Vinci Code""","Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is a treasure hunter, and his interest arose when he was a boy. His grandfather told him about a hidden treasure chased by their family along centuries.

Ben, together with his partner and friend Riley Poole (Justin Barthan) and the curator of the National Archives, Abgail Chase (Diane Kruger), try to reach the treasure first to protect it from the thieves.

Second, the whole path of this film flows extremely well - not only do we go up the East Coast after twenty minutes into the film or so, but the idea of finding a huge treasure - which had taken pretty much all of time just to get here - sounds exciting! In fact, this movie is so good that not only was I excited about waiting for the DVD, but I always tell my family to rent this every time we upgrade our living room entertainment center: They get a new DVD/VCR combo, I ask them if they could rent this movie; they get a new widescreen TV, I ask them if they could rent this movie! Maybe when they get a 5.1 system (I highly doubt that will happen), I'll ask them for it again! Yes, it's that great!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
the best adventurous thriller,I've recently seen the movie and i was just kinda feel that i was all waiting thru my whole life perhaps to see this movie.i mean who could u ever think of Benjamin gates other than Nicolas cage making a perfect chemistry with the stunning diane kruger taking all of us to the greatest adventurous ride.i guess its a must watch film for everybody out there.the most important thing about this movie is that coming all the way down with every clue there's seemed to be more clues which is obviously logical and very very relevant to the story.stealling the declaration of independence which may sounds a bit weird is another interesting part of the movie.there's has been a perfect combintion of comedy by the character played by Justin bartha which i guess has been well executed.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What?,"How this film gains a 6.7 rating is beyond belief. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly should rank among IMDb's worst 100 films of all time. National Treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on American audiences by Hollywood. Critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through.I love the justifications for this movie being good... ""Nicholas Cage is cute."" Come on people, no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid. This has to be the most stupid, insulting movie I have ever seen. If you wanted to see an actually decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. National Treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films. I bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some haven't been widely released yet.Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies. Time after time I've seen Cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is put to good use like in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation he is an incredible actor.Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Critics hated it, but it's a Great Film","For the script writers come up with this story, they must have talent, it's brilliant, the film is great. Taking a very basic idea and making it into a full on blockbuster movie, with academy award winning actor, Nicolas Cage. Jerry Bruckheimer is a well known Movie producer, with films like Black Hawk Down, Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl and Kangaroo Jack, there was no doubt that this would be a massive hit. Director Jon Turteltaub(""Phenomenon"") worked hard with Jerry Bruckheimer to get this into the cinemas earlier than the target date.Nicolas Cage stars as the brilliant Benjamin Franklin Gates, third generation treasure hunter. All his life, Gates has been searching for a treasure no one believed existed: amassed through the ages, moved across continents, to become the greatest treasure the world has ever known. Hidden by our Founding Fathers, they left clues to the treasures location. Gates' life-long journey leads him to the last place anyone thought to look: a map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The film is a lot like The Da Vinci Code because they keep finding clues after clues which lead to more clues.But what he thought was the final clue was only the beginning. The film was rushed towards the end as they probably could have made a sequel but nevertheless a decent movie, with a high budget, this movie will capture audiences throughout the world with it's exciting plot. Next up The Da Vinci Code.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Nicholas Cage has gone back to making lousy movies, apparently","This has to be one of the most pathetic attempts to cash in on a trend in recent cinema. (DaVinci code) This movie has nothing going for it. The characters are one-dimensional. The story moves along as people go from helper to adversary and back randomly whenever the plot needs them to in order to further itself. We have no idea why any of the characters other than Cage's do what they do. And Cage himself, well, it looks like he's forgotten how to make a decent film and make a character believable. I'm sure he got paid lots for appearing in this over-hyped money-grab. Let's hope he used it to buy something nice. This is profit-driven movie-making taken to it's worst possible outcome. It seems to be of little wonder that the box-office has had disappointing results lately.

One of the best treasure movies ever.,"I've just seen this movie again, and it stands up well to repeat viewings. In fact, I would go so far as to call it one of the best treasure movies ever.Originally, I was browsing the videos at the video store, glanced at this one, it looked thoroughly uninteresting at first glance, so I passed it over.Then an ad came on comparing it to Indiana Jones. Hmmm... I picked it up, flipped it over, it's rated PG and it looked like a fairly soft PG for the kids, who include a 4-year-old.AND it has to do with stealing the Declaration of Independence. OK, that's it. All I needed to know, I rented it at first opportunity.And I was not at all disappointed.Actually, my only disappointment regarding this film has to do with the 6.6 out of 10 that IMDb members have given it. I give it an 8. It's not Indiana Jones, but it's a good bit of fun - with a bit of history mixed in besides.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure Seeks National Success,"Nicolas Cage puts the silver in the silver screen in the edge-of-your-seat action adventure National Treasure.Descendant from a family of treasure-seekers, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage, Gone In 60 Seconds, Matchstick Men) strives to find the treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. One mere hint, ""The Secret Lies With Charlotte"" would lead to a series of clues and long sought after treasure.Directed by John Turtletaub (The Kid, Phenomenon), National Treasure definitely proves the talent of this magnificent director.Not only was there brilliance from the director and the plot line, but also the acting was tremendous. Nicolas Cage definitely reached his all-time high alongside newcomer Justin Bartha (Gigli). Other stars include Jon Voight (Varsity Blues, Holes), Sean Bean (Lord Of The Rings, Don't Say A Word) and Diane Kruger (Wicker Park, Troy).One definite eye-catcher of this film is the matchless cinematography. The camera work during multiple scenes keeps you engaged by every passing second. It powerfully adds to the thrill of the movie.If nothing else proves it wonderful, the box office just might. With its first weekend out, National Treasure takes in $35.3 million. Coming up close, The Spongebob Squarepants Movie gains $33.5 million in its initial weekend; leaving The Incredibles to spot number three after two weekends out.If you enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Johnny Depp) or Paycheck (Ben Affleck), this movie would please you.I personally enjoyed this movie the way Turtletaub intended. I know others did as well, catching the looks on the audience's faces as they immediately turned to their guests with satisfied smiles and content faces.Judging that it would have been an afternoon with a talking sponge or a date with Mr. Cage for seven bucks, I am fulfilled with the use of my money.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No awards--no nominations--no excuse.  Best of the year.,"It's great to find an adventure film with no dead spots and no gratuitous violence. I can always identify with Nic Cage's character, even when the rest of the film is a snorer (Gone in 60 Seconds). Diane Kruger is so smooth that it's hard to believe that National Treasure was only her third English-language film. Jon Voight has a tension in all of his performance that is similar to Cage's, which made him the ideal choice to play the role of his father. I'd love to see this pairing in future films. Harvey Keitel and Sean Bean were excellent as always in supporting roles (I can't picture either as carrying a film by himself). The film offers possibilities for sequels that could be very different from the original picture. My family and I saw ""National Treasure"" in the theater, then bought the DVD as soon as it came out. Is it possible to wear out a DVD from too much use? If so, ""National Treasure"" will be the one.""National Treasure"" received no Academy Award nominations. The Academy must have it in for executive producer Bruckheimer. I can think of no other reason--or lame excuse.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Boring ... No, Agitating!","I enjoyed this movie for a while. It was a full of adventure and clue seeking. Then one clue lead to another, that clue lead to another, which lead to another, and another, and another (I'm not joking here) and another, oh look another clue, and another, and another. The clues were cool at first and the adventure was neat. But it just goes on and on, the same ""I got a clue"" formula again and again.I wanted to blow my brains out. How could anyone think this a good movie? It's one clue after another and another in search of a treasure. That's ALL it is. The clues aren't even developed in an interesting way like the Da Vinci code. It's usually something you can't make out, until the supremely gifted clue decoder (Nicholas Cage) figures it out and explains it to us.It was cool at first, but by the end of the movie it drives you crazy, and it really becomes laughable by the time they find their 26th clue that leads to another clue. This movie was akin to Chinese water torture. Boring, and agitating ... to say the least.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Freemasonry, Illuminati, NWO","National Treasure touches upon a very real and sensitive subject known as Freemasonry. Because of this, many bogus bad reviews will be written in an attempt to undermine this film's forbidden disclosure of the secret organization known as the Masons. One thing they did not touch upon (for obvious reasons) was the Masons affiliation to the Illuminati. If this all sounds like conspiracy, that's because it is a conspiracy. Few who are focused upon current events would argue that we are rapidly moving towards the final commencement of a one world gov't which is commonly referred to as the NWO (New World Order). The ruling class elite of the ""33 degree"" freemasonry is called the ""Illuminati"", and they are the driving force behind this diabolical push toward a NWO. They will either implement the NWO or destroy the planet in their effort to achieve it.The film is not based upon fantasy, I personally know many Freemasons and was shocked to find out many of our ex-presidents and founding fathers were Masons. The plot is well thought out, the acting is very good and I rate this movie 10 for 10. After seeing the movie I highly recommend one seek out all available information concerning freemasons and The Federal Reserve System, you won't believe what you'll learn.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

(Let the record show that I am a theater manager, and did not contribute a dime to this movie. Moving on...) It makes me more than a little sad to see such trash making so much money. Cage does a great job playing a terrible character (standard action hero, with that comfortable sexist attitude America can't get enough of) going through the motions of well-intentioned (but ultimately clich√©') plot twists until the neatly packaged ending is dumped in your lap. I can't believe the waves of people who have come to see this movie. It never aspires to be anything more than temporary. And no one cares!! I guess it's mostly harmless, but as long as terrible movies like this dominate American cinema, America will never progress. This movie is just an extension of the times in which we're living.

Nicolas Cage had a difficult time appearing to be the scholar and the premise was difficult to swallow, and even more difficult to believe they achieved it as easily as they did. Everything was painfully predictable and sadly overblown. The only bright spot was Diane Kruger - she was at least a refreshing different face. The romance between her and Nicolas Cage however, seemed forced, like it was in there because the movie felt it couldn't survive without some type of romance.

Diane Kruger is a real beauty. And Nicholas Cage holds it all together as the mastermind tracking down all the clues to the greatest treasure in the world.Admittedly, you have to suspend your disbelief.

Normally I like Cage in Movies but this movie is bad,"I was terribly disappointed in this film. I watched this movie and then view CATWOMAN and in comparison, this film is much worse. It is quite easy to point out why.The plot in this film has so many holes in it that you could confuse the script with a piece of Swiss Cheese. The history is not accurate, the action makes no sense, the founding fathers of the US are not even presented accurately. I could go on for a 1000 words just on the holes in this but suffice it to say the holes in the plot on this film are so big that the writers should be put on a strict diet.The computerized action sequences in this are elaborate, but look too fake. I especially do not like the nearly 300 year old wood planks in a damp building basement that can still support weight and are not infested with roaches, termites, or carpenter ants. How could the pest control industry possibly buy that?Cage has a capable performance, and that is the only thing that gets this film to 2 on my ratings. Take away Cage, and this film is a zero, a big zero. In fact, this film makes Cage's HONEYMOON IN VEGAS look like a masterpiece.The support in this film gets a zero too. I can hardly remember their names. They should take that strong 200 to 300 year rope that the old elevator is on and hang this movie out to dry. I hope Cage will get some better material his next time out. If he can't get better stuff than this, he should go to TV & do a sitcom. He is wasting his talent in tripe such as this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Poor man's Indiana Jones turned out to be a great treat,"I felt compelled to write a comment after the smattering of so so reviews this movie got when originally released.Yes, Nic Cage is no Harrison Ford, and the locales are too familiar to be exotic, but that's what made this movie fun for me.I really did believe that Cage was a treasure fan boy. And I was giggling to myself that I'd been to many of the movie locations.The supporting cast of good guys was excellent. The love interest scholar is skeptical, but oh so curious. The disappointed dad (Jon Voigt is it?) just oozes contempt for the treasure hunt. The comical sidekick was hilarious.Even the bad guys were great. They weren't evil megalomaniacs. They were just greedy guys who wanted to make some cash. They weren't over the top cruel. In fact, they too were hilarious in some scenes. Sean Bean plays a bad guy at his best. He's even a bit lovable in this film.Perhaps the only actor under-utilized in this movie is Harvey Keitel. To be honest, there wasn't much role to be had. They shouldn't have cast him. A no name would have been sufficient.You will be pleasantly surprised if you pick this one up as a rental. I don't often think I want to watch a movie twice, but this may deserve a second viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
National Treasure,"I thought that this movie was fantastic! The acting and story of the movie were great! I would like them to make a second one, but I don't know if they are. I would also like to see it again. Nicholas Cage, Diane Kruger, and Justin Bartha were so good in this movie. It made me laugh. It made me wonder. And even at the end when they found the treasure, i got a single tear in there. I give this movie a BIG thumbs up! If you have not yet seen ""National Treasure"", you have no idea what you are missing out on. I believe that if you go and see ""National Treasure"" it will forever change your life. I strongly suggest that you see ""National Treasure"". You will love it, I garantee it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Smart, fun, thrilling and action packed... GREAT movie.","I saw this movie in a sold out theater. There were 3 different ovations including a huge ovation at the end. THE MOVIE WORKS. It's funny, action-packed and romantic. Clearly a lot of attention to details of interesting American history was paid by the filmmakers. The audience LOVED this movie. What shocks me is that it seems that many critics picked on this movie as well as the people who undertook the considerable challenge of making it. Clearly critics do not review movies for the public but for their elite friends and peers. The hotshot hot airbags must think it's not cool to like a thoroughly entertaining well made Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Why do we even listen to so called critics in the first place? At some point critics should learn to check their wannabe-but-can't screen writer egos at the door and review a film based on its merits and its genre. Worst of all, these particular dumber-than-a-bag-of-hair critics didn't even bother to verify that the script was developed years before DaVinci Code was written! Write your critic an email and tell them to get off their high horse and do their job because National Treasure is a GREAT movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lock this 'treasure' up in a vault and bury that vault so far down it reaches the core of the Earth and melts.,"There is a line in The 51st State (Formula 51 to Americans) where one character says to the other about a certain meal: ""Fish and chips mate, national dish"" to which someone else replies ""More like a national disaster"" before tossing it out of the window. This is the sort of line you might copy when talking to someone about this film: 'Entertainment, fun and CGI = National Treasure' to which anyone else might reply 'More like a national disaster'. ""It's not like Pirates, is it?"" says Ian Howe, played by Sean Bean in a 'nod' to Disney's other overblown, underdone live action romp Pirates of the Caribbean. Well actually, yes it's a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean and that link should be enough to deter anybody over the age (or should that be IQ?) of eighteen as far away from this film as possible.The fact of the matter is; if you crammed in any more formula, clich√©s or nasty representations into National Treasure then it would probably explode in a bright display of British villains, hard bodied blondes and one-liners. But that's exactly what we get here and at a time when the big budgeted action adventure film is wracking in more money than you might earn for Internet shares that rose throughout the 1980s. There was a time when these films did not exist; there was a time when you did not need to go into a film with that nasty sensation at the back of your mind: 'Oh, I do hope this won't be another crap entry in the genre'. Sometimes you get lucky but the sway is overwhelming and National Treasure is one of those that catches you out.The film plays out more like an scenario closely resembling 'The Da Vinci Code for kids' than it does an all round, children and adults orientated action adventure film. There are no thrills, there are no spills; there is no horror or jumps or violence and there are no interesting characters; merely names and appearances written down on paper with the actors/actresses' names accompanying them on the document. National Treasure is a passage ¬ñ it's a passage of scenes with no real logic nor fun, just complicated and uninteresting scenarios that exist so that 'bums-on-seats' specialist Nicolas Cage can come along and solve them.In fact the film is so bad when I think about it that it comes close to parodying itself. Nearer the end, one character states ""A jump like that could kill a man"" as Ben Gates (Played by Cage) leaps off a boat or a marina (I forget) and into the water from a great height. No, a jump like that will not kill a man ¬ñ not in this genre. This reference in alerting the audience that, in the real world the jump would kill a man, is second perhaps only to Jaws: The Revenge when it comes to conflicting the film's actual loyalties. The Jaws sequel scene in question is when a character states 'sharks cannot kill humans in the goal for revenge' thus contradicting the film's entire premise so for National Treasure to be on par with this sort of logic only backs up my idea that the film is really poor.But National Treasure is not just stupid, it is offensive. Nicholas Cage is a name and a face and one that will bring in the audiences which means more money for Disney. German pretty-girl Diane Kurger plays Abigail Chase who is, believe it or not, a doctor. There is a hilariously bad scene early on when Gates and his sidekick walk into her office and exclaim their surprise at the doctor being a woman ¬ñ no surprises from me. As an educated doctor who collects coins, Abigail Chase exists only in this film as a watered down love interest; a love interest that is only made apparent for the very last scene when a dumb joke is cracked to do with lovemaking. Although there is another reason the good doctor is a woman in this film and it is so that the character's cleavage is given a few instances of screen time. I have identified this as a tactic so that when the main characters are talking and going over the next plot points, the teenagers in the audience can ignore these particular 'boring' scenes full of dialogue and focus on the some necessary distractions ¬ñ how sad. And they call this a film.The bad guys exist in this film's world to merely spread menace and act all tough in an attempt to try and make an atmosphere. They fail because, guess what; they're European ¬ñ how original. Sean Bean plays the bad guy, a British villain and what about his cronies? They're Russian ¬ñ hilarious. It makes you beg for another Cold War so that these stupid ideas of the 'evil' British and Russians working against the innocent, fun, 'all for a good cause' Americans would go away. The same thing happened in Cage's 2007 film 'Next' in which the villains were German and French. Then there is Riley Poole (Bartha) who exists only to inspire dumb laughs at dumb times (which is practically every frame of the film) and to crack one-liners with Cage every now and again. How sad. And so, National Treasure soon falls into its rut of cause and effect scenes about something that affects Americans more than it does me; relying on the fact we must trust these caricatures and what they say is correct to carry us through. Watch out for my favourite part of the film: the gang have just escaped the museum and randomly, Cage grabs Kruger; shakes her vigorously and yells: ""Are you hungry!?"" ¬ñ Hilarious.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a wonderful movie - it has it all!,"I'd been waiting for ""National Treasure"" since I saw the first trailer months ago. I planned on going to see it on opening day. When I heard that the reviews were bad, I knew that I wanted to go more than ever. Nicholas Cage has never disappointed me, and I knew he wouldn't now. The first show at the day was filled to capacity. From the opening to the closing, everyone remained in their seats. It was a great concept and I knew I was in for a wild ride. This film had it all...adventure...history...comedy...emotion...everything.What it didn't have was a cheezy plot. I was in my seat throughout the film, not wanting to miss a single scene.

We Need New Critics,"Once again, the critics and I don't agree. I think they go into movies and don't go in to enjoy them, they go in to pick them apart.This is a FUN movie with lots of NEAT things and some actual facts and so on (including symbolism, bits about the Knights Templar, etc.). While there were some inaccuracies--this is supposed to be an adventure and it and the clues and the traps are a ripping good time!It's sort of like Shakespeare--he was writing to the common folk; while he might have had some sense of symbolism in mind, I don't think he intended people to pick apart his plays looking for layers and layers. Let's face it--it's hard to notice that when Julius Caeser was performed in the period fashion rather than costumes, as was the norm.Go prepared for fun, and you'll get it!

WOW!! Move over Indiana Jones. Best action/adventure yet!,"This was an incredible movie. One where it can eventually show on TV without having to bleep out half of the dialogue and cut out scenes. This was terrific screen writing. The plot always kept you wondering what was coming next.There was also a good blend of humor as well. At times I felt like I was watching a blend of Ocean's eleven, The Rock, and Indiana Jones. Nicholas Cage was on my list for a long time as one of the worst actors in Hollywood. But after ""The Rock"" and this one, I have to admit he's come a long way. Not the best but certainly a good performance again.This movie didn't depend on special effects but instead relied on a great story. The movie drew the audience in to feeling like you were figuring out this mystery. The movie always has you thinking about what they found and what it means to the continuation of the film. You find yourself, trying to figure out the clues as Nicholas Cage (Ben Gates) is trying to. The movie had an edge to it too because you always felt the presence of the competition with Sean Bean (Ian Howe-bad guy again!). So whatever the next part of the puzzle was, it had to be figured out quickly because Ian Howe was right on your tail. Kept you in suspense the whole time.This will be one of those ""don't miss"" movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great Movie!,"National Treasure is a really good movie. I have nothing but positive things to say about it. What's good is the acting, plot, screenplay, action, weaving in comedy, music, and family entertainment.

His associate just tried to kill him and another associate, Riley. Now, the associate, Ian wants to steal the Declaration of Independence to find the treasure. Ben ends up stealing it so it does not fall in the hands of Ian. Now he and Riley are joined up with a beautiful curator and Gate's father and they have the FBI and Ian coming after them.The acting is very good. Nicholas Cage has been a decent actor throughout his career. Jon Voight did a good job. I also was impressed with Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha.This movie is great for history buffs. The movie takes place in cities of history such as Philadelphia, NYC, and the nation's capital.I liked the music here. It is pleasant enough to listen to.

Is it true?,"There's a story, whether it's true or not, is open to interpretation. The story begins in 1820 when Samuel Chase, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, tried to see Andrew Jackson, the President of the United States at the time. That's the story----part of it anyway. There are people today who are hunting a treasure in the Virginia countryside. The person who transcribed the codes, had gone out west in 1820, and supposedly had stolen gold from Mexico and buried it in the Virginia countryside and left clues as to its whereabouts. The original transcriptionist died and left the code with a friend who did nothing with it from 1820 to 1885. However, there's been doubt cast on it. Then there's the legend of the Templar Treasure. According to this, the Knights Templar, was the richest order in Europe. The Templars, officially the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, were Europe's bankers. The Pope, who'd created the Knights Templar, was in debt to the Templars. So was Philip IV of France. According to the Legend of the Templars, the Templars had a fleet of ships that brought their treasure to the New World. The plot of National Treasure, like that of the soon-to-be released The Da Vinci Code, is riddled with symbolism. The Knights Templar are mentioned. According to National Treasure, the Knights Templar become the Freemasons. The Gates family is named after the Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Patrick Henry. Abigail Chase is named after Abigail Adams and Samuel Chase, and the villain, Ian Howe, is named after Sir William Howe, a British general during the Revolutionary War, and his brother, Sir Richard ""Black Dick"" Howe, an admiral in the Royal Navy. Is it true? Again, that's open to debate. The documents on which the story is based, are, as I said before, questionable at best.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A National Treasure indeed, in anyone's video library","This is an excellent movie. I'm a big fan of mystery movies and this one has had me waiting for what would happen in the next moment till the very end. The plot is, of course, most unrealistic, but IF one imagines that there could actually BE such a treasure, an undiscovered one, then it all becomes perfectly logical, and we can enjoy the romantic story within a hunt to protect a national treasure, a treasure beyond any man's dreams, from being stolen by a gang of ruthless prospectors. The cast is very good, Nicolas Cage is one of my favourite actors, but what I think I love the most about the movie, is the main theme. The music is absolutely perfect and I fell in love with it the first time I heard it.

Amazing,"I am a big big fan of Nicolas Cage i think he is an excellent actor and this film has proved this.The film star's some very good talents such as Nicolas Cage, Sean Bean, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel.

Until there is only two Gates family members left Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight)who believes that the treasure is load of nonsense, but Ben Gates still is determined to uncover the treasure that has been owed to there family for years. So years on Ben Gates is still looking for the treasure and to do so he must decode the clues that were left by the Four Founding Fathers of America, these clues lead you right to the treasure itself. And so the film opens with Ben Gates and his wright hand man Ian Howe (Sean Bean) and his trusty side kick and computer nurd friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha)searching in the Antartica for the first clue that was left to the Gates family. And after discovering the clue and decoding it which is and 18th century boat he believes read that there is a invisible map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, this which i will not spoil anymore leads to Ian Howe betraying Ben and Riley and sets of to get the Declaration of Independence himself and in-turn getting the treasure, so this Ben Gates, Riley Poole and also a historian called Abiail Chase (Diane Kruger) to set off uncovering the rest of the clues in America to uncover the most important treasure in the history of mankind.

Distracting and better than the sequel but still not much cop,"Adventurer and archaeologist Ben Gates is following his lifelong quest for a legendary treasure with his team and searching for a lost ship which contains the treasure. No treasure is found but they do locate a clue that suggests a map to the treasure's location is somehow hidden on the back on the Declaration of Independence. Ben gives it up there and then but his colleague, Ian Howe, decides to go after the Declaration himself ¬ñ even if it means stealing it. Left for dead with geek Riley, Ben decides to stop Howe, but with the authorities sceptical to say the least, the only way he can do it is get to the map and treasure before Howe can.After hating the sequel, it would be a fair question to ask as to why I bothered watching the first one. Well my reasoning was that I didn't believe that the first film could have been that bad if so many people went to see it. The first film clearly has a lot in common with the second film and in a way I disliked it in the same sort of way. Writing this now I realise one thing ¬ñ if I review this against the sequel I will either end up moaning about it due to the things it has in common or praising it because ""at least it is still better than the sequel"", so instead I will just try and review it without a connection to the bad experience I had.Watching it on its own terms it is hard to deny that the plot is a bit daft and I did struggle to get into it at times. Fortunately it minimises the daftness of the clues and, more importantly, the number of them that have to be followed and as a result it didn't tire me out that much. Of course what the silliness does mean is that the film cannot create a sense of tension, urgency or danger. This does keep it in kiddie territory although (sorry to do this) it is much less frequent that all the terrible ""wacky"" rubbish in the sequel. On the whole though, the film did just about enough to keep my interest and make me suspend my disbelief but not enough to really excite or engage me. It is hard to see it as anything other than a poor man's Indiana Jones.The cast are roundly so-so, a reflection of the material perhaps but here we are. Cage is all a bit too smug and knowing to draw the audience into the story and I do think that he is a part of the failing in this regard. Kruger is so-so and I suppose at least Bartha is quite fun in his character. Bean is a poor villain with a division one footballer's haircut. Voight, Keitel and Plummer are all pretty much slumming it in small roles and offer nothing other than their faces to the film.Even without comparing it to the sequel, National Treasure is only a so-so film. The lack of urgency and danger leaves the silliness of the film rather exposed. It does just about manage to minimise the wackiness and stupidity that the sequel suffered heavily from and it does distract but it is certainly no better than that.",,Anonymous,Mystery
To me this movie is a national treasure!,"I want to give this film a 10 for my pure love of Nic Cage but I know it's not perfect but to me it's pretty darn close! Many out there point out some minute details but to me unless you are a historian you won't notice and it's a movie meant to entertain and it does, especially if you love adventure and especially adventure with a treasure hunt! It's like the Indiana movies but with a more down to earth approach. It may still be out there in some minds but it's not as much fantasy, more of government conspiracy which I love, it's fantasy based on possible realities, and no one does that better than Nicolas Cage! I know he has made some bad choices in some of his films but when he's in the right role he's the best in my opinion. I only hope to see him do more roles like National Treasure and ""Knowing"" and ""Left Behind""(not my favorite ) but when he does real, like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Joe"" he is at his best!

I also loved the scenery of the cities (Washington, D.C., New York City, Philadelphia). There was humor, adventure and suspense. It was very well-done. I honestly had no idea how the story would end. I know how I wanted it to end, but wasn't sure how it was going to end because it wasn't obvious (which made it exciting)! I left the movie with a good feeling, which is so important to me. It was wonderful!!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Only for kids,"Well, I will keep this short. The disaster begins right in the first 5 minutes and then you know you have just thrown some bucks away for nothing. This movie is absolutely without any kind of authenticity even for an action movie. The story is as old as cinema and after the fith time N. Cage says ""it's another clue"" you just ask yourself ""when does the hurting stop"". The acting is awful the jokes are typically Walt Disney Style and may be funny for kids. There is some really bad product placement throughout the whole movie (even the cola bottles in 80's action movies were placed more subtle) and the list of ""must be in a Walt Disney movie"" gets checked of without any kind of mercy to the viewer. If you want a movie for the whole family and actually a no brainer then get with it. Everybody else should save their precious time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pure fun...,"National Treasure is both smart and action packed. Yes it may be used to teach kids History but it actually works. You feel almost as if you are participating in the puzzles with the characters. The Masons and Templar treasure was nice treasure choice. Ben Gates is pretty cool and Riley makes you laugh while you go on the roller coaster ride. Overall, it's very enjoyable though it has flaws such as sometimes being far fetched but I like some of that in an adventure. Oh, and the bad guy is pretty evil. National Treasure is a heist, adventure/action movie that should keep you guessing and involved with the story until the end. I love movies that can make you see something extraordinary out of something ordinary and that's what National Treasure does and does it well. Jon Turtletaub I give you kudos for making a movie though fast and kinetic felt very down to earth and easy to follow. 8/10! Great good fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a new kind of film,"National Treasure gives a new meaning to the phrase ""living history"", and it really is something thoroughly amazing for a work of historical fiction. It is entwined in a gripping mystery which uses as reference points, things you can find in your pocket, like a dollar bill, places you've probably been to like the national archives, the mall in D.C. etc, making for a truly interactive experience.Complaints about lack of character depth in National Treasure should be made keeping in mind the context in which Bruckenheimer (did i spell that right?) made the film. If you're Jerry Bruckheimer, you went from being a very hot commodity after making a $285 million-grossing film, Pirates of the Caribbean, to making King Arthur, a flop, and you want to preserve your reputation as a commercial success. Therefore, you're #1 goal is to get people into the theater and what's gonna get them there is the plot. The movie is all plot-centered and even though Nicholas Cage might have won an Oscar way back when the truth is that most of his movies ""gone in 60 seconds"", ""snake eyes"", ""8 mm"", etc, are not films you go to expecting character development.I don't think they were aiming for character depth: No one was going into this film thinking they'd snag an Oscar or golden globe nomination, Not that you shouldn't want to have a challenging part to want to act in, but I was pretty fine with the limit on character development because the plot was cool enough. The one thing I can say was, at the very least the characters were self-conscious, for example, the Abby Chase/Ben Gates hook up we could all see coming from miles away, but evidently so could the screenwriter so he gave Ian the line ""well, you got the girl at the end"" cause it's so blatantly obvious.Also, the plot is absurd in itself, stealing the declaration of independence? And it's actually quite a wonder in itself that the movie presented a historically accurate, seemingly plausible and thoroughly engaging plot out of the circumstances that in no way dumbs down to the audience. Making the plot work in itself, deserves credit.The film played to its strengths well.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good movie using an old movie standard with an original idea,"I really enjoyed this film. I can't remember the last time we even went to a PG movie.

I vaguely recall hearing one insignificant swear word. And there was just something refreshing about people not having to die ever other scene.Now I do love American History so that may have influenced my review a bit, but I genuinely want to go back and see this movie again. That's not something I could say about Spiderman 2 or Return of the King.All in all this movie was worth the ticket price.

Science Fiction,"American's summarized their tiny history with a big treasure story which their fathers (Europeans) stole from Egypt, Ottomans and Turks. However there is no such thing, they couldn't stole anything from them. The film is about a fake treasure which is under a fake church in America. We, non-Americans can't understand why Americans need to improve their history. They have no old history, because of that they don't have enough story to make films. They finished the stories so they compose false things and show them to us as it happened. I can't even thing what can they do if they had a big history like China has or Turks have or Old Greeks have.I thing USA must continue science-fiction films.

A Good Movie That Anyone Can Enjoy,"National Treasure(2004) Review: Disney makes a new movie. This can be more described like Indiana Jones Lite. This is a good movie.National Treasure has a interesting story. There is a mighty treasure that is considered to great for any man on earth. A group of knights make a pack and hide the treasure. It has been hidden for centuries. Now Ben Gates(Nic Cage) intends to find this treasure.This movie just delivers. This given a PG rating is a really fun movie. Anyone can enjoy this as there is no profanity, and no bad language here to worry about, so bring the kids. There is some fun action sequences here as well.Gates intends to steal the Declaration of Independence for there is a map on the back. How would that be done? The plan is intelligent and clever too. It's a blast to see how he can do the impossible.This movie is also given an attractive cast. The acting is in fine form. From known regulars as Jon Voight to Harvey Keitel, to new faces as Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha, we got a good movie.The Last Word: Good clean fun. National Treasure is a really fun ride. Enjoyable for the adults and clean for the kids too. Movies like this are fine. A movie that is good for all ages and is not animated. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thrilling Adventure,"I'm not a big fan of history, but this movie caught my eye. As I watched it, I thought, ""Wow, this is the best movie I've ever seen.""

It's sort of like an Indiana Jones movie; it's full of action, suspense, and excitement, and it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, eager to see what will happen next. Also, Nicolas Cage did an absolutely fantastic job being Ben Gates. He did so well, that I'm looking forward to seeing some other movies that he starred in. This movie was definitely a thrilling adventure for me, and I ended up making it my favorite movie ever. But I would not recommend it for young children (8 years or under) to watch, because some action violence occurs in a few scenes.

I now know the meaning to life...,"I always felt empty in my life like something was missing. I never knew it would be the warm embrace of our lord and saviour Nicolas Cage. In this Masterpiece he plays Ben Gates, An archaeologist/historian/badass. Throughout the film his glory carries the admittedly poor performances of all the other actors but how can someone be considered to be a good actor when in the same film as Nicolas Cage. After watching this classic I was reborn as a child of our one true god, our one true saviour, our one true overseer, our one true love, our one true hero, Nicolas Cage. I must say that is film deserves more than the excellent rating that I gave to it. Before watching this film one must prepare a live pig as a sacrifice or Nicolas Cage will come into your house at night and whisper the six most dreaded words imaginable ""National Treasure Three Has Been Cancelled"". This film will change your religion. This film will change your life. You must watch this film if you consider yourself a person with any sort of standards in great cinematic epics. This film was too good for lots of people who fail to see the glory of Nicolas Cage so they rate it low and create hundreds of multiple accounts so they can keep on giving it low ratings. IMDb needs to ban these people as not only are they pro HAX0RS but they are denying the lord of the rating that he deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very enjoyable surprise,"I was very surprised I enjoyed it. I was also surprised that lines and theaters were more packed for this compared to The Incredibles, and Sponge Bob. It was good that they kept this at PG. This is better to get young kids and adults. This movie had a Goonie-esque feel and mixed action, drama, and humorous scenes. Nicolas Cage and Bruckheimer definitely know how to score with the films they work on together. For Bruckheimer, this will make up for the King Arthur flop. This is a definite must see for anyone. I've seen some two star reviews and that shocks me when I see critics give bad movies three stars. This is one of those movies where you can't listen to the critics opinion.

The plot was great - everything seemed believable! Except for the fact that you only see a person eating once, when Riley eats some pizza. Riley was definitely my favorite character, and Nicholas Cage was amazing. Not having seen many great movies this year, I'm glad something great finally came along.

This was an AWESOME FILM!!!,"I just went to see this film tonight, and it was fantastic. A great action-adventure film with an intelligently written script and excellent plot twists. This is a great film on so many levels, but I think one of the great things about it is the fact that it is a nice, PG rated adventure film that the whole family can get into. Too often today we see films that adults would want to see but are not appropriate for kids, or we see films for kids that adults are bored stiff watching. This film is a rare kind nowadays because it is a great film for both adults and children to be entertained with. I also love the way they integrated elements of American history into the films plot, which is a great way to get movie watchers into history. As a historian myself, I very much enjoyed that element of the film, and the fact that Nicholas Cage's character reacted in the same way I might have in his place in many situations in the film. Now, is some of the stuff a little far fetched, like treasure maps on the back of the Declaration of Independence? Sure. But this only puts National Treasure in the tradition of other great action-adventure yarns like Indiana Jones. So, go see this film with the whole family, and have a great time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not perfect, but still an excellent adventure.","I agree that this film is not as good as ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"", but will ANY film ever dethrone the king of adventure movies? I don't think so. As such, this film is a slight grade lower than the all-time champion. However, it doesn't mean this film is bad. Far from it.I thought the story was original and quite good. Is it a ridiculous idea for a HUGE treasure to be hidden by some of America's greatest historical figures? You bet. But, that's the concept of treasure-hunting films. The prizes are supposed to be massive, unbelievable amounts of wealth. That's the point of being a ""treasure"".What makes this film so much fun, is how they've taken commonly seen US historical items and places, and turned them into pieces to the big puzzle. They don't change history, just tweak it a little to fit their film. It worked for many films in the past (""Titanic"", and ""Pearl Harbor""), and it works here.I highly recommend this film, especially to those who like American history. It's a fun movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In appreciation of well written.....well done,"Others may not know ""thought out script writing"" when seen other critiques show this page, I have seen poorly written/directed, but this one gives a catalyst from the Cage lead character's youth, to why he's bothering to find an uncertain priceless treasure, Voight's father character long since dismissed as myth.I highly commend the adventurous momentum and close attention to detail required of 18th century thinking clue solving, to keep pace with the ""who gets there first"" accent on finding a ""world treasure"" from ancient times collected the characters were involved, to the point of gambling ""borrowing"" the particular document needed from national archives to solve the enigma of message required for the find.For the others who don't see this, that's alright. ""Sneak Previews"" show rarely sees the same or misses the whole point of a story too. Realistic? If anyone's ever pursued such attempt, like lottery winning, likely prefer a cover story to deter attention, think about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
If only they tried a bit harder,"The frustrating thing about watching a film like ""National Treasure"" is knowing that had writers Jim Kouf, Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley, and director Jon Turteltaub tried just a bit harder, they might very well have made a fun, exciting adventure yarn.Occasionally, they manage to squeeze out a moment that hints of fun, when they might have got the tone right. But such bits of pleasure are so sporadic. And they seemingly paid no attention to their story.True, ""National Treasure"" is a popcorn film, a movie where you leave logic behind and expect to get caught up in the excitement, no matter how outlandish the story is. But even mindless entertainment still needs some magic and heart. This one is worse than watered-down Indiana Jones stuff.Kouf and the Wibberleys make everything too easy. This is one of those films where the heroes uncover little clues as they go along. But the clues placed apparently by our Founding Fathers are so incredibly cryptic, they never could have expected anyone to solve them. Yet here's Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) reading a preposterously enigmatic riddle and within seconds figuring out the answer is the Declaration of Independence! Don't even ask how easily he finds a crucial secret in the vast, barren expanse of the Arctic. And for us to buy even a smidgen of this story, we have to believe that some of our more important buildings - the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and Independence Hall in Philadelphia - have some of the most lax security in the world.The problem with ""National Treasure"" is its script. Which, I suppose, shouldn't surprise anyone. Kouf's more recent screenplays include ""Snow Dogs"" (2002) and ""Taxi"" (2004), while the Wibberleys' contributions to the world of cinema include ""The 6th Day"" (2000), ""I Spy"" (2002) and ""Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle"" (2003).""National Treasure"" is uninspired, lazy storytelling. The action scenes provide little excitement and are too infrequent. As good an actor as Cage is, he might be getting just a bit too old for these parts and really gets nothing to work with. No clever one-liners, no witty comebacks. Diane Kruger as National Archivist Abigail Chase has a better role here than she did earlier this year in ""Troy."" Then again, that isn't saying much. At least, she doesn't have ridiculous dialogue like, ""Last night was a mistake,"" this time around.Justin Bartha gets to play the comic relief as Ben's sidekick, Riley Poole, but the jokes aren't all that good. Harvey Keitel's stuck in a winless role as an FBI agent, while Sean Bean gets to play the bad guy - again. However, unlike in the Indiana Jones films, the bad guy here isn't really all that villainous. He wants the treasure, but there isn't an evil or nasty streak in him. He's just a greedy rich guy.And, of course, the big question no one in the film bothers to answer is why is this treasure so important that it had to be hidden away for so long? Its discovery certainly wouldn't change the course of the world in any way. And this lethargic story doesn't change adventure movies for the better, either.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Popcorn, Medium Drink, and a Couple Hours","Jon Turtletaub's ""National Treasure"" is such a rarity in movies, in that you don't have to think about it, enjoy the ride, and make sure you have enough popcorn and soda. Though get the medium drink. After all the movie is 2 hours and change. The 'think' comment is not an intended slam, but rather a recommendation. The screenplay by the team of Jim Kouf, Cormac Wibberley, and Marianne Wibberley has a very novel concept which is entirely envisioned as an action adventure. Turtletaub, as Director, executes the action and adventure with great skill, pacing, and a sheer sense of fun. The movie also looks great.Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, who as a kid was enrolled by his Grandfather's (Christopher Plummer) stories of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. According to the legend, the treasure map leads to a vast fortune hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. As the movie opens we find grown up Ben, now a treasure hunter/ historian of some sort, along with his sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha), and slippery business partner, Ian Howe, at the North Pole in pursuit of the legendary treasure. Predictably Ben and Ian become adversaries in search of the fortune. The FBI are thrown somewhere into the mix.Ben becomes convinced that the only way to protect the treasure from falling into the wrong hands (that being Ian's), both he and Riley must steal the Declaration of Independence first. Enter Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), curator of the National Archives. She thinks that Ben and Riley are conspiracy crazed crack-heads. Well, not really, but she thinks they are nuts. However, due to a slew of events Abigail finds herself aligned with the boys. Along the way, we find out enough about the history surrounding the Declaration of Independence to stake out the category on ""Jeopardy"". The rest of ""National Treasure"" is a wild ride, and to it's credit, most of it is clever.The cast is excellent. Nicolas Cage wonderfully plays the geek hero. He is perfect as the normal guy caught in a ridiculous situation. His Ben is not the coolest, but he is strong, smart, intense, and has a sense of humor. Justin Bartha offers expert comic relief as Riley. Diane Kruger is gorgeous, sharp, and funny as Abigail. She fairs much better here, than she did in ""Troy"". Sean Bean infuses an understated menace and danger as Ian. Credit the cast and Turtletaub for never taking themselves or the movie too seriously, and for providing a very good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
waste of talent but not of money,"It is one of these blockbusters made to be efficient and earn money. Cage has his typical blockbusters-noemotionnormoving-face and acting. Sean Bean is in it (I should hae be warned, I do not know any good movie with Bean in it), as well as Jon Voight,who is not really acting but only appearing from ""MI 1"" (as he had reluctantly shot movies that did not deserved his talent). On the other side,Christopher Plummer and Harvey Keitel (as good as usual) do waste their talents while playing supporting roles. Diane Kruger is delightful, and the young hero's best friend is doing his best (which is not so bad). The story is funny, but above all, the way it is screen-played is pathetic: Dear studios, please fire your popcorn-writers and hire real ones! The result is a pale copy of ""Indiana Jones"" movies. What makes the movie watchable when you want to empty your mind, is the slight humor in it (and Diane Kruger's beautiful...eyes and...smile).However, the underlying references are interesting, enlightening the free masons' role in the building of the free US and their values (together with the pilgrim fathers and protestants), from the declaration of independence to the mason symbol on USD bills.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Best Family Film,"My husband and I took our kids and nephews (ranging in age from 13 to 6) to see this in the theater because we had been studying National monuments.

I was drawn into the story and found myself enjoying it as much as my kids. The action was intense but not terrifying. The romance was understated but sweet. The acting was believable. The values displayed by the heroes were honorable. They were able to see a movie where the 'cool' hero uses his brain to solve problems. And even more exciting to me was that it peeked the curiosity of the kids. They wanted to know more about the history they had seen in the movie and now play 'National Treasure'.In short, this movie was worth all of the treasure holes dug in my yard and scraps of homemade treasure maps littering the dining room table.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Light geeky fun well worth your money,"In these post-X-Files days in which we live, where the government is run largely by greedy idiots, it can be a sore temptation to imbue our founding fathers with even greater intelligence and insight than they had (or as Bono once said, 'You glorify the past/ when the future dries up'). Now, granted, we had an uncommonly selfless and outstanding group of men working together to start America, but I don't know that they were all shifty Freemasons who hid the greatest treasure ever assembled in the history of mankind and then left painstakingly obscure clues as to where they had done so.But that's entirely the premise of National Treasure, the new Bruckheimer opus that opened this weekend. Treasure centers around one Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nick Cage) as he tries to track down said treasure, a family obsession dating back to the early nineteenth century. Abetting him on this madman's quest is requisite computer geek Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and equally requisite skeptical eye candy Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger, who started the Greatest War Story Ever Told in this summer's Troy). Of course we know that Gates must be on to something, not only because no one believes him (not even his dad Patrick, played by Jon Voight) except the villain Ian Howe (Sean Bean), but because, well, you wouldn't have much of a story without the treasure now, would you?Treasure is not only an above-average sleuth/treasure hunt movie, it's also a history lesson. You get to learn all sorts of historical facts (like Ben Franklin arguing for the inception of daylight savings time) along with the light action, which for me, anyway, doubled the fun. Someone obviously loved their history; the tidbits are scattered throughout, often interspersed with plot points, and look at the names of the principles: the evil Englishman is named Howe, Ben's dad is named after Patrick Henry, etc. It's kind of a history geek thing, but I thought it was fun.What I most liked about the movie, though, was that the heroes are all smart. Cage's Gates is a historical encyclopedia, but he's also sharp-witted (if a bit absent minded). It's nice to see a geek hero, and Cage fits the role very well (Poole and Chase are much the same, her sleek good looks notwithstanding). Cage gives his hero a passion for both history and the hunt, and his earnestness helps give the movie an added bit of believability and seriousness that playing it tongue-in-cheek would have ruined. Bartha treads the same line with Poole, though he gets most of the best comedy lines. Kruger, who will probably never be mistaken for a great actress, is fine here, even if her Abigail does shuck a lifetime's worth of law abidance to the wind in just under an hour to aid the man who steals the Declaration of Independence. But once Abby's on his side, she, like the boys, uses her considerable wits to help figure it all out.The plot and the clues are a little needlessly complex, but they are woven into the dialogue with some skill. We never feel like we're getting a history lesson (or at least I didn't, but then I'm partial to history as a subject), but we're given all the information we need to solve the riddle along with Gates. Yeah, some of the plot twists are a tad outlandish; Ben Franklin made a special pair of eyeglasses that still work two hundred years later after being sealed inside a hollow brick on an external wall? And so on. But Treasure isn't trying to be a serious brain flick, it's trying to be a slightly updated version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. And for my money, it succeeds.National Treasure is a great deal of fun. Cage, who's been doing deeper films of late, has never been more fun or likable than he is here, and he was perfect for the role. It's not the most solid film of its ilk this year ¬ñ that would have to be Bourne Supremacy-but Treasure can hold its own and entertain you while doing it. Well worth the price of admission to watch Cage and Co. traipse around the east coast acting one part Mission Impossible and two parts History's Detectives.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Generic, Bland, Low-Thrill Adventure Fodder","Entry-level suspense/action that's careful to paint exclusively by the numbers. Which is to say it's thoroughly safe and predictable from the very beginning, fair play for a Disney-branded family flick. It does let itself get washed away in a late flood of post-9/11 patriotism, but the constant flag-waving and revolution-era set pieces - absurd though they may be - at least give the picture something of a unique identity. It's not the next Tomb Raider though, try as it might, and the actual riddle-cracking/crypt plundering often comes so easily that it all feels redundant and boring. Nic Cage's lead performance varies from intensely awkward to, actually, pretty cool, but he can't completely fight away the urge to overact his heart out in a few late scenes.

It is sought after by two groups of people, each headed by a man with a deeply embedded passion to gain the treasure (two men and each has his own reason). The clues have been in plain view for centuries, but unless they are sought in order, they are easily passed over.The clues are not arrows on a map, but historical items such as the Declaration of Independence, a carefully carved pipe, and a poem. The honored and respected founding fathers of America wrote the Declaration of Independence, worshiped God, and gave of their valuable time and lives to separate our country from the persecution of their country/s origin. I give this movie a thumbs up. It is well thought out, fun, beautifully photographed, historically informative, with great actors.Jon Turtletaub (1964), Director, made this a fast paced film with several locations. He introduces the locations to be filmed with aerial views, some being famous national monuments, like the Washington Monument, the White House, and the Artic tundra. He shot the exterior of the Independence Hall on location in Pennsylvania, and then took his cameras to Buena Park, California to use the replica at Knott's Berry Farm. Turtletaub did some of the actual filming.The movie suggests that there are clues on the back of the original copy of the Declaration of Independence that will lead to a treasure. It is a myth. Yet, the movie makes it so believable, that I was wondering if something couldn't really have been hidden. I'm sure there are some of us who would like to believe that a real treasure, such as the one they are suggesting, really exists.Protagonist Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage), is a very smart, soft spoken, gentleman, who looks athletic and fit. When he makes up his mind to steal the document, you can see that he is decisive and determined. He is handsome and likes Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). We can tell, because when he tells Chase he is going to steal the document, he isn't offended when she automatically laughs and tries to hide it when she realizes he is serious.Antagonist Ian Howe (Sean Bean) is a millionaire who seeks the treasure to add to his collection. He is ruthless in his goal to obtain what he wants. It didn't take much --- Ben thought it was a bad, unethical move to steal the Declaration of Independence to get the clue off the back --- and Ian had one of his hired thugs {Powell (Stewart Finlay-Mc Lennan), Shippen (Oleg Taktarov), and Phil (Stephen A. Pope)}, try to shoot him. His tactics on how to get through to the document after hours, was to shoot their way in and use an electric gun to stun him, which was better than killing him.A fun movie, clean language, light romance and humor, and good family values. There is nothing boring about it either. It reinforces the bonding between fathers and sons for generations. It also says that families can disagree and still get along. Patrick Gates (Jon Voight( helped his son even though he didn't have any faith in there being a treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Excellent Movie for the Entire Family,It was so refreshing to see a movie full of action yet missing all of the filth that most producers think is necessary. There was no cussing and no sex and the movie was incredible! The movie keeps your interest through excitement and suspense. I'm taking my children and my parents to see this when it is released to the public. I want to thank Director Jon Turteltaub and the writers Jim Kouf and Cormac Wibberley for believing in the family again. Thanks to Walt Disney Pictures for releasing a movie that a family can attend together. It's nice to be able to see a movie that introduces history to our children with enthusiasm and passion that isn't portrayed through nudity. Thanks to all for a great movie! This is one to see at the theater and to purchase.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Step aside Indiana Jones,"Nick Cage has hit a home run in this one. He has created a character that is interesting, a bit puzzling, and a joy to watch. The cast that surrounds him is also impeccably in place...from Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger to Sean Bean and Jon Voight, they are all perfect in their respective roles.Though the plot line centers around the mysterious nature of the Free Masons and our founding fathers relationships within that organization, this is definitely a movie for serious history buffs...but don't fret if your recollection of Paul Revere and Sam Adams is sketchy, it doesn't go over the heads of the lay-person in the audience (the film uses Riley's character to explain and set up some of the history lessons that it uses to move the plot line along).The action is non-stop, so I seriously recommend going to the bathroom and getting your popcorn before the movie starts because once you see the opening scene set in the Arctic, it's a roller-coaster ride from there to the end credits. And a fun ride it is at that!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Maltese Eagle,"All this 'Templar Knights' stuff is becoming a little 'long-in-the-tooth'. No disrespect to the historical truth of the Knights of the Templar, nor Masons, nor anyone, but good heavens, enough already! I think that the only movie formula left undone, would be a Mel Brooks comedy on this subject.On the good side, I'll tell you that the cast is great with fun performances by Cage, Kruger, Bartha and Bean, and then 'stacked' with nice work by Christopher Plummer, John Voight and Harvey Keitel, to boot.All in all, it's a fun movie; a big long solve run chase twist and solve, some tense moments, with hardly any violence, nor ear curling language, nor eye popping 'romance', hence, a good family movie that everyone can enjoy.If I had to say anything negative, well, if you want more violence, language and 'romance', this can get a little long and boring and tedious with a seemingly endless 'sequence' of clues.But one way or the other, it's still worth seeing.I guess that all these Templar Knight mysteries are, well, ""the, uh, stuff that dreams are made of"".",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is like Indiana Jones in that it's a movie about treasure- seeking, but it is very clean and kid-friendly. There is not a single curse word or ""questionable"" scene in the entire thing. However, several of my friends have told me that they don't like the movie because the plot confuses them. This is not true. Yes, you have to follow the movie (i.e. you can't get up and come back 20 minutes later and expect to know what's going on), but you don't have to actually concentrate on the concept of the movie.

The movie is extremely fast paced and though it may seem to be built along ""The Da Vinci Code"" lines the plot and the general myth and history is American and being so, completely independent. Sean Bean makes an excellent villain. The movies got it all: Chase scenes, thriller scenes, scenes of brilliance in which the bulb comes on in one of the characters' heads and last but not least brilliantly funny quips from the techie/sidekick/whiner character played by Justin Bartha.

i can't believe i paid for this,"NATIONAL TREASURE is anything but, believe me. i came into this movie with poor expectations but a heart full of hope. i'd been in the mood to watch a good explorers/adventurers flick and finding the recent movie well a bit dry i caved in to the first one that came around. i should tell any one who considers to watch this movie that nicholas cage (who i believe to be the most useless and overrated actor of our day) fails to inspire, yet again, marvelously. apparently he was paid to be be a model for hair plugs and bad highlights because i didn't see much acting in this movie at all. some of the worst ""acting"" scenes are shared with fellow Oscar winner jon voight. someone should notify the academy and have their awards taken from them.this movie hosts such an abundant array of misguided and utterly terrible choices that it is difficult to place the blame of failure on any one aspect. is it the terrible script and story? the sub-par acting? the shoddy and clich√© directing? the poor choreographed and conceived over-long action sequences? maybe it's the combination of it all.benjamin franklin gates, our movie's protagonist, is probably the most pedantic and boring jeopardy contestant wannabe that the silver screen has ever seen. not to mention that nicholas cage brings absolutely no life or depth to this singularly annoying and insufferable know-it-all. the makers of the movie were trying to sell us on the idea that ben is a morally constant genius with a love of history and adventure. thing is, he's really a humorless sap who is entirely socially inept. this part could have been better managed by a better, younger, and good looking actor, but i doubt it would have made up for the rest of the film.the ""national treasure"" of this movie isn't so much a treasure as it is pirate's booty from centuries of yore. it's not to have one amazing treasure with singular mythological and inherent value, it has to be bigger, better. according to the logic of the film, America's forefathers--in all their freemasonry glory--stored invaluable treasures that were plundered by the romans from the egyptians and kept hidden by a secret society of knights in order to keep it out of British hands. but wait, they left a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence which takes half of the movie to steal. the rest of the movie revolves around ben's cleverness and social ineptitude getting the hottest archivist to fall in love with him and keeping his hip, young computer genius sidekick at bay. there's also something about a generational conflict with his dad. oh, and there are bad guys trying to steal the treasure for their own profit. i mean ben doesn't want the money, he wants to lay claim to helping solve a great mystery of American history. right.wait for the last minute twist. so last minute and so clich√© that you might just hate harvey keitel for the rest of your life for making this movie.this movie is what's wrong with Hollywood today. that this movie is top box office material is what's wrong with movie audiences today. it panders to the worst part of the American pop consciousness and, despite its attempts to be clever and intelligent, aides in the dumbing down of every one who watches it--including myself. NATIONAL TREASURE succeeds at being the fluffiest, worst, and most embarrassing movie of my generation. i'm sorry to see that so many people liked it. but then again, i'm not surprised.* out of 4*",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Endless adventure indeed!,"I realised that this movie was released two years back. The freaky thing is that, Dan Brown's Angels & Demons came out on in 2001. I have to admit only after reading that book recently, I then only know about the Illuminanti and the Masons. Those two groups were mentioned in that book.So imagine I was gasping away when those various references to the Masons showed up as I saw this movie on the cable. I am do aware of the Mason's probable role which led to the independence of the USA, because that mention first came out on Angels & Demons. I knew it was somewhere in there. The Knights Templar mention in this movie also almost got me gasping because to admit again, I am only aware of that after reading - The Da Vinci Code. Yes.So, this movie first started in the year of 1974 and a young Benjamin Franklin Gates accidentally found something which led to his grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer) to tell him not to look at those documents. John Gates then tell the story of their ancestors' role in the founding of the independent America. But the thing is, John's grandfather's life was counted and so he only left behind a code. Clearly when Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) saw that his father is telling that to his son, he was not pleased. But that does not stop the young Ben from really finding out what was the treasure is.Fast forward to the present day. The now adult Benjamin (Nicolas Cage) is travelling with his friends to the Arctic in hoping of searching the clue which his grandfather had told him when he was young. And when they did, Benjamin realised one of his friends Ian is also wanting to steal one of the most important documents in the history of America - The Declaration of Independence. It's what Benjamin, who is part of the famous Gates family, who wanted it first.But there is a catch. The Declaration Of Independence is highly guarded. So this led to endless chases from the police and even the friend who turned against Benjamin - Ian. With the help of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Benjamin and everyone else included (even the father Patrick eventually) started to search from one clue to another, bringing them to various places throughout the country.The endless adventure and non-stop fun and history (I am a little history buff at times) were what left me enthralled and speechless. Almost something like out of The Da Vinci Code (that book came out in 2003) but not really the case, it almost left me breathless. Maybe given I did read Angels & Demons and it's where I only began to know about the real existence of the Masons, whatever this movie might had mentioned, it always brought me back to the time when I read that book.Adventure is the key to this movie and if anyone likes it, it's a good recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Aside from the bad guys, the characters feel quite natural - each with his/her idiosyncrasies, but not so much stereotyped that the character didn't seem real. The dialogue is a bit hammy every now and then, but not bad; the hamminess is tolerable given how clever the dialogue is otherwise.
